{"text":"My wife and I have been eating at this Zupa's (Happy Valley) for almost a year.  When we first started eating there it was absolutely excellent.  Our last few visits, today and last week were not good at all.  First off the salad bowl used to be filled almost to the top with greens, last two visits there were a good 1 1/2\" from the top (really?) of course the condiments are alwyas put on with a tiny baby spoon, usually not even half full of content, but I get that and am ok with that, but what also doesn't seem right is that if you get a \"large\" size salad, you still get the small size condiments?  Additionally, the honey mustard dressing must have been diluted because it has absolutely no taste and of course was minimally applied.  Another major concern is that while eating the salad, it seemd very gritty, almost like there was sand or dirt on the leaves?  Bad taste as well.  I used to get the lobster bisque but quite ordering that because it seemd that they putting more filler stuff \"celery\" etc. in it and less pieces of lobster.  The Tomato Basil is still very good so that's my go to for soup, assuming we ever go back.
As for customer service?  Spotty at best.  Today the server behind the counter at the soup ask if I wanted any soup, I said yes, a small Tamato Basil.  I got up to the register (very crowded) and there was no soup?  The server of the soup had this blank stare on her face like \"did you want soup\"?  Then the cash registers were not working properly and we stood at the counter with our soup getting colder by the minute and 4 to 5 minutes later we finally got to sit and eat.  Only other comment (not a good one) is that the water out of one of the soft drink dispenser tasted very bad?  Not sure why but certainly something to be concerned about.  Well, that's it folks!  We live in Anthem and don't have a lot of great resturants in the ares so we are very sad that this place is seemingly going to hell in a hand basket!!"}
{"text":"Love this place!! Everything tastes amazing and fresh. I would recommend the mangoberry salad it's yummy"}
{"text":"Always happy with the service that is offered here, not to mention the food is awesome and the servings are insane! I don't think I've ever left this establishment dissatisfied both in quality of service and the quality of their food!

Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"I've been eating here occasionally for years because it's in my neighborhood, and while I like the healthier options and variety, there are some things that consistently bother me enough to write this review. First, the first employee I place my order with should enter it in a system for everyone else on the line. Don't make me repeat my order three times to three different people along the line. This makes the line slow, adds room for error, and annoys the customers, especially when they're ordering for multiple people. Second, stir the soup up better before serving because it's often not hot enough and/or you don't get a decent amount of the ingredients sitting at the bottom of the pot. The tomato soup is way too sweet by the way. Third, more often than not I find the portions chintzy for the price."}
{"text":"The set up is super awkward first and foremost.  It's almost like a walk a shame to get your food.  I ordered the strawberry harvest salad and clam chowder.  I did not like the chicken on the salad it was pressed chicken, gag.  I didn't mind the soup, it wasn't chowder by any means, it was warm, not hot either.  There was a lot of potatoes and clams, it tasted good.  I would go back for the salad with no chicken."}
{"text":"I usually go to the Zupa's in Henderson and always enjoy my experience. The food was good but not the service. I was asked at least twice if someone else's order was mine. They did not have the chocolate covered strawberry and were offering a chocolate covered oreo. I asked the one girl if I could have bread instead and she agreed. The cashier said you do not get bread with a sandwich and tossed my bread back into the basket and I tried to explain and she said there was a charge for bread. I passed. I think in the future I will just go to the one in Henderson."}
{"text":"Wow I have been missing out i was so impressed with this place. I went for the first time and ordered their Turkey Bacon Avacodo sandwich and their Strawberry Harvest Salad and it was definitely worth 5 stars. I can't wait to go back and try more things :-)"}
{"text":"Nice sandwich place to go, I like the drink selections. It's nice to have a place that the food is not expensive and yet doesn't like it's out of a can. A bit less salty would be nice."}
{"text":"Great soup...great salads and sandwiches. Very friendly staff. Disappointed they are not open on Sundays. Wish they had a location closer to Chandler Mall. Nice touch to have a chocolate dipped strawberry given to you for free with your meal. Wish they would consider white chocolate dipped strawberries as well! :+}"}
{"text":"The price point is well set for how much food you get. I love this place way more than panera. My favorite item on their menu is the roasted red pepper lobster soup and mixed berry creme brûlée."}
{"text":"Today in Las Vegas it has been nasty and rainy. My friend and I wanted to grab some lunch and had heard about Zupas having really great soup. We decided to give it a try.  When we arrived at around 1pm the place was packed. That is usually a good sign that the place is good. I couldn't believe the prices. They are very affordable. 7.99 for a sand and soup combo. I ordered the Thai chicken sand and the Wisconsin cauliflower soup. Both were amazing. I also ordered a creme brûlée for 2.99. Also very delicious. I was amazed with the service and the speed of the employees. And not one seemed to be irritated that they were working. Overall I left happy, full, and eager to try them again."}
{"text":"Cafe Zupas has delicious food and warm company. Every time I walk in, there is always someone there at the line to greet me with a big smile. Ordering is easy, everything is on a line and made as you walk down it. My favorite sandwiches are the pesto chicken, the cuban grilled pork, and the honey bacon club. All three are absolutely fantastic, but the other sandwiches I have tried there are all wonderful. I love the chipotle chicken salad and the chicken enchilada chili as well. The place can get really packed very quickly, but it normally moves pretty quickly. For having food healthier than that of other fast foods restaurants, I'm happy to go here when I need a lunch. I've recommended this spot to many of my coworkers, and everyone has loved it!"}
{"text":"Had the Try 2 Combo. Mango berry salad and turkey with cranberry sandwich. The food is fresh and delicious! Great place to eat during Arizona summer. Wish I would have eaten here sooner"}
{"text":"So good. Fresh ingredients always yummy! Love the strawberry covered in chocolate! We will be coming back!"}
{"text":"I can honestly say Yay! I'm a fan.  The food is various and tasty.  The portions are correct, and priced accordingly.  I do find the 59 Cents for the soup mix-ins is a little pricy, but the soup doesn't need anything.  I think I may be cheating on my husband with the Thai Lobster Curry soup.

If I could change anything, it would be for the staff to just chill out.  When I go, I have someone open the door for me, ask me if I need a menu, then the salad person is all chipper, etc.  Really.  Please chill.  You're freaking me out, man."}
{"text":"I went out to Zupas for the first time today. I was not impressed with the service, food, or pricing. Firstly, my salad had to be remade as they did not make it as requested. When they made the soup they were confused on the half sized bowl and had to be told that the half size comes with their half and half special. Thirdly when asked to sample the soup, they gave a cup of nothing but broth and replied they are not allowed to give anything else. Fourthly the toppings on the salads are minimal. And lastly, they had to be reminded about the strawberry and bread that comes with the meal.

The food was ok, not horrible but not great either. We expected the soup to be much thinner than it was as we were only able to sample the broth so it was much heavier than expected, but it was decent.

Overall, would not recommend coming here."}
{"text":"I enjoy the sandwich/salad combo at Zupas because I feel it's the best value.  They have a good variety of both and the lettuce isn't full of iceberg or romaine cores.  It's not necessarily healthy eating, but it beats a greasy alternative any day (except Sunday of course).

Honestly, this location seems to do a good job most of the time, and I wouldn't fault them for the occasional mistake once in awhile as they always seem happy to fix the issue as soon as possible.

Here's why 3 not 4 stars:  I have to give my order anywhere from 3 to 6 times as I travel down the Zupas gauntlet!  If it's not busy, I can get down to the register pretty quickly (yea, I life hacked the Zupas line), but if it's busy you can forget about anything less than 5 separate people asking for your order.  I even tried to streamline the process by just telling them I have the \"Try 2 Combo\" but they Must have my exact order!

Here's the greatest part of the whole thing:  there are small Micros type ticket screens at every station, and as of yet, I have never seen one on in any Zupas in the Valley!

It's not the cooks on the line making this policy.  They have to do this 8+ hours a day!  And they're usually nice about it to boot

But the food is 4 star most of the time, so I'll keep going back; also the bus boy at Paradise looks at me like I killed his father, so I'm trying to avoid escalating whatever that's about.

My challenge to the Zupas employees:  Rise up!  Seize the day and try booting up one of those screens and see what it can do!  With great risk, comes great reward!  ;-)

Edit:  Someone turned the screen on!  Here's to you; 4 stars!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  We have been many times and have left with a happy belly every time.  They have a great menu, with so many healthy choices.  The soups are delicious, and the soft fresh bread they serve with it is the icing on the cake."}
{"text":"So my teenage daughter and I both have horrible colds at the moment and hot soup sounded great for a late lunch.  Cafe Zupas was her idea and I thought it sounded great.

Note that I went to the Cafe Zupas at 3877 S Gilbert Road, Gilbert, AZ 85297 at 3:45pm on February 15, 2017.  (FC#1236)

I ordered a crab sandwich combo with Tomato Basil soup and Orzo pasta.  I also ordered the Chicken Enchilada Chili soup for my daughter.  Note that at the soup counter the Tomato Basil soup comes with FREE Orzo pasta and the Chicken Enchilada Chili soup comes with FREE tortilla strips per the sign on the counter - no mention of portion size or quantity.  I also ordered a side of cheese for both soups which I knew was an additional charge - not a big deal.  I also ordered a slice of Creme Brûlée Cheesecake.

The manager appeared to be ringing me up.  I simply asked for \"a little more Orzo pasta\" with my soup after noticing the side cup didn't have much in it.  Note again that the soup counter sign says FREE Orzo pasta with the Tomato Basil soup.  The manager proceeded to have this sh!tty grin on his face and says \"sir, the soup only comes with a small spoon size portion of Orzo pasta.  Any additional will be an additional charge. Okay?\"  I passed on the extra Orzo pasta but hell no that's not okay Mr. Manager.

Cafe Zupas can take their $22.37 portion of a sandwich, half soup, full soup and cheesecake and shove it.

Never again Cafe Zupas!  Oh, and by the way, both soups were delicious but the hot crab sandwich flavor was average at best.

Quit trying to be cheap and take care of your customers.

Never again Cafe Zupas!"}
{"text":"This was our second time here and we are sold. We have completely changed our loyalty from Paradise Bakery to Cafe Zupas. First of all, their employees are so nice. They helped us to our table, got high chairs for us and were all around super friendly. Second, the food is very good! Get the tomato soup even if it's 115 outside. It's delicious. And don't forgot to get a chocolate covered strawberry!"}
{"text":"This hip and retro restaurant hits the spot every time!? The food here is DANK! It sends my taste buds on a euphoric journey as soon as a trace of it grazes my tongue. I get the pesto chicken and a Wisconsin Cauliflower add cheddar cheese and sour cream now before I continue I would like to have a moment of silence for this spectacular duo.......ok now back to my review. The new raw lemonade drinks are a great refreshing way to compliment a warm sandwich fresh off the press! My only negative thing to say about the drinks is I just choked on an ice cube what managed to make it from the straw straight down my throat but up until that point it was a great experience! The staff is the most special part for the most part! Sam, Victoria, Alyiah (sorry I probably butchered that spelling) and K*D know I come in quite often with my divine and smoking hot girlfriend and they have made it a point to memorize our orders from the beginning to end of the line and always greet us with a warm welcoming smile upon our arrival! Even the soup mix ins are memorized we don't even have to say our order if we don't want. It is really an incredible feeling to know my business is appreciated and valued! They always make me feel like family or like I'm part of the crew! Only negative thing I have to say is that there is one younger girl in a red shirt that I feel gives me the look of death every time I come in. She is very quiet when she addresses us as customers but doesn't hesitate to very publicly raise her voice at her coworkers whenever she is upset with them. It just seems a bit unprofessional for her to raise her voice and shame her coworkers in front of customers and makes it an awkward experience for us. She put the fast in \"fast and friendly\" just not the friendly part. Minus that part of my visits, it's always a positive 5/5 experience!"}
{"text":"Tried this place during lunch for the first time. Had their new large protein salad. It was great. Prices are reasonable. Friendly customer service. Staff very attentive and helpful. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"4 people in line got their food before me worst service ever will not be going back. Will travel to goodyear to go to zupas from now on and elisa worst attitude ever. Put yourself in the customers shoes dont get rude"}
{"text":"Our new favorite place. The kids that work there are all outstanding. Customer service is on target with this store. I have not been to others but I suspect that it is their corporate culture. The food choices are wonderful and even my husband who is not known for his desire for salads nor soups, now asks to go here once a week. Love that. We dine out 5 times a week as it is so hard to make dinner for just 2 people and coming here is a weekly stop.

I have only one complaint and that is that nowhere to be found is a nutrition listing on their foods. I have asked and tried their website. Nothing. That is a shame"}
{"text":"Zupas has a great selection of semi healthy to healthy items. My son adores the clam chowder and i am a fan of the mushroom bisque. I love that we get a hunk of bread and a chocolate covered strawberry with our order. The reason i give only 3 stars is that twice when i have ordered my mushroom bisque i got lobster bisque instead and i have seafood issues. In both cases i took the soup back to the counter and i kinda felt like they were looking at me as if i ordered wrong. The other annoying thing is there not being open on Sundays which makes me think they are owned and operated by the same religious group that operates chik filet."}
{"text":"The food I've had here is pretty good but they have somethings to work out.

The biggest is the ordering process.  

You are handed a menu when you walk in and people stand around the line entrance figuring out what they want.  Once you know what you want, you can't just order it.  You have to walk through a hurried line where seemingly every person on the way asks you what you ordered or if you want what they have to offer.  You tell them what you want then at the end of the line, a disorganized pile of prepared dishes sits at the end of the line when you are again asked everything you ordered and expected to remember what the name of your sandwich, salad, or soup was called.

I agree with the other reviewer about how stingy they are.  For me it was the \"upgrades\" that I have an issue with.  None of their soups come garnished.  Want tortilla strips on your tortilla soup?  That's an extra $.69.   A Tablespoon of orzo pasta in our tomato soup?  $.69 extra per scoop.

All in all, their food is good, but these issues make me go here 1 out of 10 times I think about it.  Throw the crazed parking that Camelback Colonade offers and it's just not worth it any more often than once every few months."}
{"text":"The place looks and smells dirty.  Mildew smell.  Kids meals are sub-par.  Fruit cup is canned mandarin oranges and sliced grapes.  Not fresh.  The \"baguette\" bread tastes like the generic \"french loaf\" bread at the local grocers.   Not impressed.  Will not return."}
{"text":"Not happy with my experience today. Went in for my favorite \"Try Two\" Combo of Kale and Quinoa salad and Roasted Veggie and Quinoa soup. I love both of them! Right away I was informed the salad bar area was in repair so no salads were being served. Mine you this is lunchtime @ 11:30 am but hey stuff happens I know. So I switch over to soup and sandwich. The girl at the register doesn't ring my drink and I have to ask her to add it to my bill even though the drink cup is on my tray. Then I get to the table and there's no quinoa in my soup! I've had this soup several times. I go back to the counter and the manager said she'd get me a different bowl. The second bowl was the same! No one comes to my table to see if it is any better. I have to go back to the counter again. I had to ask twice before the manager spoke with me. She was busy texting  on her cell phone. Bottom line, she said the soup is the same recipe they always prepare. I asked her to show me a piece of quinoa then which she would not do. I had to ask for my money back for the soup I did not eat. She didn't offer it to me first, but she did give me $3 something back after I asked. I asked to speak with the chef and she said he wasn't there. She (Ashlyn) gave me the company info@cafezupas.com email to voice my complaint after I asked for the GM's phone number. There was no excuse for this poor service and food quality. They weren't even busy at the time. There were more people working there than eating there! So disappointed in the manager's attitude. She could have totally turned my experience around. That's what happens when you make 20 somethings a manager without properly training them on customer service."}
{"text":"My co-workers rave about this place so I stopped in today for lunch. I got there a little before noon so the lunch crowd had not yet reared its ugly head. Still, it was loud in there, so much that I had a hard time ordering my food. The employees across the counter were either not speaking loud enough, or I'm going deaf. They also talked very quickly and I had to ask them to repeat things several times. Also, a small observation for the management. There was a Zupas employee standing at the entrance of the ordering line holding menus. We approached her and assumed she would give us a menu or answer questions. Instead, she instructed us to walk around her and did not offer a menu. There was no one else in line but she wanted us to walk thru the pylons that form the ordering line. It was odd because the employee served absolutely no purpose that I can determine.

After ordering, I went to the restroom and discovered that the low-water use faucet is prone to splash off the sink and got my crotch area nice and wet. So now I've got to walk out with looking like I peed myself a bit. 

I had a cobb salad with chicken that was pretty good and a cauliflower soup that was very good. The portions are decent, maybe a touch small for the price. I'll give Zupas another shot in a few weeks because I'm eager to try the sandwiches. Maybe the manager can ask the staff to talk louder and slower for those us that (apparently) are becoming hard-of-hearing."}
{"text":"Pricey for the amount of food. Employees in your face as soon as you get in the door. Food is bland with the exception of the chicken enchilada chili which was delicious. Clean bathrooms and dining area. The place has a cool look about it. Probably won't go back but wouldn't steer others away without trying it once."}
{"text":"If you like Paradise Bakery and Panera, you will love this place, and never go back to the others! Great service, selection, and very clean!"}
{"text":"The customer service was good, but the quality of the food is crap. They drowned my salad in dressing, the avocado was bitter. The whole meal just had that low quality fast food taste. Not worth the price I paid."}
{"text":"You will definitely have a solid 4 Stars if you train your employees NOT to go over board with the \"precise portion controls\" at the salad station.   Get smaller serving spoons and GIVE \"HEAPING PORTIONS\".   If you are so worried about a few tomato pieces or cucumbers cutting into your profits, you are worrying about the wrong thing!!  It's all about perception folks.  Food was great, but felt cheated.  Loosen up and let the consumer feel like they are getting a great value."}
{"text":"I understand they are very busy but today I ordered the chicken chopped salad to go and got all lettuce and less than a handful of all the other ingredients.  Asked for extra dressing and got nothing.  They also omitted their usual chocolate covered strawberry and bread.  Most horrible experience ever there.  Very disappointed."}
{"text":"The food is good, that's why I come back. We were the only ones left, and they're unreasonably loud just chitchatting about god knows what. I can't hear my own thoughts. We left and weren't acknowledge. That was the first and last time I'm going to eat inside. I realized why I usually take it to go, because I feel as if they can be better with customer service. Maybe because other places go above and beyond. Oh well. :)"}
{"text":"I'm giving 5 stars because I loved the garden chowder, and grilled cheese. They also have salads I can't wait to try. Bread was fresh, delicious and chewy. Not a big deal until you get bread from someplace that does not make it fresh. Bleh lol
It is difficult to find places that serve healthy AND savory food but I'm glad I've found another one. If you're like me and love LOVE fresh fruits and vegetables cooked with FLAVOR you will love this place. Soup was not over salted as someone else mentioned.
other places to check out for healthy food lovers: hummos xpress and pita bistro. Yum. They also have an amazing selection for veggie additions."}
{"text":"This is one of the best places in Henderson to get a fresh salad, good soup, or artisan sandwich. At lunch the lines are long and there's not a lot of seating. So, if you have a larger group come around 11:20 or around 2:00."}
{"text":"A nice choice at Desert Ridge if you're looking for something good and quick.  The sandwiches are all made to order and they're good.  They also have some very good soups but, as others have pointed out, they can be a bit salty sometimes.  
If I'm in the mood for a sandwich my first choice is Paradise Bakery but Zupas is a pretty close second."}
{"text":"Delicious. Fresh.  Very reasonably priced.  I cannot say enough about this place!!!  The lobster bisque has to be the most deliciousness I have ever tasted. The BBQ pork sandwich was absolutely delightful. Sweet and tangy and the meat was so tender. The ciabatta bun was the softest I've ever had. The turkey sandwich with cranberry was fantastic. Ending the meal with a chocolate strawberry?  Yes please!!! Very friendly staff. Asked if I would like any recommendations without being pushy. Very helpful staff !!!  I have found my new favorite place!!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered the soup with roasted veggies and quinoa.The picture of this item in the menu is of the vegetables piled up in the broth of the soup,almost spilling out of the bowl.
But in my bowl,I could barely find any vegetables.It is all broth-watery at that-with very few veggies mixed in with it.Very disappointing.
This was the case on 2 separate occasions."}
{"text":"They open today, I know this b/c I'm a hugggge fan of their food and I've been driving 30mins to their Dana Park location at least 2 times a week, drooling over the idea of having one that is just a few minutes down the street here in Chandler.  


Their food is fresh and amazing, and they always have great new seasonal soups along with the staples which are equally as good.  The only bummer is that I so often crave a good soup and sandwich on a Sunday afternoon, and they are not open on Sundays.  I get it, but still miss the opportunity to fulfill this craving."}
{"text":"Great food wonderful service and the people who make your food explain everything to you while you order there was someone to greet you at the door and answered any questions we had. I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place, and we're so thrilled when they opened on Rainbow.  There's not a tone of lunch spots in the area (getting better now) so anything in the area from noon-1:00 will be packed. Plan accordingly.  Not sure what everyone's negative comments are for, it's a quick spot for a delicious bite to eat.  Lots of seats, yes, but we've never had trouble maneuvering, and my husband is in a wheelchair. My favorite soups are the chicken enchilada chili (despite what someone else has said, doesn't seem cheesy at all; it's thickened with masa) and the cauliflower soup (super rich).  I typically get the BBQ chicken salad, and my hubby gets sandwiches. Everything has been great. We eat here at least once a week and the only bad experience was they took longer than normal to make our salad and sandwich and by the time we paid for our food and sat down, our soup was barely lukewarm.  Far better food, quality, and choices than Panera, the blandest lunch spot in earth"}
{"text":"My sister & I had both been wanting to trying this place out for awhile. There was alot to choose from off the menu than I expected. I ordered the veggie sandwich & the mangoberry salad. Both were very good. 
The one thing that turned off our experience was the CUSTOMER SERVICE,- okay let me just say that customer service is very important, if your customer service is poor, there is a risk in revenue for the company. With that being said, i was soooooo disappointed. One of the girls was very rude and i had to explain to each one (more than once) what i had ordered, the girl that was rude to begin with kept questioning what I ordered, as if i was making it up or something, \"are you suuure you ordered that and not this?\" once I had explained to her that \"yes, it was what I ordered\". I had to explain AGAIN what I ordered to the other girl.  I was irritated after that. 

Would I go there again? Maybe at a different time of the day with different workers and see how it goes. Its a shame because the food was terrific, but again the service was ridiculous."}
{"text":"Great food but, very bad customer service.  The management was not helpful and didn't try to make us happy.  Management needs better training on servicing their customers."}
{"text":"Cafe Zupas is awesome! The food is well prepared. I enjoyed being able to try each of the soups. Staff is professional and friendly. I will be returning for sure!"}
{"text":"Decided to find out what everyone has been raving about and was a little disappointed. It was decent but nothing I need to try again. The soup was better than the sandwiches. The sandwiches, the cuban and turkey club, were just okay. Not a whole lot of flavor and I expect flavor from a cuban. The drink station was nice, plenty of different options but super crowded. It was busy and I felt rushed to make a selection. I didn't try the salads but they did look super appetizing and healthy. The price is right for what you get, definitely a good value. Personally I prefer Jason's Deli, they definitely have Zupas beat in the sandwich department."}
{"text":"I love this place I ordered the mushroom bisque and the mangoberry salad for lunch and I have to say the salad is literally the BEST salad I've ever had and the mushroom bisque was divine as well. I can't say enough good things about zupas! I love everything they stand for and how their ingredients are fresh and that they give you a complimentary chocolate covered strawberry and slice of bread with your order. Love love love this place!"}
{"text":"Please tip the cleaning staff. Great food great price want something light or a meal very economical and good tasting this is your place. A+++ very clean"}
{"text":"Awesome, mouth watering food! Disgusting bathrooms!!! 

Ordered the mushroom bisque soup and California club. I can't rave about how delicious this food was because there isn't enough words in the dictionary. Devine! Even my boyfriends choice was amazing too... I stole a bite or two :) 

This was our first time there because we live in Chandler but we were on that side of town around lunch time. After we ate I went to the restroom and was kinda blown away because the food was so swell and the restaurant was pretty, bathroom nasty! 

My advice to management or owner is keep it clean! I saw an employee windexing a window with plenty of free time to go clean the bathroom. 

All in all the food is amazing! I would of rather peed outside however"}
{"text":"Just ate here, there was mold in their bread, showed it to staff and nothing was done about it, not even a sincere apology, must not be the first time this happened"}
{"text":"You guys, this place is SO GOOD. Whenever I go I get the 'ultimate grilled cheese' and half of a 'nuts about berries' salad. If you order a salad, it comes with a roll and every entree comes with a chocolate dipped strawberry. This is the perfect amount of food after a long shift with no breaks. I love the staff because they are always smiling and so sweet- can't ask for anything else!"}
{"text":"I had the honey bacon club panini and the Wisconsin cauliflower soup.  Both were delicious!  The soup was awesome!!  I highly recommend both.  Can't wait to try other menu items.  This is my new favorite sandwich shop.  Beats Paradise and Panera!  Their soup selection seems better here than the competition."}
{"text":"I love Cafe Zupas! The food is amazing, has a very homemade feel, and is reasonably priced. I don't know how much these employees are paid, but they all act like they love their job and are the friendliest bunch you will ever come across, which is very rare for take out style food service! I definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Unhappy with the service. I wanted a kids meal and because I was not a child they wanted to charge me 2 extra dollars. It was the same meal!  I just ordered the tomato soup and have been sick to my stomach ever since. Go to Panera or paradise cafe instead."}
{"text":"Obsessed with their tomato basil soup!!  Always love getting the rocky road brownie with it"}
{"text":"Went there for the first time today, really good food at a very decent price. They give you a lot of food which pleased me as is hard to find at other places for lunch."}
{"text":"First Visit, Had the Pulled Pork sandwich and Lobster Bisque soup combo,  the meal also comes with a chocolate dipped strawberry.  The food was quite good especially the pork sandwich.  May try a Different soup next visit.  It was good but not great and with so many to try I am sure i can find a favorite in the soups as well.  

I normally eat quite a bit when I go out and this was more than I needed at only 7.99 so the prices are quite nice as well."}
{"text":"Dinner with my dad, I liked my salad but asked for no cheese and they gave me some. Cheese makes my butt big. No Bueno. So close to 5 stars"}
{"text":"According to my friend, Zupa means soup in Polish. 

I looooveee soup. Zupa's has a bazillion tantalizing soup options- and you can sample them before choosing! I settled on lobster bisque and a super fruit salad. 

Delicious soup, happy customer. 

ALSO YOU GET A CHOCOLATE COVERED STRAWBERRY FOR DESSERT

Will return to eat more soup."}
{"text":"Great food, friendly service and a complete meal for a very reasonable price."}
{"text":"Place is great go there all the time with my 3 boys and the wife, only end up spending $40 tops. Every time we go everyone is satisfied. Staff is great and always welcoming."}
{"text":"Really liked the food. The little chocolate covered strawberry that comes with it is a cute added touch. I got a quinoa protein bowl. It was good, but a little too much kale and not enough quinoa for my taste. The pork that was on it was great. Only downfall really was that when i asked them to add cheese, they added like a tablespoon of cheese for a rather large bowl. Other than that, friendly staff and good food. Would definitely come again."}
{"text":"People are friendly and we love the food!!!!
I especially love the butter and cracker station ;)."}
{"text":"One of my quick lunch faves! Only heard about this place from a co-worker who recommeded we go there for lunch. She calorie counts and that is another reason why she likes the place. No calorie counting for me! Haha! I like The Try 2 Combo for $7.99 which includes a Whole Sandwich: Half Soup/or Half Salad. THE BEST PART IS THE CHOCOLATE DIPPED STRAWBERRY included with every meal purchase.

The variety of soups are great & they provide taste cups if you want to try any before deciding on your soup choice, my favorite is Wild Mushroom Bisque. They have a good selection in salad options as well, my favoorite is Pina Colada Chicken Salad. For the sandwiches, I usually go with Pesto Chicken Panini. The desserts always look so delicious & I have on numerous times gave in to the \"Low Fat\" Berries & Custard Cup/Tart.

It's a quick and easy place to grab lunch on the go or to sit down with friends and enjoy. They have choice of inside & outdoor seating. It is a bit noisy in there, but tolerable. I agree with another reviewer, that the overwhelming greetings from all the workers is a bit much. Overall, I like the place & will be back for many more lunches."}
{"text":"Skimpy soup portions it's sad. They skimp on the veggies on the salads too. Barely anything. Good food just a bit more."}
{"text":"The only reason I give this place 3 stars is because the food is amazing! Everything on the menu is great and the location is clean and new. 

On another note, the service here is the absolute worst! If you are planning to order for more than one person the employees automatically panic. You go through a whole order and then when you get to the end of the line they ask you to repeat your order once again. Half the time I repeat it, no one even writes it down or does anything with it.. it's like they ask for fun. Also, my order is always somehow wrong. The wrong sandwhich.. missing a meal... 

From now on I will avoid this location & drive to another, just to avoid this service."}
{"text":"Am here for the first time because a friend of mine raved about it.  I think Zupas offers a good value for your money.  Where else can you get full sandwich AND soup for $7.99?  I had the Pesto Chcken grilled Panini and felt it was average.  I love bold flavors in my dishes and so for me the Panini was bland.  I have certainly had better Toetilla soup as well.  So I give the place 3 stars."}
{"text":"Selection was very good. Service was fast and friendly. We tried the grilled cheese, turkey bacon avocado, clam chowder and garden chowder. Everything we tried was very good. Prices were fair for the servings size."}
{"text":"Ordered a Italian Club. \"Where's the meat?\" Subway has more meat on their sandwiches. Not much taste ands lot of bread. My friend got a Turkey bacon avocado and clam chowder. Very salty. He said tasteless sandwich. Won't be back ever."}
{"text":"Food is good, nice atmosphere but I have to say being asked \"what did you order\" 30 different times while in line is quite annoying. They really need to figure out a different system because by the time I get to the register to pay I'm already over it."}
{"text":"Not good and will not be going back. I am not sure if they are trying to kill people with their salt content. We tried the grilled cheese and 2 different soups and all 3 were salt bombs. I mean way more sodium then a regular can of soup like 10x. All the workers looked absolutely miserable which didn't help the experience. Good concept, poor execution."}
{"text":"I had high expectations for this place, since there were vegetarian and vegan options along with my fellow Yelpers liking it.... Place felt like a cafeteria and soup also tasted like it came from one.

The lights went out after taking a few bites, I guess Dana Park looses power often, we got to go containers since I didn't want to eat my food in the dark. Luckiky the 40 minute drive home had time to marinate the flavors of my kale and quinoa salad together. When I got home I enjoyed what was left.

Kuddos to the complimentary half chocolate covered strawberry.....it was tasty.

Didnt care for the hard bread roll that was complimentary too with the soup....it was hard and tasted \"industrialized\". 
Son enjoyed the lobster and red pepper bisque though very much along with his meatless cobb salad....

Not sure why people compare Jasons Deli and Wildflower to this since both of them have organic options and Zupas unfortunately does NOT. Even though the food options are better here than fast food joints, it still felt very fast foodish to me !"}
{"text":"Not impressed.  Very small portions for the price you pay.  Sandwiches are extremely tiny with hardly any meat on it.  It's mostly bread and costs $5.69 not including tax.  The food does taste good and the chocolate covered strawberry is a nice touch.  Would not go back again since it is not worth the price."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite place. The menu has a wide variety and the taste and quality of the food is top notch."}
{"text":"I love this place and every other location they have!! The staff is so welcoming and prompt. The food is so fresh and I CANNOT get enough \"Nuts About Berries\" salad. LOVE LOVE LOVE"}
{"text":"This is my fourth time here and still loving it! They are very busy, but for the volume they go through you are not waiting in line more than 10 minutes. (And that's when the line is out the door) Food is always fresh, good selection and reasonably priced. Very pleasant staff!"}
{"text":"Large variety of salads sandwiches and great soups to chose from. Love the chowders. A tiny bit on the pricier side but worth it. Service is speedy however when I came in today around 2pm there were two girls and a guy up front. One girl seemed to be training the guy but all she was doing was making him flustered and confusing (and embarrassing) him. This isn't the way to train employees, it just made me feel awkward and bad for him. Everything else was great."}
{"text":"We went in for a late lunch. Restaurant was mostly empty.  $20+ for a salad and a sandwich seemed kind of high, but whatever. I asked for feta cheese, she charged me .60¢ for about four baby chunks of cheese.  For some reason, she stuck a toothpick in my salad (to indicate extra?), but left it there. I was surprised to get it in my mouth. But not nearly as surprised as when I bit down on a rock. When my husband showed the rock to an employee, he said, \"Oh. I'll let them know.\" No sorry. No questions about what salad, etc. I can only imagine he tossed it in the trash and end of story. I hope not, but he didn't seem at all concerned.

The food was decent, the staff marginal (they were having a full on conversation about getting better jobs), but the tooth pain will keep me from going back."}
{"text":"If you like fresh food (salads, soups and sandwiches only) for a decent price you should check this place out.  Today it was a tad chilly in Phoenix so I went the thai peanut chicken salad and the Wisconsin cauliflower soup. They both hit the spot and the meal was finished off with a chocolate covered strawberrry. All for well under $10 for the entire meal. The line was long and the Crystal Light Cherry needed to be diluted but all in all a great meal. I will go back!"}
{"text":"I love the quality of salads, soups, and sandwiches on there menu! I mean, how many places can you go to and get a free chocolate covered strawberry with your meal!!?? The prices are just right for lunch and it's excellent for the healthy conscious folks! I am a regular here and all I can say is get your butt down here!!"}
{"text":"I had the tortilla soup and Thai mango salad.  I have had better tortilla soup at Rubio's.  Soup was salty.  Salad was too sweet and a combination of ingredients that left me uninspired.  Salad had iceberg lettuce, cut corn, precooked chicken, diced mango, onion and super sweet dressing.  I can go to Fresh and Easy and find a better salad.  
I had a feeling that the sweets were the pull.  I went in with an open mind and had no idea what to expect.  Disappointment and bewildered.  Place was crowded and had a feverish cafeteria pace.  
Left with half eaten meal, :(  I guess I should have tried other options based on the reviews but some seem to exaggerate.  \"To die for,\" really?"}
{"text":"I was really impressed when I went here the first time, got my order ready before I reached the register and it was divine. I can recommend the roasted pepper & lobster !!!"}
{"text":"Okay, my wife makes me come here to get food. Service is good. The food is good. We've had a variety of their sandwiches, soups and salads. But every time I go here I just want to rage. I hate their process. Hate it. If the girl at the front of the line asks me for what I'm getting in my double combo, why can't she write the type of soup on the box instead of just an \"S\"?  
Tonight I told the girl I wanted two \"to go\" orders with the types of sandwiches soups and salads. Then she tells me to go to the soup section. The SAME girl comes over to the soup section and asks me which soups I want. I just told them to her. Seriously. 
Let's move onto the check out. The next person has  no idea which is my order and has to ask me again which meal is mine. Three times I have to tell them what I'm having. I pay. I leave. Food good. Service good. Process not good."}
{"text":"Love this place! Food tastes so fresh! A bit pricey for combo but everywhere else is nearly the same price for a meal these days. I thought portions were a bit on the small side but the food does fill you up. I feel great eating here...not greasy feeling. Every visit I try something new between the sandwiches, soups, & salads. So far, it's been delicious & freshly made! Their fruits are so plump & juicy! I guess they farm their own veggies & fruits. It's really great quality that you can't find in your regular grocery stores."}
{"text":"Cafe Zupas is awesome, there food is so fresh and tastes great. I love how everything is made to order, an can watch the process. To top is off the always give a Chocolate cover strawberry with every meal. Who doesn't love chocolate covered strawberries. There food is reasonably price. Highly recommend this place!!!"}
{"text":"Can't say much about this place other than its amazing and delicious food. I am a regular here and I am just in love with their lobster bisque and crab avocado sandwich. I always get it whenever I go here. The staff is quite friendly and the place is great to sit down, eat, and chat with friends and families. Definitely  a place where your family can go to and eat because it's so friendly and the vibe is comforting for younger children too. The food selection isn't rocket science. You can pretty much order from different types/customize salads, sandwiches, and soups. 


Worth trying:

Sandwiches: pesto chicken sandwich, crab avocado, and Asian BBQ
Soups: Lobster bisque and clam chowder
Salads: they're all good haha"}
{"text":"I use to come here a lot but hasn't given it a chance lately but I decided to come in to get dinner the other day. I must say I use to love this place but as the menu changed it is not as good anymore. I still have it four stars because the nuts about berries salad is amazing!!! Also everyone is always very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"The Wisconsin Cauliflower Soup is AMAZING! Very busy location, but fast service with a smile!"}
{"text":"Wow, this place sure does count every little piece of bad quality vegetable they put on your salad. They also leave out everything listed on the menu that is supposed to go on the salad. My mistake for going here twice and having the same experience again. They left out some ingredients and when I went up to ask for what was left out, they treated me like I was a liar and proceeded to tell me the exact number of pieces they place in each salad. Um, ok thanks for the education and making your restaurant look pathetic. I guess you owe me 3 tomato halves then, because you gave me two tiny spoiled ones for my whole salad. What a great value. You also owe me a pinch of bacon, a peapod, and a teaspoon of shredded cheese."}
{"text":"Tried to get a to-go order but couldn't because they don't do to-go orders after 8pm. WHAT!? We decided to go, since we were only 5min away but ended up waiting a good 20 min for the wrong sandwich! We frequent this place often but will think twice before going back especially with all the other great restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Good not great...Paradise Bakery is slightly better if you are looking for soups,  salads and sandwiches."}
{"text":"I order a Vegetarian sandwich, but they give me an Italian Club. I find out the \"hard\" way by taking a couple bites before realizing it is not a Vegetarian. Giving a pork sandwich to someone who is a vegetarian is an egregious food-order blunder; so, I go back to see what the restaurant will do to make things right. I find the young woman that had fulfilled my order. The only thing she offers me is to replace the Italian Club with the Vegetarian I had ordered. I ask to see a manager, but it turns-out she is a manager. Duh!

I am dinging Zupas three stars:
- A manager gave me the wrong sandwich.
- An Italian Club (i.e. pork) was given instead of a Vegetarian.
- They did not offer any recompense for the gaff."}
{"text":"Not a fan. I feel so rushed when I go to this location. They don't even give me time to look at the menu. The soups are not always fresh. I've gotten old soup at this place twice already. I expect fresh soup made every morning at thier prices. Not reheated soup from the day before. Some of thier soups are also too salty."}
{"text":"Didn't get the greatest experience here. As my friend and I were eating our meal, we saw these two girls braiding their hair near the food. Not shortly after that, my friend found a hair in her salad. Lost our appetite quickly after that. It's a shame because I love the food here."}
{"text":"Rocked a Try 2 combo with a Grilled Cuban sandwich and a Glazed Chicken Chipotle salad. Everything was perfect, I wish I could buy their Honey Cilantro glaze by the gallon. The bathroom was so clean and aesthetically pleasing I would've gladly eaten my meal on the floor.

I personally enjoy Coca Cola with their Italian Vanilla syrup added in, but if you're not a Coke person disregard."}
{"text":"The food here was delicious!  The lunch combo is a great deal.  Food was fresh.  The Italian soda and chocolate dipped strawberry are a nice touch."}
{"text":"Really like the concept and menu. But execution is just not quite there. Teenage girls playing chef with overflowing salty sauce on the sandwiches. Not a healthy combination."}
{"text":"Zupas Nuff said! Place is amaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaazing! Staff is always friendly, lobby is always clean!!!"}
{"text":"Been here probably half a dozen times, never had a bad experience. Food's always good, employees friendly. It's clean, modern, and what else can you ask for at the drink bar? Actually, this is one of the few places I will buy an \"overpriced\" drink, purely because of the options they have. While we're on the topic of price, yeah I know we all think it. Dropping nearly 20 bucks a person with drink, dessert (you can't say no), tax and tip? It's not an easy place to frequent, and becomes more of an easy-going spot to take friends. Because if you don't go with someone who knows how to order, you will be utterly confused your first time."}
{"text":"for a deli it gets five stars
 I was greeted as I walked in every employee i encountered was polite and smilig. they were busy and the noise was pretty high. I ws concerned about the portions being outrageous but they were perfect
and you get a chocolate dipped strawberry with yur meal! I also had a very good dessert beautifully created. But remember this is like a fast food deli its not like an mastro kitchen for dinner but for a deli its clean, organized. 
they have a place to charge cel phones and get wifi. the drink bar is hiding ehind the big ipod charging station. 
My sandwhich ws perfect, warm all the way through and no mustard just like I asked. I got the baked ham sandwhich. Delicious! and nice views out the windowfor people watching.
 One is coming to desert ridge market place soon!"}
{"text":"I love it here. The food is good. Warm. Pretty fresh. This location is smaller than an other location i have been to. But both locations greeted me at the door ready to answer questions and make suggests. Both places were quick. Both places give you a chocolate covered strawberry for dessert.

With their pick two combos a drink doesn't come with it. But you do get nice portions for the price of just two items. And if you do get a drink they have a drink station with another  menu to make your own non alcoholic mixed drinks. Made with those flavored syrups like they put in. Your coffee.
 They have wifi here but we couldn't log on. 

I will come back someday."}
{"text":"I like the concept and the employees were very friendly.  I had the clam chowder and was disappointed.  I think I saw two pieces of clam in the entire bowl.  It tasted more like a potato soup and was way to thin to call a chowder.  There was also a layer of oil on top that was very unappetizing.  Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Everything was quick and tasty. There are a lot of different options to choose from. It was a nice change from the basic soup and sandwiches you find most places."}
{"text":"Fresh tasty food and very friendly employees every time! Love the strawberry dipped in chocolate treat. Berries and nuts salad is amazing. Honey cilantro carnitas also amazing!"}
{"text":"I will stick to the salads. I ordered the gumbo, it was awful. I'm a Louisiana native and that was not gumbo. They should rename it, Cajun Soup. I was very disappointed."}
{"text":"More like cafe pukas, Gross. Welcome to the 21st century American dining experience. Food with no flavor other than salt. Sandwiches are alright... Alright is stretching it too. Someone recommended this place saying it was \"healthy.\" I got the impression a lot of people do. Just because a place has soup does not constitute it as healthy. Btw, there was no soup, just salt, liquified and highly processed. 

And they sure love to serve that white bread, 16 different types of soda too! And, heck, if that ain't enough, they got syrups and you can make yer own! Wow, these folks even have an iPod charging station (wattha???? This is a supposed to be a place to eat so you can nourish your system, not overload it with sodium and \"plug in\" uhhh zombie. 

Come on, it's not even local - go some where else. 

Two stars bc there was no hair in my food and the chocolate strawberries were alright."}
{"text":"Not enough toppings or dressing. Very skimpy. That bothers me when paying 8 for a salad. Soup was good."}
{"text":"To the person who made this sandwich!!! Would you pay for this and enjoy it?? Total ripoff!! Panera all the way!!!"}
{"text":"Soo upset with this place! I used to eat here all the time when I lived in Utah and I loved it, I love the honey bacon club sandwich and Thai mango salad, however at this location I have twice in a row now had dirty lettuce and bugs in my salad! I guess if you avoid he salads you'd be fine. Soo disappointed and will never eat at this Zupas again :("}
{"text":"One Hundred Percent - hands down 5 Stars! I have been to Cafe Zupas three times and I always leave wanting to go back the next day! I've now had the Lobster Bisque Soup, Roasted Red Pepper and Lobster Soup, Crab Avocado Melt, and Turkey Spinach Artichoke Sandwich. They always give you a piece of delicious bread and a chocolate dipped strawberry if you get a pick 2 combo. 

I am finicky when it comes to sandwiches because I really do make some pretty decent ones at home. Every single thing I have ordered (listed above) has met and exceeded my expectations. Nothing has been bland, scarce, over seasoned, under seasoned, lacking complexity, or unpleasing to my palate. I just order my food and know that it will be good, actually great. They have \"italian soda\" which is actually just adding sprite to your drink and then pumping in some flavor shots, but it's kind of fun. I like the atmosphere in the restaurant, but I don't understand why they have signs on every table telling you to not reserve a table. I don't get why it would matter.  I have not had a salad at Cafe Zupas, so I can not comment on that . However, my co-worker has gotten salads and she is even more finicky than I am about food and the fact that she didn't complain is a compliment.

As far as comparing to similar companies goes, I put them at the top for a few reasons. I have been severely disappointed by the Wildflower inside of Chandler mall because their French Onion Soup had a seasoning that did not belong there and threw off the whole flavor for me. Paradise Bakery is great and I do love their salads and sandwiches. However, I have started to find a lot of what they make too bland and I've noticed that one of my favorite salads got a makeover which I was not thrilled about. 

One last thing, there were things about the sandwiches that I was initially disappointed about and then later decided that they were not an issue. At first, I didn't like that they lay the meat down flat since I like to cascade mine on the sandwich for a gentle fluffy type layer. I later decided that it was actually easier to eat their sandwiches this way and helped keep the sandwich together. I also initially felt that there was not enough meat ( and I am not a huge meat eater) , but later decided that it was the perfect amount to not overcome the other flavors in the sandwich. Someone who is a huge meat lover might be better off ordering a sub sandwich from another place. I am not a light eater by any means and sometimes come here around noon after only having coffee for the day, but I still end up having at a minimum, half of a sandwich for left-overs. 

That's all! Now go try Cafe Zupas!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. The Wisconsin Cauliflower soup and the Veggie Chowder are my two favorite soups so far, and I love the Turkey, Spinach and Artichoke sandwich. The desserts are amazing too, and It's very hard to resist temptation. I finds myself eating here way more often than I should, but it's just too good to stop. I had to knock of one star for the following reasons: the Tomato Basil soup is overly sweet, and the sandwiches don't have much meat on them."}
{"text":"A good little lunch place. Service is quick and the food is filling. For about eight dollars you get a good sized sandwich and a soup, a piece of bread and normally a chocolate dipped strawberry. Instead of the strawberry right now they are giving you a chocolate dipped Oreo which I actually prefer. The tables turn over quickly and they keep the tables clean and have plenty of employees to help you out."}
{"text":"My review is about everything including the sandwiches.  I could eat their salads almost everyday and Im anything but a vegan.  Sandwiches and Soups are usually excellent but recommend sampling soups prior.  We have had a couple of experience of it being really salty.  Desert are incredible as well.  If I was to drop a star though it be for changes the corp office pushes sometimes which annoys me.  There have been at least 3 or 4 at this point.  Perhaps cost as well but thats usually a problem everywhere these days.  Ive not compared to paradise bakery or jasons deli but I cant imagine it being any worse.  Employees are also excellent and friendly from my experience."}
{"text":"I have been frequenting this place recently because I love their pulled pork sandwich. They have a large selection of sandwiches, soups, as well as salads. I haven't heard anyone that I have been here with that hasn't enjoyed their quality food. Also, they have some desserts that look amazing."}
{"text":"Food fresh, service great, store was very clean but everything tasted too sweet. not enough savory flavors. almost as if they added sugar to every soup and dressing."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite place for a sandwich and soup or salad! The food is amazing and the service has always been great. The food and service is better than Paradise Bakery (minus the sugar cookies at paradise) and they give you a delicious chocolate covered strawberry with every order."}
{"text":"Is there a lettuce shortage?!! I ordered a \"large\" salad, which is $8.00 and they portion out the leaves in a bowl, and then pick out any overage before putting it in your container. I am not kidding! The large salad is only half of the container, because supposedly a tiny piece of bread & strawberry that I do not even want has to go on the other side of the container. They should be ashamed of themselves to charge $8 for literally 14 pieces of lettuce! I will never go there again. A true rip off!!"}
{"text":"This place used to be good but they hire high school kids who don't care about their job (they are making 8.50 so I understand), also they treat their employees like interchangeable parts. They used to have consistency in their products but the soups are not blended and become solid with refrigeration. It's different everytime I go now, so I don't go anymore. Seems like the new management techniques have this place destined for failure. I would suggest fixing it fast."}
{"text":"Had a delicious lunch hear with my friends! Portions are pretty generous and you are allowed samples of soup before you commit to one! Loved the Pesto Chicken Panini, Nuts about Berries salad, and Lobster Bisque. Cool bonus is the bread and chocolate dipped strawberry that comes with the soups and salads. The bread is a small slice, maybe about 5 inches long, and the strawberry sizes vary. 

Staff is friendly and patient. Decor is very modern. Pretty clean restaurant. Overall, great experience and I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Thanks for the $7 bowl of chicken soup without a shred of chicken in it. Do you always do that to takeout orders since there is no way to complain in person or get what we actually paid for."}
{"text":"Salad: Red Raspberry Spinach Salad 
Location: Norterra Pheonix, AZ 
Price: $9.49  

Pros:  Seemed organic, claimed house made, natural salads and so and such. Happy to know that Zupas created soups and salad dressing from scratch.   

Cons: Initial order was for  1/2 salad-Red Raspberry Spinach Salad. But I changed mind in 30 secs and asked for full salad (due to lack of sandwich options) The manager-in-charge (the great!) decided to switch  1/2 salad bowl to full salad and call it 'that's easy' by adding a handful of spinach. I was shocked & had a conflicting thoughts as to may be there is more or may be I'm missing something..blah blah! But the bowl is moved from one end to another just with a spoonful of pistachios and some grapes (cheap stuff) and i opt out for blue cheese - they load the salad with sugary raspberry proclaimed salad dressing. And I ask for cranberry, which comes with this particular salad. But, guess what! they charge an extra 1.49 on this and make my bill for what? let's say a-big-handful of spinach, teaspoon of pistachio, teaspoon of grapes, big scoop of cheap dressing = $9.49  Argh! I ask 'is this it?' at the register and the untrained not-courteous-at-all guy at register just wants my card says nothing at all. I feel cheated, robbed and hungry looking at this spinach salad. I pay and decide to never return.  

Lesson learnt: if I'm dying and all resturants are closed in the town if only this is open I might go and if I did I'll buy only a 1/2 salad. And the dressings are too much of sugar - not close to what they have claimed as healthy stuff.  Lastly, don't bother taking vegetarian friends coz there is not a single decent & healthy sandwich that you can make it a vegetarian version. And the salads will starve you to death ;-)   

My request: Please make your salad portions fair (read more healthy and quality veg, fruits, nuts) Please add more veg sandwich options And freaggin make more veg soups other than the classic tomato soups."}
{"text":"We love Zupas. The Lobster Bisque is awesome and my wife loves the tomato basil. This place is great, try it out!"}
{"text":"The restaurant was very clean, very modern, and well-staffed with bright smiling faces. The expansive bank of shining menu screens lit the entire ordering area in a sterile blue glow, and the eating area is deceptively large, bigger than the building appears from outside even. 

The cafeteria-style counter gives an excellent view of the fresh salads, the soups are all well-marked and taster samples are freely offered to indecisive patrons. Initially I went for a bowl of Yucatan Chicken Tortilla soup and an Asian BBQ Pork sandwich, and quickly devoured them both. 

Unfortunately the meal quickly turned south on me, and my lunch was not enjoyed for long. I wasn't sure if I could cast blame for the sudden illness on Cafe Zupas (neither of my lunch mates got sick), so some weeks later I returned to the establishment with the same friends to further explore the menu...

A bowl of lobster bisque soup and a turkey bacon avocado sandwich this time, but ultimately experienced the same results. Quick-onset stomach cramps and the other lovely symptoms of which I will spare you detail. 

As much as I enjoyed the atmosphere, menu variety, service and location, I enjoy not being sick much more. After careful thought and consideration, I think the food may not be entirely to blame. I believe it may be an reaction to the cleaning products they use for their soup bowls. I'm not going back to test the hypothesis though..."}
{"text":"This place won't let you add any meat to the dry flat panini's. All bread no meat!!!! You can't even pay for more meat on the super flat sandwich. I will NOT recommend this place to ANYONE!"}
{"text":"Staff doesn't know what the hell it's doing. One scoop of chicken for a large salad, how ridiculous!  They add on extra cost without telling you. And it's completely overpriced. Don't waste your time here. For God sakes, any salad is better than this."}
{"text":"The food is so good and affordable! Fed two kids with one kids meal! I highly recommend."}
{"text":"The energy in this place is contagious! Very nice and tasteful interior! The staff are very helpful. The Clam Chowder soup is my favorite. The Turkey Cranberry Sandwich or TC is to die for. Came back to this place three times in 24 hours."}
{"text":"Tropical Maui Chicken salad......AMAZING. Favorite Salad place. My soup choice was the lobster bisque! Just absolutely love this place."}
{"text":"I was hearing the buzz about Cafe Zupas for a while and thought I'd check it out the other day. Was definitely not impressed and it didn't live up to its expectations. 
I decided to get a soup and sandwich. When I went up to order my soup I asked to try the Yucatan Chicken Tortilla, the young lady allowed me to try it yet when I actually ordered it she said there wasn't any left. Why did she let me try it in the first place? Then I proceeded to order  the Pesto Chicken sandwich, which barely had any chicken. There was nowhere to sit, and the tables which were available were dirty. I'll be sticking to Panera from now on."}
{"text":"Went for dinner having eaten here for lunch previously. Same menu of soups salads and sandwiches. There are plenty of options. Had the soup salad combo with half portions, which provided reasonable portions. The lobster bisque was very good. The strawberry chicken salad was good but very little chicken. The restaurant is fast food with little ambiance. It is clean and the staff is friendly and helpful. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Actually everything I ordered had a very good taste.  The pulled pork sandwich had such a good flavor.  The sauce was tangy and sweet and the coleslaw was very good.  My only complaint is that the sandwich was cold.  I don't know if it was meant to be cold.  Like I said, it tasted great but it was cold.  Also the soup (clam chowder and the Potato and green chili) had very good flavors, but were thin and watery.  I expect my chicken soup to be thin but creme based soups should be thick.  Right?

5 stars would be my rating except for the complaints listed above."}
{"text":"THIS IS MY NEW FAVORITE PLACE!!!!!! yes, i must admit im a Panera Bread lover at heart, however I feel as if this place has slowly taken over my soul! 

They have the BEST service, the fastest service...and hello! you get bread and chocolate covered strawberries with your meal! talk about amazingness!

The food is devine! my favorite so far is the ultimate grilled cheese which has just the right amount of pesto and the chicken enchilada chili! mmmmmm!

LOVE LOVE LOVE!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and my husband and I really love the food! The sandwiches are excellent and the soup might be even better. I will say the sandwiches are a tad on the small side so be sure to get a combo if you're really hungry. The mousse cake is delicious as well.  I've also been pleased with the customer service. Their employees are very positive and helpful. I was waiting maybe one minute for my food tonight and an employee ran down, apologized and bagged everything up for me. Needless to say, we will be frequenting this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Horrible prices to match horrible customer service not worth it. Normally I don't have issues. 
Asked for spourts and cheddar cheese on a sandwhich with no avocado. the sandwich comes with  the avocado and Munster cheese. We can't add to sandwhich....blink.. Blink. Okay can I substitute Sprouts instead of avocado and cheddar cheese instead of Munster. The manager turns around all snarky normally we don't do that. Points to the menu It's new policy but will do it just this one time.....
I no longer wanted to eat here... How hard can it be to make a turkey cheddar sandwhich . you're about to charge me a million dollars for it anyway just give me the damn sandwich. The Lady was completely out of line I just walked out.I just don't get why it was so hard to order..and why this would be an exception....especially when I ordered the same sanwhich 2 weeks ago.Sorry you hate you cafe life don't snap at me for it. Didn't realize turkey Sprouts would set you off into a panic everybody looked at me like I was an alien how dare she ordered turkey cheddar Sprouts sandwich. Jesus lol. Rant done."}
{"text":"The food is excellent. I recommend the ultimate grilled cheese. It's heavenly. I love the concept of zupas and have gone a ton in utah. I was however disappointed with this location because of the friendliness of the staff...or lack their of. Step up your game!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I'm all about the kale and quinoa salad and the lobster bisque and mushroom bisque soups! Yum! Sometimes the line can get a little on the long side and yes... sometimes they don't put extra dressing in there when I ask them to ha but the food makes up for it I think."}
{"text":"I found this place just in time as the weather is getting cooler and a soup and sandwich place is what one craves. I order the turkey panini and mushroom bisque soup which were quite good. The chocolate covered strawberry that comes with it makes for the perfect end of meal change of palette. They seem to have a wide variety so i have to come back and try the other stuff."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!  The salads are wonderfully fresh and full of flavor!  The soups are delicious and homey.  I haven't tried every sandwich yet, but I love the paninis! Service is fast, efficient, and friendly!  This is a great place for lunch or  a light supper!"}
{"text":"3rd time this week!

It's refreshing to have options other than fast food.

I find myself ordering 1-2 pesto chicken sandwich & a Large lobster bisque soup.

If I'm in the mood for something a little different I try the World Tour soup."}
{"text":"Can't even get my order in during my lunch hour!! My third attempt is my last. Three strikes and you are OUT! Tried to take my boyfriend who is a vegetarian here on the weekend but closed Sundays.. I'll never be able to eat here. Great menu and prices worth a try but I'm disappointed the large groups that come here for lunch in a small dining hall. I have such limited time to get a healthy option for lunch close to work. If I was even able to get my order in, I'd have no place to sit and have to travel back to work with soup with no time to eat it. Get it together during your busiest time!!! I was waiting in the back of the line in the dining hall (yes not out the door) people couldn't even get up from their tables without butts in their faces yelling EXCUSE ME. Third time went in I have come to the conclusion it's always going to be like this and. It to waste 10-15 minutes even to walk in on chance there won't be 40 people in line!!!!"}
{"text":"Good quality salad and soup.  Salads are more expensive than Wendys or McDonalds but you get what you pay for.  Service is also good."}
{"text":"Love this place to death, eat it everyday if I could afford. Place is the best, always a welcoming hello and happy staff. Always willing to help the customer. Phenomenal food, very clean and healthy in my opinion. Always have to order the same Italian club and BBQ chicken salad. I had finally changed my salad to the maui tropical chicken and omg! Best salad ever. Gotta check this place out if you haven't gone yet!"}
{"text":"Ok it's clean and was exciting the first 2 times.... After that.... Boring!!!! The complementary chocolate dipped strawberry and most of the time stale bread does not make up for the steep pricing for soup! Seriously! Also, if you want soup toppings they give a joke amount, even though you pay extra for it on top of the expensive soup.... Also, the bowl size is not that much bigger then the cup size (or small and large). I rather get lunch soup and salad and sweet tomatoes for around the same price.... With a coupon or some advertised special I would go back!!!"}
{"text":"One star is giving this place too much credit. Staff and management were totally incompetent. Food was mediocre at best. I have gotten better salad and sandwiches from 7-11. 

The staff, was ridiculous, and no manager was onsite. They did not even have a business card for him. I ended up having to take my \"FOR HERE\" order \"TO-GO\" because they had a worker seating guests after they paid...and he refused to seat us!!

In our case we were a party of 2... However I ordered enough food for probably 4-5 people. (2 soups, sandwich, salad, for myself. My wife had soup salad and sandwich. We wanted to try several menu items each and see what was our favorite. We love good soup and were really excited to try this place out. So once we paid... the idiot in charge of seating directed us to a small table right next to the ordering line. I understand the intent of the assigning seating... the place was pretty busy since it was a Saturday afternoon. However I wanted to relax and enjoy my feast without sitting \"ass-level\" next to a line of people. Additionally since our order took up 3 entire trays it physically would not fit on the table. The plates and bowls are each pretty large... 

I asked him if we could wait for another table and I was told that they were reserved for groups of 3 or more... So even though my order would not physically fit on the tiny table, I could not sit somewhere else. Even though I personally counted 7 open tables, they would rather we leave (pissed off) than seat us in an appropriate sized table. I wish that I had just gotten my money back. Instead I had to get my order repackaged \"TOGO\" and went and sat in the car and ate. The entire experience was really embarrassing. This literally ruined our entire day. I was really frustrated, my wife was pissed and we ended up arguing for the next few hours (Actually we are still arguing still to this minute). All we wanted was to have an enjoyable lunch and then get some shopping done at the mall. But instead we ended up just going home.

There was even a guy there from their corporate office (But no store manager). I hate conflict and avoid it at all cost.... I eventually  told him the situation and he offered no solution except that he was \"Sorry\". He did offer to give me a business card so that I could call him \"To talk about my experience\" Dude! I don't want to call you and talk about it! I want you to fix this, here and now so I can eat the 30 dollars of food I just paid for!!! The staff was polite and I got apologies from about 4 different people while I was waiting for the order to be boxed up. How can this many people recognize a situation that warrants apologies, but not do anything to fix it... I told the corporate guy that I am totally baffled that a company would force patrons to leave with their order to go over something that ridiculous... I was told it was a \"policy\"... If I didn't know better I would thing it was simple discrimination....TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE!


Great job Café Zupas YOU SUCK! The next time I will be back will be back will be for the \"Going out of Business Sale\" 



BOTTOM LINE: Do yourself a favor and go anywhere but here! try out Rachel's kitchen or Jason's Deli... Even Olive Garden... SAVE YOURSELF!!"}
{"text":"Everything was too much.  Theresa was too much sauce on my pulled pork sandwich.  There was too much bread on the sandwich.  The soups were like eating a salt lick.  I tried 4 different types and they were all too salty.  I'm usually over salting dishes when I east them."}
{"text":"I walked in, tried to order a \"create your own salad\" and walked out.  I simply asked for extra lettuce in my salad for an extra fee and was told that they don't offer extra lettuce, that my request would result in my being charged the full price of an additional salad.  I told the server that I didn't  want another salad, I just wanted a little bit of extra lettuce and I am OK paying an up charge for it, but she explained to me that \"their portions are perfectly sized\" and that extra lettuce was not an option for me. How do you have a salad bar and not give people what they want when they are willing to pay a reasonable extra charge for it? My group and I just stopped right there and walked out. Can you imagine if I wanted extra tomatoes? I would have to buy 2 more salads just to get them! Customer acquisition is the highest expense of any restaurant and they just let us all walk right out, and none of us will ever go back."}
{"text":"Came for the first time. Got the Turkey, Bacon, Avocado sandwich with the citrus spinach salad.
The sandwich came out nice and hot. Really cheesy with a lot of flavor. Every bite had more than just bread so no disappointment there. 
The salad was good however the goat cheese was a little overpowering. It had a fair amount of fruit in it and just the right amount of vinagerette. 
Every meal comes with a piece of bread and a chocolate dipped strawberry. The bread was good. The strawberry was also good. 
When you are done, leave everything on the table. They pick up your trays."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. It has so much potential, and the service is always fast and friendly, if a bit disorganized. However I have gone three times and was disappointed with the food each visit. 

First time I got the Tuscan bean soup. It was so salty it wasn't even edible, and I love salt. Second time I got the tomato soup and the Thai Chicken sandwich. Again, the soup was so salty I couldn't finish it. I asked my husband to try it, thinking it must be me, but no. The chicken sandwich was ok, but the chicken was prepared like chicken salad and had way too much dressing. Finally, I tried the veggie sandwich and it was decent, but nothing interesting. The tortilla soup was another salt bomb, neither I nor a friend could eat it. Perhaps their salads are good but I won't be returning to find out."}
{"text":"I love their food.. their fresh salads and soups are delicious. The service is great. A great place to eat lunch or dinner. They have sandwiches too I haven't tried them yet. One suggestion I would have is if they could be more informative on their menu by marking lactose free or gluten free choices. I don't like have to read the entire menu to make sure I'm not going to have cheese on my salad or dairy in My Soup...."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved Zuppas. It was my first time and I have never heard of it. They have soups, salads and desserts. So many unique salads to chooose from. The soup was amazing. My friend got a soup and whole samdwhich which I sampled. I got a whole sandwhich, salad and a dessert. I plan to fo back. Price was good, too. $8.95 and you get 1 chocolate strawberry and a slice of bread with it. Not bad for fresh food. I will take this over fried food anyday. So much on the menu that I will need to come back and try. My sandwhich was the cranberry turkey and salad was mango strawberey salad. My desert was absolutely amazeballs. Light and yummy. Line moved fast and workers were super nice with smiles on their faces. Will be coming again."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite place to go for lunch!!!
 I love the the Lobster Bisque soup....just the right amount of spice and you can definitely taste the lobster. I usually get the half and half...soup and sandwich and a nice finish to the meal is a free strawberry dipped in chocolate. The employees are helpful and friendly and the interior is bright with lots of large windows and sunlight!"}
{"text":"Today was my FIRST! visit to Café Zupas. I was placing a to go order for myself and 3 other co-workers. Very long story short'.. everyone in the serving line were rude to me. The ONLY employee who made the situation better was \"Bri\" ( even though she made \"excuses\" on why her co-workers were rude. Bri, was very helpful & attentive!
Good thing the food was good I would like to go back but, maybe I'll try a different location or send someone else to pick the order up!"}
{"text":"Ordered a chicken chipotle salad tonight after seeing the menu at my work. While the flavor was good, the portion size and the toppings were ridiculous! For a $10.00 salad the \"large size\" salad was still small and there was very little chicken or toppings. Review after review states this. You would do more business by adding more to your salads."}
{"text":"Currently my favorite place to have lunch! They have so many delicious, healthy options! Their customer service is outstanding,  they show that they appreciate their customers!"}
{"text":"First time and will keep coming back. Totally impressed by the entire staff. Great food, clean environment and good atmosphere."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service!!! Manager Chris is sarcastic and very passive aggressive/rude! Messed up my salad 5 times, offered no compensation, refused to give me his business card or upper managements name/number and and told me there was no corporate phone number which I easily got when calling another location! Argued with me in the middle of the restaurant in front of my 10 friends. My party was done eating before they got my meal right. When I finally did call the corporate number, I was told there was no one I could talk to..... ???? What? What kind of customer service is that? When I asked how I was supposed to file a complaint, the lady told me to email the email address on their website. I informed her that I did that 2 weeks prior but never got a response. She said to send another one but that was my only option. I've never heard of such a thing. Do they not want people making complaints? Seemed very odd.... Especially with a large corporation/chain."}
{"text":"When i first walked in the place looked nice. Until u basically checked out almost paying for the wrong food not to mention that i didn't even get half the food i ordered. To top it off they didn't even give me a receipt to show prof that i paid for my meal. They need to slow down and work on customer service. 
By the way the soup isn't that great and if u wanna add anything to it they charge extra"}
{"text":"Tough week trying to work with food poisoning! It's the worst! I had some soup from Cafe Zupas earlier this week and it just ripped my stomach to shreds. I loved the food there too. My stomach is still recuperating. My husband got lobster bisque (I didn't eat) and is now vomiting so on two separate occasions we got sick. I didn't think it was from the soup but for sure now we know! So, buyer beware! We will be making formal complaints because I'm sure many others have gotten sick! #bubbleguts

I called the manager and explained to them what happened and they had nothing to say but sorry and that they check the temperatures of the soups. Not much help at all! 

I will never go back to any Cafe Zupas! If I could give zero stars I would."}
{"text":"Great casual lunch place with lots of room and parking considering it is located in the busy Biltmore area. The pick-two combos are very reasonably priced and they serve a chocolate covered strawberry with your meal. Their chicken enchilada chili is very tasty."}
{"text":"I was recommended to go here and told about how awesome the soup and salad is. I was disappointed the service was subpar they did not know the difference between a half and full size on their own menu, the topping size is a very small spoonful which equates to approximately 6 to 8 small diced tomatoesfor a large salad this is insufficient. For as much as they charge and what they deliver I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"This cafe always makes me feel better if I'm down or just not quite myself.Soup is a comfort food to me and their soups are wonderful.Their salads are very imaginative and fresh.My sister turned my daughter and I on to it and we love it.The cafe is clean and the staff is great.They are very patient with first timers who are trying to learn the process of their ordering system.The lobster bisque and the vegetable chowder are to die for.Even in the Arizona heat I will still eat their soups!The portions are ample and the prices are reasonable.Hope to go again soon."}
{"text":"Yummy. Shanghai chicken salad was awesome. I love the soups too... lobster bisque.. yum. The chocolate strawberry is a nice touch too.

True it is corporate feeling but the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Great food if you are looking for a great sandwich, soup and or salad . They are really fast at making the order and they give you a free delicious chocolate covered strawberry with every meal. They also have Italian sodas !!!"}
{"text":"We have eaten at the location on Lake Mead multiple times and we're always impressed by the cleanliness, courtesy and great customer experience we had.  

Today, we ate at the Boca Park location and were extremely disappointed.  The staff on the line were dripping soup down the sides of every bowl and take-out containers and using their dirty aprons to halfway wipe them down.  Gross!  

I asked to speak to a manager because I thought someone needed to be aware and get it handled, I was told he was too busy working the line to speak to me.  I told the staff I would wait, to which they then tried to offer me 1/2 off my lunch.  Again, I told them I would wait.  It wasn't about the cost of my lunch, but the poor customer experience they had created for me and everyone else watching the disaster area they were working in.  

The manager, Christian, finally came over and nodded his head while I spoke.  I feel like he could care less and was just doing what he needed to do to get back to the line. 

To top it all off, I sit down to cold food only to find a hair in my soup.  

Needless to say, we won't be going back to this location.  I understand speed is important, but if everyone is disappointed by the time they sit down, does it matter that it was fast?"}
{"text":"Zupas it's a great place where to eat good salads. However, since some months ago they are not serving as before. I do love the kale and quinoa salad and they forget to put the quinoa or I ask for a full size salad and I get half of my plate. That salad also comes with blueberries and some times you don't see them... it looks that always they are forgetting an ingredient. I do recommend to check your order before to take it, but check all the ingredients of your meal.... then, enjoy it!"}
{"text":"My wife and I love coming to this place. Light lunch, great variety of soups, salads and sandwiches. They allow you to pick 2 like a half sandwich and a soup or a salad and a sandwich. The soups can be too salty some days. Other than that this is our go to place for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Friendly, good food and chocolate covered strawberry with your meal! They won my heart!"}
{"text":"I'm giving them 4 when they should really get 3.5; my rating is based solely on service. When I'm in the area, I tend to try whatever is around. Being as this place is new, I thought I'd give it another try while in the area shopping.

When you walk in you are immediately greeted by someone standing at the door; at least I have on both occasions. The place is generally clean and the workers are super friendly. 5 stars for that.

For a soup, sandwich, salad establishment I'm not all that impresses with the sandwiches. 

The line starts with salads and sandwiches. Moving down the line you have toppings at the second station and soup at the third (you can sample every single one of their soups). So far, I haven't sampled one that I didn't like. The fouth station is the dessert window; quite the variety to choose from. (You meal will come with either a chocolate dipped strawberry or Oreo cookie and a section of french bread).

While I only tried two different panini's, they didn't taste real (if that makes sense). I don't know if it was the sauces/spreads but, I definitely won't try those again. Their soups are rather tasty! DEFINITELY will try again; Wild Mushroom and Wisconsin Cauliflower are delish! 

As an fyi, toppings are $.69. Now, while I have NO problem paying for anything extra, I do expect to get what I pay for. Rather disappointed in the lack of cheddar I paid for to top off my soup. My next visit I may try salad only. 

This isn't my first choice for soup/salad combo's but, they're not totally off the list of options."}
{"text":"I usually go to the Zupas on Camelback where everyone is always nice and friendly. And so was this store, however the staff was so over the top and obnoxious about it I wanted to shout at them to stop and get out of my face. Let me make a damn decision on my own. And no means no! What manager is pushing them to be like this?"}
{"text":"Great friendly staff fast service. Had the Cuban sandwich it was great. Food is always fresh and tasty. Space is very clean. I will be back thanks guys!"}
{"text":"Love all their soups and salads! Wish there was more variety as far as bread/cheese to put on the sandwiches though. All the staff are very friendly. The flavor bar for drinks is super cool too."}
{"text":"Although Zupa's staff is friendly and their food is reasonably priced, I've found that a majority of their menu items are really just mediocre. Their Nuts About Berries salad is the only thing that I would come back for. It's awesome that they give you a complimentary chocolate covered strawberry and piece of bread with your meal though. On a side note, finding parking near the cafe sucks."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time,
The environment is fun, bright and the IPod charging station and wi-fi are the only thing I would come back for.
I ordered the BBQ chicken salad, it was all lettuce and literally a teaspoon (NOT tablespoon) of chicken pieces.  The toppings were incredibly small.  $8.00 for a bowl of lettuce isn't going to impress anyone.
I wanted to try the pesto chicken panini, but they only offer white bread, no other healthy or gluten free options.
I was excited to try this place but walked out VERY disappointed.  Won't be back or recommend to anyone until they get real!!"}
{"text":"Eat here at least twice a month. Cannot say enough good things about the strawberry harvest chicken salad and their Wisconsin cauliflower soup. If you are looking for a salad full of superfoods, the kale quinoa salad will not disappoint. Their pesto chicken, ultimate grilled cheese, and honey cilantro carnitas sandwiches are all winners as well. Make sure to finish your meal with the chocolate layer cake and a drink at the soda wall. Seriously am obsessed with this relatively cheap option for fresh and delicious food."}
{"text":"Great food but the portions are so small that my husband and I went out for a second dinner shortly afterward (note: both of us have a normal BMI and appetites) - I had the chicken chop salad and a bowl of soup and my husband had the Italian sub which had literally only one or two slices of meat on it. Service was great though."}
{"text":"Was tasty. Nice selection of salad dressing. parking is ok and they moved pretty quickly for a busy sunday."}
{"text":"So good, I've been back 3 times in 2 weeks!

This is a great place for fresh, homemade soups.  They also serve a variety of delicious, crisp salads, savory sandwiches and absolutely decadent-looking desserts.  I've been strong and passed on the desserts each visit.  Soup, by far is some of the best you'll ever try.  They always add a seasonal soup to the menu.  They recently changed the Swiss Onion for an incredible Butternut Squash soup.  Seriously, I think its the best I've ever had.

I love the Italian Soda bar.  You can mix your own.  WiFi stations are available.
Cool place.  Great Service.  Great Prices.  Friendly & Diverse Staff.  Delicious Food!"}
{"text":"Fresh food and a lot of delicious options, plus who doesn't like a chocolate covered strawberry with their meal?! The food is made in front of you and the to go option is quick and effecient."}
{"text":"have been here a few times and I love the fresh drinks/tea options. I also love several soups and so far my favorite salad is the cherry balsamic and the pesto chicken panini and Cuban panini are great. 

now the one gripe I have is the ordering process. after placing my order for a family of five at the beginning i then have to remember everything I ordered and repeat to the people at the end of the line who gather all the food to place on trays. very irritating especially when having a large order to repeat. they need to come up with a better system."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Lots of interesting soup, salad and sandwich choices.  Everything delicious and inexpensive."}
{"text":"Really like the soup but very disappointed with the customer service.  Ordered 3 to go orders and instead of taking my order they sent me to the other end to another cashier to take my order. And there is nobody behind us. Took about 10 minutes to get our food. As customers began to filter in after us they got there meal before us."}
{"text":"Many salad, soup, and sandwich choices. All of them made with fresh and savoury ingredients. First time eating here and have to say it was really good and the food wasn't too heavy, just the right amount to get rid of the hunger but not too much to give you that over full feeling. Prices were good as well...better to get a combo, get 2 things for around the price if you just got one thing. Employees all seemed happy to be there and all had smiles when greeting customers. All in all a good spot to hang out with friends and get some lunch."}
{"text":"This is my first time here. Very good food. Very fresh salad. Prices are reasonable. The restaurant is clean but a little loud. I would come back."}
{"text":"I was really impressed with this place! The staff is very friendly, took the time to walk us through the menu, provided recommendations, fast service and reasonably priced.

I had a half soup & salad, which were both great portions and tasty! And we had the best creme brulee...maybe even better than what you get can at a good restaurant. And they're only $2.95! 

I would, highly, recommend this place for a casual lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"I'm a healthy eater and love to come here. Sometimes it makes me feel like I'm eating a cheat meal when I'm not! Love the food and never had a problem with the staff. I have yet to try the dessert because I can never finish what I usual get which is a sandwich and a half salad. 100% recommended this place if you like soup, salads or sandwiches! 
It's mine and my boyfriends favorite date night place."}
{"text":"It was super busy for lunch on a Friday.  It reminded me of a Panera's but, much better.  I had a half lobster bisque soup and an Asian pork sandwich on soft ciabatta.  It was a first timer and it was excellent.  The chocolate dipped strawberry is a nice touch.  Nice place for lunch."}
{"text":"I'm obsessed with this place. Their salads are out of this world. They always have a seasonal soup that is to die for. The sandwiches are made on this magical bread that's toasted outside and deliciously soft when you bite in. You absolutely have to try the chicken enchilada chili. I could eat a troff of this stuff I'm not kidding."}
{"text":"I loved the Cafe Zupas in Mesa, and was excited when they opened one in Chandler. I've been to this one about 5 times, and each time I get an awkward experience from the staff, making me less likely to come back. 

The soups and salads are always good, but interacting with the staff (during dinner time) makes me not want to go here. Sometimes I get silent blank stares instead of, \"What would you like?\" Or \"can I help you decide on something?\"   At the Mesa location, I never had to recite my whole order to the cashier after ordering it up front. Can't the Chandler staff just communicate with each other to make sure that the order stays together? 

Location wise, it's on a corner across from the mall where there is always a lot of traffic, and trying to find a parking spot and then not getting run into when leaving that parking spot sometimes feels like too much effort to get a salad. 

But maybe I'll forget about the staff (hopefully they get better with customer service) and location after awhile and crave a salad/soup/bread/strawberry dinner. Will I return? Possibly."}
{"text":"O MY GUT!!!!! This place is amazing!!! Everything is fresh and customer service was awesome, I will definitely be coming back again and again and again!!! I want to try everything on the menu!!"}
{"text":"They rush you thru the whole line its very \"ANNOYING\" & they mess up on orders, I used 2 go here until they got ridiclous!!!"}
{"text":"I love Cafe Zupas! Everyone is always so nice there and the soups are delicious! Their new drink fusion bar is awesome! The teas and juice are all natural and better than most places that sell infused tea, not minding the fact they only charge $1.99 for them with unlimited refills while you dine in!  Love this place!"}
{"text":"I was really disappointed today when the \"large\" soup I ordered for takeout was only filled to about 2' from the top. The server said \"you only get two ladles- thats how it's supposed to be\" and my cashier said \"oh it needs room to move around\" (thats a good one)
Really......The place needs to either fill the container  as it should be - or get soup containers that reflect the true size of what you are purchasing. In addition the \"French baguette\" is anything but the wonderful stuff we know and love - its rather  a piece of over soft and certainly not French white bread. Although the soup was tasty, I won't be back."}
{"text":"Super yummy food.  Got a salad and a sandwich for $9.00.   I got a hot Chicken pesto panini sandwich which was so good.   Also got a chicken chipotle salad.  The dressing and glaze on the salad was delicious.  A lot of food for the money.  Nice clean atmosphere."}
{"text":"Yes yes yes!! This place is fantastic. The food is so fresh and seems relatively healthy. Their customer service is on point and the restaurant was very clean!! It's like Panera but better ;)"}
{"text":"Was really excited when a salad, sandwhich, soup shop opened near where I live. My roommate and I go there at least 2-3 times a week- they are fast and super friendly (maybe even too happy lol ) the price is really reasonable and in the combo you even get a whole sandwhich instead of the half you get at most places. The only complaint I have is that a couple of times we've gone there was no asiago croutons for my soup which was very disappointing since they are delicious!"}
{"text":"Got to give it to the owners this place is amazing! Very efficient with service and quality of food! The lobster bisque is excellent and the Cuban is tasty. They do not mess around it quality here! Just don't come on Sunday's because they are closed!"}
{"text":"I'm new to the area and have been here twice because it's a nice place. The food here is delicious. Their salads look like they'd be tasty, but I  haven't been in the mood to eat one yet. I've done the try 2 combo. Tomato basil soup is great choice and so is the enchilada soup. I just wish they would occasionally change up their soap selection (maybe they do and I just haven't seen it yet?) and maybe include something more original like broccoli cheddar. Also their brownies are the best!"}
{"text":"If you are hungry, you might not want to eat at Zupas. I order a large cobb salad and paid almost $9.00.  Instead of being a full bowl of salad, they gave me a half bowl.  I told the person working at the cash register. He told me, \"That's just the way it is\".  His attitude was indifference and he had no concern.  
      Although the salad tasted very good, I was still extremely hungry afterwards and it did nothing to satisfy my hunger.  Their portions was so small that it only teases your hungry appetite.  Zupas is not worth the money.  Their portions are way too small.  You will leave a big hungry angry bear. 
       In addition I emailed Zupas, they did not respond to my email.  This restaurant does not care about your concerns.  A simple response of concern would have been polite."}
{"text":"I had the Cuban pork and ham panini, and the chocolate mousse.  Both were the best I have ever had, and it only cost $10.  I wish I knew what they seasoned the pork with, because it is excellent.  You can pick and choose what dressings you want on your sandwich, and there are lots to choose from.  Many things on the menu look delicious, and the place is brand new and very clean."}
{"text":"Place is really good, except the bacon they put in the paninis is barely cooked and slimey. Would be five stars but they say the bacon can only be warmed inside. Unfortunately have to remove each time."}
{"text":"went in for dinner tonite. Order a sandwich and soup combo.. Sandwich was Turkey, bacon, avocado panini, and the soup I chose was Roasted Red Pepper with lobster. 

Sandwich was sliced turkey meat-like you get in the grocery store deli counter. The avocado was not slices of fresh avocado. Instead it was mashed avocado. The bacon was soft with no texture at all. 

Then there was the soup. First of all, it was lukewarm. I had to ask them to re-heat it. Maybe it is just me, but I hate the texture of roasted red pepper soup if it hasn't been run thru the chinois. IMHO, it should be run thru the chinois to give it a smooth, creamy texture. 

Just an overall disappointing visit."}
{"text":"I don't know why, but when I feel like someone is so precise in their measurement of the ingredients that they wouldn't dare give more than 7 black beans per salad or .38 ounces of soup per serving I hearken back to the scene from Casino where Ace has the two blueberry muffins and he is browbeating the cook to have an equal number of blueberries and that the cook is supposed to \"Count them out by hand\"...I don't know maybe it is just a personal thing, but I got that feeling at Zupa. In fairness the food was very good and quality, however the checkout procedure is a little mind numbing to say the least and the poor kid at the counter (because it was super busy at lunch) was a overwhelmed and slightly confused at my soup and salad. Overall Zupa's menu selection is good, the food was quality, the place was clean, they could just use a little fine tuning in the \"order to table process\" and don't be so worried about giving your guest an extra .0023 ounce of lettuce it made me feel like the cost of goods were more important than whether or not I was satisfied."}
{"text":"Fingernail in my soup tonight .Took the fingernail cutting  to the counter and all the girl said was she was sorry ?? Really ,We will not never be back ..Disgusting !!!"}
{"text":"Very fresh, good recipes, but after going a few times to make sure it wasn't a mistake, the portions are consistently SO SMALL for the price. I can literally finish a regular-sized salad in 5-6 bites. Too bad, but it's not worth the money for the portion."}
{"text":"They count the leaves in your salad. Serving is too small. Some appetizer salads are better"}
{"text":"Not bad for salads and soups. But they are counting the salad leaves. I believe mine was only like 30 leaves and lettuce are cheap. You don't get a lot for a half salad.  Appertizer salad in other restaurants are better"}
{"text":"I really liked this place! The food is good and the portions are standard. Husband did t like the broccoli cheddar soup, but my chicken tortilla was yummy! Can't go wrong w a chocolate strawberry w every meal!"}
{"text":"This place is like Panera Bread Company, but a little better to be honest....even tho there have been about 5 restaurants in last 5 years in this location, I hope this one lasts!!!
   Go for the combo, it's a TON of food! Whole sandwich and 1/2 a salad- which is huge for a \"small\" bowl of soup which is plenty! Plus a chocolate covered strawberry for dessert. I had the Turkey, artichoke, pepper sandwich-- was delish! And tried the salad of the month with pomegranate seeds, blackberries, mangos and a yogurt dressing. It was summer in my mouth! I am VERY pleased with this place, cant wait to try some of the soups. Great new restaurant, good portions, decent prices!"}
{"text":"Cafe Zupa is a perfect lunch or dinner spot when you want something relatively healthy, quick and fresh. The menu has many options for meat eaters and non meat eaters alike! 

The inside is very clean and modern looking. You order at the counter in a style similar to paradise bakery but Zupa far exceeds that. The salad options all sound delicious and I personally favor the berry citrus. The soups and sandwiches are also really good and there are plenty or options there. One of the highlights is that each meal comes with a chocolate covered strawberry for free!"}
{"text":"Let me say that I am a fan of the other Cafe Zupas at Arrowhead, Desert Ridge and Collonade. However, I have never before encountered a rude employee like Hanna. People, don't ask her while she is making your salad to omit something because she snapped and asked if we had made a modification prior and to next time let the person at the register know. Also on the Chipotle Chicken salad, she ran out of peppers and told my daughter the few tiny scraps on the bottom were all they had. Seriously? It was 2pm on a Thursday. I know they prep in advance. I saw it as being lazy and we were not worth her time to run to the back and get the peppers.I did not say anything right there because I don't want to embarrass my daughter. Our meal was good and the other employees were friendly. When I went to the register afterwards I was ignored until another employee told Hanna I was there. She then turned around from a good 12 feet away and said \" 'sup\" with a head nod. Sup? Really? And let me guess,
 that is short for \"Whats Up?\" Whatever happened to \"How can I help you?\" I asked her for a comment card and she directed me over to the wall with the screens to write a review. Well she told me Norterra was not listed and she put in Desert Ridge. I did not want my review to reflect badly for Desert Ridge so opted to not complete the survey and come here instead. I am a 47 yr old mother. Who has over 25 years in the customer service business PLUS my folks owned a restaurant. Hanna's behavior was unacceptable and rude. Chipotle, Paradise bakery and Subway are in the same area and they never get upset if you ask the person making your food to omit something(onions). Should we have went there instead?
* * *"}
{"text":"Great made to order meals at a fair price. The Tortilla soup was super and the Protien salad was too. 2 soups, 2 salads & and 2 drinks for under $24! A hit!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times. Once with my family, once with a friend, once alone and once with my sister. Every time I feel like I spent a bit too much. Also, I don't think I've ever left there feeling happy either. It's bright and noisy.  But then again, it is more of a family place. 

They do have their non-negotiable menu. It's simple, it's pretty and everything sounds good. They have their set up assembly line style. Ordering is easy. If you have any troubles, the employees in line will throw out a suggestion or two. I've tried the Crab Avocado Melt, the Turkey Bacon Avocado (I think you can tell that I like avocado) and the Asian BBQ Pork. The Crab and the Turkey were pretty good (they're paninis) but the Asian BBQ Pork is sticky and kind of a pain to eat. It is good, but I'm better off buying a Bahn Mi. Bahn Mis are usually cheaper too. I haven't tried their salads. They didn't seem interesting enough for me. Their soups are never hot, they're always this awkward warm temperature. I'm not sure if they could microwave them, but if I'm paying $7.99 for soup and a sandwich, I'd expect the food to be adequate. I've tried the Lobster Bisque which isn't bad. I've also had their Swiss Onion Soup that's a temporary item. It was good. Another thing is that their soup station was messy. I saw the assembly food line workers chatting amongst themselves, so I'm pretty sure they had time to at least wipe it down. 

With the $7.99 combo, it comes with a slice of cold bread loaf and a chocolate dipped strawberry. Sexy, huh?
Yeah, I guess it could be sexy... Unless you think fruit bugs and leaves are sexy. (Not judging if you are!)
The first issue I had with the strawberries is that there were leaves MELTED IN WITH THE CHOCOLATE. Honestly, how could you miss that?  How can you expect your customers to NOT notice it? Luckily that time, I brought it up and they switched it out. Easy. Done. I didn't even have to ask them to switch it out.
Tonight was another story. After my sister ate her strawberries, she started freaking out because a bug that crawled out of the bag. It was a tiny bug. Like the kinds you find with the berries you didn't wash yet. First, I brought the bag to the cashier. I asked if they wash the berries or if they even inspect them or whatever. She's like, \"Yeah, we wash them. Sorry about that.\" in the most \"omg, it's late and I just want to get out of here. It's not my fault you have issues.\" attitude ever.  Didn't offer if I want to talk to the manager or anything. That was a problem for me. I'm like, \"okay, thanks I guess.\"  I waited for a bit and waited until a busser came by. I told her what happened and she brought out Joe, the manager. Joe explained to me that it's corporate policy that the berries come pre-washed. He said the chocolate wouldn't stick to it otherwise. He then said they would keep an extra eye out when they inspect it in the morning. He offered another dessert or another strawberry, which was nice. We didn't take it, we were a bit grossed out by the bug. 

Yeah, I can say (with a lot of confidence) that we won't be returning there. Ever. Not even if you paid for my meal. If I wanted soup or anything like what they have, Panera Bread is down the street and Sweet Tomatoes isn't far from there either.  If you do go, just watch out for bugs!"}
{"text":"So my friend had told me about Cafe Zupas because of the Lobster Bisque soup. I checked it out at the Lake Mead location and the food options and pricing immediately made me think of Panera Bread. The soup was good but not better than my beloved Broccoli Cheddar soup in a Sourdough bread bowl at Panera. For that reason alone I was likely to choose Panera Bread if given the choice in the future.

However upon visiting this new location I think Zupas now has the edge. The food options are great. Just ordered a Try 2 combo and was able to get a whole Turkey Spinach Artichoke sandwich and a half salad of Glazed Chicken Chipotle. It came with a side of bread and a chocolate covered strawberry. The strawberry is a wonderful little addon that Panera does not do. Also this Rainbow location has House Made Drink Infusions that are lightly sweetened with Raw Honey and a much healthier alternative to soda or sweet tea. I'm inspired to recreate these at home and drop soda out of my diet. 

This place gets bonus points for all the fresh produce, local dairy, and overall healthy ingredients. Menu is way easier to navigate than Panera as well. New favorite cafe and I will be spreading the word."}
{"text":"Forget reading the review... go to this place to taste the best soups!! Comparing to Wild flower bread co and Paradise bakery, this place is way way ......... way better! 

Their soups are yummiest best. They make unique dressings for their salads which gives a wonderful taste. We had strawberry salad and panini and soup combo. You will be licking till the last drop of the soup in the bowl. They have a wide variety of salads too. Though the cost is may be a notch higher that other places, but its worth the taste."}
{"text":"This place is close to my work and after seeing it a few times I decided to go check it out. I have to say I was drawn to it because I'm Polish and zupa = soup. Cafe Soup! Why not, I'm down!

They have a great combo deal that I'll always get for lunch. You can pick two choices from either half a salad, half a cup of soup, or a sandwich. And then you go on down the line and run into their giant delicious deserts and you realize you're in heaven! Big thick brownies and giant slices of heavenly looking cake. And as a bonus even if you don't get a desert they give everyone a chocolate dipped strawberry as a small treat. That makes me love them all the more really.

I have to say that I haven't sampled all of their soups and sandwiches but from what I have tried I have to say the mushroom bisque is to die for and if you love grilled cheese you HAVE to try the Ultimate Grilled Cheese sandwich. 

The service is fast, they have many people working behind the counter so you never get stuck waiting and waiting and waiting for your food to be prepared. It's a great choice when you need something quick and don't want to resort to a fast food drive through. 

All in all Cafe Zupas is one of my staples if I'm having a lazy lunch day and want something delicious!"}
{"text":"Soo bomb! Their sandwiches, soups and salads! You can choose one of each or two of something or just one item. Soups abd salads come with a baguette and all orders come with a chocolate dipped strawberry.Yumm. They also have a few desserts to choose from. Very laid back atmosphere great for lunch or dinner. Prices are great."}
{"text":"I haven't seen a Zupas since I moved from the western United States so I was excited when I stumbled upon this location.  I had several above average dining experiences at Zupas with friends while going to school in Utah, but that was many moons ago.  I was wrong to assume that it would be just as I remembered it.  Let's just say, either my palate has changed dramatically or this place has gone downhill.  I'm going to venture that my poor experience here has more to do with the latter.  Like other reviewers, this place is trying too hard to be cool, trendy, fresh, healthy, whatever.  It wasn't like that in the past, but I guess in recent years this chain has been trying to reinvent itself to appeal to a certain audience.  The music is so loud that it's just annoying.  I did not have to wait in line since the place was surprisingly empty at 7:00pm on a Friday night.  I ordered the half soup/half salad combo with lobster bisque and strawberry harvest chicken salad.  I love lobster bisque but there was something very amiss with this bowl of soup.  First of all it was way too salty.  Secondly, the texture was all wrong.  The base was was not smooth and velvety as it should have been.  Maybe it wasn't pureed enough or maybe the cream had started to separate from being in an overly hot steam tray.  Whatever the deal, the consistency was off, making it rather unappealing.  The French baguette that comes with it was nothing more than a generic bakery dinner roll.  I will say the salad, albeit boring, was still the best part of this meal.  Thank god the greens weren't overdressed.  The meal comes with a chocolate covered strawberry, which was always a nice little treat I looked forward to, but on this particular night I had to pass.  The strawberry was far from ripe to the point of being inedible.  Cover that sh*t in chocolate all you want, it's not going to make it better.  Okay, the last part of the meal was a rocky road brownie and I will admit it was good, but not good enough to give this place more stars."}
{"text":"I went to cafe zupas yesterday for takeout soup. I ordered three large soups to go for $22.00 and they only filled the cups half way! I asked the teen girl why she wasn't filling up the bowls all the way and she said only two spoons full for a bowl. At over $6 dollars a bowl they should fill it up. PASS. Not for me again"}
{"text":"love coming here; i was sad to find out my favorite worker diego was not working here anymore. hence the 5 stars. he always made my salads the way i love them and made my experience so great. really gonna miss you diego. 

p.s. panera bread is better."}
{"text":"The sandwiches here are really good and the soups are to but the plates look a little dated ... They could atleast get new ones there only plastic"}
{"text":"Ladies, be aware of Male employees in Ladies Bathroom...

My wife and I took our daughter to this location for lunch outing.  Before we were going to leave the restaurant, she went to use the ladies room.  When she came out, she had this terrified look on her face.  I asked her what happened and she said that a male employee walked into the Women's bathroom and started going to each stall and fill-up the TP container.  I asked her is he was aware if anyone was in the bathroom.  She said that the lady who was using the stall next to her, thinking that he was a female employee, voiced that the TP container is empty.  He grabbed one and passed it to her OVER THE STALL DOOR and said \"Here you go\".

I spoke to the manager and although there were at least 4 other female employees behind the counter for various posts, he said that the guy was the only available person and he was doing his job and didn't realize that someone was in there.  I asked about handing the TP over the door to another person, and he started making excuses.

I should have called the cops and made a scene.

All in all, an embarrassing situation for us and a terrible dining experience."}
{"text":"Great food for the price, decent quality. A quicker version of Sweet Tomatoes without having to serve yourself. A step below Panera in terms of quality, but still a valid cheaper option! Great customer service and expansive menu options."}
{"text":"i would give a happy 5 stars but the only thing that is a complete negative is the children's menu.  your child's option from the kids menu is 2 warmed up chicken tenders + about 8 grapes and some canned mandarin oranges OR grilled cheese (both my kids dislike the panini style bread used) + the fruit listed above OR a tiny half cup of soup.  no other options on the children's menu.  where are the fresh sandwich options for kids?  how about a little more variety for the little ones??  we love coming as a family, but the kids are bored with the sad kids menu choices."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely terrible. I was craving a full salad and I hoped Cafe Zupas would fulfill my craving. However the portioning sizes are not reasonable if you are hungry. I asked for more lettuce in my salad and the employees rudely said that my request for more lettuce was not possible. I ordered the chipotle chicken salad and I did not want any tomatoes or avocado. I told the employee making my salad that I didn't and she put tomatoes on it anyways, so I had to repeat my request and she then acted annoyed. Then I got to the cash register to pay and the machine to pay was broke and I tried to swipe my card and she told me the machine was broken as if knew this and acted as if I was stupid. To top it all off I sit down to eat my tiny salad and I come to find a hair in it. This is probably because none of the employees were wearing hairnets. I took it back up to the counter expecting an employee to say sorry or give me a discount or something and instead I got a glare from the employee who said \"I guess we'll remake it.\" In addition to the horrible customer service and the toddler sized portions the place was an absolute mess, food all over the tables and the floor and the drink bar was a mess. I will not be going here again."}
{"text":"What kind of restaurant doesn't have Caesar Dressing or Chicken Breast? Other than that, my sandwich and salad were good once I could find something on the menu that fits my tastes."}
{"text":"The food is so fresh and so good! The enchilada soup and the cauliflower soup are very tasty. You can't go wrong with a restaurant that gives you a chocolate covered strawberry!"}
{"text":"Unsanitary!  I wish I would have read the previous reviews (cockroach etc) as that would have saved us from one of the worst food experiences I've had in a long long time.  We ordered a chicken panini (in which they got it wrong and used ham) a soup which was so salty that it was inedible and finally a salad which came complete with a long blonde hair of one of the workers (we both have black hair). After showing the hair the only response I got was a refund of just the salad.  Please avoid this as there are much better options in Desert Ridge.  Even paradise bakery is a much better option."}
{"text":"I thought this place was going to be obnoxious and/or complicated on first site, but once I actually got my butt inside, and looked at the menu it was evident that it's not that complicated, expensive, obnoxious atmosphere, or stingy on the servings. Pretty much whatever you order will be delicious and I'm a total sucker for those chocolate covered strawberries. These guys just totally nailed it and I always look for excuses to go. It's really different from pretty much any other place, like a combination of Pita Jungle and Panera, but way better than both combined I think. Good balance between trendy and comfortable."}
{"text":"My only complaint is that they don't have locations in Colorado! This place is great!! Very fresh with great choices! I only wish I could come back but I don't live near one :-( I did a sandwich/salad combo and it was amazing.!!!"}
{"text":"Mouthwatering deliciousness!  I had this a few months ago for one of our company meetings.  Mind you I live in Tucson, not Phoenix but I dream of these sandwiches.  The Italian Club is perfection and the soups and salads are great!  I will continue to return on every trip I make to PHX!"}
{"text":"I Absolutely love cafe Zupas! It is one of my favorite places to eat. I know the dishes can't be THAT healthy but the freshness convinces your mind that it is. 

My favorites are the glazed chicken chipotle salad, the asparagus soup (that they brought out for a limited time in the spring), and the herbed chicken bacon avocado sandwich (although I ask for it to be made into a panini). 

They give you a complimentary slice of french baguette and a chocolate covered strawberry (which is obviously the real reason why anyone goes to Zupas. complimentary chocolate covered strawberry, I'm there!). Which is why I was a little bit bummed out the last time I went on Friday August 14th, they were out of fudge and could only gave you a regular strawberry (which is still great, but it's not what I had grown to expect from one of my favorite neighborhood restaurants)!

Also, if you go near closing time, whenever they have any extra desserts you can get them for half off! Which is amazing, because the desserts are well worth it at full price!"}
{"text":"The Food was fresh, healthy and filling. I have been there three times since they opened.  Each Time, I give the food five stars. However,  everytime after I order, at each station, I have to constantly repeat my orders back to the workers and this is very ANNOYING when you have ordered 3-4 meals \"Yes, I ordered two kids meal, one with chicken strip, and fruit cup, and one with soup and fruit cup, and I ordered the Italian club with soup, and my husband ordered Pulled pork, and etc\"... at each station.... Yes, I did this everytime I stopped in.  

Maybe a suggestion is to do what Einstein does, is take your order at the first register (install a register at the order counter maybe?) and cash you out at the end, this way, employees aren't asking you at every station \"what did you order?\" and they have some sort of direction in the back Unfortunately when you are hungry and cranky already by the third time an employee ask you what you ordered, I want to reach over the counter and pick up my orders myself, and move it to cash out.  The flow needs a bit more streamlining but otherwise I am still a fan of the food.

5 stars for the food becuase I do like light meals, not huge portion, so its perfect for me.
3 stars for the lack of organization behind the counters but good efforts."}
{"text":"Stopped at Zupas today after shopping in nearby center.  I have been looking for a good soup, salad, sand. place for awhile and never been here.  AND, I won't be back.  I ordered the half salad half soup.  I almost had four small pieces of chicken in my salad,(smaller than a nickel, and seemed to be out of a can? not fresh cooked?) and the  rest of the ingredients did not taste fresh nor was there an abundance of anything but lettuce greens, which are very cheap to serve, so this manager is making up $$$ by skimping on the good stuff in my opinion.  The buttermilk dressing was like water.  The Lobster bisque was tasty, a little spicier than traditional bisque, and again I think I spotted a few microscopic pieces of lobster floating around in there with all the celery.  The one thing they did do well was their customer service and friendliness.  5 stars for that.  I don't understand who is rating this place as high as three or more stars.  Sadly this place has the potential to succeed but won't if they keep short changing their customers on the food."}
{"text":"Hands up for this place!!! My husband & I come here all the time. The customer service is great! Staff is wonderful, never had a bad experience since they have opened. Even on opening day we were treated really nice & with the upmost respect! I recommend the Mango Berry Salad. I could never get tired of it!! Ofcourse we will continue to come here!! Enjoy everyone:)"}
{"text":"So good! Their sandwiches were amazing I got the pesto chicken sandwich I highly recommend. I also got the glazed chicken chipotle salad, I would tell them easy on the sauce cause mine was drenched but otherwise very good! Mixed berry creme brûlée is amazing as well. They serve bread and a chocolate strawberry with every meal. They also have Italian sofa flavor pumps and an iPod/iPhone charging station. Very nice upscale place."}
{"text":"First went to Zupas when we were in Utah....then they opened here in Phoenix.  I was so excited.....and surely not disappointed. I love their salads and the chocolate covered strawberry they give with every meal. The only suggestion I would have is that they make some deserts without nuts in them....my daughter is allergic so she has to miss out on them.
They are opening in Dana Park the end of November....can't wait as that is really close to my house!"}
{"text":"Simple and fresh soups, sandwich, salad. Bold flavors, happy employees. The ordering gets confusing with more than one person because you have to repeat your order multiple times down the the line."}
{"text":"Good soups and sandwiches.  Great, friendly staff. Really liked the lobster curry. Avocado crab melt is great.   Yucatan chicken chipotle salad was tasty. A yummy alternative.  Good upscale fast lunch."}
{"text":"This place is fine. It's new, so it's relatively well kept. There was a small puddle near the door that we had to walk around, but that doesn't really affect how I feel about the restaurant. I'm sure they were working on cleaning it up or something.

The first time I went, I got the food to go, and they were falling behind on the order so I got a free drink while I waited. They also lost part of my order at some point, and started serving up a new soup and making a new sandwich before they found it, so I got a free soup out of it. My boyfriend got the chipotle chicken salad and he loves it. He orders it every time. We got sandwiches that were pretty good, and the cauliflower soup was great.

The second time was with my mother-in-law, and she was disappointed. She felt that they branded themselves as something of a fresh, healthy place, and as a diabetic, she didn't like that they didn't have any bread alternatives. She got a tomato soup, and she said it was really sweet, so we all tried a bite. It was more butternut squash than anything, with maybe a hint of tomato. It wasn't what she was going for with ordering a tomato soup, so with that on top of the lack of diabetic-friendly options, she was left really disappointed. I forget what I ordered, but I had an okay experience.

This is the third time we've been to Zupas, and it has again just been okay. We ordered two salads to go. My boyfriend again loved the chipotle chicken salad. I ordered the garden chicken chop, but the ranch wasn't ready, so they offered chipotle ranch or herb vinaigrette instead. I opted for the vinaigrette thinking \"herb\" meant earthy and savory, it ended up being very, very sweet. My salad also barely had any toppings, so I'm fairly unsatisfied. Overall, again, it's an okay place. I think I'd prefer Paradise Bakery/Panera."}
{"text":"Do not come here for their salads! They are very small, and the toppings are extremely meager. There was around only an ounce of chicken. I could have easily confused it with a side salad. The wait time was also almost 45 minutes for 8 orders, which is very inconvenient if you take into consideration that they don't do pick-up orders from 11am to 2 pm!"}
{"text":"The Zupas on Stephanie and Sunset has very friendly employees.  The Glazed Chicken Salad was amazing great mixture of vegetables and dressing.  Excelent flavor as well as the amount.  The reason for giving Zupas only four stars is the soup.  I ordered the Clam Chowder I was expecting a normal clam chowder.  This clam chowder was watered down, very little,clam or potatoes.  I would suggest they not water down their soups.  I Will not be ordering one again...but the salad was on point."}
{"text":"Professional, friendly staff! I had such a great customer experience from each staff member! I will definitely return again - can't get enough of those chocolate strawberries and paninis"}
{"text":"Wonderful mean! So good and so fresh. I could come back over and over and have something different. There are hundreds of options and I can customize each of them!  Exposition styleish kitchen means I can watch them make everything in my meal. The soups are great, I had tomatoes basil and it had great flavor and not over salted. Were excited to come back! Any excuse will do. Plus they are fast and super friendly! Great stop for a long lunch, a quick bit, or grab and go."}
{"text":"I've been here multiple time and the food is fantastic! Only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars is because it's a bit too loud in there.. The music is blasting and everyone in the dinning room seems to be yelling, fighting to be heard. other than so, I love coming here!"}
{"text":"What a disappointment. 
I went in with my husband and got the mangoberry salad and the turkey bacon sandwich. The salad normally comes with mangos strawberries and blue berries and cinnamon almonds. However, I substituted the berries on my salad for more of the cinnamon almonds. As I was checking out I asked them if it normally comes with oranges they said no, and offered to remove the oranges. I didn't want to be an inconvience because they were busy so instead I told them I will pick them out myself but asked if it still had the mangos because I didn't see any and they said yes. We sat on the patio and Began to eat I opened up my sandwich and one half had avocado the other slice literally hardly had any. So my husband asked for some. I started mixing my salad and picked out the oranges and there were no mangos and three slices of strawberries. I could not have been more irritated with this place. The lack of connunication and the assembly line does not work in their favor! Can we also talk about how stingy this place is! Get it together!"}
{"text":"Fresh food, great salads and soup, great attitude from their staff. Their catering is excellent and their food is outstanding."}
{"text":"Without a doubt- Cafe Zupas is one of my favorite places to grab an affordable and hearty meal! I always get the \"Try 2\" combo. You pick 2 of the following: FULL- sized sandwich, a soup, or a salad.

I'm really impressed with how much food you get for the price. The serving sizes are good and you receive a roll and a delicious chocolate-covered strawberry with every purchase! The Italian soda bar and electronic device charging stations are a very nice touch as well.  The food is consistent every time I go back. I cannot recommend the pesto chicken panini and the Wisconsin Cauliflower soup enough!

It's also worth mentioning that this location had very friendly workers and the store was very clean. Paradise bakery and Panera should be taking notes about all the things this place does right!"}
{"text":"Food is just ok. The mango berry salad is the best. There's a combo you can get that is a sandwich or half salad or half soup. You pick two. But this \"combo\" does NOT come with either a drink or chips. As for the service there's so many employees and they're all yelling out different things at the same time making it a very confusing and overwhelming experience while ordering. Go to panera bread for better food and better experience."}
{"text":"Sad to even give this facility one star... HORRIBLE customer service, the dishes were filthy, and they have unqualified management. I asked them about the dirty bowl so they came back and slammed a to go container of soup on the table and walked away. Don't go here, I will no longer be doing business with them."}
{"text":"So after reading the Yelp reviews I had my expectations set for Nordstrom's Cafe - not quite there, although cheaper, but better than Panera. I liked the selection of sandwiches and soups offered but the food was mediocre. I had the lobster bisque and crab avocado melt. The lobster bisque was 'meh'... a thick flour roux base reminiscent of what you would expect from clam chowder at a street vendor in San Franscisco. Not a huge lobster flavor and not refined by any means.  

The crab avacado melt had the potential to be very good, I mean crab and avacado how can you go wrong, but the bacon overpowered the delicate flavor of the crab. I love bacon, but this was not the time nor the place for bacon to bully it's way in. Other than that the sandwich was good for the price. 

This place was packed with the lunch crowd, there was a line out the door. The restaurant had a very cafeteria like feel to it, and it was very loud, again the acoustics left something to be desired."}
{"text":"My family loves Zuppas. The soup and salad and sandwiches are all amazing with great selections. We were first introduced to Zuppas in Park City, and the only reason I am rating this one 4 stars and not 5 is because the chocolate covered strawberries are weak at this location. The one in Park City gives you normal sized strawberries not little wimpy ones!! Up your strawberry game :)"}
{"text":"I will not return, and here's why:  I was becoming a regular customer as they seemed fresher/healthier than the average fast-food restaurant.  They had a couple slip-ups prior to my last evening, very dry chicken on salads (complaint by me and my mom's meal), a bacon issue, and then another day I ordered soup/salad combo and they forgot to put the chicken on my salad. When I went up to show them, they took their time, while my other food was sitting on the table with no-one to watch it.  I was also charged one day incorrectly at the register, and luckily caught it, in which he refunded the amount.  Here's the clincher:  One evening I went in approx. 7:40pm, as I work later, and the manager who was first on line behind the food counter asked if I would be eating in or taking out.  I said that I would like to eat in, (it's 110 degrees out and I still had errands).  He said that I couldn't eat in as they were having an employee meeting at 8pm and I wouldn't be able to.  I said, don't you close at 9pm?  He said there was a sign on the door.  I went to look at it, and it was a white piece of paper with wrinkled corners taped to side and not something I would have really noticed.  Most professional businesses will always have their meetings prior or after hours, never affecting their main customer hours.  The worst part of it was the way I was talked to, and then I got angry and came back and asked for the corporate number.  He stated, there wasn't one and I could find the email online.  As I left, he and another co-worker laughed and talked about it. I felt like I was back in middle school.  I  can put up with an occasional dry chicken, etc., but not being laughed at or treated poorly.  I would have probably only taken 15 minutes to eat.  Needless to say, I wrote a very civil letter to their corporate customer service email, especially having restaurant experience in my past (my mom owned an excellent restaurant), telling them in detail what happened.  Wouldn't you know, I received \"no\" response.  Considering the restaurant success rate, I would think they would have cared a little more.  Well, there's lot's more to choose from!"}
{"text":"This place is heads and shoulders above Panera.

The sandwiches, soups, and salads are all amazing (haven't yet had a dessert, so no comment there).

However, enough with the ridiculously fake and manufactured \"thanks for coming in today\". I keep looking around for Jennifer Aniston and her 35 pieces of flare. I want to vomit all over your creme bruelees every time I hear that phrase in line (which is at least two dozen times per visit)."}
{"text":"I waited a few weeks after the grand opening to have my first try of this Nevada location. I remember when the first one opened in UT when I was in college.

The service is unreal at this location, everyone is all smiles and so friendly. It makes for a great experience. The food is always delicious and there are so many more choices than I remember.

So glad they came to Vegas!"}
{"text":"This is the perfect place to go on a cold winter night. It was my 1st time in the restaurant and surly not the last one! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"The food is super good but you literally get the tiniest portions of the toppings on your salad and if you want a good amount you pay for it like you could at least try and make the experience enjoyable"}
{"text":"Do NOT come here unless you wish to be annoyed! 
After we were asked no less than 5 times what we wanted to order (all girls behind counter are extremely busy chatting with one another and not listening to our order of 2 chicken pesto sandwiches), we were told they only had enough for one sandwich. 
So we ordered 1 chicken pesto and one California turkey.
Waited in their line to finally be able to pay where we were then  told they couldn't even make our 1 chicken pesto!
Get it together! Ordering here is ALWAYS an ordeal. Ask for no sprouts and they'll still be on your sandwich. (A previous experience.) Unless you can \"break the code\" and actually get through to one of the talking girls behind the counter, you are ordering at your own risk! Good Luck! We left."}
{"text":"I are here twice and I love it! First time I took out and I only waited about 15 minutes for my food. We got the combo of soup + sandwich. First time I got the crab avocado melt which was awesome and the clam chowder. We also got the Creme brûlée desert and it was good as well; kind of sweet. The second time I ate in and got their chicken pesto which was amazing! They also give you free chocolate covered strawberries :) oh and there is free wifi!"}
{"text":"I work right by this place and go as often as possible - it is amazing!!!  I'm a veggie hater, but their Wisconsin Cauliflower soup has made me love cauliflower!!!  I also love the Honey Bacon Club sandwich and have tried their deserts - this place rules!  Only con is that they are closed on Sundays, which is ridiculous, this isn't the bible belt for pete's sake!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed eating here yesterday. Lots of space to sit and eat. The good was fresh and very filling! The staff was friendly and attentive. I'll definitely be back"}
{"text":"It was ok...... I would much rather go to Paradise Bakery or Crackers and Co. I ordered the lobster Thai curry soup that says it comes with fresh lobster.... I didn't see ANY in there. It was more like a watery potato curry. I also had a club sandwich which was pretty good, there wasnt much meat though. The place was packed and couldn't even find someone to wipe down our table for us.... Like I said, it was ok."}
{"text":"Decided to try Zupas Avondale location out with my family for the first time. Well hate to bash the place but I ordered my sandwich and asked for certain items not be added. The girl making our food was very rude and just kept rolling her eyes as if I was a bother. Anyhow I finally get my food and it had everything I asked not to be added, added to my sandwich. I take up my sandwich an let her know that I asked for these items not to be added I also let her know that I had allergies to these items. She rolled her eyes yet again then flicked her hand at me and said I can't take that from you, I'll make you another one. I mean I understand that she couldn't take back the sandwich but come on now I'm a paying customer show some good customer service! If she's unhappy with her job then quit! So I get my new made sandwich brought to me and as I'm eating it there was a long hair in my cilantro sauce! Like wow! I was done at this point! I will never go back again! If you want bad customer service and hair in your food then look no further cause this is the place to go! Honestly ZERO STARS but Yelp is making me add a star."}
{"text":"We had lunch catered to us from this location today and inside the tub of the tomato soup was a giant...worn and  clearly used... metal scrubbing pad used for cleaning pots and pans. Absolutely disgusting and unsafe. Their response? Sent us another tub of the disgusting soup... likely from the same pan.... If you care about your health don't go here!!!"}
{"text":"Been there 2 more times, all I can say is this place fully deserves 5 stars. Great food, great quality, and outstanding customer service."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Food is fresh and delicious. Staff is helpful and nice. The whole place feels very clean. I recommend the Garden Chop Salad and chocolate mousse cake. Every order comes with a chocolate dipped strawberry. My new favorite place in chandler fashion center."}
{"text":"And now its bad here too. Ordered a chicken ceasar salad with no red peppers.  The girl threw peppers on it and we told her we said no red peppers. So what does she do, pick them off right in front of us. So disgusting! Wow. Not coming back."}
{"text":"Let me start out by saying I love Zupas and the arrowhead location is a 5 star!!! I was super excited when the Avondale location opened up. My favorite soup that we frequently made the trip to the arrowhead location for is the garden chowder, it is sooooo yummy! 

I sent my husband to the new Avondale location for my favorite soup after getting my wisdom teeth pulled and I'm not sure what the hell he came home with!! It looked like the garden chowder, with the exception of the 2inch chunks of tomatoes! It was also spicy as shit! My husband got all the way home with the to go order and I couldn't eat it, it caused us an extra trip out at night and a wasted 8 bucks!! I figured this was a one time mistake. The next day we went there for lunch and I asked for a sample of the garden chowder and was told they do not offer samples... We left. (Wisdom teeth removal requires lots of soup eating!) today we went back and I was hoping third time would be a charm and wanted to give one last chance to the Avondale location....Today was a damn nightmare, if I wasn't so hungry and irritable I would have spoken to the manager.  I asked for a sample again, and was given one this time! Except it was literally two drips into the taster cup, not even enough that it would drip out into my mouth! What the hell? So a 'taster' that I coudn't 'taste'??? Really?? I ordered the soup anyways (cauliflower). I ordered a large to go, the girl filled my cup half way up and put a lid on it, I asked for her to put a little more in the cup and she told me 'no'. No??? Really?? I proceed to the counter to pay and told them to hold the strawberry, I cannot have seeds because of having teeth removed and asked for a second thing of bread to soak in my soup, and stated 'I will pay extra'. Again... I was told 'No'. I was so furious I almost just walked out. Someone, manager, owner, PLEASE get your staff in line! I love Zupas but your staff are KILLING this location!!! 

as a side note, your salad maker is reusing her bowls more often then not.... It's disgusting and could cause an allergy interaction.... 

Zupas, you will not lose my business, Arrowhead location is amazing! The food and customer service for arrowhead makes it the best place to eat. Avondale needs to do some training with the arrowhead location. I will never return to the Avondale location!"}
{"text":"We are from Texas and found this place by just driving by.  The soups and salads were very good.  For me the portion size was more than I could eat. Will return the next time we are in town."}
{"text":"Food was good.service was average .my girlfriend loved it more than I did .I could see my self eating there once a month"}
{"text":"The reviews definitely tells me there is something wrong with customer service and they are much similar to Lenny's Burgers in Glendale, AZ.  They will definitely cheat you no matter what and charge you for a pile of leftover food whether you like it or not.  How are they still in business!  Who would pay extra for food that they did not put there in the first place!  I really hope the County Health Department shuts them down soon.  There are much decent better places nearby except Sweet Tomatoes that will serve you plenty at a great price similar to this darn place."}
{"text":"Thoroughly grossed out. I had eaten here a few times and it was OK until last week. I ordered a half salad half sandwich. First bite into my sandwich I pulled out a LONG BLACK HAIR from the middle of the meat. Like 6 inches long . I have short blonde hair, so it definitely wasn't mine. I was incredibly disgusted and threw out the entire lunch. This did it for me, won't be going back."}
{"text":"Actually this review is for the new Chandler location.  Clean location with great service.  We had amazing salads.  The kids meals were good and came with a chocolate strawberry.  The sandwiches are tasty but TINY.  Great brownies.  No 5 star because of puny sandwich.  Definitely worth a visit for salads and kids meals."}
{"text":"Place looked nice and everyone was friendly. This was my first visit. I got a soup and sandwich. There are three soup container sizes so I picked the middle one, expecting the soup to fill it. Nope. It was once scoop of soup, about 3/4 full-22 spoonfuls to be exact. It was tasty though. The sandwich was quite small. I guess the pictures on the wall that are 20x30 made me think I'd get something bigger-my bad. It was also tasty but the meat was sliced like the cheap packaged type. I can't certainly don't know but that's what it felt like.
Overall, for $9+ I was disappointed in the portions. I guess, comparatively, a sub sandwich, even at Subway, if you are into that, would have been more food for less."}
{"text":"Honey bacon club + chipotle pulled pork salad may be my favorite restaurant duo ever!"}
{"text":"mmmmmm yes the Lobster Bisque soup is a must here!!! Everyone is so fun and friendly. All the food looks and tastes very fresh. I am so happy that I found this place and it's near work ;)"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places for fast sandwiches salad soup combo.   Price has gone up but for $8.79 you can choose any 2: whole sandwich, salad, or soup.  They have a wide variety to choose from and it always taste good and consistent.   Only reason I give it a 4 star is location and they don't open on Sundays."}
{"text":"Yesterday was my first time trying Cafe Zupas and now I'm here again; I'm hooked! This place is a gem. Everything is fresh and absolutely delicious. The first day I had The Ultimate Grilled Cheese with the Strawberry Harvest Chicken salad and today I had the Crab Avocado Melt with the Kale and Quinoa salad. These combos came with one chocolate coated strawberry as well as a bread roll. I can't explain the explosion you get in your mouth with every bite. The sandwiches are light and honestly if you get a half salad (as I did) you'll be full after eating, maybe even with left over. The salads aren't too saucy and the greens are crisp. I also tried the strawberry lemonade, yum! Please try this place :)"}
{"text":"Ordered a turkey bacon sandwich .very disappointed . One thin piece of turkey and 2 little bacon pieces. Maybe the soup is good"}
{"text":"I love their food. It's one of my favorite places..  but I found a hair in my salad :( 
I think they should probably wear hats or a hairnet.. will definitely still eat here until it happens again."}
{"text":"This place is simply fantastic.  It used to be a once in while treat for my wife and me, since the nearest location was all the way over on Eastern, but once they opened up this location, we were done for.

The food quality is always fresh and everything tastes wonderful.  With the introduction of their new salads, they have truly pushed things to the next level.   The Asian Citrus Chicken salad, the MangoBerry, and the balsamic salads are my favorites.  For soups, the Chicken chili, and especially the Chicken Tortilla, are amazing.

The only issue we've ever encountered is when there are more guys working behind the counter.  For some reason, they are never as efficient and quick as when it's an all  girl staff.  My wife swears that this is because women multi-task better and, well, that's not something I'm willing to argue.  Even when it's not at its best, the service is still leaps and bounds better than most places.

The desserts are also tasty.  The creme brulee, while not being REAL creme brulee, is still a nice treat.  The dessert bars are always tempting but, unfortunately, they all contain nuts.  So if you're one of those poor suckers like me who can't have nuts, you're SOL for most of the desserts.  And, of course, the chocolate covered strawberries are a perfect after dinner sweet.

There's enough variety here that I feel like I could eat here every night of the week.  Combined with the smiling employees and the reasonable prices, this place will always be a win in my book."}
{"text":"I love Zupa's! Their cauliflower soup is amazing! Prices are a little higher than I like, but I still eat there!"}
{"text":"Amazing fresh food. I had ordered the veggie sandwich and tomato soup. It was delicious and super tasty. You could actually feel the freshness in the food they serve. The chocolate covered strawberry was an added bonus and sweet surprise!"}
{"text":"Really delicious lots of selection we love this place 

Will be back for sure! 

The veggie quinoa soup was good but needed more salt. Easy fix. 

Great panini.

:)"}
{"text":"I can't say enough wonderful things about this place. Let's start off with the delicious selection of salads and soup. I just can never make up my mind on what to order. Nothing has ever been a disappointment, as the next thing I try is always better than the last. Desserts are super, and don't forget to try out the italian soda bar. Too much fun, I love the iced tea with a pump of raspberry. yum."}
{"text":"This place is incredible. Get the Asian BBQ sandwich and the Cauliflower soup. They are excellent. The staff is so friendly and the place is so clean! I could go on and on...only positive comments for this place."}
{"text":"This place blows every other sandwich place out of the water . It's bright with a lot of natural light and light colors. There's a place to charge your phone , which is a huge plus. The place is very clean and everyone is very friendly ! The food is absolutely amazing. I would 100% be back. Most likely going to be a regular at this location. They gave us a chocolate covered strawberry with our order as well. Love it"}
{"text":"The bessst Salads & Soups in Las Vegas! Very friendly service and a young man named Chris was very helpful and hard working!"}
{"text":"The food is very good. I usually do a panini and a soup. The bisque is awesome, as is the tortilla soup.

What turns me off from here is the customer service. I know that employing young people is hard, and sometimes they don't give the best service. However they seriously need some retraining. They have such awful demeanor; they've been so rude to me the last few times I've been there with no regard to how they make customers feel. 

If they weren't so awful to me I might go back, but I'm not so sure I want to."}
{"text":"The food is great and hearty as well as fresh. The staff is incredibly friendly which is rare to find! We has the mushroom soup and it was delicious. Great place to go especially heading into this fall/winter weather. They are very generous when it comes to letting you sample to make sure you are getting what you want."}
{"text":"I tried it for the first time this past Tuesday, and I was very very impressed. I got their Pesto Chicken sandwich and the Lobster Bisque soup (they had a Try 2 Combo that was about $8) and it came with bread and a chocolate dipped strawberry. For dessert, I got their creme brulee that had berries on top (I forgot the exact name) and the entire meal was just delicious. The sandwich was very tasty and the soup was delicious. The service was awesome, the employees were very helpful, and the place was clean. Definitely recommend trying this place!"}
{"text":"Amazing!  One word is all you need to describe this place.  That covers the food, the service, the employees, the price.

I went there for lunch AND dinner yesterday (don't judge!), and I'll certainly be back soon. =)"}
{"text":"Normally this is pretty good place to eat for lunch.  But the last few times I have found that they are getting really skimpy on the ingredients.  For instance today I ordered the Strawberry Harvest chicken salad.  You would just assume that there might be more than 2 tiny strawberry slices and 3 tiny pieces of chicken.  Really?  That is ridiculous!  Then to add insult to injury the chocolate covered strawberry was about the size of a small paper clip.  Come on Zupas get it together!"}
{"text":"I really like this cafe. It is now my first choice for a bite when at desert ridge. I have several complaints however on areas I feel need improvement. First of all, WHY are they closed on Sundays??? I'm sure it has something to do with religion, which I respect, but it is a BIG mistake from a business standpoint. Desert ridge gets sooooo much foot traffic on weekends!! Not to mention all the people who want a nice soup and salad after church service. I, myself, have found myself wanting to eat at Zumas on many a Sunday (if not every Sunday since opening) even driving there on two occasions before remembering they are closed. I feel bad for them for all the business they are losing being closed on Sunday. Bad, bad decision. At least open up for lunch.
Secondly, I was VERY disappointed with the kids portion size. You DO NOT get your money's worth there. My daughter is nine and the amount you get would hardly satisfy a three yr old. The fruit cup was literally four grapes and three mandarin orange pieces! The two chicken strips are tiny, also. Provide some decent size meal options for kids, please. I would gladly pay a little more but as it is now, I could go anywhere else in the ficinity and get twice the amount, at least.
And lastly, I was asked twice what I ordered but other servers, which I found odd. I had to go back to the beginning of the line where the menu is to check since I couldn't remember the name of it. Not just once, but twice!!

Overall, the food has good flavor. I agree with the other reviewer though about the extras being a pitiful attempt to make a buck. Add a few croutons at NO charge!! I mean geez, really?"}
{"text":"Yes, yes, yes. So delicious. The tomato soup was fantastic (and plentiful), the sandwich (chicken pesto) was scrumptious, and the house-made crème brûlée? Don't even get me started. Everything tasted fresh and the service was prompt and courteous."}
{"text":"Worst dining experience ever. Sure their food is overpriced, but what do you expect from a staff that stands around not doing anything? Seriously, there were at least 10 employees standing around the entire time I was in the restaurant.

Blatant fire code violations (standing in the front door to explain the restaurant concept to new patrons qualifies as blocking a point of egress, therefore, fire code violation). 

The restaurant decor looks like someone took a cue from a hospital cafeteria. Sure, it's modern, and new, but if you have any sort of anxiety with hospitals, this place will set you off. And the music choice... really? Here's an idea, how about playing music which is calming, instead of angry? 

Besides the food being overpriced, and the quality of the food missing the mark, pretending this is not a fast food establishment is a mistake. Just because some teenager walks over and asks how the food is, and if he can take some empty plates, does not mean the place is upscale. They have signs on the table saying \"get your food before your seat.\"

Seriously, don't waste your time with this place. There are plenty of Mormon Sandwich shops that don't look like hospitals, and actually have food that justifies the prices."}
{"text":"Great selection of soups, sandwiches and salads and most importantly quality ingredients.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"A couple of friends and I decided to give this place a try.. I liked it so much I brought my family in to try it a week later. It is very clean, the staff is very friendly and the food is wonderful! One thing I didn't like was that it was freezing inside the restaurant so bring a jacket if you're planning on visiting. The portions are decently sized and you're full at the end of you're meal. I usually order the full sandwich and half soup. The prices are quite affordable and the food seems like a healthy option. I would definitely recommend and can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I've never been a fan of this restaurant. I feel their portions are ridiculous for the price along with the fact that they don't offer nutritional information. I have a lot of food allergies and they won't share information because they're not allowed to. Isn't that against the law? Not a fan!!"}
{"text":"Omg seriously I paid 15$ for French onion soup and panini so expensive,And there French onion soup was so oily and gross I had to ask for money back,the staff is so rude the guy on register think he owned it...I would not recommend anyone to eat there they will get sick from that French onion..."}
{"text":"Been there with Friends food was awesome we had combo yesterday, one veggie and one with lobster soup n pesto chicken,,e loved mango almond salad"}
{"text":"This cafe is soooo good. The bread was soft and light. The meat tender and the soup.....the soup was spectacular! I had the tomato basil mmm mmm good!! Good service as you walk in the front door you are greated and given direction of what there is and other staff members keep the floor and tables clean. Will go again!"}
{"text":"The soups here are absolutely delicious! They make them from scratch in the back and they are better than homemade! The lobster bisque is my favorite so far but the mushroom is also delicious! The grilled paninis are really good too. I also tried a few of the salads. The lettuce is very fresh and the dressing are flavorful. They need a 'try 3' combo since its so hard to choose between two! This is my new favorite place. This is a great place to grab a quick bite before a movie."}
{"text":"First time here and was very pleased to see the variety of fresh soups, salads and sandwiches.  The Maui Tropical Chicken salad lived up to its description and was deliciously fresh and tasty.  The soups looked inviting, so had a taste of the Roasted Red Pepper & Lobster and it did not disappoint.  Enjoyed the Honey Bacon Club sandwich on Ancient Grain & Whole Wheat.  All in all, looking forward to going back to try other items as food freshness, cleanliness, great customer service and healthier food choices are on my list of food places to frequent."}
{"text":"So So good, you get good bang for your buck,... skip the paradise bakery and head here love it!! They also have Italian soda which is also so so so good."}
{"text":"I love their salads! I normally get the mango salad with mostly mangos with strawberries and blueberries - it is soooo fresh! I get it almost every time I go. It's easy to park and get in and out. It's so good that I order the large thinking I'll eat half now and half later but then I end up eating the entire salad since it taste so damn good. the strawberry dipped in chocolate is a nice add on."}
{"text":"Poor customer service, do not make accommodations for people with food allergies, they will not do double the meat even if you want to pay for it. They lost my business and my entire family."}
{"text":"Nothing that is going to blow your mind from a flavor or culinary perspective, but great value and a home run with the kids.  They love the grilled cheese, soup and who doesn't love a chocolate covered strawberry.  I have had the turkey panini which was good, the Cuban was would have been perfect but the pork had a bit of a funky flavor to it like it had been sitting out for a while.  Their beverage counter in back has some cool hot sauces and flavors for teas and sodas which I haven't seen at most sandwich shops.  The thai mango salad is pretty good as well but order the dressing on the side.  As another reviewer stated they drown their salads in dressing.  Their service is up and down.  Sometimes they have someone greeting you at the door, sometimes they don't.  Sometimes the tables are clean, sometimes they aren't.  Sometimes the bathroom is spotless, sometimes it isn't.  We will keep going back to grab a bite before a movie and hopefully things even out.  It could be a 4 star place if it does."}
{"text":"Great and quick service. Much better than Panera in terms of prices and food in my opinion."}
{"text":"Efficient service and good quality fresh food. Prices are reasonable and they clear your table for you. I tried 3 soups and they were all great, even better than Panera. Would like to see the calorie count on them as there must be a lot of butter in them. Overall, great quick stop for lunch."}
{"text":"The food is good, though the portions seem small. I guess it's suitable for lunch.

The ordering process is a hassle. Having to explain what you want to 4 different people is not ideal. Frankly it gets confusing. The staff is very friendly, though. And I like the chocolate dipped strawberry you get."}
{"text":"I ordered the soup & salad combo. The clam chowder was super salty and it was difficult to eat. The salad I had was swimming in salad dressing. Gross. I was there with a group of people and they complained of their soup being too salty as well (tortilla soup). The employees were super friendly and helpful though. I doubt I'll be back."}
{"text":"Very good food. Fresh and inviting. Wild mushroom soup is to die for. Had a Chipotle salad that was wonderful."}
{"text":"Awesome FRESH food! Service was very tentative and helpful, a great experience all the way around:)"}
{"text":"I would give this store 0 stars if I could. They are always rude when I go in but tonight was the final straw. I stood at the front of the salads waiting to order and the manager Janelle stood there and talked to her employees for 5 minutes before she greeted me and asked me how many orders. When I told her three she called someone down from the other side of the line to take my order and moved slightly to the side. I waited another 5 minutes before she could find a pen and greeted me. Then when I ordered my sandwiches the girl turned around and no one was there to make my sandwiches but there were five employees standing around doing nothing. I paid for my order and waited another 5 minutes for my food to be ready and it was still wrong. The girl at the register was the only pleasant thing about this experience. She was very friendly and apologetic and I think her name was Kylie I can't remember but she was great."}
{"text":"Not worth the price if you are getting a salad. They not only fill half of the bowl with lettuce. If you ask for more lettuce (which is the cheapest ingredient) they will tell you that they are only allowed to five you a prepositions amount. If you watch them place the lettuce in your bowl you will find that it is not pre portioned at all, it's just whatever amount of lettuce the server decided to put in your bowl. Prepare to be dissatisfied for paying for a $5 salad that looks like a ration. I've had great experiences at all Zupas up until this visit. Please decrease the price of your salads if you are going to ration the ingredients. And if you are going to ration and claim to give pre prepared amounts, consider actually using a measuring utensil so it is consistent rather than claiming you are giving the allowed amour when previous visits have been quite different. I suggest getting a quality assurance rep."}
{"text":"First off, I'll start with the positive.  The staff is very friendly.  However, when I asked about getting an extra scoop of lettuce, I was informed that I'd have to buy an additional salad because 'this was the portion size.'  Now, I understand if I were asking for a protein, but I wasn't.  The lettuce is the base and probably one of the cheapest items.  Adding an extra scoop would have satisfied the customer, me. 
This is the second bad experience at Cafe Zupas. For that reason, I will never go back.  There are better options out there for the same price point."}
{"text":"OMG! If I could give a negative 5 star review I would!!! It was my first time in this new location and it was super packed! My BF and I went there for lunch on March 30th after deciding to meet up there on our lunch break. We both hadn't eaten anything all day as we both had a hectic morning. We were excited and hungry! I ordered a pesto chicken panini and a cucumber green tea from their fountain tea drink selection. My bf got an Italian sandwich and a clam chowder and a soda from the fountain drink. After eating my sandwich which I thought tasted good and drinking my drink which was disgusting, my BF ate his sandwich which he said was OK and soup which was disgusting and watery! We left full and a little disappointed. It was definitely not something we were planning on going back to...

After about 30 minutes my BF and I both began feeling sick!!! My BF is a physician and he knew we both got food poisoned! I did call the manager (she said her name was \"sharika\") the next day and she said she'd look into it...but this was enough to forever turn me off from any zupas for the rest of my life! I also warned all of my friends and family to never take their chances here...
My BF and I both had to return to work feeling like dying and I was soooo sick and nauseous the whole day and felt like death!! 
My BF didn't vomit like I did but he was feeling the pain! 

BE AWARE OF POTENTIAL FOOD POISONING!!!
PROBABLY DUE TO THE LACK OF QUALITY CONTROL BECAUSE THIS PLACE WAS CROWDED!!!"}
{"text":"First the good: prices are very reasonable, wait-staff and servers are very friendly, the place is immaculately clean, lots of interesting salads, sandwiches and panini. Now the negatives: our salads were mostly lettuce with very skimpy portions of the other ingredients, the turkey avocado panini was just so-so, the slice of bread that everyone receives even if you order a sandwich was pasty and very ordinary tasting.
We complained to the store manager about the salads and she comped us with a slice of chocolate cake which was delicious. Bottom line until they get their act together, come here for dessert and go to Paradise Cafe for good sandwiches and salads."}
{"text":"The tortilla soup was delicious! I decided to try something new and went for the carnitas sandwich and omg it was the best sandwich I've ever had! I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Amazing soups! Amazing sandwiches! Amazing desserts! Clean, fresh, modern decor. Love this place! Well worth a $10 lunch."}
{"text":"The rudest staff ever. You should really consider letting customers tips so maybe they would be nice. They don't care about making customers happy at all. But the food is good"}
{"text":"AWFUL! Worst dining experience I've ever had!! I took my sister here for her sweet sixteen and we were greeted with COMPLETELY RUDE staff, including the manager, as well as food poorly prepared and not enough seating. I have never been so dissatisfied!! They have lost our business forever! Do NOT recommend."}
{"text":"Just found this place and I love it! The selection is nouveau and varied. Everyone gets a chocolate dipped strawberry for desert. The atmosphere is modern and rad - must have put a lot of $$ into the build out! I'll be back here because there is a lot left to try! I'd love to see more menu item production on the triple tvs!"}
{"text":"My first visit here, I came for lunch with friends and it was packed.  This place kind of reminded me of Panera Bread, but with more choices and a little bit cheaper.  They only took half my order because you order soup/ salad first then down the line you can order soup.  They got my sandwich order, but completely overlooked me and went to the person behind me,  I did manage to squeeze in my soup order (I was going for the pick 2). 

My other friend was successful in placing both his orders, but his sandwich never came down to the cashier. Then they said they will bring it out to him and it took almost 15 minutes even when he went back to ask them what happen to his sandwich.

When it came to finding a table, the empty ones were dirty with no one in sight to clean or wipe off the table.  I had to go to the cashier to ask them to send someone or give me a towel to wipe it off.  

I did enjoy my turkey spinach artichoke panini sandwich though."}
{"text":"My biggest addiction. Have a create your own salad every day with spinach, almonds, pistachios and the amazing poppysead  dressing."}
{"text":"This was my first visit here.  I had lunch with a friend and we both loved it.  Healthy food is usually not my first choice but I'm trying to get in shape.  This is healthy but delicious! The place got packed pretty quickly. I think it's a nice touch to give bread and a chocolate covered strawberry with each order, even if I couldn't have the bread. Looking forward to coming back."}
{"text":"Disapointed in the poor customer service. They cant accomodate to extra lettuce for a salad and I offered to pay more for it. They said theres no charge button on the system so i have to take it as is. Finaly i get to the end and the guy runing the register threw my \"complimentary\" piece of bread on my tray and it flew out, touched it with his bare hands and put it back in the bag. Seems to me this place is very stingy.."}
{"text":"First time visit for lunch. Well priced combo deal ($7.99) allowing you to choose two items between soup, salad, and sandwich. Went with the grilled cheese sandwich and tomato soup. Figured these better be good for a place specializing in soup. And guess what -- they were.

Lots and lots of staff. Friendly and well trained. Parking at this location SUCKS. Very busy parking lot."}
{"text":"Good food.. terrible customer service!! Stood there for 10 minutes before someone even acknowledged me! On top of that they took two people ahead of me, that ordered after me!! So irritated."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch and it reminded me of Paradise grill and café  in St. George, Ut. I was greeted by friendly person at the door with a bright smile. She went over the menu and made suggestions of what to try.

I had the pesto chicken pannini. It was good. Like the other reviews, the portions are small. I  was surprised at how small the sandwich was compared to the big box it was in. Maybe I'm not used to an actual serving size. None the less I have no complaints. I didn't feel heavy after eating my sandwich.  Nice to have more healthy alternatives in the area. I definitely return to try more items on the menu.

The decor is nice. The place is very bright inside. At times it was hard to hold a conversation due to the loud music. 

Overall, you guys will see me again."}
{"text":"\"The food was good, a bit pricy and the place is super busy at lunch time. They forgot our rolls & strawberries.\""}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here together to pick up lunch... Long story short, this is probably the worst location. My boyfriend ordered a sandwich and didn't get the bread or strawberry. I ordered a salad and soup and they somehow forgot to include dressing in my meal. Save your money and time by going to the location on Lake Mead. They have better service, staff, and they've never made mistakes when serving meals--even when they're overwhelmed and packed with customers! Such a shame that this location couldn't measure up... huge fan of Zupas."}
{"text":"Went in again to get my lunch before work and I ordered a glazed chicken chipotle salad... I get to work 20 mins later to find that they forgot the chicken! Unbelievable."}
{"text":"very good especially the chipotle chicken salad and Cubano although that's all I've had, many times"}
{"text":"Got the Honey Bacon Club and tomato basil soup. Not worth the nearly $9 for the pick 2. If you're in the Norterra area, save your self and go to Paradise instead. We won't be going back."}
{"text":"Delicious lobster bisque and wonderful Maui tropical salad! If you have not been to cafe Zupas- you must go! Ends with a chocolate covered strawberry complimentary! Will go again! Was friendly and fast service and more than tasty- borders on Jason's deli and panera bread!"}
{"text":"Finally! My kind of place in Summerlin... Sandwiches, soups & salads and a great environment!  'Try 2 Combo' is a great way to get to know the variety of food they have (& what a variety!) I was given 'favorite' suggestions at the door by a very helpful employee...but went with my own choices - that were fabulous as well!  I red the turkey spinach artichoke sandwich (panini) and 1/2 salad choice was the red raspberry spinach. Both delicious! (though, my salad did not look like a 1/2 salad-but a full one...not complaining) Oh, all meals come with a complimentary chocolate covered strawberry!  Even though I had plenty of food...I ordered their caramel brownie...so worth it!  I will be back...& often! :)"}
{"text":"This place is beyond good, ive been coming since they open and im still addicted to their turkey spinach artichoke sandwich and tomato basil soup.
This place is always busy and the employees are awesome and verry helpful,  the restaurant is always clean.

The only thing they are missing is a tip jar SERIOUSLY! !
This people work their asses off and dirty people just leave the table super dirty, at least leave a couple of dollars for the person that picks up after you!"}
{"text":"Tried roasted veg soup & toasted veg sandwich. Great in taste. Really nice, tasty, healthy. Customer service is good."}
{"text":"Zupas has the best soup in the world. It reminds me of soup my family makes me and it is delicious."}
{"text":"The music is way too loud to enjoy the meal. Especially when the upbeat tempo songs start blasting"}
{"text":"2nd time in Zupas and the restaurant wasn't busy messed up my order TWICE both times and ate cold sandwiches 15 minutes after sitting down.  NOT IMPRESSED AND WONT RETURN!"}
{"text":"Comparable to the style of Panera Bread except lower quality. Great upbeat customer service, (5/5) but food was subpar. (2/5) I got the crab sandwich and lobster bisque combo; both were EXTREMELY salty and not really any flavors that stood out except the salt. I was quite disappointed and hope they fix this issue in the future. I love little cafes, so hope to go back with some improvements in their food."}
{"text":"I used to eat at Cafe Zupas a lot when I lived in Utah, so I was excited to find this one in Arizona. The grilled cheese is always a good choice! The soup is pretty tasty as well. They offer to let you try the soup and always have a nice atmosphere"}
{"text":"Everything about this place is awesome. I've had everything on the menu and haven't had a bad meal yet.  The service is outstanding and they great you wi a smile."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good but.... Please please please STOP asking me 20 different times by six different people what I ordered!!! Especially frustrating if you have a group of more than three. 
Nuff said"}
{"text":"It's not Ruth Chris but for a cheap, quick lunch.....it's good.  I typically get a salad and a soup.  Greens are always fresh and crisp and their Yucatan soup is good.  A few friends have gotten a sandwich and they all said it was an average sandwich.....but i've never tried their sandwich. 
The service is always quick and they appear to be overstaffed, not sure how the owners handle to overhead with the prices and the amount of staff....but it works."}
{"text":"I tried
Cafe Zupas for the first time today and I must say that I was very pleased. The place is clean and well lit. The girl that greeted me at the door was very helpful in giving me recommendations. They have a take 2 special for $8.29. I ordered the turkey bacon guacamole sandwich and the summer chicken salad w/ fat free raspberry vinaigrette.  The sandwich was warm and delicious.  The salad fresh and the raspberry flavor really popped. The portions are a nice size and the meal also came with bread and a chocolate covered strawberry.  The staff is super friendly and super fast!
I had the salted caramel creme brule for dessert. It was decadent!
Cafe Zupas has various syrups that you can add to your fountain drink, including a sugar free raspberry syrup.  If you need to recharge your cellphone,  there is a charging bar available with 5 outlets.
I plan on coming back to try their soups which looked delicious.  
Give this place a try. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Was a regular at the Norterra Cafe Zupa. No more. I ordered the usual sandwich and salad combo (the Italy with a ceasar salad). Get to the end of the line. What did you order? Italian sandwich and ceasar salad. We don't have the ceasar anymore we discontinued it. What? You couldn't tell me that when I ordered? No sorry. Just we added a few more salads to the menu. Not even do you want to try one of those. I said just the sandwich then and left. After a 10 minute wait in line (only one customer in front of me who had to sample everything and order everything) and then this, I will not be back. The food combo was the only thing keeping me coming to this place as the young employees behind the counter have no clue what customer service is. Goodbye Cafe Zupa's. Here's to finding something better!"}
{"text":"I went here with my friend and cousin after prom dressing shopping a while back and I was very impressed with this café! It was all moderately priced (if not on the cheaper side which is always a score for me,) and the staff were very friendly. But the desserts we got were amazing! My cousin got the Sinful 7 cake and I had to refrain from eating it all when she let me try it, my friend got the Rocky Road brownie which was also decadent and delicious, and my Berry Crème Brule was outstanding. I am looking forward to the next time I'm out in Mesa so I can go here again."}
{"text":"Overrated!  Sandwiches are small; bread tastes mass produced without flavor, and the texture is too airy.  Salads are small too.  Atmosphere is that of a frozen yogurt place (bubbly and plasticy) with food aspirations of Panera."}
{"text":"One of my favorite lunch places has finally come near me! I have been going to Zupas for years and I absolutely love it. I usually get the turkey spinach artichoke sandwich with the soup: half Wisconsin cauliflower, half tomato basil with a scoop of orzo pasta. Then I dip the sandwich in the soup. It is seriously heaven. I've tried the other soups, and they're good, but not nearly as great as this mix. The salads are great, and I love that meals always come with bread and a chocolate dipped strawberry."}
{"text":"4.5 Stars. 
I've been coming to this location for 2+ years now. I LOVE their Strawberry Harvest Salad and Garden Chowder Soup! Every time I have these I am thoroughly satisfied. (The strawberry dressing is amazing! I wish they sold it!!)
Customer service is always great!
Advice I would give if you call in an order... look inside the bag and make sure you have everything, i.e. salad dressing, prior to leaving. 
Request I would make to whoever prepared the Chocolate Strawberries today...be more generous with the chocolate please."}
{"text":"Have been there twice already.  Food great.  Prices great.  My faves...tomato basil soup and Asian mango salad.  Staff friendly and courteous."}
{"text":"Great customer service. Pulled Pork Sandwich was to die for. Great sauce and piled perfectly high. Salad was built by myself. They gave me the perfect amount of dressing!  Was delicious!  Would recommend to anyone for our of the norm soup salad and sandwich place."}
{"text":"Always a great place to stop while traveling through Vegas. Clean restaurant with fresh,delicious healthy food. I love the menu, but it's always hard to choose a soup - they're all so good!"}
{"text":"We are regulars.  Love the food.  Great paninis, salads, and soups.  Awesome Italian sodas.  Don't know why they have such a disorganized, confusing system of passing your order along down the line--boggles my mind."}
{"text":"Great place! Great food, good service. Love the chocolate covered strawberries and bread that come with the try 2 combo. The employees are generally helpful though it's annoying they won't let you add any veggies to a sandwich. Also I will say the drink station always seems unpleasant. Maybe it's the lighting but it always seems a little messy or unkempt. 

Definitely a favorite though for fresh yummy food!"}
{"text":"Zupas always has the most upbeat and welcoming employees. I have tried a variety of their soups and sandwiches and I'm never disappointed. The lobster red pepper and the mushroom soups are full of flavor."}
{"text":"I've eaten at this place over 20 times according to my yelp check ins. I gotta say, even though it's a chain type place, the food is always solid. Not AMAZING, but solid. I've had almost everything on the menu and their soups are definitely the highlight. And the service is always super friendly. Would I recommend it to a friend? Yes. Will I be back. Yes."}
{"text":"I stopped in after hitting Barnes and Noble and was very pleased with the experience.  The service was fast and friendly and the food was fantastic.  I ordered the Wisconsin Califlower soup along with a salad and both were awesome.  While enjoying my meal I witnessed the staff being productive when not waiting on customers which is a welcome change from what I see at other establishments.  Thanks ot the Cafe Zupa staff for making the first of may visits so enjoyable."}
{"text":"As far as a sandwich, soup, salad place goes, this place is pretty dang good and the prices are very reasonable. I created my own salad and had their tomato basil soup and it was VERY good. 

Did I mention these devils had a piece of bread and chocolate dipped strawberry to your meal for no extra cost? Evil. Awesome, but evil. I can't turn down carbs or sugar. Ever.

Overall we loved the food and the atmosphere, but they did lose one star on the manufactured greetings and overall fakeness of the employees. I don't think the PEOPLE are fake, but it seems like they are forced to be overly friendly to the point where it's painful to watch. No one loves their job that much, not even people that actually LOVE their job.

We will definitely be going back soon. Want to try the paninis."}
{"text":"Train wreck. For a place giving the illusion of being \"homemade\" and \"healthy\", they have an extremely shitty selection for vegetarians. Only one vegetarian sandwich and NO vegetarian salads?! Maybe 3 vegetarian soups, but we're in the desert.. I'm not going to want soup when it's 110 outside. Strike one.
 
Came here around noon with the fiance after a gym workout. This is a new location, and was packed. Similar to places like Q'doba and Chipotle, you start at one end and work your way down the assembly line. The first lady (with a glazed over look) \"greeted\" us with \"for here or to-go\". 
Us: for here. 
Her: would you like to try any salad or sandwiches today? 
Fiance: a soup and sandwich combo, please.
Her: would you like to try a salad or sandwich today?
Fiance: (extremely confused) a soup and sandwich please?
He proceeds to order a Cuban sandwich and clam chowder, to which she rudely says to order the soup at the end of the line.
She looks at me and repeats her slogan, \"would u like to try a salad or sandwich today\", to which i also say \"a combo\". She, again, repeats her question if i want to try a salad or sandwich. I repeat my order that i want a combo with a veggie sandwich, add sprouts and onion. Another gentleman behind the assembly line snaps his head around and says they can't add anything to sandwiches, only salads.. You're freaking kidding me, right? Strike 2. Also ordered vegetable and quinoa soup.

They were extremely unorganized behind the line, waaay too many employees that don't know what they're doing behind the line for the space they have. 

Ordered soup at the end of the line and the soup dude asks what sandwiches we had (they weren't finished being made yet) and looks around, lost. Dude next to him talks the fiance into a cheesecake. 2 lunch combos, 2 drinks, and a slice of cheesecake-$28. Strike 3.

Food- my vegetable quinoa soup was really good. Also, the cucumber basil green tea was great. That's where it ends. \"Vegetable\" sandwich was absolutely pathetic. ALL bread. (although fresh) One piece of Muenster cheese, 1 tomato, tiny specks of mixed greens, a few sweet peppers and a cilantro sauce that was decent. Fiance's chowder was straight up runny and he said it was very salty. He said his Cuban was decent. He said cheesecake was just ok. We both got a \"complimentary\" piece of bread, and a small, chocolate covered strawberry that was very mushy. 

No thanks. If I'm in the mood for that type of food, I'll stick to Panera. 2 stars only for the tea and the soup, and that's being generous."}
{"text":"Rude to my mother and little sister. Rushed them in ordering, the employees and management were not helpful or kind. 
This was their first time trying zupas. I felt so bad because I recommended this place based off the friendly service and fresh food from the other locations."}
{"text":"I was ecstatic when I saw that they were opening this location because I live nowhere near the others and I'm a huge fan of the eastern location..I've been here three times since opening and I am extremely unimpressed.

1. Yes, the entrance is tricky but as adults, it's not that difficult to find the entrance to a line; so I'm not going to complain about that.

2. My biggest complaint - every time I've been in, it's extremely overstaffed which would automatically make you think quick, friendly service.. Completely wrong. This is the slowest assembly line of over 8 workers at a time that I have ever experienced, it's actually pathetic how slow they are when the lines aren't outrageous (chipotles lines are longer with less workers). I'm not an impatient person and don't mind waiting for my food but why have so many people getting paid to stand around? On top of that, while you're in line, prepared to be asked what you ordered over 5 times from different workers. I haven't experienced any rude staff. In fact, most are very friendly; so maybe that's what has made me return. I just find their assembly line to be extremely disorganized.

3. The salads here are delicious (especially the mango berry) and is another reason I have returned..but don't be prepared for anything fantastic when you're ordering the soups. I tried the tomato bisque to accompany the grilled cheese. The sandwich was really good, the tomato bisque was disgusting..it was so sweet (yes, sweet..so gross) none of the other soups look that appetizing either.

4. I'm hoping that this is just a trial and error because this was the perfect location for them to open one up and I don't want disorganization to keep me from giving this place business."}
{"text":"Good food- weren't very accommodating to my mother who can't eat certain vegetables. They seemed to be frustrated when they had to start the salad over- work on your employees attitude."}
{"text":"Been to this location multiple times and they have been consistently good and fresh food. I have never tried the soup though. Salad and sandwich are much better (taste, selection, and value) than Paradise Bakery across the street. Service is good. Even long lines, it hasn't been a problem, they got moving smoothly. Always clean. The only thing, every time just before reaching the cashier, they always asked what I ordered. Hmmm. Should you know that? And it's hard to remember 3-word items. Regardless, I will keep coming back."}
{"text":"Great place restaurant is clean every one is nice and friendly, very attempt to customers and food is great."}
{"text":"First, I'll just get this out of the way before I go on my rant. The food there is a 6 out of 10. It's ok but nothing to go crazy about. 
Here's where I go crazy. I hate this place! The only reason I've been here maybe 6 or 7 times is because my 11 yr old daughter loves it. Why? I have no clue. Maybe it's because she doesn't have to deal with that complete cluster f**k of a mess when you try to order and the painful process of walking that line all the way to the register. 
So I order my sandwiches at the first stop, then stop 2 is salads and you either order salads or keep moving down the line to soups. Then I stop to give them my soup order and then I'm getting asked what I ordered! Why? You would think maybe so they can hook the correct soup with the correct sandwich. Nope! Not sure why they ask because they're just putting soup bowls on the tray. 
After that, you arrive at the register and they ask you for a 3rd time \"what did you order?\" At which point, I'm about to lose it and freak out on all of them. It's so unorganized and when someone like me orders for the entire family and I have to remember all 6 sandwiches, what soups go with what sandwiches and then I have to repeat it a total of 3 times? Not to mention they rush you and that doesn't help when you're trying to get through the process so you can just sit down and eat. 
You people need to get your act together! I can understand this happening the first couple days of grand opening but by this point, one would think that this place would have streamlined this process! Nope! It's gotten worse as time goes on. 
At this point, I'm willing to bribe my daughter with just about anything up to and including a car for her 16th birthday to prevent having to go to this place again!
If you dare go here after reading these reviews about what a cluster it is, make sure you come armed with Xannax or your medical marijuana cuz you'll need it 10 mins into this circus!
I'll get my soup and sandwiches elsewhere!"}
{"text":"We love Cafe Zupas!! We are always greeted at the door by a friendly young lady. The staff has always been upbeat and friendly, they even offered to let me taste the soup before committing. The ingredients used are fresh and tasty. I recommend the Pina Colada salad if you like coconut. We LOVE the Wisconsin Cauliflower soup. It's the bomb.com. And fresh chocolate dipped strawberries?! You really can't go wrong with this place. The desserts are good too. I have been here several times and have never had a less than wonderful experience."}
{"text":"Literally my favorite place! Every time I come to AZ for business I have to eat at Zupas!"}
{"text":"This place is outstanding!  I usually don't write reviews for chain restaurants and franchises, but this place was so good that I think people in Las Vegas should know about it.  At first, I thought this place would be like a Panera.  It serves the same types of food as Panera, but the quality is significantly superior.  

I've been here twice, and each time I got the Pick 2 option for $7.99.  This includes a full-size sandwich and a salad or soup.  I ordered the Vegetarian sandwich both times, and I had the vegetable soup on one occasion and the MangoBerry salad on the other.  All of these items were excellent.  the MangoBerry salad was the best salad I've had in a long time.  It's actually a very healthy salad, but I felt like I was eating candy.  The soup was also really good.  They also have a very extensive soda selection, and additional flavors of syrup that you can squirt into your soda to give it unique tastes.  The complementary chocolate covered strawberry is also a very nice touch.  

There's a very modern, clean feel to this restaurant.  They have a \"recharge station\" where you can plug in your laptop or cell phone.  It seems like the type of place where they wouldn't mind if you want to come and work on your laptop for a while.  The only reason I didn't give them five stars is because their employees are a little overly-friendly.  From the second you walk in to the place, there's a person holding the door open for you, and all too eager to tell you about what's on the menu and how to order.  Whoever owns this place would do well to tell the employees to back off just a little and give customers a chance to look up at their menu on their own and take it all in.

This is definitely a great place with nice atmosphere and good food at great prices.  I'll come here again."}
{"text":"Let's start off with the least important stuff, the customer service. I find their over the top pandering to be totally obnoxious. I don't need to hear \"thank you so much for coming in\" 6 times before I even receive my food, maybe just once on the way out. The soup here is my favorite ever. Their lobster bisque is second to only my lovely girlfriend's. It's a great mix of delicious flavor and the perfect amount of seafood mixins. The clam chowder is also excellent. My girlfriend loves the sandwiches but they seem a little froofy to me, like one slice of deli meat in a panini? Who is that gonna satisfy, a hamster? The ambience is a great mix of upscale feel to the point where I feel guilty drinking my soup out of a bowl like I'm a child but not so fancy that I don't do it."}
{"text":"If you want a great fast lunch experience come here. So many great choices for soups salads and sandwiches and the service is amazing. They must have so many people on staff because there's 50 people helping you through the line. Also they give you a chocolate covered strawberry with your meal. Love that! Wish there were more locations in vegas! Best service ever. Especially for a busy lunch place!"}
{"text":"Yummy!!
Very clean fresh flavors...  
Very nice and helpful employees....
Definitely will return so I can try something else.  
Love the chocolate dipped strawberries."}
{"text":"My very first visit, and I am impressed! I ordered a combo California turkey sandwich  and Mangoberry salad. My first bite of the salad and my taste buds jumped with excitement.  I had not read the description and I could taste the cinnamon almonds, blueberries, strawberries,  and mangos.  The dressing was delish, it's described as a house made mango yogurt dressing.  The sandwich was just as good,  I know a sandwich is a sandwich, but again, I could taste the flavors of it.  Ps, they give you a chocolate covered strawberry with your order.  Thanks. Oh yeah, the service was great from start to end."}
{"text":"My sandwich (california turkey) was good, but the soup (tomato basil) was pretty bland and brought my rating down from what could have been 4 stars.
Sandwich: 4 stars
Soup: 2 stars

The sandwich was good enough that I will probably try them again and sample other items on the menu."}
{"text":"This place just became one of my favorites.  The food is phenomenal and fresh.  And it is a great value: a good-size gourmet sandwich, a large gourmet salad (with chicken, hard boiled eggs, olives, tomatoes, and croutons), a chocolate dipped strawberry, and a piece of french bread for only $7.99.  Incredible taste, quality, and value.  I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I waited thirty minutes in line and when I reached the register I was told they were out of one of the ingredients (pesto) in the menu item I had ordered at the beginning of the line and were making more but suggested I order something different. I told them I really did not want something different and that they should have told me at the outset. I said I would wait for what I had ordered. I was told it would be five minutes. It was over ten minutes. The manager could not be bothered to come speak to me about it when I asked. Not coming back."}
{"text":"Ordered a Chicken Cobb Salad and Red Pepper Lobster soup to go. Got home and realized my salad had no chicken in it. Location is too new to even have a phone number and it was an inconvenience to go back. Portions were smaller than the rainbow location also. Not fulfilling and I'm still hungry."}
{"text":"While the food is decent if you're looking for a salad, their ordering system is not customer friendly and very annoying, I have to place my order with the first employee at the front of the line and then completely repeat the whole order when I get down to the cashier. By then I can't remember the name of the sandwich or salad I ordered for me or my other party and the menu is not in view from down there. Either write the order down, put it in the computer first, or have one person assist me the entire time,"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time yesterday and will definitely be back. I got the mango berry salad and pulled pork sandwich and both were delicious. I was in a group of three and we all got the same salad but one was somehow made with light dressing which wasn't a big deal but odd. I think where they set the food while you wait to pay is disorganized but again not a big deal. Next time I want to try the citrus berry spinach salad. I was impressed with how quickly the line moved through. I loved that it came with a chocolate dipped strawberry."}
{"text":"Probably the best soup and sandwich restaurant I have been too.  Incredibly clean with a very friendly staff.  We were even thanked when we changed our minds after walking in one time!

Try two combo is filling even for a big guy like me (250 pounds).  My favorite is the lobster and red pepper soup.  Today I have the chipotle glazed chicken salad and it was good as well.  The try two combo always comes with some French bread for dipping into the soup and a chocolate covered strawberry for dessert.  The complimentary italian soda spritzer to spice up your soft drinks is also a nice touch!"}
{"text":"I hate to give these guys such a low rating because I love Cafe Zupas. But the last 2 times I've been to this location, my experience was not good. Both times I ordered soup and salad to go. The first time, they forgot the salad dressing for the kale and quinoa salad. I was at work and had nothing to put on in it, so into the garbage it went (I mean, come on, have you ever tried to eat kale and quinoa salad with no dressing? Horrible!) Then the next time I went there, I mentioned what happened the last time to them and told them to make sure they include the dressing with the salad. I get home and lo and behold, the dressing was there, but not nearly enough. Half the salad was completely dry. I don't know who they have making the salads, but whoever it is needs some serious training. Their saving grace is the fact that the other location that I go to has always gotten my orders right. Just won't be coming back to this location anytime soon."}
{"text":"The combo meal was a great deal and it tasted great.  They even give you a free chocolate strawberry which is a plus. I would definitely suggest coming here if your looking for a sandwich and salad."}
{"text":"Nice place to grab a sandwich for lunch! Very fast, efficient and friendly workers. A diverse menu to select from. I had a panini sandwich and it was pretty tasty. Food was made to order and still came out amazingly fast. 

The food prep area was kept very clean. As for the dining area, it was a little neglected, and because of this, there were many people circling about looking for clean tables.

Otherwise this is a very decent restaurant. Too bad they're not open on Sundays."}
{"text":"Love this place for their soups and salads. Great quality and taste - a little expensive but generally worth it."}
{"text":"I love their food! I went yesterday and had the lobster bisque (yum!) and turkey bacon avocado panini. I love that they give bread and a chocolate dipped strawberry with their  try 2 combo, which is what I always get. I really want to try the mango thai chicken salad too. 

Great location too!"}
{"text":"I have found my new favorite spot!!!  A little over one week new to the area and the word is out!   I have read the great reviews from the one they opened in the Henderson area and was eager to try this place out.  

As we walked in everything was a little overwhelming at first.  Since it is new they had greeters at the front ready to explain their concept and how it all works.  Its all pretty simple - Salad, Soup and/or Sandwich.  A combo includes your choice of 2 for $7.99.  This is similar to the Chipotle style assembly line thing where you tell the servers what you want and they will assemble what you choose.  There is an assorted number of fresh toppings to choose from-meats, cheeses, veges, pastas, nuts, fruits, croutons etc. Better ingredients than any salad bar I've ever been to.  They had a wide range of dressings as well as many fat free and low fat choices which I thought was fantastic!  So you can opt for their salads choices or you can build your own.  If you build your own salad they give your choice of 6 ingredients. You can also choose to add toppings to your soup for $.59.  They have many sandwiches to choose from.  The Ciabatta bread they use is fresh, soft and airy.  

Here's a rundown of what we ordered:

*Asian BBQ Pork sandwich - Very flavorful - BBQ sauce was tasty
*Salad (create your own). Romaine with Sesame Ginger dressing (fat free & amazing flavor), chicken, ground cashews, feta, apples and croutons - this was my favorite overall
*The Italian sandwich - BF really liked the flavor and balsamic spread it had
*Roasted Red Pepper Lobster Bisque - was amazing with a little kick and lobster flakey chunks to compliment (I've been to steak houses that don't have this much lobster)

Each combo came with bread and a chocolate dipped strawberry.  The drink section has your choices of \"syrups\" to add to your soda.  Recommended recipes are written on the drink cups to give you an idea of how it works.  My BF did the \"rootbeer float\" mixture - 2 squirts of vanilla to your rootbeer.  It was very tasty and was exactly to be expected.  I forgot to mention that had some amazing looking desserts but it was already enough food.  Maybe desserts to-go next time.  BTW you can get any of the food to-go.

The customer service was great.  We were nicely greeted by everyone we came in contact with.  Since its new everyone was on their A game and happy to be there.  I hope that continues.  The place was very clean (new still) and you can tell they spent a lot of time and money on the bright and vibrant décor inside and out.  Its very modern and open with plenty of seating.  They have the recharge bar-but I have no idea what that was about yet.

As we were indulging in our new found favorite food stop we were already planning on coming back the next day.  So as we drove up on Sunday our hearts sank - CLOSED ON SUNDAYS.  Wah wah waahhh.  Sad face.  No worries.  I intend to be back ALOT just not on Sunday.."}
{"text":"Great food! Worst service you will ever find! We come here at least 2 times a week because the food is great, unfortunately the one thing that never gets better is the service!"}
{"text":"Food is as always very good. The service today was poor at best. They were busy but 2 woman were just rude. Tantine was rude to the kids making salads and stephanie was not happy. She practically threw my salad on the tray. If you are in the service industry you must be able to at least fake friendly. 
It seems like a whole new staff in there. Gonna miss the old ones. At least the night people looked they were having fun and enjoying their jobs. It shows with the customers."}
{"text":"Made our first foray to Cafe Zupas today and loved it. The food was delish (the Nuts About Berries salad and the Honey Bacon Club) although the portions seemed a little small for the price. My only complaint is their Clam Chowder has onions in it. Yuck! Bonus points for real brewed tea and Italian flavorings for the soda. The layout is efficient, staff courteous, and interior design appealing. We'll be back."}
{"text":"One of my go to places for a warm soup. I love the veggie variations they have in soups. Have tried their tomato basil soup and garden chowder. They were both good. I tried the veggie sandwich and it was just okay. I have had better sandwiches. The mango berry salad and the chicken BBQ salad were great. Both the salads were on the sweeet! 
I would go back there for their soups and infusion water!!!"}
{"text":"Cafe Zupas is a fast-casual restaurant that is new to Nevada, its first location is now open in Henderson near the shopping center at Richmar and Eastern. A second is coming soon to Summerlin. Cafe Zupas has had great success in Utah and Arizona. They offer homemade soups, freshly made salads, paninis, and gourmet sandwiches. I was fortunate to receive an invite to a VIP party that allowed Frank and I to sample various menu items. All guests were warmly welcomed and encouraged to sample the Try 2 Combo, which comes with a whole sandwich, half soup and half salad for $7.99. The Kid's Meal Combo is $3.99.

Salads are made in front of you as you order, soups are made fresh daily in Cafe Zupas' kitchen, and sandwiches are fixed when you place your order. It is quite the assembly line. I chose the Tomato Basil soup with Orzo Pasta, topped with asiago cheese for .59, their signature salad Nuts About Berries and Turkey Spinach Artichoke Panini. Frank had the Yucatan Chicken Tortilla soup, the BBQ Chicken salad, and the the BBQ Pulled Pork sandwich. They got started on our orders right away, all components were added to our tray, we selected Brownies for dessert and our order came with Belgian Chocolate Covered Strawberries. By the time you pay your tab (ours was gratis on this visit), your order is complete and ready to be whisked away to a cozy table in the dining room.  

We dug into the soups first, the Tortilla soup is fantastic and loaded with flavor. It was so tasty Frank devoured it before I could snap a photo. The Tomato Basil was good, but less of favorite. It's quite sweet and very heavy on basil flavor. I hear the Wild Mushroom Bisque is not to be missed so I'll try that one next time.

Next, we tried the salads, I had the better of two with Nuts About Berries. It was loaded with fresh berries and topped with cinnamon almonds and lightly dressed with poppyseed dressing. It' a bit sweet, but not cloying so it was enjoyable. The BBQ Chicken salad was loaded with tomatoes, black beans, corn, olives, red onion and dressed with buttermilk ranch. What it lacked was BBQ chicken. There are ten other salads to choose from one is sure to strike your fancy.

Unfortunately, the sandwiches were the weakest link. This is a shame because their Italian Ciabatta bread is really fresh and delicious. The BBQ Pulled Pork tasted more like honey mustard that BBQ. It wasn't a very hearty sandwich. Sadly, the turkey wasn't very good. It tasted like prepackaged deli meat. I prefer freshly sliced deli meats. I expected actual artichokes on the sandwich, but it was a spread. That was my mistake, the menu clearly states a three cheese artichoke spread. I overlooked it. Truly, the bread is so good, I'd try the gourmet sandwiches again. I'm interested in the Asian BBQ Pork and the Vegetarian.

Dessert ended the meal on a pleasant note. I love Belgian Chocolate Dipped Strawberries so those alone wooed me, but the brownies were quite good and oh, so decadent. Gooey caramel and candy topped one and the other was more of a bar with coconut, nuts, chocolate and other goodness. 

The staff was incredibly friendly, they gave out dozens of prizes including water bottles and giftcards. Discounts and prizes will also be given out during their Grand Opening celebration on May 18. There are few places where a complete meal can be had for less than ten bucks, but it can be done at Cafe Zupas."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE service! Food is ok at best & price is good but the service is HORRIBLE! Orders are always wrong, they're always rushing you even though you're the only customer in the joint. Asked for a specific order, asked 3 times if it was what i asked and they even marked it that way but when i got home it was wrong! NEVER AGAIN!"}
{"text":"Food is still very good, however, we've been having a lot of issues with order accuracy. 

I always get my food to go. Once I got the kale quinoa salad to go, and when I opened my salad when I got home, there was no quinoa in my salad. I had to spend 30 min driving back to get some quinoa. How do you miss a main ingredient of the salad?! A week later, I got the kale quinoa salad to go again, and this time when I got home, I saw there was no dressing. So I had to spend another 30 minute of my life driving back to get the dressing. 

They did offer me a free meal for my inconvenience. The process of getting that free meal is frustrating incident on its own. The manager that offered me a free meal only took down my name, even though I asked several times if there's a card or something I should take so it's more official. But he reassured me it will be fine as long as I give them my name. So when I went to go redeem it, nobody can find that piece of paper he scribbled my name on, and I had to repeat the incident to 3 different people before they got the manager on duty at the time, and I had to describe the whole incident to him again. It took almost 20 minutes before I was on my way with my free meal. 

After those two incidents, I have decided I will never go to Zupas again, but my boyfriend is still a big fan so he's been getting takeouts for us. The first time he went, they actually forgot to put quinoa in his salad, but he caught it before he left the restaurant because my experiences have made him so paranoid. 30 min waste of his life averted. Yesterday he went to get a salad and guess what he found out when he got home (he forgot to check before he left...)..... Yep. No dressing! It's almost comical at this point but he was not amused and I had to pick up McDonald's for him (the McDonald's order was 100% accurate). We don't go to Zupas everyday so at this point their accuracy is less than 50%. 

Please Zupas, you really need a better employee training program. And for all of you that are thinking of getting take out, make sure to check your orders before you leave!!!!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to this place for a bit now and I always come in big gaps of time hoping each time I come they might have their operating systems together by then. Well they never do. I always wait way too long because there is one or two people trying to slam out a long line of waiting customers. They are always unorganized, always flustered, someone is always yelling for someone else to help, and I always have to ASK for my receipt. THIS DISGUSTS ME THE MOST AND I HAVE SEEN IT HAPPEN TWICE NOW. Teach your staff to TAKE OFF THEIR GLOVES before handling money!!!!! This was the second time I saw an employee use their salad making gloves to receive form of payment and give change as well. Then going right back to touching food with the same gloves. I saw one 'female manager looking women' today throw her glove away twice while I waited, but not the younger team member. They seem to be so flustered needed someone's help that their attention goes to getting help instead of proper health awareness. You should have a food maker, a soup and extras maker, and the cashier should only be there for the payment transactions! Hellooooo! Don't think I'm going to come back again because every time I leave I end up frustrated... Again."}
{"text":"When did CafeZupas become stingy on their portions? This used to be a value for your $$, not the case anymore. Thumbs down..."}
{"text":"I had their Red Rasspberry Spinach Salad, it was really good but they are a little stingy on toppings. I'll go again but maybe this time I will try a sandwich and half a salad."}
{"text":"First time here. Food tastes great. Good environment. Choice between Mimi's or here is a hard one, yet there is wifi here. Families galore I didn't bring my son, yet I see lots of families eating here. 
For what you get you could go to sunset station, yet the service was fast and prompt. 

When I am in the area it's now a good place to fill in the answer to \" what do you want to eat\""}
{"text":"What can you expect from prepackaged salad greens and soups that taste like they are out of a bag.   There is really nothing special about this place and many better options when it comes to eating in and around Desert Ridge Marketplace. Skip it."}
{"text":"Super yummy for fast casual.  We visited Zupas for the first time the other day & was happily surprised how yummy the food was.  I had the crab avocado melt panini, my husband had the turkey spinach artichoke panini & my son had the bbq chicken salad.  Everything was absolutely delicious including the fruit infused drinks.  Our total was just under $20.  Prices are pretty good: Sandwiches $5.49, Salads half $5.59/large $7.59, Soups half $4.39/large $6.39, Pick 2 Combo $8.79, Kid's Meals $3.99 & Drinks $1.99.  They also offer desserts and provide a free chocolate dipped strawberry w/ any of their entrees.  The best part is the food is ready super fast yet tastes super fresh.  Loving Zupas as another go to place for lunch!"}
{"text":"First time here and I enjoyed it! The chicken Cobb protein salad was really good. I also had the Italian club and it wasn't my favorite but not bad. Will definitely be back to try other options. Loved that I got a chocolate dipped strawberry with my sandwich order! Also got the rocky road brownie and it was delicious!"}
{"text":"It WAS good when it first started.... Now every time I come here they either forget part of our meal (and l had to be constantly asking when it was going to be ready and they forgot TWICE), overcharge us or the food is cold... Today is the last day we come here until they get it back to how it used to be. 
On the good side, that honey lemonade is tasty."}
{"text":"So happy we finally have Cafe Zupas in Vegas. I can't think of another place we have like it. The food is made quickly and right in front of you, the selections are great, and extremely affordable. Especially because they have combos so u can get soup, salad, or sandwich paired together. 

The BBQ pulled pulled pork sandwich is one of their more popular sandwiches and I like the touch of the fresh red cabbage slaw in it. 
Each sandwich even comes with a chocolate covered strawberry.

As for the salads, the Nuts About Berries and Shanghai Chicken are both great choices and the half size was big enough to fill me up. 

The lobster bisque was creamy and had chunks of lobster in it. It also comes with a slice of french bread to dip in it. 

Their dessert case makes everything look so tempting. I tried the Hazelnut Cream Creme Brûlée and found it was very light and just a little on the sweet side. But no complaints. 

This is definitely a good place to stop for a quick, healthy, and tasty lunch. But don't forget, they're not open on Sundays!"}
{"text":"horrible excuse for a restaurant. sandwkch was tasteless, chicken tenders served
cold and hard, no ketchup (?), ditsy workers. do not waste your time."}
{"text":"Today I got the Ultimate Grilled Cheese, Half cup of Lobster Bisque, and some salted caramel crème brulee.  This meal completely hit the spot.  The grilled cheese with the pesto spread is delicious.  The lobster bisque is exactly how I want it to taste.  I splurged and got the salted caramel crème brulee which was creamy, rich, delicious and soooo satisfying.  I love the free chocolate covered strawberry and the roll is great for dipping in the soup.  The staff was friendly and efficient.  My order came quickly.  I love it here!"}
{"text":"I work nearby and come in every now and then. This place is fast food salads, sandwiches, and soups. 

Interior: well lit and clean. 

Food: Overpriced. The veggie sandwich is so small it's a joke. They basically put salad ingredients between two thick pieces of bread. I don't get it. How about sliced tomatoes and veggies? They also put too much pesto on it to the point where it ends up soggy & all I can taste is the pesto. The salads are not bad but they don't have very healthy options unless you choose to build your own salad. The desserts are actually pretty good. Soups are good and come with a bit of bread which is nice. But most soups are cream based so, again, not very healthy. 

Service: What is terrible is they make you repeat your order over and over again. There is no communication between the people that put your order together and the person who rings you up. Hey, Zupas, there is technology now that allows you to enter an order through something called a computer. A lot of other businesses use them. Staff is always nice but I don't want to repeat my order so many times. 

Get it together if you want my business on the regular. Serve better portions of veggies instead of just slathering everything in dressing. Create a more efficient and convenient way to order."}
{"text":"A friend introduced me to this restaurant and I've been obsessed with it ever since. A new one was finally built closer to me on Charleston, which makes this place's job to get my business 10x easier. This eatery reminds me of an upscale Panera Bread (not hating on Panera, also a great option) with its soup, salad and sandwich style cuisine. I never feel guilty indulging in a meal from here because it's for the most part healthy and made fresh to order. My favorite thing to order is the Honey Bacon Club - hold the tomato. Or as they would call it (HBC no Tom). It's full of flavor and a savory sandwich that comes pressed- panini style. 
The reason for giving this establishment a 4/5 stars was due to the service. Although always greeted with a smile and friendly workers, my order has been messed up quite a few times. I always check my food before leaving if taking out in case their is a mistake, and if there is they are quick to fix it."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite quick eats. I love their nuts about berries salad and their soups are good as well. The staff is friendly, the store is clean, and the drink selections are interesting. Their dessert case looks pretty awesome as well, although I'm usually too full to venture towards desserts."}
{"text":"I love this place so much.  My review is not on the food per se, but on the terrible way they run the register.  When it's busy, all the orders get put up on the counter.  Then when checking out, they ask what did you order.  Well when I am ordering for 5 people I don't want to have to repeat every single item. Very obnoxious. It delays the checkout time, exacerbates the lines and doesn't make for a great experience. I love the sandwiches, salads and soups and drinks.  They have to figure out the checkout process. Hopefully the owner reads the Yelp reviews so they can fix the process. If not, it will turn away loyal customers."}
{"text":"The food is fantastic but why do I have to repeat my order literally 4 times while moving through the buffet line"}
{"text":"I love the ultimate grilled cheese and garden chowder."}
{"text":"If a restaurant sells salad and soups, you can expect to see my face often:)

I love the concept of the salads, soup, and sandwich bar. You get to pick what you want and see your meal come together right in front of you. Their ingredient are really fresh and everything taste delicious. I like to create my own salad. You get to pick your greens and 5 toppings. I like to get mixed greens with bacon, Parmesan cheese, dried cranberries, apples, mango, and fresh herb vinaigrette. I usually get the pick two combo so I get the Clam Chowder soup with my salad.

My biggest critique about Cafe Zupas is that they are really stingy! Ideally, they are supposed to give one full scoop of each topping, but they always get me less than half a scoop. Their food is more expensive than other salad bars so I get mad when I see them being cheap. Staff is always stuck up and rude to their customers. I usually just get my food togo so I don't have to deal with their employees for too long."}
{"text":"My sister introduced me to this place and I fell in love with their soups!! Delish!!!"}
{"text":"I'm glad I didn't review this one too quickly- after our first visit, I was squarely in the 'yay!!' camp, but after my third visit, I'm downgrading it to a 2-star review. Maybe it's because on my first visit, I had a 50% off coupon, because I've come to realize that this place is really over priced. It's also hard to find something that doesn't have 800+ calories- that's way too much for lunch. 

The setting is loud, hard surfaces and pop music- actually reminds me most of something that you'd find in the Minneapolis airport. After paying $9.00 for a bowl of soup, even with the chocolate-dipped strawberry, I'm kind of done with it."}
{"text":"I love the fresh ingredients, made from scratch concept and the quality and flavor shows. I had the pick 2 combo with the New England clam chowder and ultimate grilled cheese. The chowder was packed with flavor and very different from any other one I've had. You have the option for add-ons like bacon or asiago croutons, but it really doesn't need it. The grilled cheese was actually a grilled panini with tasty cheese, tomatoes, and a pesto sauce. 

The preparation and service was quick and friendly. They certainly know how to staff appropriately for when the restaurant is almost full. My only complaint is that this place isn't open on Sundays. Oh well, nobody's perfect."}
{"text":"We frequent Café Zupas quite often when we're at Desert Ridge. They provide a quick and tasty meal without breaking the bank. We usually order their soup and sandwich combo, where you get a full sandwich and a bowl of soup. I like their hot sandwiches, which are pressed Panini-style; the bread is nice and crunchy and is filled with a decent amount of meat/veggies, which taste pretty fresh. Our most recent visit, I tried the Crab Avocado Melt, and it had a lot more crab meat than I anticipated. Same with the Roasted Red Pepper and Lobster Soup; lots more lobster meat than expected. The meals are served with bread for the soup and a chocolate covered strawberry for dessert. I've never ordered their salads or baked goods, so I can't comment on them.

The restaurant has always been clean and service is friendly. It's a great place to grab a quick bite to eat without having to resort to fast food."}
{"text":"The Garden Chowder &  Wild Mushroom Bisque are not only vegetarian friendly, but absolutely delicious. The Chocolate Dipped Strawberry that comes with your meal doesn't hurt either."}
{"text":"We stop here at least once during our annual tennis trip to Vegas. Sure wish we had one in Hawaii!"}
{"text":"5 Stars all the way! ....Great selection of healthy salads, or you can create your own salad, the way you want! Delicious healthy soups, too. It may cost a little more, but you are definitely paying forahigher quality of food, it's worth it to me, also VERY friendly service!"}
{"text":"We've eaten lunch there two days in a row and have enjoyed the choices they offer.  The mango salad is tasty and I tried the turkey cranberry sandwich.  Staff there is very friendly and helpful. The place is clean and they have loads of parking. Nice stop after a movie."}
{"text":"Great soups - great sandwiches - love the cuban - they need better soup spoons - very difficult.  Good value."}
{"text":"The whole family went. All very disappointed. The service was so bad that after the third time of making my daughters salad WRONG we gave up and promised never to come back."}
{"text":"First time going to Zupas today, it was recommended by a friend and I'm glad I went. I was greeted with a warm welcome when I walked in and Nicole was able to help me order since I've never been there before. I got my food extremely quick and was able to sit down and enjoy my meal. The Manager, Nicole, even came to the table to see if everything was alright and offered a free sample of their new soup. Overall I'm very happy with my experience there and will be reccomending it to all my friends!"}
{"text":"Portions are small for the price but Vegas has a real produce lack so it's actually probably the fairest pricing for fresh ingredients they can offer. Solid, flavorful, FRESH food and delightful service. I recommend ordering for pickup as the line can be a bit long for the lunch rush on a week day."}
{"text":"Good overall. It was a feast for the senses. I like the concept. It's hard to explain. They have soups, salads, sandwiches, and desserts for all sorts of cravings."}
{"text":"It's my first time here and the workers were so nice and helpful. The food is sooo delicious! I had the crab avocado sandwich and their mango salad. It's healthy and sooo good. I love that I had a dessert too and it all added up to $12 compared to going to a protein house and paying for just a bowl of food. Affordable and you get more. Great workers!"}
{"text":"ACTUAL IS ZERO STARS.

About three months ago, I found myself and the darling Orchid in that neighborhood to transact some business.  Since it took a while longer to transact than we originally figured, we found ourselves hungry after \"mission accomplished.\"  Having not been in that neighborhood before, and having seen the sign, we thought, \"why not?\"  We entered the building and \"saw the sights,\" as it were.

(DISCLAIMER: AS HAS BEEN NOTED IN THE PAST, ORCHID HAS SEVERAL FOOD ALLERGIES, WHICH DOES OCCASIONALLY MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO CHECK OUT A NEW PLACE.)

We were concerned about several issues relating to ingredients, expressed or implied, in certain of the offerings, and so, as we have so many times before, we asked about ingredients used.  Imagine our surprise, shock and dismay when we were told that they would not divulge the ingredients - even a specific request such as \"is there any soy in this?\" or \"do you use any hot peppers in this?\"  When we asked why such a medically-reasonable request was being refused, we were told that they did not comply with such requests to keep their recipes from being stolen.  HUH?

After about ten minutes of discussion on whether or not an allergy qualifies as a disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act, as well as a few more simple requests for specific allergens in their preparations, we finally decided that their \"policy\" meant more to them than new clients.  We left, with no intention of ever returning.

On the Nighthawk 100-point scale: 5.  (No, that's not a typo; that's a single digit.  Five.)"}
{"text":"I love this place. My wife and I go here at least every other week. Their Nuts about Berries salad is one of the best salads I've ever had at a restaurant. This one in particular the staff is always been nice and the environment has been welcoming and clean. I do and will continue to go to Zupas."}
{"text":"Amazing food and friendly staff! The wait time was extremely short and the restaurant was spotless. Everyone was smiling when we came in including the guests. Will be going back!"}
{"text":"Great fresh sandwiches, salads and soups!! Love the mushroom bisque!! My sister had the tomato basil soup very good! My son loved his kids grilled cheese and fruit cup. My husband and sister both had the turkey, bacon avacado panini my sister said it was great considering she doesnt like hot sandwiches so thats saying a lot! With every combo meal you get a chocolate covered strawberry!! We took a large lobster bisque home which was also awesome too! They have a drink station there where you can add flavorings to your tea or whatever you like they even have screens around the place showing you how the make their soups and sandwiches all fresh ingredients and made there everyday! We'll definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"This is a great place for fresh salads and sandwiches. When I'm in the area on business, I walk here at least once a trip. The staff is always super friendly and always are ready for a helpful suggestion on what to order. The food is great and the staff is always amazing. Plus who doesn't like getting a chocolate strawberry with their meal!"}
{"text":"The only fast food place where you have to tell the person upfront what you want and when you go to the  end you have to tell them again because they don't enter it into any system. Talk about being inefficient!!!!!!!!!!! We have POS systems that take care of this nowadays. Please...change this process as it gets frustrating!!!!!"}
{"text":"Fast food Panera.  We were lured here with the mailers and promise of 50% off the entire check.  We had the crab soup, clam chowder, and tomato soup.  All were spot-on with flavors and not overly salty or watered down.  The Asian pork sandwich was a winner.  It had a hint of heat and the cilantro really brightened up the sandwich.  The Thai sandwich and the crab avocado were adequate and not terribly special.  

We loved the idea of flavoring your own drinks with the syrups they had at the drink station but noticed you need a lot of squirts to really flavor the tea.  I like the option, though.  The ice-makers were having a hard time keeping up with the crowd, which, I assume, were just kinks from opening days of service.

The staff was efficient and the management must be given kudos for moving the crowd along fairly quickly.  I don't suppose they will keep that many staff on hand in the coming weeks and months, so I will be curious to see if they can keep up with busy service.  I like that they have placards on the tables imploring customers to not save a seat as the tables turn over quickly.  Once you're done getting your food, it makes it easier to find a table fast.

This place was slightly cheaper than Panera but without the comfort of one.  Still, I've been a little annoyed with paying Panera prices lately, so this is quite a decent alternative.  The food is comparable, and I will come back again soon."}
{"text":"It was okay, a bit inconsistent. I got the lunch combo - soup and salad. The salad was called \"nuts for berries\" or something along those lines, and it was very strange. It tasted like cereal. How can salad taste like cereal right? My lunch date was very skeptical when I described my salad in that manner, so he tried a bite and his response was \"wow it does taste like cereal\". Strange and not in a good way. 

But the soup I chose was good - Wisconsin cauliflower. Although I did not see any cauliflower in my soup, the cheese taste was really great. This earned the place 2 stars. 

I gave them a 3rd star because they give you a chocolate covered strawberry at the end and that made me happy. 

I probably would not return here though."}
{"text":"Fell in love with the new Avondale location on Monday, so much so I came back today... big disappointment. 

The chicken enchilada chili was runny and had very few ingredients. I asked a staff member if there was a different batch because on Monday it was thick and plentiful. Her response: \"oh it gets thick when it sits for a day\" \"so on Monday the soup was old?!\" \"Uh huh.\" (She smiles and walks away) The soup wasn't the only watery gross thing. 

The cherry coke tasted like ice had been sitting in it for hours, which is weird since it was straight out of the fountain. 

The salted caramel creme brûlée tasted like nothing and was the consistency of watery, unchilled box pudding. 

The roll tasted like just starch, no flavor at all. 

My husband wanted to add a second type of cheese to his sandwich  and they told him \"no!\". I'm sorry, what? What company says no to up selling a customer?   Did corporate leave already? Too soon after opening to be this disappointing!

(On Monday also had a turkey avocado club, it was ok. The bread tasted like plastic. But the soup was  amazing!! The husband had the cauliflower soup in Monday, also great. If you are a honey fan, their lemonade is good. Honey is the prominent flavor, so skip if you're not into that. The chocolate hazelnut creme brûlée was amazing!) ....but then again, I don't know if that was just amazing Monday while the trainer's eyes were watching?  

I'll probably give them one more try. I'm so glad to have new stuff in the area finally, but I won't waste calories or money on anything lackluster."}
{"text":"I was quite happy to find this place.  It is essentially fast food with somewhat wholesome offerings.  When you walk in there is a salad bar counter where you can order a salad your way, or pick from one of their combos.  They have sandwiches and soups as well.
I have tried two salads and two soups and was pleased with them both.  All of the ingredients tasted fresh and they get bonus points for providing a generous amount of dressing on the side (I don't like dry salads).  Service was also friendly and helpful, and even when it was rather crowded, everything moved quickly."}
{"text":"Completely overpriced with fake highly processed chicken and they charge .69cents per scoop of vegetables and they are very stingy on the amount they give"}
{"text":"Love coming here for lunch! The menu doesn't really change, but everything is so good! I love the beverage center they have and the free chocolate covered strawberry is a nice touch. Portions are good size and I almost can never finish it all. Next time I go I'll have to try some of their dessert."}
{"text":"I've only just recently started coming here, and each time I'm left more satisfied than the last. I can't say no to the Wisconsin cauliflower soup, so usually either get that by itself or the \"try two\" combo with a sandwich. I got goat cheese as an add in today, and it was awesome.

The staff here is always overwhelmingly (in a good way) friendly and happy. Today, one of the servers, Amberly (sorry if I spelled that wrong) made our night with her attitude. I wish we could tip!"}
{"text":"Zupas is one of my favorite lunch places.  However, this location has terrible service.  Both times I ate here we paid and had to wait for our food.  That wouldn't be so bad, but I had to go up twice (both visits) and ask for the food.  Once I finally was given my food, one order was wrong and the other tasted and looked like it was made a day earlier. Go to Zupas, bit pick a different location."}
{"text":"I do like this place but they over charge fir the little thing.  Example. .. get soup and you 2 toppings it is about .79 to .99 cent each... and it is less then a tablespoon. You can not customized your sandwich and add extra"}
{"text":"Great soup and salad concept.  Don't care for the fact that someone greets you while you're in line to push their combo special down your throat.  It's set up like Chipotle (assembly line style) so you'd better know what you're going to order before you get in line or you'll hold everyone up like I did.   There is SO much to choose from.  They have an awesome infused drink bar with juices and teas sweetened with honey."}
{"text":"I would rather eat hospital food than go back to Cafe Zupas. IThis is just REALLY overrated and really bad. I took me and three of my family members, and we all hated it. I had the wild rice mushroom soup. I love mushrooms and salt, but they managed to ruin that for me with this soup. The soup was disgustingly salty and the mushrooms tasted like they were out of a can. I spent over 10 dollars for a \"sandwich\" and soup. The sandwich was really the size of a half of a sandwich, and was not good at all. Really wouldn't recommend this place."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for fresh salads. They have a plethora of fresh ingredients from several types of greens to every fruit and nut toppings imaginable.  You can sample their soups before making a selection and their salted caramel creme brûlée dessert is the best!  Every meal is topped off with fresh homemade bread and a chocolate dipped strawberry. Although they're always busy, their service is fast and the staff are very friendly. Try the Nuts over Berries salad and their Tomato Basil soup. Wonderful!!"}
{"text":"Love the salad and soup here! The only thing that is bad is the bread. They need to step that up - otherwise everything is INCREDIBLE!"}
{"text":"Skeptical of this place after reading some of the reviews but decided to give it a shot. Pleasant surprise! Don't know what people are complaining about. Restaurant was clean, service was great and the food was above par with all fresh ingredients! Had a California protein Cobb and even the half portion was more than enough. Husband was able to make his own salad to his liking and the free chocolate covered strawberry was a nice add to the end of an amazing meal. Great value for the price. Definitely will be back!!"}
{"text":"I am beyond obsessed with this place. It's so refreshing and always consistently satisfying. The staff is friendly and knows what they are doing! And the drink selection is amazing!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I always try a different soup and sandwich, and they never disappoint. The salted caramel brulee is to die for!"}
{"text":"Wonderful food. Cafeteria style setting, still warm and friendly. Got our food fast and easy, lots of help in working with the menu. 
We both got combos ( soup / salad / sandwich, pick 2 ). I had a crab and avocado melt and mushroom bisque. My wife went with a pesto chicken and lobster bisque. Everything was delicious.
For drinks, we hit the beverage bar and tried their house made Drink Infusions made with raw honey. We both agreed that the orange berry Infusion was the best.
We finished it up with a couple of hand dipped strawberries, although we need to try those creme brulees next time."}
{"text":"Food is good but wife did not like cold pulled pork. Soups are delicious but interior too stark, way too well lit - thought I was auditioning for the Voice and the tables/seats are way too cold. Just okay but probably won't go out of my way to go again."}
{"text":"I just want to let everyone know that they don't wash their strawberries before they dip them in the chocolate, and sometimes the strawberries are moldy. Also they claim to be so healthy but all their sauces are mayo based. That is why they don't have nutrition facts available. They don't want you to know how UN Healthy it is."}
{"text":"Mmmm....Cafe Zupas. Great place to eat. Great sandwiches, great salads and great soup (Lobster Bisque is my fav)...and great deserts to boot. Staff is very friendly and the place looks great.  They do  have wi-fi so I considered studying there like I do at Panera, but they kinda have a time limit set on how long you can stay while you eat (not sure if that's a good thing) so i don't know if it would be an ideal place to study (i'll find out soon)
Otherwise, this place gets two thumbs up from this guy!"}
{"text":"I usually love this place and I only ever order one thing from here. Today no diffrent I went in to order a mexicali protein bowl ... in a half size or a build your own.  Today proved communication is not a priority in this place, every time I've ordered a half salad mexicali style they've made it no problem today the lady who was helping me was just very insistent on not making my order. That it couldn't be done with out paying a 1.25 per extra topping... or taking toppings off.. which would defeat the purpose of ordering that salad point being.... if I come one day and order something I expect to be able to order that same thing next time I visit. Inconsistency is very annoying.."}
{"text":"Today my wife and I want to Zupas for lunch like we often do because we love Zupas it's delicious I asked what I thought was a manager if I could have a few extra pickles for my Cuban sandwich and I was told no I couldn't have no extra pickles with my Cuban sandwich and that's absolutely ridiculous so I will never go to Zupas again the people there slash manager does not know how to satisfy a customer and therefore they lose I will never go there again stupid people my bill totaled $28 and change but that doesn't come with a couple extra pickles again stupid stupid people"}
{"text":"We came here on opening day and it was packed. We came back a few months later and things were much more mellow. The food here is OK. The turkey on the TBA panini has the texture of packaged butterball turkey lunchmeat, not something that is \"fresh and homemade\" like they say. The salads here are above average but nothing special. The soups are what make this place desirable. The lobster bisque, even though I swear on opening day had large chunks of actual lobster, is sweet and tasty. The clam chowder is also very good. I love that they give you chocolate covered strawberries with every meal and their soda bar makes it worth a comeback visit. The prices here are also pretty good for what you get."}
{"text":"Holy cow, I've been by this place a hundred times and for some strange reason I thought it wouldn't be very good. Maybe the name, I don't know. Okay, I put that aside today and went for it. Wow, its amazing, so many soups and sandwich/combos. I had the Cuban and Tortilla soup. Both were superb. Prices are very reasonable for such quality food. Very friendly staff. You can sample the soups which is nice as well. I can see eating here for lunch or dinner, definitely worth a try. They give you a chocolate covered strawberry with your sandwich, nice touch."}
{"text":"Stopped by Café Zupas for lunch. There were a lot of choices. I ended up getting a sandwich, soup, and salad. The food was just OK. I also decided to try their crème brulee dessert. It wasn't very good and tasted as if it were made with artificial flavorings. It also had too much gooey caramel on top, which was overpowering. My friend, who sampled it first, also felt the same way. I didn't even eat it after one spoonful. I also didn't care for the cafeteria style and probably won't be back."}
{"text":"This place is like a really bad rip off of Panera. I got a build your own salad, which limits you to a certain number of toppings otherwise you pay extra money. The portion sizes of the toppings are laughable, especially the protein. I asked for chicken and got a couple small pieces of chicken, at best. When I asked if I could have more chicken they told me I had to pay for it. I paid $5 for my \"extra chicken\" that was given to me in a tiny one ounce cup. Are you kidding me????? While the chocolate covered strawberry is a nice little \"free\" dessert, which I wouldn't even consider free because of the prices you pay for everything else, that's about all they have going for them. Won't be back!"}
{"text":"My office orders pick-up 1-2 times a week and our order is always correct and ready when we arrive. Our food is always tasty & hot. The have great customer service & Heather is always on the ball."}
{"text":"Lots to like about this place.  Fresh, healthful food made in house, reasonable prices, friendly service.  The roasted red pepper and lobster soup was very good (but, as other reviewers noted, too salty).  The house-made infused tea at the drink bar was good also.  On the negative side, the half salad was small, and they were out of several items."}
{"text":"I go for lunch with a friend here every now and then. Great food each time and I do love the chocolate strawberry. It is something to look forward to each time I go. It is generally busy around lunch but the line does move well. A little pricey but nothing over the top."}
{"text":"Great place for a fresh soup, sandwich or salad. Had the Cuban sandwich with the Maui Tropical Chicken Salad, OMG I was soooooooooo full and the taste buds were soooooooooo happy, servers and staff were a delight, will go again."}
{"text":"This place is so great. I come here every time we are in the area. The honey cilantro carnitas is delicious and every meal comes with bread and a chocolate dipped strawberry. More than enough food! And it takes a lot of willpower to make it past the dessert area. The food always comes out quick and hot too. Love it! Oh and check out their cookbook for $15, it looks amazing!"}
{"text":"I like this place, they always have a greeter which you don't find anymore. There's nothing better than to see a great smile at the door when going in to eat. The food is always consistent and just the right amount. The ambience is very well appointed. The only thing I've found inconsistent is the cleaning of the tables. I was there a few days ago and counted 6 dirty uncleaned tables by management. I would have given it 5 stars but I hate looking at uneaten food and dirty tables while trying to eat my own food."}
{"text":"I work in an office location not far from this restaurant and we love to pop into new places for lunch. The food for the most part is OK; I wouldn't put this in my top 3 places to go to for lunch, but overall there are some really good qualities. 

Pros:
The atmosphere in the restaurant is very new. Clean lines, bright. The staff is very friendly and up beat.  The location is excellent and is within walking distance of a lot of the other local businesses. Prices seem in line with other local businesses. The chocolate covered strawberry given with every meal :) 

Cons: 
I feel like the way you order is strange since it's almost broken into stations for the employees. By the time you get to the cashier, it feels like you've repeated your order multiple times since it's not communicated down the line. 
The soup has been disappointing. It's more broth based and there's not a lot of \"stuff\" in it. 
The containers are huge regardless of how much food you order. It doesn't seem cost or waste effective and I wished there were smaller options when I just get a sandwich. 
Salad toppings, from what I've experienced, aren't very proportioned. Sometimes you get a lot of meat and less veggies. 

Seems to be a very popular place for lunch, however I'd stick to the sandwiches since they've proven to be good."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good, but I have a bad feeling that it's very high in calories.  They don't list their nutrition info anywhere, so you know that can't be good.  I don't care if items have a lot of calories - I just want to know so I can decide.  On the upside, most of the soups are very good, and I really like the grilled Panini sandwiches - especially the chicken pesto.  The only other thing I'd say is that they should re-think their packaging.  I have rarely seen so much waste - paper wrappers inside of plastic containers inside another bag."}
{"text":"I have enjoyed Zupas for lunch and dinner...I think their food is very good, service is excellent..culture of this organization is super. the only thing that is annoying is the wait...always a long line..and it would make better sense to have the drinks and utencils on the back wall...there is NOT enough room to accommodate  the vast amount of people and it is very crowded trying to get your drinks, etc, before going to find a table. I think you get a good value for your money...the chocolate strawberry is a nice touch. Fast checkout..Mike"}
{"text":"I called to place an order as i have heard great things about this place, I asked the girl who answered the phone if i can place an order for pick up. Her response, no joke was \"no....you would have had to place a phone order by 11am\" really?!!! they just lost my business along with all of my coworkers!"}
{"text":"The food is full of calories and completely empty. You'll down 1500 calories in a couple minutes and leave hungry. Plus, no nutritional guide on their website? ? For real? Even Burger King and Mcdonalds have nutritional guides! And by comparison, you should probably eat there. You'll be downing the same amount of calories from BK/McD's that you'll take in at Zupas; you might as well leave satisfied. (Not that I recommend eating BK or McD's on a regular basis.) I think this place tries to appear healthy, and they're definitely trying to present a product that is superior to fast food chains. A little more bourgeois for the types that refuse to eat at traditional fast food joints. However, the devil is in the details. I would say this place is dangerous for anyone trying to lose weight. And It appears that those who are looking for \"healthier\" fast food options, are Zupas secret demographic. (And young people, of course. Quite obviously! There's a smart phone charging station, Duh!) You'll leave this place filling light, completely unaware that you just consumed about the same amount of calories found in a Double Whopper. And then an hour later, you'll be eating again. No worries, Zupas asks \"please don't hold your table\" not that they really give you a choice. Large reverse vacuum pipes blow subzero air directly above most tables. Therefore, they'll definitely be a free table waiting for you to come back and consume more! 

If you're not a calorie counter, the food is decent enough, I guess. If you're hungry when you leave, however, I wouldn't say it's a very good value."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time with my mom using a 50% off coupon she got in the mail. I'm glad we went and I will definitely be back to try it again! I had the Ultimate Grilled Cheese panini and the Vermont Maple Salad and liked them both. I sampled the Wisconsin Cauliflower soup and it was yummy.

Pros:
-although it was crowded, the staff was quick, efficient, and attentive
-their soups are DELISH
-1/2 salad and whole sandwich combo for $7.99 was the perfect amount of food
-lots of vegetarian options!
-free Italian syrups and recipes to create your own drink with any drink purchase
-clean, organized, and YUMMY!

Cons:
-a little bit pricey (a little less than $10 for one person's lunch)
-when the shopping center is crowded, parking can be a pain"}
{"text":"Generally this Zupas is my go to spot after a workout but the last two times they have really dropped the ball.  I order the same thing every time, nothing special or custom just standard menu items.  First time they forgot to make the salad altogether.  Second time they made the salad with no chicken or dressing.  Sent it back and it came back with chicken and still no dressing. Both times my order made it though the whole process, being asked multiple times what I ordered and still coming out wrong.  How is this possible given that the same salad was likely made hundreds of times each day?  Zupas please hire people that pay attention and take pride in what they do."}
{"text":"The first time I was there I got the vegetarian sandwich and the white bean soup. I was really impressed. But the last few times I've been there the food has been very salty (only the veggie sandwich has been good). The white bean soup had no white beans, only vegetables the last time. Not really impressed anymore. BTW, I got the thai peanut sandwich too, so I have not restricted myself to vegetarian items."}
{"text":"I'm in LOVE!!!! This place is amazing!!! The only thing better then the food is the service. Chris was so enthusiastic and friendly he made me feel like I was being served by family. Then Keahu was so helpful when I asked about the desserts. Thank you Zupas team. I will definitely be returning soon."}
{"text":"I LOVE cafe zupas!!! The food is freakin amazing and makes you feel good. High quality ingredients and great taste. My only [complaint] which isn't even a complaint: the price isn't the cheapest. Therefore, I can't eat here everyday lol or else I would! 
*The way I look at it- it's so worth it to spend the extra money on healthy, quality food like this place. It's much cheaper in the long run, because it can save you from future medical bills! Try the mushroom soup and the bbq chicken salad. Yummm"}
{"text":"Love this place! Always so clean 
And the staff is super efficient. Food is consistent and love the choc dipped strawberries! Also have to give props for the staff cleaning the tables & floor! Nice to eat somewhere you know the management has trained the staff properly!"}
{"text":"Great Place to Eat.  Loved the Sandwiches, the Soup and also the Salad."}
{"text":"Awesome food. Really good soups. Great salads. You can mix different flavors into your drink. They have free wifi, and a charging station just bring your usb cable. The food is very fresh. The kids meals are great as well my son loves the grilled cheese."}
{"text":"I've been here quite a few times and they have items on the menu that sound like they'd be great, but they are just never overly impressive. I've gotten the piña colada salad before and it's always a little dry and the lettuce isn't fresh. All of the sandwiches are made on the same bread, it's white and very basic with no flavor. The rolls are served cold, fresh out of the fridge with no butter or anything to put on it. With some simple improvements and attention to detail this place could be a solid 4 stars. But as of now this is the best I can do!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been going to cafe zupas since they opened and we have never had a problem.  The quality of their food and customer service is always exceptional.   Even tonight when we sat down after paying for our food I had noticed we paid too much and that they had messed up the bill.  Before I could even get up, the manager \"Dakota\" came up to our table to inform me of the mistake and that he had already fixed the bill and refunded my card the difference.   He explained that it was an employee in training and that he had caught the mistake.   Nice to know you can trust them and that they will make sure you have a great experience every time."}
{"text":"I love this place, and have tried all their salads and sandwiches. My favorite is the Asian citrus salad, Cuban sandwich and roasted veggie soup. They give you a hunk of bread (ehh it's okay) and a strawberry dipped in chocolate with each meal. Plenty of seating, but my only gripe is that it's expensive!"}
{"text":"We've been on a family mission to eat healthier... And there isn't too many good tasting salad restaurants ...
So we have been going to the Cafe Zupas on Stephanie 
In  Henderson...  The service and portions are better there!!! The gal taking out order was terribly rude here off Eastern... Her name is Micala.. And I guess she's apparently a manager...
She kept barking at everyone to move down the line while she was preparing our salads... And taking ingredients out of the salad bowls as if she was giving too much???
The portions are pretty small for the price point to begin with!!! She was also rude when she was addressing her staff members of the sandwiches we were placing!!!

Hopefully someone that is anyone of authority will read this post and make some adjustments!!!

There are too many restaurants to choose from if you're not on salad kick...hopefully...there will be some changes!!!

By The way...the salads and sandwiches do taste great!!!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to get salads and sandwiches from. The produce they use are really fresh and crisp. A couple of my favorites are the Mango Berry and the Nuts About Berries. Maui Tropical Chicken is also really good. The BBQ chicken is okay. Their soups are amazing. I love the Lobster Bisque and the Wild Mushroom. The soups are not too thick or heavy which is why I like them. The price isn't bad. You choose two between a salad, soup, and sandwich. There are usually a lot of people working so the service isn't too bad but there was once instance where a couple of the employees started getting into it. One of the employees even told me that she was going to kill the other employee. Lol you can add extra ingredients in your soups for extra charge. They did forget some ingredients this one time and I got charged for it. I really enjoy this place and I have been here over 10 times. The drinks bar offer refreshing drinks; especially during the hot summer months. Check this place out."}
{"text":"bengning looks good and but the food was avarage. I spent the night in the restroom so no more zupas for me."}
{"text":"Do not order via the phone as a delivery order!  We placed the order early to get the lunches delivered by noon and discovered that they do not do pork sandwiches before noon, then they came back with anyone with crab had to change their order because they don't do those before noon either.  Then when the order was delivered they were missing one out of the 9 we ordered flat out!  We called, and they have a \"system\" that prevents them from not packaging the meals in the order, yet we were missing the order.  Sadly, it was the person who paid for the lunch for the whole group.... so no more ordering from here!!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Always great service and amazing food. My family and I love going there when we are feeling too lazy to make our own food lol"}
{"text":"The soup was literally a just a can of mushroom soup, I had 1/4 of a small red potato in my entire bowl of potato soup almost nothing else.    The turkey they used was the stuff I'd buy at the grocery store if I hated my family.   Can't understand why this place exists, I can get better food literally anywhere else.    At least it was hot."}
{"text":"This place is fabulous. They have a selection of around 10 soups and so far every one has been great. I like the Sandwich and soup combo but it's hard because I want more soup and more sandwich, too many choices:)"}
{"text":"Don't waste your money here. Portions are tiny particularly for salads& soupsand they are way over priced. i asked for chicken with my salad, i agreed to pay extra but only got 3 tiny slivers of chicken. um.... 
the reason i gave it two stars instead of one is because their service is good, the staff is trained well. it's not their fault they are instructed to make the portions tiny. also! soup portions- tiny again! the cup i ordered was half full and mostly liquid no clams in the clam chowder. definitly feel ripped off after going here. i tried it 3 times now, same experience every time, high cost, small portions. i will no longer go to this place for lunch. baja fresh next door has bigger salads, they provide a proper amount of protein and are priced better. Cafe Leone  down the street at Tivoli also has better salad options with an appropriate amount of protein for a better price."}
{"text":"I am so upset, I have NEVER had such a bad experience at zupas before, this is ridiculous! I drove 20 minutes to get a TBA COLD and clam chowder soup. Not only was the sandwich made hot (i hate panini types, I just wanted a regular freaking sandwich ) but I got the completely wrong soup! What a waste of time and money! I called and was told they really aren't supposed to \"customize\" orders... really? Then why not tell me that when I placed my order? Now it's a policy, now that it's been completely botched? I go to zupas quite often but will not be returning to this location, even if it means I have to drive an extra 20 minutes... at least maybe ill get the food I actually ordered!"}
{"text":"Man, what a surprise this place was! I had a great sandwich ( Crab and Avocado ) with mango berry lobster bisque soup with desert. Will be back here again!"}
{"text":"My kids and I love Zupas. The cauliflower soup is my menu favorite. My kids love their chocolate covered strawberries and soups too. Downside is sometimes parking can be tough depending on when you decide to go and is a bit pricey, so we only visit occasionally."}
{"text":"This place has the best salads and sandwiches, if you are looking for a healthy option when it comes to \"fast food\". I've had almost all their salads on their menu, and all are great. So fresh and tasty, and a good selection so you don't get bored with the same choices. They also have seasonal salads and sandwiches, which are also superb! I love this place!"}
{"text":"Love. Love. Loooooove zupas salad and soups. The stRawberry vinaigrette is amazing and their tomato and cauliflower soups are to die for. The one thing I absolutely can't stand are their employees. They seem to be the dumbest, most unintelligent and dense of the human race. They mess up my order EVERY SINGLE TIME I go. Without fail. They've overcharged me twice. Hire some smarter, more on the ball employees."}
{"text":"I did not like this place, was way overrated for what get. Food was not that good. Selections even though many didn't have some of the basic things I would have liked(like Italian dressing). The price was pretty high and the soup didn't have much flavor:( very sad as I thought I would enjoy this place."}
{"text":"Great new soup, salad, and sandwich place. Think  panera but with more choices and better value. My only complaint is it gets really busy and parking and finding seats can be difficult. Also, they are closed on Sundays. Food is decent and not too salty."}
{"text":"Just picked up a bbq chicken salad and got it to work - no chicken.  Super disappointed.  I'll have to check my food before i leave next time."}
{"text":"Love this cafe for it's attention to detail and ability to cater towards its customers! Although this is somewhat of a chain store, it doesn't feel at all corporatized. Every time I come in, the employees are extremely helpful in putting my order together. Especially since I have a hard time deciding on what to order with so many great option, the employees always reassure me that I can't go wrong and will offer their personal preference. One time, an employee told to try mixing the cauliflower soup with the tomato bisque and surprisingly, it was the best combo ever! And I've been ordering it every time since! Another reason I love this place is because they are so detail-oriented. Whenever you go to store, dessert is alway an additional course at an additional price. Here, they top your meal with a chocolate covered strawberry! What this gesture is saying is, 1. we're a store fresh enough to carry strawberries and 2. we value you, please come again. The tactic is smart, it works, and it's won my heart."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why there is a difference between the Zuppas in the Valley but there is. I frequent two specifically,  the Zuppas on Sunset on the one near my house on South Rainbow. The Zupas on Sunsets food is always amazing. I typically get the Italian sandwich and the cauliflower soup. The sandwich is always packed full of ingredients, bread is soft and delicious and the soup is a little thicker and creamy, and tasty at the one on Sunset. Now let's talk about the new one on South Rainbow. For some reason the food is always less than Grand. My sandwich is puny with very little ingredients. Today I ordered my normal Italian sandwich and the cauliflower soup. Literally I think my sandwich had one piece of meat two tiny peices of sprouts and nothing else. The cauliflower soup literally was the consistency of water, hardly any flavor, just not good. How can items differ between the stores, if they serve the exact same items? The store on South Rainbow needs to get some tips from the store on Sunset!"}
{"text":"I had the Soup & Sandwich combo. (Tomato Basil soup & Turkey Bacon Avocado sandwich) That came out to under $10 with a complementary bread roll and hand dipped chocolate strawberry!!"}
{"text":"Well I've been here several times and I actually really enjoyed it. Today my work for zuppas catered and we all placed our order ahead of time. I got the Cali Turkey, however as I was eating the sandwich I realize there was no meat. I didn't even eat it because who wants bread, cheese, and veggies (unless you're a vegetarian), which clearly I'm not. My manager called and they said sorry they get the sandwich mixed up with the vegetarian sandwich. I'm not sure how if it's called a California Turkey sandwich. Way to ruin my lunch that I didn't even eat and they didn't even offer a free meal."}
{"text":"I have been to this location once before this and my experience was fine; the food was tasty and delicious. However when I went back there for the second time, within an hour of eating I was throwing up. I had the chicken herb sandwich and the clam chowder soup. I don't know which one did it but one of them gave me terrible food poisoning. I won't ever be back!"}
{"text":"I cannot believe this is my first time here! Of course there are so many places to try ,you can only eat so many times before you get to them all. It has been here for a long time,( maybe 3 years). It used to be the location of one of my favorite Chinese restaurants. I was so bummed when they closed down. Maybe that is why I waited so long to visit here.
Anyway, I had taken my car into Discount Tire to have some work down. 
I went across the street to explore. After a bit of shopping I thought I would give Cafe Zupa a try.
Love it, Yes , Love it!
It is a bit different but, they tell you exactly how it works. It is all laid out for you in order. They ask you to read the menu. They tell you how to order and you just go on down the line.
They even tell you, when you are through just leave your dishes, they will clean it all up for you. Then they say,  please no tipping.
The food is great!   Salads, Sandwiches, and Soup! I even got an order to go. I tried the Lobster soup whilst there and got the pepper lobster to go. Divine on both counts.
Even free Wi Fi and a charging station.
The rest rooms are very clean. Thinking of how many people are in and out of there during the lunch rush, I was impressed!
I am really looking forward to returning and checking it out!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I love the food and everyone there is very friendly and polite. Always a great experience."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with my son & daughter as it came recommended by a teacher. The sandwiches were drenched in a vinegar dressing which was not tasty. My son found a hair in his salad which they exchanged for some chicken strips that were tiny. My daughter's turkey sandwich came with an avocado mash which none of us liked. Fresh avocado would serve Cafe Zupas well as would a different vendor for cold cuts. The dessert was the only enjoyable menu item.  Creme brûlée"}
{"text":"Love the food! Soup is nice and hot, sandwiches are fresh, and the kids loved it! Only thing I think was a bit dissatisfying was the dipped chocolate strawberries. They are horribly dipped! Overall food and service is great!"}
{"text":"We love the salads however as many times we've been in there we've never seen the same employees the turnover rate is beyond and no one seem to know what they are doing along with how much of a turn off it is to watch them ration out your toppings. The floors are filthy and dull, and there was a nasty film in the ice tea containers. My wife doesn't like to go because she is always cold from the uncomfortable temp they keep it at."}
{"text":"My first time there last weekend , my wife loved her Lobster Bisque and BBQ Pulled Pork Sandwich , my girls lover their soup and I loved my Salmon Chowder and Pesto Chicken Sandwich. It's very good and the service as well , We will be back for more. Check it out ... I hope you like it."}
{"text":"Super good! Great customer service! Also their sandwiches and soups are delicious! I got the barbecue sandwich with the tomatoe and the  basil soup and my wife got the spinach artichoke turkey sandwich with the chicken enchiladas soup. We enjoyed both dishes thoroughly!!"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff and diverse fresh ingredients. Reasonable prices and a free chocolate covered strawberry treat. The only recommendation is to beef up the salad sizes a little more, the large salad was a little small."}
{"text":"Ordered a Honey Bacon Club sandwich with a Wisconsin Cauliflower soup (cheese and bacon on top). Along with the meal, you get a piece of perfectly moist French bread to dip in the soup, along with a free strawberry that has been dipped in melted chocolate. The entire meal was absolutely amazing. I highly recommend to anyone and everyone."}
{"text":"I went to your location at Dana Park in Mesa, AZ tonight and felt disgusted by the lack of customer service. I stood in line with about five people ahead of me. When I reached the counter to begin my order, I was never greeted. I stood there long enough to read the name tag of a young girl named Tess, who never looked at me. She stood up against the back counter as if to take a breather from the small dinner rush. So I slowly moved towards the middle of the salad area and was finally greeted by a young lady who paid me a beautiful compliment and continued with her duties. Thinking this would grab the attention of Tess who was taking everyone's order, she still never approached me to ask for my order.

I then moved toward the soup area and placed an order for a large lobster bisque soup. When I got to the register I asked for the manager. The manager looked to be early 20's. When I explained to her that Tess did not greet me and there was a lack of customer service in her store, she smiled (did not apologize) and said she would talk to her. 

She then went down to Tess and exchanged a few words with her. I then asked the cashier who the general manager was and the young manager was called back down to speak with me. She told me the general manager's name and still had no sense of empathy for my concerns, nor did she simply ask \"what can I do to turn your experience around?\" With this simple question, I probably would not be writing this compliant. Again, no sense of empathy for my concerns.

I explained that I would not be paying for the meal due to poor customer service, no apology, and lack of concern. Coincidentally, the only person in the store who greeted me was a young Black girl (keep in mind I am also Black). I feel this was a form of discrimination and I will likely not EVER return to this location. I am a customer service supervisor and I would have handled the situation differently. I believe every customer should be treated with C.A.R.E. (Consideration, Appreciation, Respect & Empathy). I will also be writing a separate letter to the corporate office with my concerns."}
{"text":"Fantastic service, great food, wonderful experience.

I read some of the other reviews for this restaurant that were less than positive and laughed. People apparently can't figure out how to stand in a line and cry over not showing up in time to get lemonade. 

My experience with Cafe Zupas left me completely satisfied. I had a turkey bacon avocado sandwich and half of a chipotle chicken salad. Despite being full after eating this delicious meal, I don't feel bogged down.

The service here was great. Despite being so packed that the line went out the door, the friendly and cheerful staff was not only able to get us served in under a few minutes, but kept us happy with polite conversation in between ordering food.

Eat here. It's a great place. Every penny was well spent."}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat lunch or dinner. The tomato basil soup is the best. The nuts about berries is my husbands favorite salad. This place has my kids eating salads and that's not normal.  Love the idea of giving a bread roll and chocolate covered strawberry with every meal."}
{"text":"1st time dining here and it was great.. there were alot of salads to choose from and dressing i had was so good. You can also mix and make your own drinks.. 

New place to hang out! Will see you soon"}
{"text":"Saw a waitress/cashier receive payment with gloves on, then proceed to putting deserts in the display with the same gloves on...I ate my salad afraid of getting sick and only because I was starving."}
{"text":"Very healthy choices. Everything is always fresh & ready to be prepared just the way you like it. My favorite is the Tomato Basil Soup. Very flavorful & made from scratch. 

No matter how long the line is, they get you thru pretty fast. Always quality friendly service & someone usually opens doors for you. I enjoy eating on the bar which is perfect height for someone in wheelchair. There is not a handicap designated area."}
{"text":"Uncooked tofu ...who eats that?  No wonder vegetarian food has a bad name.
We visited this location twice, the first time I left reasonably happy due to the complimentary chocolate-covered strawberries,  friendly staff, and fresh, vibrant produce. I appreciated the build-my-own salad, but got a bit frustrated when I was told 'no substitutions' on the sandwiches.  I fail to understand why I can't modify the ingredients on a sandwich that is being made fresh in front of me?? 
Enough! I no longer see the real upside to Cafe Zupa.  I won't avoid it but won't make a point to go back.  By the way, maybe consulting a vegetarian or chef who is familiar with the product would help make you create a tofu option that  is a delicious choice."}
{"text":"It's always busy so if your I'm a hurry not the place to be. Food is good but not my favorite. 
Staff is awesome very friendly and nice."}
{"text":"My coworkers and I have ordered out from here a handful of times and each time the orders are right and the food is still fresh or warm when we receive it (we're about a 15 minute drive away). 

First, as far as their options go, the food is fresh and I appreciate all the different tastes you have options for. If you're craving more Southwestern flavors for the day, no problem. If you're in the mood for warm, comfort food, they've got that, too.

This most recent time, I was in charge of picking up the food. I immediately was greeted with a smile and when I told them I wanted to place and take orders to go, an associate asked that I follow him to another register and told me the name of the other associate who would assist me. He gave me a drink while I waited and the ordering process was easy-peasy. They were a lot quicker than I thought they'd be since I walked in and placed my order vs. calling it in.

For a soup and sandwiches place, I felt like a Queen! 

Tips: If you think you want to place a to-go order, do it early as there is a certain point in the day when they stop accepting carry out lunch orders."}
{"text":"Had a great visit to Cafe Zupas today. Had a chicken pesto sandwich of wheat that was super delicious. Staff super friendly. One employee named Dominique greeted us when we came in. She complimented lots of customers as they came thru line. Setting a positive atmosphere and energy.  She treated people with respect and genuinely enjoys her job."}
{"text":"So many soups! Lol, this place is pretty good for a quick affordable meal and there's lots of pictures to help you choose. It's clean with friendly staff and they even give you samples if you want. 

Had a buzy week so I ordered extra soups \"to go\" take home that I could eat another day :)"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! 
You can really taste the food quality with each bite. The staff is always super friendly. Of course I cant leave out the chocolate covered strawberry that accompanies every order. Highly recommend for a quick healthy bite."}
{"text":"This was our first time here and we walked in and the first person asked us what we wanted. I wanted soup and sandwich, oh OK well, you have to go down to the soup bar....que awkwardness. I asked for the chicken enchilada chili soup as pictured and was very specific in my request: as pictured (which was tortilla strips, sour cream and cheese). There was ZERO mention of an up charge, and it was not listed in their menu or anywhere in their prep line. When we checked out, the lady charged us for it and when I asked why she said well because is an up charge. No, not if you show it in the pucture on your menu! The girl seriously just stared at us like we were stupid and then finally said, \"well, that's what we do\" false advertising?? Yikes!
Now that we know they will nickel and dime you but don't tell you till checkout, we may or may not be back, and if we do, it will NOT be for the same things. I hope they read these reviews. They turned a non biased first visit south very quick. No one explained anything. And the soup was lukewarm at best by the time we sat down to eat."}
{"text":"The place has a surprisingly nice variety of soups, salads and sandwiches. Make sure you read all the ingredients though, my wife ordered her bbq chicken salad and it comes with olives which she hates. Seems like every salad there has black olives.

We went with the \"try two\" deal. You get to choose two out of the sandwic, salad, or soup. Went with the mushroom soup and it was tasty. Salad was the chopped chicken and it was ok. Next time will go with sandwich and soup as all the sandwiches looked and sounded good. 

Good price for a nice selection. Something different from your normal fast food chain type food. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I love Zupas! I eat it 4-5 times a week. This location was  really disappointing. The first time I went, my soup, salad and sandwich that I ordered was all wrong. I received everything I didn't order. To top that off the girl gave me an attitude, telling me that's not what I told her...like it was my fault. I order the same exact thing every time I go..so I know that's not on me.  Also... who actually tells the customer they are wrong and didn't say that?!?  Then they completely forgot to give my boyfriend his salad. I decided to try it again tonight, thinking it had been an off day. Everyone there was nice tonight... but they ran out of rolls and didn't tell me until I paid. One of the main reasons I go is because of the bread and soup. I was really upset to find that out. It should be told before you order your food, otherwise I never would have ordered soup. The girl behind me was just as upset about it. One of the girls behind the register was sweet and offered us ciabatta. Then someone, I don't know if it was a shift manager, or what... but she started saying that it wasn't ok to do that and \"blaaahh blah blaahh\". I was annoyed. You ran out of rolls and this employee was trying to make everyone happy... while the person in charge was saying \"no you can't do that\". I just spent $30 something on food... you can give me a piece of frickin bread without complaining! 
When I got home I was realllllyyyy disappointed. I open my salad and it smelled fermented. It literally smells like wine was being made in there. Everything about this salad just looked and tasted bad. I ended up throwing the entire thing away. The only thing that I enjoyed was my soup. This location needs a lot of help."}
{"text":"Ordered the Turkey Bacon Avacado, it was pretty good. next time i will minus the honey mustard sauce though. not a big fan of mustard."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place two stars because of the bad customer service. I just came in and ordered 2 sandwiches and waited 10-15 mins for tomatoes. While waiting for said tomatoes I see two employees through some windows working in the back and thinking to myself \"surely those two are not responsible for the tomatoes because there is no sense of urgency whatsoever considering there's a customer waiting and they are working extremely slowly and having a conversation while they stop working at times\" but nope I was wrong, the gentleman was the one responsible for cutting tomatoes. Finally when he got around to it, it took him 30 seconds to cut them and have them out. I waited all that time for him to finish whatever else he found more important then got to giving the front employees what they needed to finished making a sandwich. Really ridiculous! The only reason I gave them two stars and not one is because I actually like their food too bad customers are not all that important. I should also add that the employees in the front offered me a drink while I wait and a creme brûlée but I didn't want any of those I just wanted my sandwich so I can head to my destination."}
{"text":"The food was ok but I find it very upsetting that you charge extra for each additional item such as my chicken tortilla soup to add tortilla strips cost extra. But when I wanted extra turkey on my sandwich they refuse to do that?? I don't understand...."}
{"text":"Zupas food is really good I'm not going to front, but there policies on skimping you on your order as expensive as it is, is not cool! I ordered a large red roasted pepper & lobster soup and the guy didn't fill up the cup and gave me like 3 croutons, and when I asked for more they charge $.69. What is that all about. Probably why I only come here once or twice a quarter and now not sure if I'll back."}
{"text":"The food is good but not to die for.. Its a little overpriced for the size sandwich you get.  I do however like their italian soda bar. The ambiance is beautiful and its a clean place. I do however like that they give you a chocolate covered strawberry with your meal. Lots of soup and sandwich places to pick from in the area so not going to go for an average over priced sandwich."}
{"text":"I have only dined at Zupas because my daughter likes it. The concept is good, like a better than average cafeteria. They toss your salads in front of you, the soups are ready made and they ladle it into bowls while you wait. The sandwiches are grilled panini style and are made by the time you pay.

I have been here several times and to me the food was a bit average. The only two things that impressed me were the use of Winder Farms butter and the chocolate dipped strawberries. On our visit today, we noticed no Winder Farms butter and chocolate dipped Oreos instead of strawberries. What's happening here?

I had the Wisconsin cauliflower soup and it was, eh... Average. I also ordered the Cobb salad, it was also, eh.  I love Cobb salads and it is my go to salads at restaurants

I can't do it, sorry folks."}
{"text":"I really like the soup most days here. Some days they are too heavy with the salt. Salads are pretty fresh and sandwiches are fine but uninspired. 

Go here if you want quick average food. You get a lot of it so it's perfect if you're really hungry."}
{"text":"Let's start with the fact that the tables here are clean. This alone is a first for the west-valley as most places can't or don't bother to clean their tables between customers. We've eaten a lot of soup and salad here. It's the best and most varied selection of soup and salads right now in Avondale until an actual salad-bar place gets here. Service is okay; lines can get long at lunch time. Please, CZ staff, be proactive in getting people to use your que line that you have set up. 15 seconds of direction from a manager would avoid that long line that stretches back to the door, blocking customer flow. You've got the poles there for this, use them. Our soups have been consistently good with the clam chowder running a bit thin. Standard coke-brand drinks along with some good-tasting infusion choices, too. We like the little strawberries at the end of the meal. There is plenty of space inside for seating, so don't let a full parking lot fool you. We've been there at least once a week for a quick meal."}
{"text":"This place is definitely worth the lunch rush! Perfectly priced for all the food you get.  This place is bomb.com definitely a place to go eat at. Everything is so good!"}
{"text":"Awesome food. So much better than normal fast food. Everything is so fresh and finally another restaurant that had mello yellow. Would definitely recommend and will be my new homegrown soup, salad and  sandwiches."}
{"text":"ohhhh I was doing research on places to eat that were really good to try out and this is one of those places.

Majority all of the reviews were 5 stars and stated to have really yummy food, some of those reviews made me want to try the lobster bisque soup and sandwiches and to me that sound really yummy.

I asked my boyfriend if we could try this place out since it was in the area close by to us and we went.

We went at night time and it was a bit hard to find but Cafe Zupas is near baseline rd, took us a few mins to find it. lol. When we got there, I didn't realize the lighting was super bright with funky light colors. LOL!

It is very casual and very bright at night so just warning you. lol.

Cafe Zupas is hard to describe - basically you choose if you want to eat it there or have it to go. We wanted to eat it there so we were standing and looking a the menus on the wall to see what they have to offer and everything just looked so yummy. A young lady asked me what I wanted and I said I will try the pesto chicken panini and she turned and told several of her crew of my order and I went down the line to be greeted by another lady and told her I wanted to try the lobster bisque then I continued down the line to be greeted by another lady who convinced me and my boyfriend to try their hazelnut creme brulee and we went for it.

If you get the two combo - which is a sandwich and soup you get a piece of bread and a strawberry that is dipped in chocolate. we both got two combos each and it was yummy! I was so full ^_^


It's really nice and soooo good food! I do recommend going to this place. We went here for dinner so we have yet to try coming here for lunch ;)


It is also a good place  if you want to have something light and not too heavy - soup and sandwich is pretty good. They are more of a soup, salad and sandwich type of place and it's very chill too : )"}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant. Everything is delicious including their infused green teas! WHEN ARE YOU COMING TO CALIFORNIA?! Please pretty please...."}
{"text":"One of my favorite soup and salad and sandwich places. I somehow always end up here when a friend wants to meet up. It's very quaint and kept clean. The service is generally pretty quick but I have had some issues with them mixing up my order or trying to charge me for something I didn't order, but I think it's because the process of how they make your order is pretty confusing. 
Their ingredients are super fresh and yummy. I love the cauliflower soup..it doesn't sound good but trust me it is amazing. The pork sandwich is really good too. I think I've tried everything there and I'm usually pretty impressed. A bit overpriced in my opinion but you get giant portions. 
My only real complaint is that they got rid of the Maui Tropical Chicken salad. That salad was to die for and what kept me coming back. I used to go there all the time but I now I rarely visit because they don't have it. I try to ask for recommendations of something similar but the employees are typically clueless, it's okay, haha. Wish they'd bring it back or something similar!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have already visited twice for their opening and we liked it both times. The salads and soups are probably their best thing to get and the reason to go. More than anything I loved the Mango Berry salad. The sandwiches aren't bad either, but they aren't that great of a deal for what they were. The desserts on the other hand are very mediocre and definitely not worth the prices.

We were fortunate enough to go during the opening when we had 50% off our entire order both times, but it seems like a place that may be too expensive to visit without a coupon. The interior is obviously new and is more fancy looking than I expected. Since they serve relatively healthy food that tastes good I had a positive overall first impression."}
{"text":"100 times better than nasty Panera Bread. Loved the layout of the restaurant. They had a pretty big selection of items to choose from. I chose to just go with a bowl of Red pepper lobster bisque. I was given a roll and a chocolate covered strawberry to go with. Oh my that soup was so much better quality than something I'd get at a Panera and I'm pretty sure cheaper too. I do think that their pick two or whatever is a tad bit over priced but overall nothing to outrageously priced. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Veeeeery disappointed with the portions. .. the food is Yummy through! ! Fill the Salad bowls and soup bowls. .."}
{"text":"Kinda pricy but everything has good flavor. Lobster bisque is amazing w chunks of lobster! Turkey sandwich was average, dry microwave bacon, sauce is yummy. Big dessert selection. Fruity waters to pick from. Nice hang out spot or lunch date."}
{"text":"The food was good but over priced. The  place is VERY disjointed. You order salad or sandwich with one guy at the corner, then travel down the corner to order your soup then travel down to pay only to find a confused person asking you what you order so they can find your salad/sandwich. You take your food and family and sit down only to realize you have to walk to other side of the restaurant to get your utensils, drink and napkins. Why can't they either give you the utensils or have them at the counter? I'd love to know the reason. It's really inconvenience to to sit down with your kids to eat then have to get them all up to again to get a spoon to eat the expensive soup you purchased.  The food is good and I do love the chocolate covered strawberries."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. Super clean. Fresh and delicious too. The staff is excellent. 

So far I've had the pesto chicken sandwich (bomb), the lobster and red pepper bisque (double bomb), I sampled the calm chowder (delish). 

My absolute favorite is the Pina colada salad. You must love coconut though. I've dreamed of that salad. Something about the dressing. Mmmmm. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"First time eating here and the food was all yummy.  The soup was just perfect and the sandwich was put together nicely, very unique.  It's a bit pricey for the portion sizes but everything we ate was wonderful.  The crew was pushy about taking our order and moving us along the line.  But I would come back.  It's a good atmosphere to bring kids but don't waste the money on their kids meals since there isn't much to them."}
{"text":"This place just opened up near my work and I'm so excited! We ordered it for pickup for the office at the new location in Avondale and they didn't fail me! The chicken pesto sandwich is delicious. With a great sandwich, soup and salad menu, you can't go wrong. I have eaten at the location in Phx and it was fantastic as well.  Go check them out! You won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Yum, yum, yum!! I love this place!! Their prices are great, the food is amazing and their staff is the friendliest in town!"}
{"text":"Ate there for lunch while staying across the street on business. Had chicken Cobb salad and grilled Cuban. Both outstanding. Free chocolate covered strawberry added to the plate nice touch. Didn't have other dessert which are apparently made on premises but they sure looked good.  This place is nothing fancy at all, but a five star location.  Pretty sure I'll walk across the street and eat there for dinner."}
{"text":"I had always assumed this was a Greek restaurant and never went inside.  To my surprise, it's a Paradise Bakery style sandwich, soup, and salad place!

My honey bacon club ($8.79 with the soup) was okay, but I can't even recall tasting any bacon now that I think about it.  It was VERY dry due to their choice of bread.  It was better when dipped in my bisque.  Unimpressive though.

The lobster bisque had very good flavor for being so cheap, but the array of veggies included (for texture?) was inauthentic and not needed.  They were a distraction from the lobster flavor, and the tomato, carrot, celery, and onion only added unnecessary bulk.  Don't expect it to be super creamy, as it was more watery than a true bisque (it's made with 2% milk instead of cream I bet).

The caramel creme brûlée ($2.99) was fantastic with a crack of sea salt from the salt shaker.  It doesn't have the crunchy brûlée part though, so it's more of a caramel-topped vanilla bean custard.  But creme caramel would be confused with a flan...

The complimentary bread and chocolate-dipped strawberry were nice touches, and in sure customers appreciate the wifi, charging station, and flavored add-in syrups by the soda fountain.

The pricing was very comparable to Paradise, in that slightly-more-than-Subway $10-ish per person level for a sandwich with soup or salad.

Parking can be a nightmare due to the Last Chance shoppers raging in the lot.  However there always is parking if you're willing to walk across the asphalt expanse a little ways."}
{"text":"I loved this place! I have been here a couple of times and every time is just as good as the last. The amount of food that you get is crazy! For around $10.00 I got a big sandwich (California Turkey), half a Mango Berry salad (but it was still huge!), a piece of bread, a chocolate covered strawberry (surprise!), and a drink. Tell me that's a lot of food for very little. I tell everyone I meet to come here. I love that you are able to sample all of the soups. The cauliflower soup is so freaking yummy.... If you love potato soup, you'll like that soup. (plus it's probably better for you!) They offer free wifi and outlets to charge your electronics. This is a great place for students to just hang out and chill. 
 There are two reasons why it didn't get five stars. The first reason is because it is closed on Sundays. I was so excited to go there today and show my friend the awesomeness that is Cafe Zupas but they were closed.... BOO!
Second, while I don't wish for them to be any less enthusiastic, the wait staff are extremely happy. Happy people scare me. They all seem so excited to be there and to help me out. It's a little freaky to be honest. However, it is just one of the charms of Cafe Zupas."}
{"text":"Delicious soups! The Wisconsin Cauliflower was amazing and I don't like cauliflower. Sandwiches and salads too."}
{"text":"Awful service and experience. There were staff slamming down meals because they couldn't slow down enough to listen to the customer and get the order correct.  I asked for a salad without the cheese or tortillas. The third time they got it wrong I spoke to the manager who seemingly could care less; she was too occupied with lunch time crowd to be present with a very dissatisfied customer. Very poor customer service and lack of leadership from the person who was supposed to be the manager.  I would not recommend this establishment. Check out one of the eatery in the area. No one needs to spend hard earned money on rudeness and insensitivity."}
{"text":"On the positive side: Employees were friendly & the decor was contemporary & tasteful. 

Zupe has the vibe of a bustling cafeteria, which is fine if that's what you're in the mood for. They have soup, sandwiches and salads. I wanted something fresh and healthy so I ordered a chicken salad with berries & grapes and stuff. It sounded good but the reality of it was pretty pitiful. It had 3 strips of chicken on it, like 1 strawberry and a few grapes. Something tasted freezer burnt. It was so bland & sad. There's no pride in the preparation. Its made in an assembly line. Someone puts on 1-2 ingredients, then passes it to the next person who adds a couple ingredients. I'm sure its to expedite the process but what ends up happening is food is just thrown together. And as we all know... We eat with our eyes first. 

After a few bites, I had no interest in continuing with the salad. So I opted for the BBQ Pork Sandwich. It was fine. Edible but not great. 

Personally I'm not likely to go back. I'll get my soup/ salad fix at Sweet Tomatoes."}
{"text":"Went yesterday for dinner, Irish stew signs posted all over. As I approached the counter I was told they were out. I was disappointed but stayed for a soup and sandwich. Both were ok at best, but I did not get my chocolate covered strawberry. Not a good experience."}
{"text":"Soup and sandwiches are good. Now for the up keep of the establishment... The floors, mats and tables are always dirty. I seriously need them to do a better job at keeping the restaurant clean. It's rather disgusting."}
{"text":"For a place that's literally named \"soup\" this was probably the worst clam chowder I have ever tried.  Watery thin and so overly salty it was barely edible. Clam was rubbery, low quality & low quantity. Cuban sandwich was a pathetic excuse, for the price the portion of pork was a rip off. $27 for lunch for 2 was robbery considering the portions & questionable quality especially in a cafeteria style environment where you are expected to carry a tray and then bus your own table. One trash can in the middle of the restaurant, sorry, not snaking my way half way across a restaurant, through a maze of tables with a tray full if trash for a $14 soup and salad."}
{"text":"This place was great! I wish I could try everything on the menu. Friendly service, fresh ingredients and chocolate covered strawberries. ZOMG."}
{"text":"I would love to give them a great review, because the menu looked awesome and I was looking forward to ordering some take out today when they opened. However when I called shortly after 11:00, I got a recording saying they were not doing anymore take out orders and advised to place future take out orders BEFORE 9:00 AM?? Who seriously A:) is even thinking about lunch that early and B:) if they are, thinks \"I better order now!\" FAIL Cafe Zupas. Maybe some better planning/staffing on your part should be rethought. I've been in the food business for over twenty years and have never heard of anything so stupid. Sad to say lost customer here because I'm not going to try again."}
{"text":"Great freshly made sandwiches. Half off cream brûlée one hour before closing. Will be back again. Soup was good too. Will be back soon."}
{"text":"Highly recommended if you are looking for a good sandwich, soup and salad casual place... they have a great variety of options. I also really liked the unlimited refills on a few mixed fruit tea options if you want to drink something different from your typical soda fountain options.. only negative about this place is unfortunately they are closed on Sundays"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, and the pictures of their fresh salads on their website looked enticing. So got a group of my co-workers to go for a \"healthy\" lunch. Many of us ordered the combo - which I thought was a half sandwich and a cup of soup - like it is at most places. Instead, it was a whole sandwich and bowl of soup. So much for the healthier smaller portions. Soups were salty. Thai lobster curry did not have a shred of lobster meat in it. Lunch meats used in the sandwiches were cheap and relatively tasteless. One in our group got a salad that \"tasted like fish\" but contained no seafood. They happily exchanged it, though.

But the thing that really chapped my butt was a salesperson who approached our table mid-meal and tried to sell us Silpada jewelry and have us book a party. Apparently, management at this establishment allows that to happen, as she and another salesperson had set up their \"home base\" at a table at the front of the store, with catalogs and gift bags. Let me assure you, when I am out lunching with co-workers under a time limit, I am there to enjoy their company. The last thing I want is to be accosted by a sales presentation! I tried to complain through Zupa's website, but they have no Contact link there for message. Wonder why?

Thank God I didn't see the review here about the cockroach in the salad until after we got back. No need to ever go again."}
{"text":"My daughter had recommended this. The staff was very friendly. She must have been able to tell we had never been there before. She was patient and offered samples of anything we wanted. The food was fresh and good for salad and soup. Nothing, as far as the food goes, stood out that will make me run back to eat here again. I did love that it comes with a chocolate covered strawberry! Very nice touch."}
{"text":"Stopped here for some to go on my way home (Tucson) last night. Was not impressed. Salad was skimpy, they forgot to give me my dressing Tomato soup was extremely sweet.  The only thing I liked was the infused water."}
{"text":"Filtered water is soooo important! The place is amazing but when we first started coming here they had amazing water at their fountain water dispenser and now it's gross faucet water or tastes different... I'll change my review to five stars when they change their water."}
{"text":"Food is great. It is a new location and they are always understaffed. Don't go if your in a hurry or ordering large takeout."}
{"text":"Been here twice and both times had good experience. Service is fast and friendly without pressure to \"hurry up with your order\". Soup was well balanced with flavors. Salad was not too heavily dressed and veggies were super fresh and tasty. I also like the strawberry for a tiny sweet after the meal. Definitely try the house blended drinks made with raw honey, just enough sweetness and very refreshing."}
{"text":"Lauren is amazing. If she's not managing she should be. Awesome worker with great customer service. It was literally the end of the night and she was still smiling and sweet. Food was bomb as always!"}
{"text":"Turkey/bacon sandwich was good. What really won me over was the weekly soup special, white bean & chicken. Awesome soup."}
{"text":"I really do like the food here. The service is usually pretty good. This is one of my favorite places for a quick, healthy, filling meal. They have great seasonal items. I ordered the seasonal protein bowl but they were out of one of the main ingredients. That's happened a few times which is disappointing but there are plenty of other great options to chose from. A couple of my favs are the Salinas Valley Chicken Bowl and the Pesto Chicken sandwich. I would like to voice my discontent with not being given a roll and chocolate covered strawberries with my order regularly. It's hit or miss so be sure to check your bag before you leave!"}
{"text":"Had no idea what the heck Cafe Zupa was until I saw this location & Googled it. I'm a super fan of soup the year round. Yes I know I'm in AZ so that's crazy talk but I love it. For me it's hard to find a good Tomato soup since my Mom cracked open that can of red & white nasty as a kiddo. So when they opened you know that was my go to, to try. I'm happy to report it's complex, chunky goodness. I've had it both times I've been there & loved it both times. Probably not made onsite because of it's uniformity but makes no never mind to me as long as it's the same good each time. The staff is helpful, patient with the newbie to the Cafe. I have tried the turkey sandwich & tasted the hubs clam chowder & lobster sammie too. All were good, prepared as requested with fresh ingredients. I'd recommend this place as a fresh yummy alternative to a burger lunch any day. The deserts look divine but I haven't made it there yet. However included with each combo is a sweet treat of a chocolate dipped strawberry. Can't beat that. YUMMO!"}
{"text":"I've never had an issue with Zupas until recently. Tonight I went to have dinner there. Asked where the strawberries were. I was told they had to dip some more into the chocolate and that they would be brought out to me. It had been more than 15 minutes and they still weren't brought out. I went up to the register to ask about the strawberries and the lady told me that they had to run to the store to get more, which is a lie."}
{"text":"Zupas is pretty awesome! Drove 30 mins from our hotel just to eat here :) the employees are respectful & nice."}
{"text":"I have been a fan for a long time. Anytime I went up to Utah, I would stop in for a quick little lunch. 

I was really excited to get one on the east side, although it was a really good excuse to go to Last Chance in Phoenix (they are in the same parking lot).

I love the Nuts About Berries salad, love. I also love the mushroom and tomato basil soup, but I don't want to know how many calories are in it. 

Each meal also comes with some yummy bread and a chocolate strawberry. They sure know the way to a gals heart.

It's not super fancy, and it feels a little \"chainy,\" if you know what I mean, but overall it's great food for a very reasonable price and the staff has always been really friendly. You can't beat that."}
{"text":"First time here and no regrets.

Cafe Zupas was a cafe that opened up fairly recently, I never considered that it might be good because the zupas places I've been to are very bland or plain boring. I was pleasently surprised that this place was NOTHING like that.

I had the two for $8.99 and a drink $1.99, and for the ammount of food, I thought it was a great deal. Especially considering everything was made in front of you, it's like the better sister of Panera (which isn't bad but in comparison, Cafe Zupas is tastier). I had the pesto chicken and asian salad, which were definatly winners in my book. Then they gave me a bread roll and strawberry, I was confused (because I didn't expect to get either on of them) but I found out later that it was a complimentary thing they did.

But on to my favorite part, the drinks. The signature drinks were pretty epic. There are four of them, and in one sitting I made it a mission to try all of them! The lemonade and the one that tasted like a fresh orange juice were pretty tame. While the pomogranit and the cucumber one's were my favorite! Still, I'd be happy with any of them because they're all so refreshing and not overpowering.

Cafe Zupas is definately on the top of my list for places to go for lunch. Clean atmosphere, great food, delicious drinks, and music in the background made it a wonderful experiance."}
{"text":"Love cafe zupas but horrible experience tonight. We had a fairly large order and had a very small order request to have a different type of tomato placed on the sandwich, to which she said \"we can't cross over between sides..\" And then when we asked for extra crab she stated that they \"can't really do that.\" We were very polite and said it was OK, and then upon checking out, the female manager very sarcastically said \"oh so you just came in and ordered instead of calling it in?\" Felt very disrespected and will likely not return to this location."}
{"text":"Never disappointed with Zupas! Always love coming here with family and friends. The food is fresh and well prepared. The environment is always positive and social. Not to mention, clean!"}
{"text":"The food is really, really good.  Soups and salads are all wonderfully fresh and tasty.  Nice variety and it's quick.  They make it a point to not accept tips, which makes things easier, but I'm afraid it makes the staff surlier.   The bus girl is going around with a perpetual scowl.  Maybe she was being punished.  I don't know....  Also, the manager Scott is an overbearing fool that has to butt in at every possible occasion to make sure the customers know that  the extra's are going to cost extra!  What a shocker!  I have no problem paying an extra $.79 for some apples for my son's fruit cup.  I'd also pay an extra $.79 to see him in the back managing something more than making sure the servers don't give out too many lettuce leaves.   Heaven forbid....   If this chain was smart, they'd can Scott.   I would have given an extra star and a half if not for the sour taste he left in my mouth..."}
{"text":"Welcome to the neighborhood!  Let me explains why only 3-stars...

I was on my way to Paradise (Bakery) and saw a new place had moved in at Dana Park; thought I'd give it a whirl! Selections look YuMmY!  I tried the turkey, spinach, artichoke (spread) panini. They give you a chunk of break and a (small) chocolate covered strawberry with your order.  Set up as a kindof cafeteria.  Service was quick. I asked for a large cup for drinks. The largest they have is about 12oz...that's the largest and ONLY size. They need to work on that. We live in Arizona...a desert...where the humidity is usually SO low that we fill our pool with bird sweat! We drink A LOT to stay hydrated.  Strike One. (It was pointed out that you get free refills, but my order was 'To Go'.  Got back to my office only to find they use turkey coldcuts  :(  No wonder the stryafoam box felt empty. Very disappointed in that. Although, the sandwich was pretty tasty (not real yummy as I had imagined though).  Thus, Strike Two.  Soups looked amazing; got a sample of the veggie cheese chowder. Pretty good.  

All-in-all, first impression is their menu looks better than the food tastes, but I'm going to give it another try, with hopes that as they settle into their new digs, they will make improvements."}
{"text":"A note on my rating: Based on the expectations my friends created for this restaurant, I would give Cafe Zupas two stars. If I have to be entirely objective, I'd give it two and a half stars. Since Yelp doesn't offer half-star increments, I'm reluctantly giving Cafe Zupas three stars.

Why do so many of my friends love this place? I don't know. Could it be because many of them went to school in Utah, where Zupas originates, and the restaurant reminds them of their college glory days? If so, I get that. I, however, did not partake in their college experience so I'm not privy to the nostalgia they must feel when they are greeted by the harsh blue neon that is Cafe Zupas' decor.

The food, while good, is unimpressive. It's just risky enough to be different from your average cafe fare. With more locations popping up in Utah and Arizona (and \"other states to follow soon,\" according to their website), it's apparent that as a restaurant Zupas is more interested in growth (read: profit) than making an impact in the culinary world. In other words, it seems their focus is more on creating a menu that everyone will enjoy rather than true culinary innovation. And there is absolutely nothing wrong with that as long as that's what their going for.

I ate at Cafe Zupas last night for a friend's birthday dinner. I had a honey bacon club panini, which I enjoyed, although it was cold and somehow seemed grow soggier with every bite I took. The shrimp and sausage gumbo soup was alright; I found the shrimp disappointing. It was mealy and the size of shrimp you would find in a Cup of Noodles. For a dish that boasts shrimp as a primary ingredient you'd hope they'd do a bit better on the shrimp."}
{"text":"Good food but portions are soooo small and they literally counted the strawberries they put on my salad! #stingy"}
{"text":"My first time here.  Tried the Wisconsin Cauliflower soup.  Very tasty, but not a very large bowl.  We did not have soup nor sandwiches.  

The reason I did not give it 5 stars, is they were very very slow about busing tables.  One gal even went to a few tables and stacked the remains all one one...the one closest to where customers with their food left the counter.  It seemed ridiculous that she did not just take them in to the kitchen."}
{"text":"After a marathon shopping sesh at Last Chance, my mom & I needed some food! Cafe Zupas did not disappoint. This is a great \"meet someone quick for lunch\" spot.   As everyone has mentioned, the chocolate covered strawberry with every meal is such a nice touch! They were really accomdating when I wanted to sample like every delish looking soup.  My mom really enjoyed the Lobster Bisque, I loved the cauliflower soup.  

The desserts were semi disappointing, but everything else was great.

OH! And my favorite part was that they have all of these different syrups that you can mix into your fountain drink.  it's really fun!"}
{"text":"Ate lunch today with my daughter and the staff was amazing and friendly. The Chicken Protein Cobb Salad was amazing and my daughter enjoyed her Pesto Chicken Sandwich. We even shared the Sea Salt Caramel Brûlée and it was so yummy. Will be going again for sure."}
{"text":"Great Service experience POOR SOUP EXPERIENCE. This location offers a friendly service experience. I can't believe that fresh made soup should taste like they dumped the whole salt shaker in the bowl. The soup was also short on chicken and vegetables, it was mostly broth. I like the place, but with the poor soup quality. It was my first and last experience. I would choose Paradise Bakery for soup over Zupas"}
{"text":"I am a frequent customer at cafe zuppas in the east valley and have been wanting my husband to try it. Finally convinced him to go last night to the location in Avondale which is close to our home. Got to the salad stationed and ordered our salad and sandwiches. Not even a minute after we ordered my husband realized they put mustard on the sand which he ordered and asked the nice lady wearing a red shirt if he can get it without mustard. The young African American man who was making his sandwich, directly in front of us, threw his hands down on the sand which table as if he was throwing a tantrum because my husband asked for no mustard. All he had done so far was get the bread and put mustard on it. It wasn't like he had to remake an entire sandwhich. We obviously saw this and my husband said \"if this is a problem I'll just eat it with mustard\" and then nice lady said \"no it's fine we can remake it\" with a smile. News flash young man, you work at a sand which shop, making sandwiches, you get paid to do this. Everyone else was wonderful and so was the food, per usual. That employee could absolutely use some more training on customer service."}
{"text":"I got the pick 2 option and created my own salad. I agree with other reviewers that the toppings were TINY. You get to pick a protein and 5 toppings--keep in mind that cheeses count as toppings too. Mostly upset that if they were going to skimp on the toppings, at least give us more protein. The herb vinaigrette was pretty good. I also ordered the red pepper lobster as my soup. That was really flavorful and filling. Overall, everything tasted good and fresh but not happy with the portions."}
{"text":"I love Cafe Zupas! I'm so happy we have one in Chandler. I would LOVE a Tempe location too. 
Everything is great here! The prices are very fair too! The salads and sandwiches are yummy! The cauliflower soup is SO good! 
Great vegetarian options."}
{"text":"I'm a little torn... When we are there this afternoon, it was great. My quinoa protein bowl was impeccable, his lobster bisque was amazing and had a full portion. Unfortunately when we ordered a large one Togo before leaving desert ridge, there was just specks of lobster. The container had like 2.5 inches over the top... For the price I paid, I'd expect for it to be a full container and actual chunks of lobster.. I'm glad I picked up a loaf of French bread or me and my fiancé would still be hungry.. the ladies who worked the evening were unbelievably rude, and the cashier rolled her eyes when I asked for my reciept like it was the most difficult damn task she's ever completed..."}
{"text":"Cafe Zupas is now one of my favorite places to go. Get the Try 2 Combo and you'll be so full and the food is so tasty. Plus the chocolate covered strawberry is a perfect touch at the end."}
{"text":"I remember when the first one originally opened on Eastern by the 215, it was like an amazing thing. Healthy salads thats different from the usual salads and stuff. But the only downside was its location being 30 minutes, on a non-busy 215, to get to. Yeah i work near by sometimes but still not something i can get that easily. They had another location on lake mead that was more inconvenient than this location. I rarely on that side of town xD 

When i heard of this location opening up, it was like a god-send XD and had answered my prayers ! (no i didnt pray for this to happen but i did hope one would open on this side of town at some point in time) 

Big open location in a newly developed shopping center, across from the widely popular Arroyo Shopping Center on Rainbow and 215. Only downside is the traffic that is on Rainbow at almost all times of the day ! 

I had came here one day after volunteering to pick up for a few friends as we were meeting up at the office. They've never had Cafe Zupas before so it was a new experience for them. Since nowadays, everyones on the healthy route, it was the perfect pick ! And they loved it !

Their popular try 2 combo is amazing. It includes picking 2 of the following (whole sandwich, half soup, half salad), bread and chocolate dipped strawberry. All for $8.79 

My usual go-to is the Strawberry Harvest Salad (fresh strawberries blanded into a house-made strawberry champagne vinaigrette tossed in house-chopped lettuce, chicken and sliced strawberries, gala apples, cranberries, fontina cheese, and candied pecans) and a sandwich (turkey bacon avocado usually)

This salad is my favorite. It was AMAZING to get this considering i was getting sick of the usual salads from like Sweet Tomatoes. Sweet and savory. Fresh and bright. Soft and crunchy. Holy crap. Lol XD i have gotten this salad ALMOST every time i've went to Cafe Zupas, except now ill probably attempt to try the entire menu again, it being in a more convenient location. Lol xD

Turkey bacon avocado sandwich. How can you say no to avocado? Usually my go-to sandwich as well. Panini style with a crispy outside. 

---------------------------

I had came here again and totally got something different this time around (as i had mentioned earlier, tryin my attempt to try the menu... XD) 

California protein cobb salad with baby field greens, fresh herb vinaigrette, chicken, eggs, bacon, edamame, grape tomatoes, olives, goat cheese, and avocado. the vinaigrette is yummy. i even dipped my bread into it to get more. The salad itself seemed a little smaller than usual. Edamame gives it a nice variety of textures. Goat cheese, was not strong at all, or maybe im one of those who is ok with eating goat cheese. Lol Avocado was scooped by a baller like it was guacamole. Small amount. Wish i get more xD 

Pesto chicken sandwich with home-made pesto chicken, almonds, roasted sweet red peppers, muenster cheese, sprouts and tomatoes. pesto was nice and light. You'd think this sounds like a semi-heavy sandwich but not so bad. Pretty tasty. creamy pesto and muenster cheese sounds like a good combo. tomatoes gives it a nice brightness to it all. 

------------------------------

I still have yet to try the soups but friend said the chowder wasnt bad nor is the lobster bisque. they did mention it was a bit weird that the chowder had chopped celery in it. Maybe ill try a soup next time :3 :D

definitely cravin some zupas right now :("}
{"text":"Portion size of the salads got reduced. I asked for more lettuce ans they added 3 leaves.  What the heck!!! Love this place but it is getting stingy in greens. When we asked why the size were reduced they said it was a policy. Well for $8 will have a salad somewhere else."}
{"text":"I wish there was one closer to where I live.  My kids and I love their food.  They have salads, sandwiches, soup and dessert.  Love this place!!"}
{"text":"I wanted this place to be better than it was. It has so much promise. Soup, salads, sandwiches. Their little desserts are so tantalizing. But, it was just so boring. 

I got the California chicken sandwich and it didn't taste like much of anything. The minestrone was a miss. The little pudding cup (salted caramel?) was so overly sweet and sugary. The salad had nuts and strawberries and it was good but over dressed. The grilled cheese sandwich was the only thing that was really tasty. 

Like I said, I really wanted to like it. Maybe I just got the wrong things. I will try again soon."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times and have generally enjoyed it each time. Even though the service was not up to par the food was. Today I did a mix and match of salads. I did quinoa with mixed greens chicken goat cheese and a few other things. I love their freshly made drinks. Especially the orange strawberry and honey."}
{"text":"I love the food at Cafe Zupas! Great quality and delicious. Only wish they'd pay more attention when they're busy! Husband got us a to-go offer and there was no dressing on my salad. I understand mistakes get made when it's busy, but attention to detail gots a very long way!"}
{"text":"I'm disgusted with the way I was treated by this location on the phone. I've been going to Zupas since the first one opened in Provo. NO MORE!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Hair cooked into food!!! I ordered a grilled cheese for my grandson and a salad for myself. The salad was a small portion for $9, but ok. What was not ok was the hair that was cooked into the grilled cheese. I took it to the counter only to get attitude from the girl at the register. No refund and no apology, just attitude and then another grilled cheese, which I threw out. Check your food before eating."}
{"text":"Favorite place in the area by far! My roommate and I eat here almost everyday. It's great if you need something quick but also want something healthy and fresh."}
{"text":"I actually love their salads and if I'm dining in the restaurant the service is great.  But you cannot order food to go (when you call you get a message saying that they are unable to take phone orders at this time...regardless of what time you call.  And their website has attractive pictures and descriptions but NO nutritional data.  C'mon, get with the program!  Researching the \"unofficial\" nutritional data through other websites reveals that some of the salads are over 800 calories: if this is true that's probably why they don't offer the info, but still there's no excuse to not make that info readily available.  As another reviewer said, Wildflower has a superior product and their website provides all the information needed to make an informed dining decision.  Shame on this company for not making that information readily available.  I would give them 4 stars for their product and 1 star for customer service."}
{"text":"I first tried Cafe Zupas in Salt Lake City, UT, so when I saw that it opened right next to my house, I got excited! It's a great place for a quick lunch. I usually choose the pick 2 combo. You can choose between a sandwich, salad, or soup. I recommend the turkey bacon avocado sandwich, the lobster bisque soup and just about all their salads! You also get a small piece of bread and a chocolate covered strawberry. 

I wish the cafe was a little less crowded with how the tables are arranged. I feel like when I'm eating, I'm literally right next to someone at the next table. Regardless, I'd recommend this place for anyone who loves sandwiches, salads and soups! They provide great customer service, and they're quick as well."}
{"text":"OMG!  Can I just tell you how much I LOVE salad now that I've eaten a Nuts About Berries Salad from Cafe Zupas.  If you know me...you know I'm NOT a rabbit and I have never PURPOSELY gone to get a salad for any reason.  I am now OBSESSED with this salad.  I have also graduated to their soups.  SOOOOOO GOOD!  I bring all of our out of town guests to Cafe Zupas and I get them hooked on it too...they're usually pretty sad when they have to leave and realize there is NO Cafe Zupas near their hometown.  :D  (that's the evil in me)  The staff is great.  The place is always clean.  Their food is DELICIOUS.  If you have NEVER liked salad...trust me...go there...you will change your mind...and your lifestyle.  Who would have thought I would EVER crave a salad???  Crazy!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food, even better service with a staff that went out of their way to make sure my family and I enjoyed our lunch.  My daughter even dropped her sandwich moving from one table to another and one of their staff members who was clearing tables said he'd get her a new one before she could even pick it up. 
Solid place and the price was surprisingly low.  
Recommend the Turkey Cranberry sandwich, the Chop salad and you can't go wrong with any of their soups.
We'll be going back often....."}
{"text":"I love this place and would like to give it a 4 or 5 but please talk to your people about food safety. The nice blonde girl by the strawberry, bread and register station is wearing gloves. She goes back and forth between packaging rolls and strawberries, touching peoples credit cards, money and the register over and over. Never changed a glove. Touching cooked food, Money and the register then back to cooked food is a big no no. Look at Chipotle."}
{"text":"Cafe Zupas is a nice place to meet friends for lunch. They offer three item-types: salads, sandwiches, and soups and you can buy each as an entree or buy 1/2 of 2 items to make a meal (e.g., 1/2 salad and 1/2 soup, 1/2 soup and 1/2 sandwich). They also offer truly delectable desserts.

The ingredients are fresh and the food good; the beverage bar is excellent. The bar includes all the regular soda fountain items and has Torani syrups you can add on your own. In addition, they offer several natural drink options like cucumber green tea and citrus-infused water. With every meal, you receive a piece of bread and chocolate-dipped strawberry. 

The place is always impeccably clean in the restaurant and bathroom. They bus the tables and regularly ask if you need anything (like boxes). 

The reason I don't like Zupas as much as other places is that the food does not fill me. Even when asking for extra lettuce on a salad (including if I pay extra for lettuce), there isn't much. I need lots of lettuce to fill me and even buying two full salads is barely enough. Instead, I go to Cafe Rio across the street because they will pile on the lettuce if you ask. Also, they do not offer bread bowls for their soups so I go to Panera down the street instead. 

Zupas has great food, the restaurant is a wonderful place to meet others, and the staff is great, but the food portions simply don't satiate my hunger."}
{"text":"Really excited for this location to open so close to home! I've missed Cafe Zupas as I haven't gone since I lived closer to their Lake Mead? location. I'm not a fan of the layout, it takes so long to get from the front door to the line and then having to rummage your way over through the tables was uncomfortable. I should have used the side door but wasn't sure if it was an emergency only door when I first arrived. 

I ordered the Mango Berry Salad, it was delicious I just wish they used spinach or a better type of leaf as some of mine were browning otherwise totally a great veggie salad! Also had a cup of soup which was perfect and exactly what I needed to end my day.

The Salad associate was very friendly, warm greeting loved interacting with her. The Soup associate was kind of rude and not friendly at all. The General Manager was very friendly but he made it awkward, very awkward when he kept thinking I was the mom of the kid in front of me in line....no sir I have no kids, nice of you to assume i'm a good mother but no that mother was sitting down and making her kid order all the food and pay not me. So it was just awkward having to stop him from letting the kid almost pay for my meal.

The \"bus girl\" was very nice, she wished me a good evening when I was getting my iced tea to go and that was unexpected. Overall I will totally be back especially for the free chocolate covered strawberry ;)"}
{"text":"First time eating here and 2 things really stand out: GOOD FOOD and CLEAN never mind the smiling faces...everything looks wonderful to eat as well..I had the. Mango salad..simply delicious...also the turkey sandwich..wow!!! Already told the wife and she is siked..."}
{"text":"Perfect meal for lunch if you are planning to sleep post lunch.
They have fresh creamy soup & sandwiches with the bread and chocolate dipped strawberry.
Flavoured soda take the brownie point here.
I love that."}
{"text":"I love zupa's. It cannot be beat.  The price is great especially for what you get. I love the turkey bacon avocado panini, BBQ chicken salad, and the HBC panini.  I love this place!! The flavor is amazing. And they even give you a chocolate dipped strawberry. 
Plus they have lots of amazing drink combinations to choose from. I even got my kids to love salad because this place is so tasty. :)"}
{"text":"Yum!! The west valley needs more places like this. I love the soups, especially in the fall. I love all the food and am totally happy and then I remember the desserts and I am over the top excited!!"}
{"text":"The Red Pepper Lobster Bisque is probably the most delicious soup I've ever heard, soooooo good!  I got the Italian sandwich and it was good as well, nice and fresh.  Customer Service was fantastic.  I was pleased all around and will definitely be a repeat customer, especially since I live in the area."}
{"text":"Wonderful lunch.  I had the red pepper lobster bisque soup and mango berry salad...so good!  My husband had the clam chowder and crab sandwich and he loved his too!"}
{"text":"WOW!!  Top notch staff who are genuinely happy and thankful that you chose their restaurant!  Genuine smiles, not those \"plastic\" smiles that disappear as soon as they say, \"Welcome to blah blah, how can I server you?\"  It's as if today was their grand opening!  They are happy to share how the process works of ordering a soup/sandwich/salad combo of your choosing.  More than enough food for a very reasonable 8 bucks!  (Enough to take back to the office to save for tomorrow's lunch.)  

They offer free samples of their many delectable soups.  The Pumpkin/Chorizo soup's last day on the seasonal menu is today!  :-O  

Loved the bright menu and main eating area, as I also loved the subdued back eating area.  Oh! and flavor choices to add to your soda, to create an Italian soda of your choosing!  

Easily 5-star for a quick and inexpensive, but oh so good lunch!!  I will most certainly be back!"}
{"text":"I was interested to try this new place that just opened up right by my home. When we walked in, I noticed a certain odor right away that I wasn't a fan of. I was also disappointed by their lack of options. Basically you can get a sandwich, soup or salad. And about 3-5 options within those. Only two cheeses and breads to pick from for sandwiches. I like to have more options. I was also disappointed they don't serve kettle chips or anything like that to snack on with your sandwich. But I did enjoy my complimentary chocolate covered strawberry that you get with your sandwich. Not very impressed. Probably won't go back."}
{"text":"I'm really glad we have such a yummy salad & soup place here! We've been there multiple times & always enjoy it! There salads are so good & I can recommend there Chicken Enchilada Soup, because it's the best soup & I crave it all the time! The only thing I would recommend is that they think of a better way to do there like & check out because it gets confusing & you really have to watch your food, otherwise there is a chance of it getting mixed up. Other than that I would definitely recommend them!"}
{"text":"I love this place! A friend told me to try Zupas and I'm so glad I did. The food is delicious and even the leftovers taste great the next day. I've been eating there for the past 2 years. The only downside is they get very busy during the lunch hour so there is a little bit of a wait. That's what happens when you make good food!"}
{"text":"Overrated big time. Portions are small. Food is okay tasting nothing to write home about. Soup selection is not great. Mostly creamy soups and don't even have good old chicken noodle. Dessert looks good but are waaaay too sweet. Panini was greasy, small and somewhat empty of contents. This place is basically a gimmick. 3 stars because it's edible and service was friendly and they give you a complimentary chocolate covered strawberry and cold roll to go with your meal. Also not sure they use clean gloves when handling lettuce. Keep an eye on them. You also have to repeat your order about 4 times which is a strange system. I've been meaning to try this place due to the hype and I won't be back. Too expensive for mediocre food."}
{"text":"Came here for coworker's birthday.

Pretty good food! Wonderful, healthy options. I got the turkey bacon avocado, and although it may not look the best, it was pretty good. Was honestly sad that I finished it because the flavors in the sandwich paired well. Also got to try some of their desserts. Some were a little too heavy and sweet, but pretty good for just a few bites."}
{"text":"Best tasting ice in town! Food isn't as healthy as you think. They don't have a nutrition lost of their menu. Once they release one people won't eat there as much. Good sandwiches. Salty soups. But the ICE is awesome!!"}
{"text":"What up y'all? The food at Café Zupas is great. The salads are fresh and dressings are tasty. The sandwiches are flavorful. The annoying thing that brings this review down to 2 stars is the annoying ordering process. You walk in and trying to read the menu and the salad Nazi is already asking what you want. Dude, I just walked in, give me a freaking minute. As I order a chicken chopped salad with blue cheese, I'm already attacked again by the sandwich guy. I haven't decided which sandwich yet because they have a lot of choices. I finally make my choice of the turkey and avocado. As I walk towards the register the soup bandit hounds me to buy soup. No, I already ordered the salad and sandwich and if they were paying attention would know that's all I wanted and then no, I wouldn't want any soup. As I get closer to the register, I can see the desserts. I love desserts. They are a weakness. That weakness is easily overcome by pushy counter people. Give me a damn min to look. Instantly I get turned off and just go right to the register. The best part is, now after getting hounded by 2 other people after you place your salad and sandwich order and feeling the pushy tactics of what should be a simple process, they ask you what did you order? REALLY??? I have to remember the name of what I ordered because the pushy sales of the counter people don't remember and or pass the information down to the register. Honestly, this is a joke and needs to be corrected. I love the food, it's just the service and way of ordering the food is such a pain in the ass that I will take my business elsewhere. Till next time........Let's Eat!!!"}
{"text":"I would give this place 5 stars for the flavor of the food and the portions alone. But I took a star off because for some reason they decided to remove my favorite sandwich from the menu. The tai peanut chicken sandwich was taken off the menu about a year ago. I would go there for this alone but all the soups are wonderful as well. All the employees laugh when I ask for that sandwich every time I go in and they always say \"we don't know why it's gone, it was really popular\". When I wrote the company to ask them to put it back on the menu I got the stiff arm! They said \" we are glad to hear you liked that sandwich but we are sure you will learn to like the carnitas sandwich\". Really?  You're wrong. I stopped going for a long period of time but found other things on the menu I like too so we are now going back. Then a while back they stop giving you the really nice cheese croutons for the soup and started putting out normal run of the mill croutons for the same price. I think the people running this chain aren't concerned with there customers opinions at all.  Thanks !"}
{"text":"I went for the 1st time last week and the sandwich was really tasty but the people working were very disorganized. I went back today and again, disorganized. They were barely busy and my salad had ingredients I asked to be left off and they forgot my sauce. And the sandwich was just not as tasty. I think management needs to step up their game and organize. Instead of everyone doing several jobs, have one person do one job. And make it so the Customer doesn't have to repeat their order to the cashier."}
{"text":"The food is just ok. Soup is ridiculously overpriced and not that great at $6 for a bowl.

They offer syrups with the soda machine, but good luck making an italian soda because they won't give you half and half. I want to be clear, it's not that they don't have half and half, they do (I saw 6 gallons in the kitchen just from where I was standing in line) and they will not give it to you at any price. If they are unwilling to provide something so simple as a mere ounce of half and half when they have plenty, you can only imagine what else they won't do. I offered to pay for it and they still said I can't have any. They had the gall to suggest I should bring my own. Cause I've always wanted to be carrying around all the condiments I might need for the day. I've been trying to talk to somebody about this, but their management is impossible to reach.

I just can't believe a company would spend so much money on marketing and then be completely unwilling to address a customer's concerns. 

So go ahead and try cafe zupas, and if you like it exactly how they serve it, good for you. Good luck if you want it \"your way,\" their attitude is \"eff you, go to Burger King.\""}
{"text":"Not bad. 

Warm friendly service. The assistant manager was very kind and friendly.

Food was good. The rolls came out cold. The soup was okay. The chowder on one hand met the bread really well. The tomato basil was a little sweeter at this location. The sandwiches were nice. Every pain served was crunchy on the outside soft on the inside. The only thing I disliked was the tomatoes. Sometimes they were cut too thick and they were bland overall, but you'd expect that of basic American tomatoes lol.

Overall, would eat again. Always down for a quick fix."}
{"text":"What happened to this place. I wanted extra chicken and they said they gave it to me and it looks like what I normally get. There are A LOT of kids that work here. They don't know what they are doing. Once there was bacon in my food and because of my religion I couldn't eat it so I took it up there and told the girl and she just look right through me and said oh sorry. Wtf can you fix it. They need adults to work there because these teenagers don't know what they are donling. Constantly messing up my order. I'm done going back."}
{"text":"I had the Mangoberry salad and the crab avocado melt, both were delicious. The salad was the best in my mind"}
{"text":"I'm a Café Zupas fan.  I am!  However, I realized over the weekend while visiting this location that every time I've been to Café Zupas I've always ordered the same things. I normally order the Turkey Spinach Artichoke Panni, California Turkey Sandwich, California Protein Cobb Salad, Kale and Quinoa Salad, Roasted Pepper Soup or the New England Clam Chowder.  I've been to Café Zupas more times than I can count because I can walk to the Camelback location.  My visit to the Gilbert location made me realize I never wrote a Yelp review on it.  I'm a fan of Café Zupas because the combo is accompanied with a nice, juicy, sweet chocolate covered strawberry.  They also serve a variety of flavored teas and sodas. 

While visiting the Gilbert location over the weekend I decided to try something else because I noticed pictures for seasonal items.  Someone standing directly in front of me asked if the Crab Patty Melt had real crab meat.  The worker said No.  The guy asked if the Lobster Bisque was made with real lobster.  She said No.  Bummer ... I wanted to try the Crab Patty Melt this time.  When it was my turn to order I asked if I could have the Pesto Chicken sandwich without almonds. She said the almonds are mixed into the chicken, along with raisins.  Which means the Pesto Chicken Sandwich is really Chicken Salad with pesto spread on the bread.  It's not necessarily a pesto chicken sandwich.  It's a chicken salad sandwich.  We left because we didn't want chicken salad, nor did we want fake crab meat on a sandwich.  I'm still a fan of Café Zupas just a few words to wise.  Any seafood item is made is imitation meat and the Pesto chicken sandwich is a chicken salad sandwich really."}
{"text":"I was visiting from SoCal for my nieces college graduation. We didn't want to eat anything heavy cause they were having a party tomorrow after the graduation.  I ordered Kale & Quinoa salad and Tomato Basil with Orzo Pasta. The salad was great after eating the salad you get sick and tired of eating the salad cause all you taste was the just dressing. I felt like they drowned the WHOLE salad in dressing!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch today to try something new because friends recommended it. Looked good, until the guy making my sandwich wiped his nose with his wrist and continued to make my sandwich. That just soured me. I asked the person running the register if I could have another one made because of that and she said, \"We usually use our arm, but I'll talk to him.\" What I really wanted to hear is that they wash their hands and arms before touching food again. Or, if you have a runny nose, how about running the register and not making food? 

That grossed me out. But I still tried the grilled cheese anyway. Glad I asked for pesto on the side because it was strong and not very pesto. Couldn't identify what flavor was so strong. It looked like green mayo with basil or something in it. The grilled cheese panini was pressed so thin it was the flattest sandwich I've ever eaten. It tasted okay. 

My husband liked his pork sandwich though and the place was cheap. Especially for kids meals. We tried the sinful chocolate cake and it was meh. 

Not as clean as I like. I don't see a need to revisit."}
{"text":"I work in close proximity and had stopped coming here because of the service, but I tried it again and am so happy that the staff is friendly and helpful now. Jenelle is welcoming and good for the team! Of course I love the strawberry harvest salad so it's a win win again"}
{"text":"Food is pretty good for a healthy lifestyle. However, they have become so popular that customer service is not important. The managers there cannot make any exceptions to satisfy the customer. For example, they ran out of the large soup cups and was providing 2 small cups to substitute. I did not appreciate this, however this happened for about a week and I grew accustomed to the change and decided I can save half for later in a smaller container which was good. I revisited the Las Vegas Location and they had received the large cups. I requested 2 small cups and even asked the manager who said they meet the request. I told her that I visited the location almost daily (close to my job) and she still insisted she could not even after I expressed the inconvenience they had put on us the customer with no complaints. Their take out rules vary depending on who you speak with. Also, once I asked for an extra chocolate covered strawberry instead of the bread (that I would only throw away) no give from the manager. Poor, poor customer service and managers!!!"}
{"text":"First time at any CZ and we loved it! We got the \"Try 2\" so we could try different things. I got the BBQ Chicken salad and Chicken Enchilada Chili soup. They will offer you extra shredded cheese on top but don't pay it. Not necessary. It is already super cheesy goodness! I have to say the chicken enchilada chili soup is WONDERFUL!!!! If I got that alone it would be easy 5 stars. The salad was good tasting, super fresh and all BUT there was too much BBQ dressing so near the end it got to be really sweet. Also I had to send it back just as I sat down as I ordered it with no onions, I heard the girl repeat it to the girl making the salad but onions still were on it. I'm allergic to onions so can't eat that like it was. My friend got the \"Try 2\" option also. He got the Yucatan chicken tortilla soup. This is very onion-y, brothy but he said it was ok. Although he didn't finish it so I know it wasn't great. He also got the Nuts About Berries salad. He loved it and I loved it as well. I had to try it. He would definitely get that again. Overall, very friendly staff, we will definitely go back."}
{"text":"DO NOT COME IN HERE thinking this place is healthy.  My review is based on that assumption and less on the quality of food.  All their salad dressings are LOADED with sugar.  You can't  just get plain oil and vinegar....only several sugar sauce options.  I went with the herb vinagerette and was mortified by how sweet it was.  They then give you a white, processed roll and a hard chocolate covered strawberry....so basically I ate none of it. My mistake, but I had no idea.  People seem to like all this as there were people in there, but not happy with my sweetened experience.   I went to their website, and of course any detail is not available...I'm sure because it's all sugar and preservatives.  Yuck."}
{"text":"Love this place! Today I tried the Honey Cilantro Carnitas sandwich and chicken enchilada chili and wOw the flavors!  Delicious! 
Great customer service and chocolate covered strawberries with every meal.... not sure why I don't come here more often =)"}
{"text":"Just found a hair in my chicken enchilada soup and when I went back to the counter to complain, the person said we'll get you another that happens often. I don't understand why the servers don't have to where hairnets if they are handling food for preparation???? Needless to say that will be my last time going there!"}
{"text":"I visit this Cafe Zupas regularly in the evening when I've had a long workday and the last thing I want to do is make dinner. Every time I walk in I am greeted with the best customer service. I am pretty sure Belinda has been there each and every night. I can tell that Belinda has amazing work ethic and takes pride in what she does. An employee like her is hard to find."}
{"text":"After previously visiting Cafe Zupas at Dana Park a few times, I was definitely excited to find out there was one closer to home at Chandler mall. Their sandwiches and Salads and deserts are all excellent.

I would have given them 5 stars but was very disappointed to find out that they no longer offer my favorite which was the Thai Chicken Sandwich and Salad with the peanut sauce. They totally did away with it. Hopefully they will bring it back."}
{"text":"Don't be turned away by the 4 stars this place is really good, and the service was outstanding polite, these people need to go work for Disney World they were so nice and friendly!! So I'm in town for a few days and wanted to get some soup, and was recommended by a native to try CAFE ZUPAS and she didn't steer me wrong.  They had about 10 different soups to choose from, and not just your typical boring soups either. in addition to the soup you have CYO salad, you cant go wrong with the 1/2 and 1/2 soup, salad combo. We had the wild mushroom (OMG YUMMY), Chicken Chipotle (not for me but sis loved it) and the lobster bisque (this is why I'm giving it 4 stars) was too fishy. Now I'm from the east coast and have had my fair share of true lobster bisque from \"The Cape\" (cape cod for those of you who haven't been) so i feel i have enough to stand on to say it wasn't good. Other then that its a great place, food, service and clean!!"}
{"text":"The million dollar bar is worth a million dollars. Best dessert bar I have ever tasted.

The salads get drowned in dressing. They must confuse soup and salad? That was our only complaint. Sandwiches were very good, unlike a few reviews we had plenty of salad ingredients... No skimping (seriously, cool it on the dressing).

Better sandwich selection than paradise, and the million dollar bar is better than any cookie at paradise (a very overrated place IMO).

We'll be back for more."}
{"text":"No Caesar salad for a salad place??? I just wanted a simple chicken Caesar salad and was told they don't carry Caesar dressing. What???"}
{"text":"Quality is going down. Soups don't look like they are getting turned (it's obvious on the thick soups) I even found a large pick in my sandwich when I opened it the last time I was there."}
{"text":"I usually love zupas
TYLER in the white jacket looks like he was training someone was so rude to my husband and I and the following guests behind us, talking to all of us like we were idiots and we were annoying.. will be back to zupas but not this location."}
{"text":"Fresh, healthy and tasty; can't go wrong with that!! Just wish the line to order went a bit faster."}
{"text":"Forgot to give a review for this lovely location even though we've been over 5 times now. My husband had never been before and absolutely fell in love with the flavors of the sandwiches, soups and limitless drinks. Every time we go out this is where he wants to go. We usually get the half a sandwich and soup or salad combo for the quality at $9.79 isn't too bad. If you ask for samples of soups it's a great way not to get stuck with something you may not fully enjoy. I really liked the chicken tortilla and lobster bisque with a turkey bacon avocado sandwich or the pesto chicken. My husband loves the Cuban Grilled Pork. The desserts are artfully crafted little beautiful morsels that you can share if desired. We had the chocolate mousse cake and chocolate creme brûlée and as an added extra bonus a bread roll plus a chocolate covered strawberry is complimentary with each meal. With unlimited refreshing drinks such as cucumber mint infusions sweetened with raw honey you can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"We love love this place.  It's a bit pricey but less than Panera overall. 

The soups are super hot
Salads are amazingly fresh 
Always get dessert 

The sandwiches are all equally good and original.   We love the pesto chicken salad panini mmmmmm :)"}
{"text":"I use to love zupas! Went probably twice a month for about six months. And I just left the sunset road location. Asked if everyone on my salad was okay (because they have them prestocked) I say no I don't want the cheese. I walk to the counter, with a tray full of my friends and not mine. The cashier informs me that my food is being remade because it was made with cheese. Strike one. Then after about five minutes my salad comes out. Then the moment my friend takes a bite of his sandwich, the big hair is inside his food, I inform the manager, she says oh okay I'll remake it for you. She remakes it or whatever, hands it to us and says let me know if this is okay. Then I look at my salad and in the corner of my salad that was already remade had a little blonde hair in it. Strike three. Manager never stopped by a second time to see if everything was okay. And that's strike four. Will not be returning. Sweet tomatoes is around the corner. Little more pricey but at least I know if I find a hair in a salad it's gonna be mine. Oh well."}
{"text":"My rating is based on their recent postcard mailing for the Lake Mead location.  Their grand opening offer was good August 1st-3rd, however, the postcard didn't arrive until Saturday and since we were out for several hours, didn't get the mail until too late to use it.  Whoever they used for marketing screwed up.  Our office has ordered lunch a few times from the Eastern location and it was great in the beginning but the last salad did not seem fresh or flavorful.  Since I live near the new Lake Mead location, I was hoping to see if it might be better and would have loved to use the offer since it was a good one.  But doesn't do residents much good if not mailed timely.  We get our mail everyday and it definitely was in the 8/3 mail, the last day of the offer."}
{"text":"I will start this off by saying I hate the ordering system at these type of restaurants. So that taints my opinion a bit.  They do the same thing at Paradise Bakery where they make you stand in a crazy long line and wait behind everyone that is ordering some random thing. If you don't want a salad then why do I have to wait behind the four people that have no idea what they want on theirs?  If I want soup can I just skip them? It seems rude so I never do I just wait.  The veggie quinoa soup I ordered was 25% quinoa and 50% salt.  I was glad I got a sandwich or I wouldn't have had anything to eat.  My California Turkey sandwich was pretty good. I liked the smashed avocado as you get a lot more than the few measly slices they give you other places.  All in all this place is just not my cup of tea."}
{"text":"Cheap and yummy! And pretty healthy too!

Where can you get a kids meal for $3 nowadays? At Zupas! Where can you get a huge adult meal for $8 nowadays?! Zupas! 

I love Zupas' fresh combos. I get the mushroom bisque and turkey bacon avocado sandwich. I can never finish it all! It's so much food. Oh and did I mention every meal comes with a free chocolate covered strawberry? It's only the perfect dessert for any and every meal! The kids meal comes with your choice of two items (chicken strips, grilled cheese, soup, or fresh fruits) for about $3. You can't get a kids meal like that anywhere else! And everything is made fresh in front of you!

Service is very good and friendly and there is lots of parking.

Tip: There is an Italian soda fountain area where you can make your own mixes! Yay! Also, if you aren't sure what soup to get, you can taste them all!!"}
{"text":"Love this place!!! They have salads, soups, sandwiches, and cool deserts!. Has the feel of a cafeteria but a very modern one. The reason i gave them only 4 out of five is because YOU need to remember what you ordered and if its crazy or you have a large party it can get confusing. Theres a combo option which is less than 8 but make sure you get that size or your order will be more pricy. I also disliked that they are closed on Sundays... They give you a piece of bread  for each soup you order and they give you free chocolate dip strawberries! So mo need to purchase desert! But their deserts are delish"}
{"text":"I had a work lunch catered from here and the staff was extremely helpful and accommodating.  The price was right and everyone loved the food, 40 boxed lunches and each one was correct with names written on them, made my life much easier.  Will definitely be ordering from them again and recommending to other co-workers for catered meetings.  Thank you Cafe Zupas!"}
{"text":"I have ordered Zupas on two separate occasions for our office luncheon.  They are always extremely friendly and helpful on the phone when ordering and the delivery girls are super friendly as well.  The food is inexpensive and good.  The Lobster Bisque is my favorite!"}
{"text":"love the food, but customer service is terrible. camry and justin made my visit to zupas extremely uncomfortable. they were both super rude and impatient. makes me never wanna come here again."}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise. We wanted to try a new place and saw Cafe Zupa while driving by.  Excellent selection,  quality,  portions,  value and service.  Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Come here sometimes cuz it's close to my house but it's been twice that the strawberries have mold on it and they act like it's not a big deal. The white girl in the cashier spot said \"we can't take food back so if you toss that one away I can give you another one\" hopefully this gets fixed cuz it's honesty disgusting seeing that l"}
{"text":"After having a couple not so good experiences at this location, I have to admit, management is doing their job right because they have improved significantly. Every time I come in they are extremely busy but also very quick and make sure to double-check orders, meet every guests need, and they keep the place clean and welcoming! They cross their t's and dot their i's! Every employee seems to be pretty happy and genuinely pleased to help you AND to see returning faces! I'll be coming back for sure! #ultiforlife"}
{"text":"Cafe Zupas is super delicious! Ordering food is very easy and it's great being able to make combos! The place is brightly colored and inviting. I was very pleased with the enthusiastic and friendly employees. got a salad and soup which I found both to be very fresh and tasty. Each meal also comes with a chocolate covered strawberry, what a great ending to a meal!"}
{"text":"If you haven't been, you MUST go for lunch or even after work to pick up dinner to go. It's SO FRESH and they have so many yummy options of soups, salads and sandwiches. PLUS they give you a free Belgian chocolate dipped strawberry with each meal!!! My personal favorite part.

The Wisconsin Cauliflower soup is now in my top 3 of fave soups ever in the world. Tastes like a creamy, pureed cheesy potato soup. They also give free soup samples! The chicken tortilla is also very delicious. Great broth flavor!

My favorite salads are the Strawberry Harvest Chicken Salad and the Chipotle Glazed. I love the pulled pork option for the chipotle glazed salad because it's not fatty at all and the texture is amazing and the flavors go so well together. The glaze is to die for! Adds a perfect sweetness to the salad. The strawberry harvest comes with their house made strawberry vinaigrette which is also to die for.

My favorite sandwich is the ultimate grilled cheese but all I've tried are delicious. The service is beyond impressive. Everyone is smiling, super helpful and speedy! So even if there's a line out the door, which there very well could be, especially at noon, it doesn't take too terribly long to go through it.

Only con is the loud music. We have to yell to hear each other and that's just not fun when trying to catch up with friends."}
{"text":"Really disappointed with the management and communication of this store. I had an interview at 4. I sat and waited for an hour until I walked up to the girls and asked why no one had met with me yet. They said they don't do interviews on Fridays because they have meetings and someone shouldn't have scheduled me then. I don't mind if there's a miscommunication and if they could have told me by 4:15 (once they realized it was going to be awhile and that it wasn't typical to have interviews his day!) but I waited and had to ask three people while I waited for an hour what was going on. They would say it's just going to be a minute or they're almost done. None of this was ever true. They should have told me so I could reschedule early and not waste my afternoon sitting alone. But after an hour, I politely excused myself and will not be following up with an interview after this. No longer interested in this company and will not ever go out to eat here."}
{"text":"We went for the first time the other day! It was great I had the BBQ chicken salad combo with the turkey bacon avocado sandwich! Amazing! My husband had the Cuban sandwich and the lobster main soup! Amazing! Love how you get a chocolate covered strawberry! So good we are about to go eat there dinner!!! You guys blow Panera bread OUT OF THE GAME!  See ya guys in a hour!"}
{"text":"Packed for lunch but very worth the wait. They have their salad portion down perfectly. Everything was fresh and the staffs assembly line seems very well trained and work very good with each other."}
{"text":"They served my wife rotten meat. She ordered the same sandwich for both of us and mine tasted great like it usually does but after her first bite she said it tasted funny. I finished my sandwich and she offered me hers, and I obliged like the good hungry husband I am. I bit into it and it came right back out. Something was wrong. I opened the sandwich up and dissected it until I found the culprit. The ham was definitely passed expiration. An employee asked how our meal was and we told her about the meat and she apologized and said she'd look into it. But nothing was \"fixed.\" She paid $10 for a rotten sandwich. Probably won't be going back, but we did enjoy our previous meals here"}
{"text":"We had a bad experience the first time we tried this place when it first opened a couple years ago.  We thought enough time has gone by that we should give it another chance, since their salads look so good on their website menu.  What a waste of our time!  We ordered a large protein Cobb salad which barely looked anything like the one on their website.  It was just under $8, which is way overpriced for what amounted to what would be a small side salad at most places.  Also ordered a large bowl of chicken enchilada chili.  Without stirring up the pot, the server dished out two scoops of broth from the top of the pot which had none of the beans, chicken or corn settled on the bottom.  When this was mentioned, the server said we didn't have to get it if we didn't want it.  We spoke with a manager and ended up getting a refund and leaving.  Sorry there's no picture.  The manager scurried the salad away as fast as she could when my husband tried to get a picture of it.  My husband made me promise to NEVER try this place again.  An easy promise to keep!"}
{"text":"Should try the salad here! Fresh and offering many options to choose. I don't like the soup here because the textures are a bit weird and was not as tasty as I wanted. the Pull pork sandwich was okay but I might or might not order again cuz i don't get much impression for this first try unfortunately. Will be back here if I'm hungry since it's just right on my way back home from school everyday."}
{"text":"Their food is good, never been disappointed with flavor, just very pricey for what you get, and I have gotten bad service a few times from there. I got a sandwich and soup to go one time and when I was paying, I noticed the the soup container was only 2/3 full. I looked at the receipt- yep, I paid like $8 for a bowl of soup. I brought that to the staffs attention, and they argued with me stating that was the correct amount. I mentioned that I have been there many many times before, and had always had a full container. They continued to argue with me. Really? they argued with me on a $34 bill over half a ladel of soup they have always put in there before. Needless to say, we used to go there weekly- been 6 months and have not been back since. Zupas, you may have tasty food, but there are plenty of places that value their customers, and you are not one of them. You may not care about loosing a customer, but I will patron somewhere else that cares about gaining a customer."}
{"text":"Had this for lunch did not expect the place to be that good. It's a good concept of mixing soups, salads and Sandwiches on a meal at a very affordable price. Service was good which wasnt expected for a Fast Food place definitely a must try venue. If this place keeps opening we might be looking the next Chipotle sensation."}
{"text":"The sandwich was absolutely amazing and perfectly toasted. With the New England clam chowder was so runny it was like water and extremely disappointing with no flavor. The lobster bisque seem to be a much better choice today"}
{"text":"This was our first visit. The food was wonderful!  I had the crab sandwich and Lobster bisque.  My wife had the chicken tortilla soup. Great stuff!"}
{"text":"Love the clean and quiet ambiance. It's quick and it's fresh. I'm not too fond of Mexican food but I always order the chicken enchilada soup or like today, I ordered the Yucatan chicken tortilla soup. Why? Cause it's good! I'll try the salads next time and I don't even like salad!"}
{"text":"Hubs and I have been there twice now, and have enjoyed it a lot.  So far, I've had the Cuban sandwich with a Summer Chicken salad, both were incredibly yummy, and my 2nd visit was an Ultimate Grilled Cheese with Roasted Red Pepper Lobster soup, also both quite yummy.  

I also got the Sea Salt Caramel Creme Brulee and, while it's not a true creme brulee, it's decadent.  I could only eat a small bit of that, though, due to the intense sweetness of the caramel.  Hubs didn't mind ;)

He got the Honey Cilantro Carnitas with Tomato Basil soup on the first visit and the Italian Club sandwich with a German Sausage soup on the 2nd.  

Everything got devoured despite the quantities being huge (though Hubs had to eat half of mine in addition to all of his, he was up to the challenge)

We will definitely be back, this place is now on our lunch favorites list :D"}
{"text":"Really liked this place. Cool atmosphere, loved my meal and the price was good. Had the Asian BBQ pork sandwich and the chicken tortilla chili which were both very good. I'm from out of town but would come here again, and would certainly eat here if they opened one near my home town."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Most of time I get soup and salad (california protein) but I replaced the greens with kale to add more protein. I highly recommend this place. All employees are awesome and do a excellent work. I eat here twice a week my son."}
{"text":"I will continue to leave one star yelp reviews until they provide a tipping option for their employees. They are great. Always smiling, friendly, and working hard to prepare the orders. They deserved to be tipped."}
{"text":"This is such a great little lunch spot. The soups are always fresh and tasty...just tried the mushroom bisque...delicious. (I usually go for the Wisconsin Cauliflower) The sandwiches are good, but can be hit or miss. The pulled pork is usually a safe bet. The salads are amazing...never disappoint. The BBQ chicken is great. And the chocolate covered strawberries are the icing on the cake. I should really eat here more."}
{"text":"Try it for the first time today. If you are going to advertise lobster bisque \"pack with real lobster\"my ass. It all imitation chunk of crab meat. So nasty!!!  We also order the crab avocado melt. Again it full of imitation crab meat."}
{"text":"I have to admit to being very surprised by this place. We went in as an afterthought and are very glad we did. We ordered the Cuban Pork sandwich (holy crap that's good, easily on par with those at fancier places), the grilled cheese (not as good, but still tasty), clam chowder (very good), red pepper & lobster soup (amazing, but unless you love the richness of lobster, you won't be able to finish it), and some fruit (not bad, but not much variety). The food was quick and very affordable. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Got a large salad and my friend got a half a salad and at the end of the line they both looked identical.  Had to buy a sandwich so I could get filled up and ended up costing me $15. Portions to small versus the cost.  Staff was friendly but my last time going here."}
{"text":"I've never had a bad experience here. The people are always nice, friendly and helpful. The food always tastes AMAZING and I've never had anything that didn't taste good so definitely try something new every time you come here. Only complaint is when cooperate changed the bread a while back, not as good as it used to be (but I don't need the extra calories anyway so it worked in my favor haha) definitely one of my favorite quick but not too quick lunch options."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. I usually stick to either the California protein Cobb or the nuts about berry salad. Both are delicious. The grilled cheese is also very good. The cauliflower soup is sinfully good as well as the tomato bisque. The service is always quick so it's a great place to pickup food to go or to sit down and eat. The added chocolate strawberry makes the meal."}
{"text":"Two stars only because the chicken enchilada soup is always good, but the customer service is very lacking: The boy employees here are rude. You say \"thank you\" and aren't even acknowledged. Same with the female cashier. They act like they are all put out to down the very bare minimum. Well at least the food is decent.




Edit:
As I was finishing my meal with my mom, a homeless lady walked in walking from table to table with a sign asking for money. Is management even paying attention to who walks in here?"}
{"text":"I love the place and the food, but I'm gonna dedicate my good comment to talk about the staffs who work there, mostly the manager of this branch at Desert Ridge, who went above and beyond of his duties, cuz he rescue my cellphone and it was late at night, so he even wait for me that night passing his hour shift time, cuz they already had closed the place that day He was my hero that night! Lol  Thanks!"}
{"text":"Cant add meat to a sandwich but you can add meat to a salad!? Soups are very watery and the methodology used for the ordering process is riddled with human errors. However the staff are awesome. Sasha will take that extra time to get your order right which was very nice!"}
{"text":"First timer. Food was ok. First thing I noticed was the two preparers talking behind my back because I asked for no pesto on the grilled cheese. Said \"I guess we should just sharpie that off the menu\". Cool little place, but just a but of an immature/elitist staff"}
{"text":"My friend and I went tot he zupas on Rainbow and 215 in Las Vegas, NV today and she asked for menu items with NO QUINOA because she is very allergic. She asked the lady in the front multiple times and then asked if the wheat bread had any and they adamantly said NO. As soon as she took a bite she could feel her face getting itchy and swelling. We asked the employee and he said no it has no quinoa in it. Then he comes back 5 min later and says actually it does. By this time she was swelling and she had to run out to get Benadryl. The GM there was rude and asked \"what do you expect me to do? Next time ask a manager\". This was insane. So not only did they give us the wrong information and cause an allergic reaction, but then they blamed it on her!!! You should be ashamed. You don't care about customers at all. I will never step foot in there again."}
{"text":"Food is great for the style it is. But Nothing spectacular. Our kids love it, especially the tomato basil soup.  Only complaint is that you have to repeat your orders about 3 times to 3 different people before you pay. Very annoying. They should do something about that so you only order one time."}
{"text":"Our little dinner group - there were 4 of us - all said the same thing... so much better than Panera!  Fresh salad ingredients, a very good choice of soups, a clean restaurant and the delicious chocolate-covered strawberry made this our new choice for a nice lunch or dinner out."}
{"text":"Wow! Loved it!! Was hesitant because of long line but man it was worth it! Only downfall was they were out of the orange berry mixed drink:(! They have coke products atleast so it saved them there.  The line moves nice and fast, the kitchen looked beautiful and everyone seemed to have it down employee wise as to what they were doing.   
I got to go- A veggie sandwhich- loved the bread and was a good mix! Quinoa on it would have just topped it off.
Cobb salad-yum and a lot of bacon!
Chocolate hazelnut creamer brûlée-yum yum yummmmm! Came in a cute little cup too that I will be keeping:)
And comes with a chocolate covered strawberry and a piece of French baguette! Yum!
Recommend and will defiantly go again!!"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I went to the new location off of  Stephanie and Sunset in Henderson. It was amazing.  Very good food at good prices. Our only complaint was that they only had two dressing choices for the salads. Blue cheese and Ranch."}
{"text":"Great Food and Prices.  Staff very nice.  And you get a free strawberry with your order."}
{"text":"Food and menu selection is great, although who doesn't have a chicken noodle? Anyway, the system is flawed. I mean when you go in and place an order say for a family of 4, or goodness a whole office, then when you get down the line to pay, they want you to repeat the whole order again! Are you kidding me??? I don't know I just told you! Secondly, I am a young fit person, so this isn't laziness but if you place an order to go, say of soup, I would like a spoon to be put into the bag. Crazy idea right?? They make you go over to where the utensils and drinks are, again think of someone who comes here on a quick break during lunch rush, you should toss a spoon in their bag and out the door they go, no you want to send them to the crowded drink area just for a spoon. Inconvenient and silly if you ask me!"}
{"text":"It is very clean and the staff is very friendly but I will say ordering was more complicated than it should be. they wanted to make sure we understood the menu and how to order which was great but when I ordered and going down the line I had to repeat my order 3 times. I assume that will clear and be better given they've only been open for 2 weeks. As for the food I ordered the Cuban sandwich and mushroom soup. the soup was great but the sandwich I had had a fishy taste to it which I wasn't too fond of. I will come back and try a different combination. I love the passion tea unsweetened"}
{"text":"Speechless! 

Food, smile - everything \"A\"

Good luck to you guys at this location! 

Thank you"}
{"text":"I am a courier at one of the biggest companies in the world and I went in there 2 weeks ago i ordered 2 large soups..1 was the lobster bisque, I swear I got 1 small piece of lobster in the entire soup...so disappointed..then today I go in and I asked for just a cup to grab some ice and the girl there wanted to charge me $ 2.38 for a cup of ice.?!! REALLY.!! I am your courier..i deliver to you on a daily basis..never agsin will i buy anything from this location in Avondale on W McDowell Rd..I would give them 0 stars if I could..really disappointed at this place"}
{"text":"Café Zupas is my favorite place to eat in Las Vegas.  It has a pleasant atmosphere, terrific staff, the best salads, soups and sandwiches.  The portions are adequate.  They have many combos to choose from.  It's a welcome change from the big restaurants."}
{"text":"Nice place!  Went here for lunch today and had a pretty solid meal.  I love how clean and well organized the place is.  It has an industrial feel with lots of stainless and high ceilings.  Everything is impeccably clean and new looking giving the place a great vibe. Bathrooms were also clean and have touchless towels which always scores points with me.  Comfortable seating and great staff that actually seem like they enjoy working there.

I had a Cuban Panini that was pretty good and a bowl of roasted pepper and lobster bisque soup that was flavored well.  Prices we fair and a chocolate strawberry was a nice touch.  I was asked if I wanted croutons in my soup \"for extra\" which seams silly.  A crouton is a lightly seasoned piece of stale bread which has to be one of the cheapest items in the kitchen so this was a little \"off\" given their theme and price point.  

All in all a solid lunch spot that I prefer to Paradise which is just next door."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times - food is pretty good!  You have to be careful though - a lot of these \"healthy\" places may put a lot of salt in your food.  It feels that way to me anyway so I may feel better about eating the food there but it may not necessarily be great for me.  With that said though, the salad is made quite fresh as is their sandwiches.  They also have a nice variety of desserts. Beware!  We've only had their choco covered strawberries though.  The service is great and the setup/décor is nice, too."}
{"text":"We've been going to the Zupas in Peoria.  Nice to have a bit closer.  Nice location, good food.  The salad dressing is a bit too sweet but I just put half in and it works out fine.  Love the bread there!"}
{"text":"I was introduced to this restaurant by my daughter and when she said the name to me and suggested we go there, i grumbled and said, NO it sounds like that Mexican place I don't like, she looked at me and said, \"well it's not at all like that\" and when she explained it to me, i said sure let's try it.  That was 3 weeks ago and I've eaten here at least 6 times since. I love it, convenient location, fresh food, great desserts, quick service and for under $10 you get a fantastic meal. The food is consistently good, fresh and prepared right in front of you. Not sure on a soup you might like, they have at least 8 to choose from, all delicious and vegetarian friendly options too, best part, ask for a sample so you can make a good choice. The salads are crisp, fresh and bursting with flavor. They manage to put the perfect amount of dressing on every time. My favorites are Lobster Bisque soup with strawberry chicken salad, yum. The grilled cheese and mushroom soup is another i like as well as  the red pepper lobster soup, its all so good. Try it, trust me you simply will NOT be disappointed. Oh and the other great thing they do, is EVERY order gets a fresh Belgian chocolate covered strawberry FREE"}
{"text":"Great place for fresh and healthy food.  Everyone in the line is very helpful and everything moves along quickly.  For a sandwich/salad/soup shop it is a bit on the pricier side but still worth it."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place. Their food is tasty and they have awesome customer service. 

My 2 year old accidentally dropped her plate on the floor when she was less than half done. I went back to the counter to order another meal for her and as I was about to pay I was having a conversation with the gentleman behind the counter and mentioned why I was buying another meal. He handed my money back to me and said I certainly didn't need to buy another meal, accidents happen and they were happy to take care of it. They didn't have to do that since it was in no way their fault! 

They don't have the BEST food, but I have enjoyed everything I've gotten so far. The chocolate covered strawberries are a nice treat!"}
{"text":"I like zups a lot because of the strawberry at the end of the meal but the soup and sandwiches are good too, I don't eat salad"}
{"text":"Excellent for rocket surgeons!

If you love the kind of place where you can participate in watching the process like a hawk and correcting it frequently, this is the place for you! You will have ample opportunity to observe employee mistakes (conducted with great apathy), reminding them countless times of what they forgot, and having them get it wrong anyhow. If this thrills you, this is your adventure calling. 

This is our fourth visit. On our first visit, they were new, and we chalked it up to opening jitters. On our second visit we had a large group - mistakes were expected. On our third visit, we saw how busy they were and it was no surprise they kept tripping over themselves.  However, this time, there were three of us, and nobody in line ahead of us nor following us. It became incredibly obvious that this incompetency is built right into the culture and employee training. 

If I want rocket surgery, I'll go to NASA, thank you. If I want a sandwich or a salad, there are a hundred other places to go that do things right."}
{"text":"I eat here everytime I go to Vegas. This place is great it's some of my favorite food. They have every soup/sandwich/ salad you could think of. I only get one of three things because I'm vegan but their berry salad, garden veggie and Quinoa  soup, and vegan sandwich are great."}
{"text":"My husband and I just moved here, and had never eaten/heard of the restaurant before. I happened to order a carry out lunch for a work mtng(which I wasn't eating at). All of my order looked so delicious, that I drug my husband back for dinner that night!  Our food and beverages were yummy(but I personally wouldn't order the mushroom bisque again). I had the protein Cobb salad with soup, and my hubby had the crab avocado melt with the same soup. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We have been customers of ZUPAS Desert Ridge for quite a while now with about 4 -6 visits a month. Quality hasn't been as good lately and tonight due to an error on the stores ordering they didn't have regular bottled water.  Typically they have 33 oz Smart Water for $2 each and tonight they sold us Dasani 16 oz for the same price.  Thinking this was an oversight and being a regular customer, the manager said...Nope that's what corporate was telling them to charge for a smaller bottle.  So their mistake of supplies is costing me the same for a smaller bottle and they don't care.  She didn't even say, sorry this is what I am told I have to do and act like she felt sorry.  I mean everyone has times where things don't all work out and I can understand that but not caring and just Oh Well You will Pay More For My Mistake in Ordering...doesn't make me like to go back.  So unfortunately acting like you don't care and quality of food has gotten gradually less consistent and poor...we won't be going back."}
{"text":"I have been here twice.  Both experiences were great.
The food is so fresh and the pricing is very reasonable to what you're getting in return.
This place is super clean, the staff are extremely accommodating and friendly but still professional.
So far, I have tried several different items including desert which is mouth watering mm mm and each visit was satisfying.
I look forward to my following visits to test out their large menu of fresh, healthy yet fillings meals.
I am definitely bringing my family & friends here next time they visit.  I take their menus to work too and share the delicacy."}
{"text":"Two words \"Lobster Bisque\". Oh its heavenly good. The salads as fresh as it gets. This is one of my new favorites. Too bad there isn't one close to work for me. I would probably be there two or three times a week easily."}
{"text":"Worst service ever.  Waited in line 20 minutes and still hadn't passed the soup station.  Watched them give away food that was part of our order to other customers and then ask the people behind us what soup they wanted before asking us.  Walked out and won't be back, to any location, ever."}
{"text":"Was excited to try a new place, but probably won't be back. Nothing wrong - food was OK (not amazing) and employees were friendly.  But it's a bit pricey for soup and sandwich - $32 for soup and sandwiches for two seems like a lot for average food. Food is ordered, picked up and paid for before sitting - although they clear dirty tables, there is no table service.

In all, just average and expensive."}
{"text":"What can I say except that this is my kids first choice of places to eat in chandler.  The food always tastes fresh, the sandwiches and soups are absolutely delicious.  We all love being able to see our food get prepared, and it's nice to know what when I order a bowl of soup, it isn't coming out of a little plastic bag.  The ability to taste the different soups before committing to one puts Zupas heads above other similar places."}
{"text":"Just came here for a to go order and they basically got everything wrong. I ordered a spinach berry salad and a fresh herb chicken sandwhich.  When I get home, I realize there's no dressing with the salad. I call them to let them know that I'm going to come back to pick it up. When I get back, a girl with dark braids and glasses goes \"are you here for the dressing?\"  and I say \"yeah for the spinach salad? Thank you\" and she hands it to me. That's it. No sorry, you're welcome, or sorry for the inconvenience. Literally silence. As if that's not upsetting enough, I come home again to realize that my fresh herb chicken is actually pesto chicken instead. I'd call back, but it doesn't seem like they care about messing up their customer's order. Will never be returning. Don't come here unless you want to waste your time running back and forth because they can't get a simple order right. Plenty of other sandwhich/salad places in town."}
{"text":"For dining in: Decent customer service, good location, plenty of seating at the camelback location and clean. Tasty sandwiches and soup ( they allow you to sample the soup), but not the best of salad combinations. Poor presentation of food, especially for take out. The food looks sad and lame when plated. 
For take out: I called(6pm on a Sat) and got a recording saying that at this time they cannot take any orders over the phone for take out because they were \"booked and cannot take anymore take out orders because they fill up fast and to call before 9am!!!!!\" LOL. IS THIS A  JOKE??!! WTF??  Dumb and irritating! So, we went in, stood in line with ONE PERSON in front of us and ordered our take out!"}
{"text":"Ok, so I this is the 2nd time I have eaten here and the food is just meh and way OVERPRICED for what they give you.  I wish I had taken a picture of my plate, but my TINY, FLAT chicken pesto sandwich looked so lonely all by itself.   You don't get a pickle, a single chip (unless you buy a bag) or anything!!  Oh wait, you get a tiny chocolate dipped strawberry.  Honestly, I would rather have chips or a small salad instead of a strawberry.  I don't think I will bring my family here anymore.  I hate places that are all about every penny they can make off of you instead  of the value they provide to their customers."}
{"text":"This restaurant is the best place to come when you're out and about. They use fresh ingredients and provide a complimentary chocolate covered strawberry with each meal. The sandwiches are a normal sized and not overbearing. No need for leftovers. Ultimate grilled cheese sandwich with pesto was the best group pled cheese I have ever had! YUM! The desserts looked delicious while waiting in the line - will have to try some next time."}
{"text":"For some reason the ordering process in this place always pisses me off. How many times do I have to repeat myself. The whole point of an assembly line is to increase speed and efficiency.

The food is good. The chowders are salty most of the time, but sometimes they have a new soup that tastes amazing. Ask for samples. I've tried the pesto chicken sandwich and loved it. You get a chocolate covered strawberry for dessert. A consolation prize for having to deal with the people who work in that traumatizing assembly line."}
{"text":"I'm impressed this spot manages to stay so busy in a plaza with so many other quick lunch options, including a Panera. And there's another location just a couple blocks north at Lake Mead. But this spot always seems to have a line. Luckily, it goes fast.

I usually do the pick-two, and more often than not opt for the mushroom soup because it's consistently amazing. Their seasonal specials are worth checking out too- they had a Mexican pork sandwich that I ate nearly twice a week til it was gone! I've never had an issue with freshness or service here, but the constant questions in the ordering process (add-ons for cheese, nuts, garnishes, etc) can get overwhelming on your first visit or if you're placing a large order for a group."}
{"text":"Even though you took away the balsamic vinegar and the Olive oil in separate containers so I can put it on my salad which pisses me off to no end you make a crapy balsamic dressing that I can't stand.  On top of that, my favorite place that used to love to eat has the worst service humanly possible. There were he 2 idiots in charge tonight  May 15, 2018 at 8:46. The 2 idiots in charge argued with a girl for like 45 minutes over an $11 salad when my husband & I paid @ $25 had to wait and our salads got warm for them to argue over something stupid. I really hope that you do better training and bring back the balsamic vinegar and olive oil."}
{"text":"My sister and I found this place about two weeks before I moved away, and I'm sad to say that there isn't a Cafe Zupas where I live now because best believe I'd be there on a weekly basis! What I love about this place is that it's not greasy fast food. It's fast, sure, but the quality of the food is so much better to me than anywhere else. Actually, that's not even the only thing I love about this place, I just love this place.

Every time I come in I order what is to me one fantastic lunch: the Italian club sandwich and a half size of the mangoberry salad. The sandwich is great, don't get me wrong, the lettuce is nice and crunchy and the bread is just soft enough and the meat is good, but what REALLY draws me to this place, what really keeps me coming back for more, is that heavenly mangoberry salad (with extra cinnamon almonds). I'm a fruit salad type of girl so this just hits the spot for me. They use a spring mix in the salad so the sweetness of the fruit and dressing is balanced by the occasional spiciness of the radicchio. I would recommend this salad to everyone I know, I just love it!

As for the place itself, it's roomy, it's clean, and I've yet to have a bad experience here. The service is so friendly, which is great, but honestly I'm just there for the food. I don't think anyone could go wrong here, because they have a variety of sandwiches on ciabatta bread or paninis, salads (or feel free to make your own), and soups that I've yet to try. Long story short: good stuff, two thumbs up."}
{"text":"Never been here before. Wanted soup to go. I ask for the large container because I wanted \"that much\" soup. The young girl leaves at least 1.5 inch space at the top. I ask if it's sold by the weight or by the container size. She says it's sold by the container. I asked her to please fill my container to the top. She said no. You get two scoops and that's all. I ordered large because I wanted that much soup... I won't have to worry about it again though. First and last visit. PS- Lobster Bisque doesn't have course vegetables in it. And don't give me this \"It's our own variation\" crap. Veggies in LB are fillers."}
{"text":"I honestly feel bad about about giving this cafe only two stars today.  The service was prompt, friendly and efficient but the food was not.  My Kale and Quinoa salad which was made with blueberries, grapes, parmesan cheese, cherries and nuts was tossed nicely but with a tasteless dressing.  The Yucatan Chicken Tortilla soup had a tasty broth but was a tad salty.  One of my diing partners ordered the Lobster Bisque and was turned off by the saltiness of the soup.  She paid for croutons as an extra, tried adding extra crackers to balance the soup but she still could not enjoy it.  The kitchen staff kindly gave sour cream to blend in but that didn't work.  She sampled the New England Clam Chowder but that too had an off the chart salt reading.  She ended up ordering the Crab Avocado Melt instead and the kind staff brought it to our table no charge.  That's great service!  I have dined at the Camelback location and had wonderful experiences.  Perhaps it could be that this location just opened up earlier this month and needs time to get things down pat.   I will return to Cafe Zupas for they usually serve up wonderful meals.  I'll give it a few months.  :)"}
{"text":"Love their food and the assistant manager Chris was professional, upbeat and a great multitasker! Now please Zupas open one in Tempe: )"}
{"text":"My favorite Zupas by far!!
First time here I was impressed! The staff was everywhere to be found-- one person opened the door and greeted you right away, one person was there to help with suggestions or questions about the food, people going down the \"assembly line\" when ordering and a few more at the register! 

They have a good list of soups, salads and sandwiches to choose from -- and if you want you can do a combo, you choose two for $7.99! 

I'm not a salad fan at all .. but I LOVE CAFE ZUPAS salads! I can seriously eat it all day! The few salads I've had are the : Nuts about Berries and the MangoBerry! 
Yes! I love the sweeter salads! The nuts, berries/fruits and dressing mix so well with each other, it's the perfect pair with a more savory sandwich or soup! In my case I like their Clam Chowder! Creamy with just the right amount of clams, chunks of potatoes and topped with bacon!

I've had a couple bites of their sandwiches and they're ok. Good but nothing that stands out!

Their dishes come with bread and a chocolate covered strawberry! 
They have a whole display of desserts (cakes, brownies, cookies and creme brûlées) I have yet to try out!

Very affordable, healthy, and great for lunch dates!"}
{"text":"After staying closer to this place for more than 2 months, I finally made my way here one evening. Ordered a large bowl of roasted red pepper and lobster soup, and I must say I found my favorite soup joint in happy valley. The portion size was decent and the soup was the epitome of creamy tangy deliciousness. It smelt amazing and I had to dig in the moment I sat down and burnt my tongue in the process(damage already done) but I still kept shoveling it in because it was the best soup I've ever had! They also give you a free chocolate dipped strawberry which is good and the place looks very clean and is milling with students, probably the free wifi. I will definitely be revisiting with company as this place is too good to pass up. And it's 4 stars and not 5 because although the soup was really tasty, I wish they had adjusted the temperature right and not have me write this review the next morning nursing my burnt tongue."}
{"text":"I'm addicted. Cafe Zupas is my go-to spot for lunch on work days if I didn't pack my lunch.

Normally, I hate \"cafeteria style\" restaurants because the lines are slow and it can be frustrating to navigate, but Zupas makes the process easy. There is one employee per section and they make sure that the line goes fast with always friendly service. You're also free to sample stuff if you're on the fence about what to choose. The only downside about their system is sometimes they get orders confused and that really holds up the line, but that rarely happens.

The menu is pretty big and there's lots of healthy options. I love the variety of salads that they have available and I have yet to try a salad that I don't like. Their soups are really good too. The sandwiches are hit or miss. My chicken pesto sandwich was swimming in cheese and missing the pesto that I was craving. They also have an awesome selection of desserts and house made drinks. 

The prices are cheap if you take into consideration the portion sizes and quality of food. You just can't beat it. Just go!"}
{"text":"First I need to start by saying my fiancé and I are Vegan.  Not a very big vegan/vegetarian selection.  As a vegan you would think a soup and salad place would be a good choice.  The portions are tiny and not very filling.  They have so many employees, it didn't seem efficient.  The portion scoops for your custom built salad yielded a serving size comparable to a teaspoon. When you ask for more they charge you or use another of your 6 inclusive toppings scoops. The prices were decent for the portions. Service wasn't memorable, which is to be expected at $10 a plate. Probly won't return, considering the all you can eat salad bar at sweet tomatoes is relatively commensurate as far as produce quality, yet boasts more options. The one vegan Soup was great, a little salty, but not unbearable. The wilted and soggy lettuce was a bit of a turn off, but too insignificant to warrant complaining. Over all not great for vegans, and would be estimated to be pretty good for meat eaters but no better than a panera or other salad bar in our opinion."}
{"text":"The was my 1st time visiting this store, and it will be my last time as well.  I ordered Combo Lobster Bisque (medium soup) and Combo Cuban Pork Sandwich.  I had a soup mix-in with Croutons that cost extra, are you for real?  Who charges extra for croutons?  The food was good and they let you sample their soup before buying, but extra for something that's suppose to be free?  I am NOT coming back and I will NOT recommend this place."}
{"text":"First time stopping in here and it was a delight!  I was immediately greeted by the super friendly staff.  From placing my order to paying for my meal, they were all professional, courteous and smiling!  Great customer service!

Now ~ they have many many items to choose from.   Ultimately decided on the Turkey Cranberry Gourmet Sandwich and the Wisconsin Cauliflower soup.   This is part of the pick 2 for $7.99.   Nice!  I was used to the Panera pick 2 when it only comes with 1/2 sandwich but here it is the whole sandwich!  Fantastic! 

The Turkey Cranberry is served on a ciabatta bread roll with sprouts, cucumber, cheese, mixed greens and house made honey mustard.  This was a fabulous combination of ingredients that my taste buds sure did enjoy! The great thing about their ciabatta bread is it was soft and not flaky.  Sometimes that type of bread can be really tough to chew but they have theirs figured out.  

Now for the soup.  Some people might cringe at the fact of eating cauliflower. The Wisconsin Cauliflower soup was really great! It has a flavor and texture of potato cheese soup! I see more and more recipes using cauliflower instead of potatoes.  Cuts calories and healthier (I think or that's what I'm telling myself).  My opinion is the soup was great and give it a try!

BONUS BONUS BONUS~~~ Their sandwiches come with a chocolate covered strawberry! The strawberry was fresh and the chocolate had a great non-bitter flavor! 

I am thrilled about Cafe Zupas! A great place!"}
{"text":"Hmmmm. You stand in line to order: first the salad stuff even if you aren't getting a salad, then the soups (and order your sandwich) and then the desserts, oh, yes, and then you pay AND wait for your order. Water? Spoons? Napkins? in yet another area. Tables so close together that it's difficult to walk thru w/ a (very full) tray. Warning, spoiler: the CRAB in the crab sandwich is actually the imitation stuff (you know-Krab). The lobster in the two \"lobster\" soups? You guessed it. I think they may, however, wave a real lobster over the pot. The soup I got was tasty, but not hot enough. One of the other people in our group actually had her soup exchanged for something else because it was neither hot nor tasty. Thumbs up for the exchange. Each order comes with a strawberry dipped in chocolate. Howz 'bouts dumping the strawberry and work on the quality of the food. Problem areas include no area for wheel chairs or even someone on crutches, and, even scarier, a very small sign pretty much saying that you might have an allergy problem but it isn't their fault because they warned you there might be \"cross contamination\" of foods."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick lunch with the hubs. The outside patio is cute but overlooks the parking lot. The menu is a simple concept, salad, soup and sandwich. The con here is it's a fairly high placed menu and not easy to read. I asked for a paper menu but they had done away with them, bummer. He got a standard cobb salad and I got the veggie quinoa soup. It's soup, it's salad, pretty standard. I love that they give you a chocolate strawberry to complete your meal, that's a nice surprise. I'd come again in a pinch."}
{"text":"Surimi I don't like it
Not the Zupas
Not the Zupas

Apologies to Joe Strummer and pals. Hmmm. Friend of mine likes this place for some reason and wants to meet here for dinner often enough. We usually get a soup and a sandwich but every soup I've had here seems to be high on salt - enough salt to get you high. Maybe it's just me but meh. Also their krab sandwiches have that fake crab - I get it - real crab is more expensive but I'd rather pay more and get the real thing or not have it at all. Place is in the strip mall restaurant row between the 101 to the east and Chandler village drive to the west. Plenty of parking. Probably won't be back. Friend will have to suck it up and agree on another place."}
{"text":"Super customer service today!  We were greeted by every employee we passed.  Even my daughter noticed.  Her panini must have been good for by the time I had a chance to take a photo, this is all that was left!"}
{"text":"The best crab sandwhich I have ever had. I love their bbq salad. Its so refreshing and delicious.  This place is so good that even their takeout is worth it. I took 1/2 the sandwhich to go and it was just as good an hour later . I would recommend this place to anyone"}
{"text":"Such a quick and easy stop for dinner- and I'm totally guilty of coming multiple times a week for dinner! Always fast, fresh and delicious! The staff is super nice, the restaurant is very clean and well kept and the food is great!"}
{"text":"My company orders from this place for lunch all the time, and I usually love it. But today, a coworker picked up soup for me because I'm sick. She ordered the roasted vegetable and quinoa, but they gave her a creamy lobster soup which was the last thing I wanted to eat given my cold. They also forgot to include bread. 

I couldn't leave work for several more hours, so after missing my lunch, I finally went to exchange the soup. When I got there, they exchanged the soup, but when I asked if there was anything else they could do to improve my experience and encourage me to come back again, the manager was not empowered to do much. He did give me extra soup, but when I got home, there was NO QUINOA at all in the soup and only a negligible amount of vegetables. It's essentially just broth -- not worth the time or the money. 

Needless to say, unless Zupas can empower their staff to do more for their customers, I won't be spending my own money there again. Big thumbs down on customer service and value for your money. 

Hope it was worth the $8 you stole from a sick person today, Zupas!"}
{"text":"The servers on the line are very patient and helpful which can't be easy with us idiots staring with our mouths open at all the options.  Every time I have been here the food is fresh and good.  I will keep coming here."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time today. Got a turkey sandwich and strawberry salad to go. As I was eating this delicious salad, I decided to check out my sandwich. And guess what!? Everything was there until I noticed, THERE WAS NO TURKEY! Tried to call the number on the receipt (702) 978-4444. That number is useless. It's a repeat of a recording. You don't get to speak with anybody. So I had to drive back up there and tell them what happened. They made me another sandwich immediately. It was quite frustrating for that wasted SO MUCH time of my short lunch. So please CHECK YOUR FOOD BEFORE LEAVING HERE!"}
{"text":"I have been eating at Cafe Zupas for about 5 years (other location in AZ). I used to be very pleased with the food, the quality, serving size and service. Over the past few years the service and quality of food has diminished. I still love the Wisconsin cauliflower soup which has been a staple but the consistency of the soup fluctuates. Recently also noticed how the serving sizes are significantly smaller if you place an order to go on salads. I would have been better off having them make my salad like I was going to eat there to get a normal size. I don't eat here as much as I use to because of the reasons stated above."}
{"text":"Great place for a healthy lunch.  Quick salads and sandwiches and great tasting soups.  I do wish they would put a little more chicken on the salad unless you get double there is barely any on it."}
{"text":"Great area. So addicted to their food. The Maui Tropical Chicken Salad is out of this world with the pineapple vinaigrette. Turkey spinach artichoke sandwich spectacular. Love the little display of hot sauces. Many good soups. One of my favorite places to eat."}
{"text":"It's just okay. The first time I visited, Cafe Zupas had  just opened and the food and service were pretty good. It wasn't excellent, but pretty good. I went back after awhile and the sandwiches were soggy, the soup was watery, and the service was slow. The employees obviously didn't want to be there.

The lemonade is delicious, so if you go, get a big cup of it. It's probably the best thing there."}
{"text":"This location of Cafe Zupas did not disappoint! 

The service here is phenomenal.  Every employee from being greeted to ordering to paying were smiling and so friendly.  They really make you feel welcome.  

I will say I love the grilled pesto chicken sandwich.  It's filled with pesto chicken salad, almonds, red peppers, muenster cheese, sprouts and tomatoes.  Delicious! Their soups are also fantastic.  The Wisconsin cauliflower is probably my favorite even though I do enjoy many of their options.  When I order the choose 2, they give you a whole sandwich and the bowl of soup is huge! Very filling! 

I absolutely enjoy eating here.  Delicious food topped with great service. Win Win!"}
{"text":"If I could give it a negative rating I would. The only good thing I have to say was it was cheap and you get what you pay for, be forewarned. 

So I went with the soup and salad combo. Got the Lobster Bisque, I was excited because I love Lobster Bisque, this is NOT Lobster Bisque, it should be called creamy vegetable soup, no seafood flavor and not a hint of Lobster. I really thought that Bon Chef Cafe had the worst Lobster Bisque I ever had, but Cafe Zupas topped them. I suggest the owners go try Ventano's Lobster Bisque, so they know what real Lobster Bisque tastes like.

The salad I picked was Chopped chicken salad. If there was an ounce of meat in this I would be surprised, also got it with Blue Cheese dressing, again if there was an ounce of dressing on it I would be surprised, flavorless salad and vegetable soup is not what I ordered, but it is what I received.  

Finally with this fabulous meal, we received Bread and what they call Chocolate dipped Strawberries. The bread is like a thick slice of Wonder Bread. The Chocolate dipped strawberries are dipped on one side, but once you try it you are glad they didn't cover the whole strawberry in that cheap waxy chocolate."}
{"text":"Polite staff. Need to work on keeping tables clean. Food is tasty but I am really on the fence if it is worth the money. Reminds me of a semi dirty hospital lobby. Not really thrilled about the menu. But maybe I am not their demographic... I just got that impression when walking through the line."}
{"text":"Delicious food!  I love how fresh everything looks and tastes.  Service is quick, staff is friendly.  I like the fact I can taste the soup before buying and especially love the chocolate covered strawberry with the meal!  I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Ever since Cafe Zupas came out with their new salads, the Asian Citrus Chicken salad has been my favorite salad to order here. The Yuzu Miso vinaigrette is made in house and perfect when you are craving sweet and fruity flavors. Edamame, cashews are not only crunchy yummies but healthier for you too! OMG...Im soo addicted, I just had to update my review and share!  

Another reason for this update is gotta give props to their staff. I swear they are the most cheerful bunch. Patient too. I happen to be there when a couple of customers were giving them a hard time. I had to restrain myself from saying something and strangling them myself!  CZ staff handled the annoying people in stride and with a smile. I sure hope the company takes care of their workers. 

If you ever order your salad  to-go, know that they pack your salads nicely, dressing is in a separate container so when you open your container your salad is still crisp. 

And if you happen to be there the last few minutes before closing, they offer the desserts at 1/2 off.  Well at least the time I was there they did! Pretty sweet!"}
{"text":"Fast forward one week later: My AP Yelp family wanted to get together here after our post workout.  It's a good thing you can mix your combo. I passed up sandwiches  and got a soup/salad combo.  On this visit my combo choice was their Vermont Blueberry salad and Cauliflower Bisque. The Vermont Blueberry salad was so good, that I did a ninja check in today and repeated that same order....and bought a bunch of strawberries on top of my free strawberry. Okay now Im a bigger fan of Cafe Zupas. Especially for their Blueberry salad."}
{"text":"Came on a Saturday 1:30pm and it's still crazy packed here for lunch. No place to sit so we ordered to go. Little did i know that if you order 4 or more things to go you have to go to the end register to order... So after waiting in their looong line I had to go wait in another line and order. After I paid she informed me that three adult meals and one kids meal would be a 20 minute wait.... Wtf. Would have been nice to know all this and save us some time. They gave us free drinks which made it ok but still annoyed. Food is great. Tasty panini sandwiches, (dessert) salads and soups. Haven't tried one I didnt like. Just be prepared for a long wait and beware of ordering to go."}
{"text":"Delicious food and you really do get more than enough! Prices are just a smidge higher than I would expect for sandwiches/soup/salad but they do give you plenty and have a great variety and seasonal flavors. Great customer service and the restaurant itself is very nice and clean."}
{"text":"This reminds me of something similar to what California has (souplantation) by this taste so much better and honestly I was so impressed I'll definitely be coming back  the salad was amazing, (Asian chicken) and the soup (chili chicken tortilla)"}
{"text":"my cuban sandwich was tasty and the tortilla soup was good. I went with a friend and she ordered a salad with chicken. The chicken was soooo bad it was sad! Rubber! Impossible to eat.  
The portions for the salad and soup are too small for the price. 
The line was a little long. I understand that but they rushed us and barely gave us time to think what we really wanted. 
The bathroom was extremely clean. Great job!"}
{"text":"Italian club sandwich was good but don't order the New England clam chowder unless you like room temperature soup. I was informed that Zupas does not have a microwave.  How about warming the soup in a pot on a stove top?"}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for lunch yesterday. I love Zupas and their fresh food! There was no line when we arrived and the employees were very attentive. The seating area was clean and there were plenty of seats to choose from. We each ordered the pick 2 combo. 
Our meal was ABSOLUTELY delicious!"}
{"text":"First off I received a postcard mail for this new place. 50% off your entire dine-in meal. What a great deal! And if you make it to the first 50 customers for certain days then you get a $10 gift card. Too bad I wasn't one of those first 50. 

When you walk through the doors a worker greeted each person and provided a menu. The menu is nicely done with pictures of each item, with descriptions and prices. It also shows available house-made sauces, house-made dressings and spice blends. Everything looked so appetizing! The decor was a fresh look of lime green and deep red. Tables and booths are plentiful. 

Since I love variety I went for the 2 combo which is regularly $8.79 for a choice of 2 items: whole sandwich, half soup, or half salad. It comes with bread and a chocolate dipped strawberry!!! Wow! That is a very nice complement to a meal and a rare complement for any meal that I've seen! This deserves a major star!! For the kiddos (10 years and younger) they also get a combo deal for a 2-choice of baked chicken strips, fruit cup, grilled cheese or small soup for $3.99. They even get a choice of bread or a chocolate dipped strawberry and small drink!! You lucky kids!! 

If you're not into the combo deals you can always get whole sandwich, salad or soup for $5.49, $7.59 and $6.39 respectively. And halves of salad and soup for $5.59 and $4.39 respectively. And the great part is that you'll receive the fresh french baguette and the chocolate dipped strawberry! 

There were at least 15 people ahead of us but Cafe Zupas did a phenomenal job in efficiently handling the line quickly! Probably took 7 minutes-ish. At the end of the line before you get to the register to pay they have a nice display of some desserts!! More deliciousness to add to the meal. This time around I passed on it but I foresee me getting one next time. 

I ordered the combo of pesto chicken sandwich and the roasted red pepper and lobster soup. 

Pesto chicken: had sliced almonds, roasted red peppers, muenster cheese, tomato and sprouts. This was a new kind of pesto sandwich for me because of the almonds. For me it was a bit too much almonds. Maybe it wasn't spread out evenly. The size of the sandwich was a bit smaller than most places hence the whole sandwich. 

Roasted red pepper soup: \"Rich and savory\" it actually had real lobster meat! Yum! This had a little bit too much saltiness for my taste buds. If you're the type that seasons your dish with loads of salt or soy sauce then you might be okay with it. I dipped the bread to tone down the saltiness. 

The chocolate dipped strawberry ended my meal with a sweet note. 

The variety of the foods and the price points were pretty decent. I really enjoyed the complementary choc dipped strawberry. And the service for the grand opening days were pleasant."}
{"text":"Love this place food has always been great. I don't eat too much seafood so I'm not sure what other reviewers are complaining about the seafood or lobster bisque. My only complaints are that it is a bit pricey and for some unknown reason they are closed on Sundays. I never really understood the Sunday issue, but whatever."}
{"text":"I got the Italian sandwhich which was overpowered by the creamy dressing they use. This was not a memorable sandwhich. I got the lobster bisque as well; Twas a quality soup, very creamy and rich with decent sized lobster chunks. 

My girlfriend got the Honey Cilantro Carnitas and she let me sample it. Fire. This was way better than my sandwhich. She got the tomato basil soup with orzo. The soup was very heavy. 

Nice sized menu with create your own salad option too. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Ive tried most of their menu and I promise you its better than Panera Bread or Sweet Tomatoes and the prices are better. The best by war is the pesto chicken. Their turkey and pork sandwiches are all right, but their crab sandwich is gross with imitation crab. The lobster bisque is the best soup ever, but the clam chowder didnt taste like your normal clam chowder. Would be 5 stars, but most of their sandwiches just arent that great, a lot taste like something you could make on your own with ingredients you can buy at Coscto. Their salads and soups however are amazing. Salads have great dressings and fresh fruits. The best is the nuts about berry with the poppy seed dressing and candied nuts! The salad portions are really small though. I recommend getting soup in the to-go cups, but salad in the for here bowls. I can tell a big difference in the portions. The desserts are amazing too, but way overpriced. $5 for a thin slice of cake?? Also I always do big orders and they make me repeat what Ive ordered 3 times...But they do give one free chocolate covered strawberry and piece of bread with every meal. Friendly staff, always fast even when its busy. I feel like they could make a profit if they offered pastas and sold their dressings and soups by the bottle. Try their try 2 combo!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite place! Cheaper and better than Paradise Bakery! Bread is really soft, every meal comes with a chocolate covered strawberry, and you can make your own Italian sodas! The service is also friendly and fast!"}
{"text":"The only reason I'm giving this place 3 stars is because of the food. The staff however are disorganized and not so friendly. It's very annoying that you have to repeat your order 3 times as you're going down the line. Today was the worst day of all. Some guy kept removing his hat and shaking his hair. I'm assuming it was itchy. That's a health code violation. So finally he took it off and scratched his head. Took off the gloves. Thankfully. Only one girl looked like she was working. Poor girl. Taylor was very disorganized. Gave away my salad to another customers. I had to wait for them to make me another. My sandwich was put on a plate at first even though my order was to go. When finally everything was together they put it in the wrong bag with someone else's desert (I didn't take it) Unbelievable."}
{"text":"My first time there! Staff was very pleasant dining area was clean. Menu looked great (photos) I ordered 2 salads and an Crab Avocado sandwich. I was shocked when I saw the Nuts about Berry, a large. I told the young lady, that the salad seemed light for a lg order. She assured me that they use a bowl and the eye ball technique and it reiterated that the portion was correct. While the other salad, looked proportionally ideal for a large order. Interesting...

The avocado crab melt was tasty, but the size looked liked a childs serving, I hope not. If I can give you a suggestion, use a bowl and scale for accurate serving and that will help you to control inventory and manage margins too.

All in all, it was a weird first time experience..."}
{"text":"The salad and soup are very well made.  And th customer service is really great here."}
{"text":"I was actually surprised about how good this place was, to be honest. I thought it would be much like a Souplatation or a Sweet Tomatoes, but I thought wrong. 

I decided to get a Bowl and Soup combo, and got the Thai Coconut Tofu bowl and the Wisconsin Cauliflower soup. My favorite part of the bowl was the generous serving of kale and quinoa. I kind of wish it had more tofu, but I still really enjoyed it. The dressing for the bowl was tangy and sweet, it really completed the dish. The star of the show though was the Wisconsin Cauliflower soup. SUPER HEARTY and CREAMY. I practically licked my bowl clean--it was that good~

They also give you a chocolate covered strawberry with your order which devoured pretty quickly ¯\_(?)_/¯"}
{"text":"Ordered a Turkey Avocado & Bacon sandwich. Asked for Sweet red peppers on the sandwich or on the side which they do have standard on other sandwiches. I was told they have no way of charging for them. So therefore I was denied. But they do know how to charge 69 cents for add-ons for your soup. 
So if I can't have it my way I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Very good food but attitude of the employees was careless and largely ignored customers.  They claim to be healthy but give you a shot glass for water when you spend $15 for an individual.  Annoying.  It would be much nicer if they fully embraced people eating healthier and needing to drink water."}
{"text":"Tried this restaurant for the first.  Arrived around 1230p and there was a bit of a line.  Problem is, the line moves at less than a snail's pace.  I waited for over 20 minutes to place a quick salad order.  I opted to create my own but the girl who was making the salad assumed it was another type.  She added ingredients I did not want.  She did offer to remake but I had waited so long in line, I just told her to keep the extra ingredients on the salad and then told her what I actually wanted.  Much to my dismay, they charged me for the extra ingredients.  Salad was good but felt they should not have charged for their error.  I went to their website to let them know but there is no contact us option.

If you are in a hurry, avoid this place as it takes a long time to eat there.  Not worth the effort and I will most likely not return."}
{"text":"My husband picked up a sandwich & salad for take out last week and when I scooped up the chopped nuts in my salad I bit down on a NAIL. I included pictures of the long, very hard, sharp metal object that was in my salad. I could have broken a tooth! Not expecting a nail (obviously), I repeatedly tried to munch what I thought were just hard candied nuts. I could not believe what I spit out. Are they doing construction by the take out orders?? Don't trust this place. Obviously no attention to detail. I called to tell them about this and I got a \"Oh! Sorry about that.\" Swell customer service"}
{"text":"My husband and I ordered $40 worth of food through postmates. About 10 minutes After we placed the order my husband got a message saying our order was cancelled because cafe zupas was \"too busy\" . Also on the postmates app it says cafe zupas excepts orderes until 830pm and we ordered at 630. If they're too busy to take our money, we can gladly take it somewhere else ;-)"}
{"text":"Friendly, helpful staff. Good variety of fresh-tasting sandwiches and salads. $18 for two combo meals. Clean, comfortable, casual."}
{"text":"Brand new location so store looked clean and modern. Service among the food assemblers was friendly enough. Realized I had forgotten to use my 50% off coupon as soon as I sat down but they wouldn't honor it since I had already paid. I wouldn't normally care except the food was mediocre so $10 would've been nice. Probably won't be going back because of that."}
{"text":"Hmmmm I'm not impressed with this place. The soup tastes better than canned but needs some more spice/flavor. I asked for cheese and croutons in my soup. They were  $.70 each and the tiniest amounts. I got 4 baby croutons. I asked for a couple more and was refused. The \"sourdough baguette\" that came with the soup was just blah white bread... no crunch, no flavor. Every table on the patio was dirty. I love soup but won't be back."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Always fresh products.  Friendly staff. Clean restaurant. And you gotta love the chocolate dipped strawberry!!! They also have a great soda bar with flavored syrups"}
{"text":"Love this place since there's no Panera on this side of town. Their soups are light and tasteful and I'm a fan of their light salads too!"}
{"text":"Amazing!!!
FYI: if you're allergic to tree nuts, avoid the house-pesto sauce and the chicken pesto sandwich because its tossed with almonds. It doesn't say it on menu, had to ask.
Visited the area for work, went here for lunch twice!  The soups, salads and sandwiches were delicious, along with made fresh. Great customer service!  The combo for 7.99 is a great deal, very filling and gives you a chocolate covered strawberry to top off your meal.  Wish it was here in California!"}
{"text":"The California turkey sandwich I had was OK. I was not happy that I could not modify the sandwich to my liking. Unsure why if it's not premade.  Was bland and the bread is nothing special."}
{"text":"I have been here several times, both for lunch and for dinner. We came in today for an informal low carb lunch. There were lots of options at very reasonable prices. You line up cafeteria style and order your meal in sequence. I wanted a salad. The first person took out a large bowl and placed the lettuce. The next person in line added in the extras that are specific to my salad. For my Cobb salad, she threw in the chicken, olives, eggs, bacon, etc. As you go down the line they ask if you want a sandwich or soup. The next person asks if you want one of the desserts. After that you come to the cash register. I have been very impressed with how pleasant and helpful the staff is. Going from the person who opens the door and greets you with a smile to the the workers behind the counter who prepare the food, everyone seems to be smiling and happy. In my Cobb salad today the ingredients for all fresh. They could put in a little more chicken, but that is a minor gripe. Overall, it was a delicious  freshly made-to-order salad, more than enough food for lunch. They threw in a chocolate covered strawberry and a piece of bread. Nice touch! All of that for under $10. Tasty and a good deal too!"}
{"text":"Let me put my review in because these people don't know Great Food and Great Customer Service. I had the Chicken Pesto and my friend had the Cuban Pork. We also had soups and salads. We shared everything to get the full experience. TOTALLY WORTH IT. The sandwiches were juicy and delicious. I loved mine and my friends. The salad we shared was the Strawberry one with all the greens. I wanted so much more. Then for soups I tried the Garden Chowder...HEAVEN, ABSOLUTE HEAVEN.  Then I tried my friends Clam Chowder, with Lobster Bisque added Wow Heaven on earth. They gave us bread and a special treat too. For Dessert...Yes, we had Dessert... Half off after a certain time because it's either they give it to you or the trash. Creme Brulleé Carmel for me and Chocolate Creme Brulleé for my friend. Of course we shared that too and they were nice and creamy and not to rich. You couldn't ask for anything more. Charging station, Drink Flavor station, great Food and Great Friendly People. Let's get more places like this around America. I'm done."}
{"text":"I used to love this place until I went in for my BBQ chicken salad, ate half, then found a live cockroach crawling around in the salad. I called over there and they did nothing for me but offer me my money back! So I brought the box over and the cockroach crawled out of the box on the counter. I work at an office building a block away with 450 employees, which most would go to zupas for lunch. Since they weren't taking care of a customer finding a HUGE cockroach in their salad I decided to let my whole office know about it. They lost a lot of biz. I hope they don't treat you the way they treated me!"}
{"text":"Wow, nice. Love the Lobster bisque! Grand opening was 3 weeks ago although there is still construction ongoing construction on the exterior."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches and salads.  This was our first time in here and the food was great and even looked as beautiful as its pictures.  My favorite was the turkey bacon avocado sandwich.  We were so full we had to take our chocolate covered strawberries home."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this lil gem with a girlfriend, I absolutely loved how fresh all their ingredients are and the staff is always kind and attentive. I always get the half and half a crab Avocado sandwich and a Chipotle salad. It's a great lunch buy very filling and very fresh. I just wish it was open Sundays."}
{"text":"Love the concept. Food was great. Also, getting a free chocolate covered strawberry was such a nice added bonus.
The quality of food was above expectations. Everything is made fresh, by hand, and tasted exceptional! I had the pulled pork with a bowl of Clam Chowder! I highly recommend it. 
Clean dining area. My favorite part was personal Salt and Pepper Crackers rather than shakers at every table."}
{"text":"Nice little spot to grab a healthy lunch. I love the BBQ Chicken Salad and their Mushroom Soup is amazing!!!"}
{"text":"As soon as you walk in the door its the American ninja obstacle course!  Jumpin over tables, bobbing and weaving...what an adventure!  Anyhow I was greeted by young...but very friendly staff!  I ordered the Honey Club Sandwich and Strawberry Harvest Sandwich.  The sandwich was tasty but nothing special really.  It was smaller than what I expected.  I paid $10 for my 2 combo meal which also came with a slice of bread and a chocolate strawberry.  If you total up all the items together id say its worth the price.  The salad was also nice.  The light vinaigrette worked well with the strawberries, apples, nuts, and dried cranberries.  The tables were clean, and i enjoyed the music playing.  All in All Zuppas is my sort of spot to eat at.  A decent healthy food spot thats not too expensive.  Id recommend you give them a try... Its not a spot ill crave but more to just get a quick healthy meal and relax for a bit ;-)"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I walked in, we have never been to Zupas & just moved nearby.. thought we would check it out! There was a pretty big line, but we were helped and sitting down to eat within 20 minutes? It was so delicious! They have extensive ingredients for any salad you want, a long list of sandwiches PLUS half a dozen soups. I love that they have seasonal items to try as well. Will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Nothing but wonderful customer service. Absolutely LOVE the beverage station. The berry custard is my favorite dessert. AND everyone receives a chocolate covered strawberry, what's not to like about that?!"}
{"text":"They will give you a hard time about ordering 4 combos. I can understand if there was a long line. But in this case it wasn't. 

I was the 4th person waiting to be helped. All i needed was 3 combos and 1 side sandwich. I like the food but it is overpriced. $10 for a little soup and half sandwich. 

They way I was treated by most of the staff was a real FAIL. inept staff saying go to thr catering area. There were 6 people on the serving line, sounds like a lame excuse to not want to help. Real lack of common sense with today's staff. 

Please note this review will be followed up with corporate complaint."}
{"text":"Not a bad place to grab some lunch. My BIGGEST hang up with them is when you are building a salad, there is a choice of half or full size, however they put the same amount of veggies, proteins, etc. no matter the size. So basically you just pay more for double the lettuce...."}
{"text":"The food is great. I love the tomato basil risotto and bbq chicken salad. 

I would prefer a more cleanly dining experience however. I have dined twice now and tables are full of dishes and the stack of dirty dishes that accumulates around the fountain drink dispenser is gross. I had a hard time finding a table that was wiped clean, having asked to have one cleared."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I just had dinner here. I have to say, I'm very underwhelmed by the food here. I was pretty stoked to get a tastey but simple sandwich and fresh made soup. Regretfully, I had the grilled cheese and it was quite lacking in flavor. The red pepper lobster bisque, though a tad \"clumpy\" was quite tasty. I will give Cafe Zupas another shot, but I'm hoping my next choice in sandwich will turn it around for me."}
{"text":"Yelp should allow for ZERO stars.

Who is the owner of this franchise, Mr. Potter from It's A Wonderful Life???

I got the soup & salad combo, which is like $9.
You get six items for your salad and then look out!!
A - LA - CART like you've never seen in your entire life.

When they scoop your items, they have this slotted spoon that is the equivalent of a tablespoon.

So if you're getting sunflower seeds, you may get a decent amount.
But for vegetable items, fuh-git-abo-it!

Can you envision a tablespoon of whole cucumbers, not even chopped up?
That's like five slices of a small cucumber.

Can you envision a tablespoon of cherry tomatoes?
That's three halves!

Can you envision a tablespoon of red peppers that are julienned?
That's two slices!!

It's utterly astounding that someone took estimating the food cost to this extreme.

They're making the salad and I'm like...\"That's it???\"

Then I got my soup.
They have a ladle and you can only get one ladle full, even though it only fills the bowl 2/3rds.
The presentation is awful.
There is ZERO VALUE in this place.

Then they offer you fried onions for your soup. 
Sure! Love some!!

Oh wait!
You get only a tablespoon full for $.69!!!
You get the TINIEST amount and you have to pay for it!

Like they give you a garnish amount and charge you!!
They are literally insane.

Then my friend got her soup and she had more than I did so I asked them to put more in my bowl.

The cashier employee can't make that executive decision so I asked for a manager.
She said the manager was busy training someone.

I informed her that there was nothing going on that was more important than making a customer happy.

She was waiting for the manager who was in our view, to stop talking and then she would inform her that she was needed.

SHE'S THE MANAGER!! Duh! Call her over you passive wall flower.

I told the manger that I wanted more soup because my friend had more.
So instead of just spooning more soup into my bowl, she was going to take my bowl and THROW IT OUT, 
And I quote...\"reportion\" it for me.
Can you imagine???
Re-portion!!

She'd rather throw out a whole serving than take the ladle and spoon a bit more.

That's when I knew that the manager had zero critical thinking skills.
This place might as well be run by robots.

You can get 2 lbs of food at Chipotle for the same price of their bowl of lettuce and half a bowl of soup.

You can go a few doors down to Jason's Deli and get an ALL YOU CAN EAT salad bar with 30 items on it, including muffins, chocolate mouse, ice cream Sundays, hummus, crackers, bread potato salad, pasta salads, and go up as many times as you like for $9 bucks.

You can go to Pieology and get unlimited toppings on your pizza for the same price as this place sells you a bowl of lettuce with vinegar on it.

Take my word for it.
Even if the food is good, there is ZERO VALUE in the portions.
Whoever is the cheapest person you know on the planet, the owners of this place are cheaper.

We then went to Jason's Deli, with complete regret that we wasted $22 at this place and left hungry.

We got a kid's salad bar (one trip) for $4.95, which includes a bottle of water, and a kid's macaroni & cheese, which is delicious beyond words, just like you made as a kid, but perfect, and includes a bottle of water. 

For $10 we got more food from Jason's Deli than $22 at this wacko joint.

Oh and as for the service at Zuppa's, only one of five people behind the counter has a smile on her face.

At Jason's Deli, they all have smiles and gave us VALUE for our money.
Get that Zuppa owners??? VALUE."}
{"text":"Went it during their half off opening special and ordered the Crab Avocado Melt and Cherry Balsamic Salad. The salad was fine, but the crab avocado did not have any avocado, bacon, or muenster as stated in the menu. It was just some crab mix, celery, and tomato. Normally I would've brought this to someone's attention but it was half off the food and the line was out the door. During a very busy weekend I can see mistakes being made, but I was still disappointed in my bland sandwich."}
{"text":"Very good food and crazy good service! They have like 20 employees behind the counter! It doesn't seem like it would be efficient but they are all very friendly and work together like a well oiled machine. Very smooth service and the soups... Ah the soups. They allow you to test them all! And they are ALL amazing. It was hard to choose just one. The price was a little high for a soup/salad/sandwich place IMO, but hey, gotta pay all those employees! My advice to Zupas: trim down the workers so you can trim a little off the price. My advice to consumers: check it out anyway; this place is good!"}
{"text":"Really impressed with this place. The food is really really good. I loved their chicken tortilla soup and their tai mango salad. So so so good. The staff is really friendly and I love that you get chocolate covered strawberries with your order! It's def. my go to place for a good soup and salad."}
{"text":"Excelente place for healthy food when you are in a rush. Soups and salads are very good in quality and size. They even include an strawberry with chocolate as a dessert. Prices are very reasonable. I only suggest that the piece of bread that accompanies the soup shouldn't be directly out of the fridge"}
{"text":"Triple S!!! Sandwiches, Soups & Salads galore!! I'm absolutely 100% totally a fan of this place!!! Every time I've come, the food and service has been spot on, accommodating to the occasional specific request (I ask for my strawberry not dipped in chocolate), consistency in taste and freshness of the food served is a huge reason I'm a fan and speak so highly of this place, as well the reason I give it 5/5 stars 

Location is easily visible from the main road Rainbow Blvd in a brand new plaza. It has lots of seating as well as outdoor seating available. Very well lit as the entrance and one side wall is floor to ceiling windows. 

Lunch time gets rather busy especially at the peak of the lunch rush between 11:45am-1pm. The ordering system is very much like an assembly line system so at each part of the line a different person is assisting you. I will admit during their busiest times this may (or may not) get confusing but just keep moving forward and the rest will follow in place (puns totally intended lol) 

I always get the try 2 combo which give you the option of salad, soup, sandwich obviously pick any of the two. I do the soup and salad. What I like is that unlike other establishments that do a salad sandwich or soup combo option, you get a full panini sandwich verses the half of one. I normally get the mango berry salad that is completely vegetarian (no meat) and it comes with an amazingly sweet but not too sweet or thick mango yogurt dressing that I always get on the side (calories control). I've also tried their Asian citrus salad that perfectly pairs with a citrus peanut type ginger vinaigrette dressing. Although I've sampled all the soups, I always still end up ordering the roasted pepper lobster bisque. They do have original lobster bisque but I like that added kick in flavor. Another soup I recommend is the wild mushroom. Seriously, their options on the menu are pretty endless so I'll definitely be in to start trying other things on the menu. Sandwiches that I've tasted from family while dining has all been really good as well! Maybe one day I'll check a bit and order myself one of the sandwiches. 

Drinks are separate at $1.99 but at the drink station they have in house brews that are all naturally sweetened with raw honey only so I love the pomegranate lemon coconut water. I always grab an extra lemon slice to squeeze into my drink as well. They also provide flavored syrup sweeteners as well. The in house drinks are definitely worth trying and I highly recommend it. They have 4 different flavors. 

Every order comes with a roll of bread (wish it was warm bread) & a strawberry dipped in chocolate but I get mine without chocolate. This place also offers desserts which I've had the cheesecake before, but I come for the healthy eats do I tend to stray away from desserts, 

The combo is $8.99 & I walk away full every time. My salad is always tasting fresh. I do wish the soup was a little of the thicker side and less thin like it's been watered down but that's not enough for me to knock this place off a star. 

The area is great, place stays clean, service is great as they have people that come around and ask to take your plates when done, & it's been a consistently pleasant experience for me every time I've come. I really do love coming and eating here and I most definitely will keep coming back for more!"}
{"text":"It's so refreshing to come to a new cafe and view so many healthy options, with a slew of salads and soups, paninis and sandwiches, but...there are those tempting desserts! I ordered the Asian Chicken Mandarin salad, it was esquisite including edamame, diced snap peas, wontons and the miso dressing is wonderfully light and tasty. It comes with a slice of baugette, (I asked for a extra piece @.49 cents extra). The most delightful surprise was the orange berry juice infused with raw honey. Perfectly sweet! Everything comes with a chocolate dipped strawberry. Be patient during lunch times, it does get busy, although there is adequate seating to accomidate all!"}
{"text":"I agree they measure things too carefully and it's a little too expensive. It's salad bar where they control things. They even cut things in half, such as strawberries.

The soup, however, is the best."}
{"text":"Wow! I just wanted to commend Ria on her excellent customer service. Unfortunately, I wasn't feeling well and she made a great suggestion for me to try the veggie and quinoa soup. It was delicious and made me feel better. I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"I utilized the catering service at Café Zuppas in Henderson for a recent celebration I had in my home.  The experience was excellent!  The food was amazing and fresh.  I received many compliments from my guests.  Amanda and her catering team delivered my items on-time, and fixed a minor glitch in my order quickly and professionally.  I would definitely recommend to my friends and will be back for future events!"}
{"text":"Could I give it more than 5 stars? This place is FANTASTIC!!! Chipotle...eat your heart out!! You want fresh food, swing by here!!! Granted, no Mexican food, but salads, sandwiches, and soups to die for!!! The chicken enchilada chili, OMG, amazing!!! The chocolate cover strawberry is a nice touch too. The people there are really nice, and helpful. This place also has proper Italian Sodas. Haven't tried the desserts yet, but that will happen soon!!! Check this place out!!!"}
{"text":"Oh Lord Jesus is a fire!!!!! Sorry Panera, this place is too legit. Soup, salad, and sandwiches from heaven! They even exclude a chocolate covered strawberry. 

I had a great experience. Friendly and helpful staff as soon as you walk in. Even helped by giving samples of soup. 

So far I have tried the crab avocado melt sandwich, BBQ chicken salad, lobster bisque and roasted red pepper lobster soups. 

I will definitely be coming here often since it's close to home and decent price for the amount of food you get."}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent quality, excellent staff. I work a job where I am on the go, so eating healthy can be tough, but not with Zupas. I eat here 4-5 times a week. Never upset with my food. The salads are my favorite, but the sandwiches and soups are great as well!"}
{"text":"WOW, I've been by this place many time, never thought to stop. What a shame. Soup was heavenly and the sandwich was great too. If your looking for something healthier but taste good, this is the place. With it being next to the Harkins Theater. I say it's \" Zupas and a Movie\""}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite place to eat. The food is so delicious. However the last 3 times I have dined here, there is just poor communication between the staff. My order comes out wrong every single time. Sadly, I won't be returning her anymore because of the uncertainty of the service and how my food will come out."}
{"text":"First timer now Zupas enthusiast. The food was so amazing that even if the service was horrible I would still go back but the service was amazing too!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love the food but there is one manager there that is not so nice. I love the food so much that I might have to start going to the chandler establishment instead. That's a shame because the gilbert one is less than 5 minutes away. I might try sunflower cafe. I spend $40-$100 a week here but she's just left a bad taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"We discovered this little place the other day.. It is in our neighborhood and didn't know it..  You walk in and order what you want.  Very clean, bright place. It also has a recharging station for your phone, I-pad etc. It has a cute soda fountain area where at no extra charge you can add syrups to your soda to make it an Italian soda.. Loved the Lobster Bisque soup & The Crab melt.. Plus every order comes with a chocolate covered strawberry.. very sweet.. I will be back because there are salads I want to try.. I am glad I found this spot in our neighborhood.."}
{"text":"Came here for what we thought was a nice late lunch with the family. Everything was fine until we found part of an acrylic nail in our enchilada soup. We talked to the manager, who simply apologized and offered us soup. We declined, but we are definitely not visiting any time soon!"}
{"text":"I like the idea zupas has here order a combo with a soup or salad or sandwich. It's pretty cheap too but if you're eating with one other person it's about $20 which about the same as sweet tomatoes for 2 people so I'd say the better deal would be to go to sweet tomatoes but I mean if you want fast but healthy food id definitely come here though!
My favorite soups from here would have to be tomato basil or veggie quinoa and the best salad would have to be chicken chipotle or the healthiest is the kale salad. Best fruit one is the nuts about berries 

They also have really good house made drinks like the cucumber/basil infused water is my favorite.
I also love how they give you a strawberry and bread with every order. 
The service is very fast and they have a lot of good workers working for them. 
The interior is decorated nicely too.
The only problems I have is that the portions are so little. Like when they scoop you your soup they do one scoop and it fills only half the bowl. 
One time I was ordering and the worker gave me a little too much soup and the manager told them to take some out because it was too much? 
Other than that though everything else is fine. Sometimes it's too cold in here too, but other than that I'd still come back and bring my friends if we want quick healthy food"}
{"text":"This was my first time stopping into Cafe Zupas. I wasn't sure what I wanted but Josh was kind enough to assist me. He made sure to let me know what I would personally like based on my taste and was kind to go through everything patiently. Josh's customer service went above and beyond and the food was excellent, I will most definitely be coming back!!!"}
{"text":"Quality restaurant food at high speed at a really low price! If your a health guru and want to eat something besides chipotle, come to cafe zupas!

Great for brunch they have grilled paninis, savory soups, and a load of veggies. This is gonna be my go to spot from now on."}
{"text":"It took several hours for me to be able to even write this review, I was so upset, after getting off the phone with the District Manager Lyle. He works out of this location on Eastern Ave. It never ceases to amaze me, that the restaurants in Las Vegas think that they can act and treat their customers terrible and they will keep their jobs and the business will continue, to keep its doors open. I leave this review in hopes, that is NOT THE CASE! I called the restaurant to place a to go order for pickup. I had send someone to the restaurant to pick it up, but when they arrived, no one had a clue what was going on??? I said, put me on the phone with them. After going around with 2 gals on the phone and one manager, Drew, trying to get my order for a soup and salad ready, for about 10 minutes, I said, I'm not paying for this order, you guys screwed this up, this is ridiculous! He says, \"Well, we can't give you free food!\" Number one, the order was called in, you dropped the ball! Number two, then I had to talk to 3 different employees, the gal got the soup wrong (fixed it, the size AND the kind, were both wrong!), while the manager ran around and LITERALLY THREW, my salad together!! Ridiculous behavior when they are charging $19.00, for these two items!!! You can have Great Food all day long, but if you have HORRIBLE SERVICE, and employees that are VERY RUDE, guess what, PEOPLE WILL GO SOMEWHERE ELSE! Just like I will next time!! There's a million places to eat in Las Vegas!! Bye Bye Zupas:( I hope Corporate is happy with your behavior, because they are on my to do list for tomorrow!"}
{"text":"The worst ran branch of all of the chains. Do not come here is you are on a schedule!"}
{"text":"What I like about this place is the fresh ingredients. I enjoyed my kale salad. I also really liked that they tossed the salad with the dressing as they made it. 

What I didn't love was the sandwich. It was okay, but nothing to write home about (California turkey). 
Also, the salad was way too small. Any other place you go, you can expect 1/3 to 1/2 more than what you get here. For the price, I expect more salad. It's almost funny to watch them, as they strictly measure out the kale leaves. 

I probably won't go back. Don't like the price point. Doesn't measure up to what you get. And really, I would only like the salad.. Which isn't big enough to fill me up."}
{"text":"Tried it for the first time tonight. Sweet girl employee opened the door and welcomed us in. I love that they had personal menus to look at so you're not standing at the front line still deciding what to order. The first employee at the counter takes your sandwich order which i gave her my entire order, but she kindly directed me to the next gentleman to order the soup. I felt like it was great customer service! I ordered Turkey Bacon Avocado Panini with a New England Clam Chowder. The Panini looked like it was lacking 'Umph' but the taste was great. The soup was so tasty! It was the perfect amount of pepper and creamy consistency. It also comes with side bread slice and chocolate covered strawberry. I say totally worth it."}
{"text":"So I'm a soup salad and sandwich SNOB! this is my first time here and this place is AHHHMAZING! delicious everything, and I even got a complimentary chocolate dipped strawberry to top it all off!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place since I saw that it had opened its doors. 

Sadly I was more disappointed then impressed.  :(

I got their combo... Full sandwich with either a half salad or half soup.

I got the turkey with bacon and avocado.  The sandwich was decent. It didn't blow me away. I figured that the bacon would still be a little crispy.... Sadly no it was limp.... And it looked like it had been sitting in their reach ins for sometime.  And the turkey was just your normal sliced turkey u can get at a grocery store. Now the real disappointment.... The avocados. I love avocados and that was one of the main reasons why I got this and instead of being fresh avocado slides.... It looked like they had just smeared guacamole on it. Very sad about that. :( but the flavor was overall decent.  (3/5)

The soup was another disappointment. I call it a soup even though they call it a chowder because it was NOT a chowder. When I get a chowder I expect that it's going to be thick and chunky.  It was brothy like a chicken noodle soup. And it was SALTY. very very SALTY. The soup comes with a piece of bread.... They call it a baguette... But it was just a loaf of bread in the shape of a baguette. :/  even with adding the bread into the soup it was SALTY.... But I was hungry so I ate it.... I got the new England clam soup.... The flavor besides the saltiness was barely ok.  There was no potatoes... Just lots and lots of celery. And the pieces of clam were miniscule.  This was a total miss. (1/5)

Best thing about this visit was the drink station. They have 4 upgraded drinks included when u buy a normal soda fountain drink. They are all natural made with honey instead with normal sugar or sugar substitutes.  I tried 2 and both were well balanced and not overly sweet.  If you do not like honey I would not recommend these drinks as the honey is very obvious. (5/5)

Free chocolate dipped strawberries.... (5/5)... You can't really complain about free....

Ambiance.... It was very clean and the staff were awesome. Very friendly.  But I will knock a star off since it was COLD in there. This is coming from someone who has her thermostat at home set to 68.... It was COLD.  (4/5)

Overall I would like to give them 1 more try.... And see if the food quality improves.  But I won't be rushing back here. :("}
{"text":"Good food, excellent service, stinks that they discontinued the marshmallow brownies. But over all a good place to go"}
{"text":"I really like this place. There are lots of options to choose from. They have a great try two combo which you can choose soup, salad or sandwich. Try the roasted red pepper lobster soup by far my fave. I will be returning in the near future!"}
{"text":"I love the Mango Berry salad! I taste tested all their soups and the Chicken Enchilada soup won me over. The staff is wonderful and very polite."}
{"text":"Really good soups and salads. And the choco strawberry is a nice touch. But bland sandwiches and they refuse to let you substitute. It's unreal. Overall, meh. I only go when I'm feeling soup."}
{"text":"The bowl of soup was decent, but there are some flaws here with the food. 
Turkey - standard deli sliced crap
Salad - they only use field greens which isn't lettuce in my view
Soup - I sampled three soups and all tasted a bit off (too creamy, no taste etc) and the biggest problem is that there is no Chicken Noodle Soup. This is like not having mustard available for your hot dog. The soups are corporate driven, so there is no change. This was a big omission. Garden Chowder was not so bad, but had way too much corn. Still a good value as its under 5 bucks and a slice of bread and strawberry are included.
  Are they really making 12 soups from scratch every day in a chain? Questionable. Prices are reasonable, but food quality might suffer due to that fact."}
{"text":"The mangoberry salad is very good. Somehow they manage to make several of their salads taste like dessert. My husband said the pork sandwich wasn't bad, bread seemed slightly stale. I thought there'd be pesto on the grilled cheese but I'm not sure what happened. It honestly just tasted like a mayonnaise sandwich. The lady behind me ordered grilled cheese with no spread and I guess she knew what she was doing."}
{"text":"The ultimate grilled cheese with tomatoes and pesto is a must try.  Quinoa & Vegetable soup is very good.  I also enjoyed a Maui Salad.  Everything is quick and tasty.  

My new favorite spot when I am a near!!"}
{"text":"When this place first opened it was awesome! Fresh produce and tasty sandwiches and soup but, it started declining...the salad items appeared fresh and that was good but,the soup...yea BUT the soup. ..it started out thick and creamy (cauliflower cheese) but ,after a few months it was getting more and more watered down and less and less flavorful. We started trying other soups and thry all were so watered down we stopped coming in to get it. Months later here we go again and as i watched the employee pour the cauliflower cheese soup into the to go cup I stopped her and told her that i didnt want it. You could see how watery it was. I got a bbq chicken salad....which was good BUT...unfortunately there is another but...this time it's the ranch dressing. Totally watered down. What a bummer. Everyone that likes ranch dressing knows it's rich and creamy if you purchase a bottle of it at the store....here with my salad at spas cafe totally watered down. White water dressing does not make the same effect as normal ranch dressing. Huge disappointment. Im not trying here again. This is the 4th attempt to get a soup and salad that is as good as it was when they first opened. Great place,great idea...not good products any more."}
{"text":"First time coming here customer service was amazing  loved the chicken chili enchilada soup .. I think that's what it's called. Will definitely come again."}
{"text":"Great food.  Really tasty and fresh.   Super great value.  Nice folks.   I will come back often."}
{"text":"I have been here a handful of times and it's always a great experience! I have had soups and salads and the food is great! Get the Wisconsin soup and add the fix'ins. You won't be disappointed and it goes well with most sandwiches.  This place is still awesome!"}
{"text":"I came in one day between school rehearsals asking for a salad with no nuts due to an allergy. I was in a rush and didn't check the salad until I was back at school, where the salad came with nuts. I couldn't go back to the store so I didn't eat. Luckily, I called the store and they promised me a complementary meal. I walked in today and told the workers, to which the manager came out to oversee that it was honored. At the register, they tried to charge me for the soup to which I said the same story. The guy shrugged and told me \"ok I guess\". Will not be coming back."}
{"text":"One of my favorites. Soups , salads, sandwiches, desserts (not to mention the included chocolate covered strawberry and French bread!)  And the custom soda bar. My current favorite is the crab melt and the nuts about berries salad... I really haven't come across anything I haven't liked yet. Super friendly staff will show you the way to order. Check it out"}
{"text":"The portions for their salads are measured out with this tiny spindle.  If you ask the worker to add a little more they are quick to point out that it will cost you 2 points.  The quality of the food was great, the portions were way too small so I wont be heading back here."}
{"text":"Really good soups, salads and paninis. Soup is my go to here, they've got like 12 different flavors and you can try before you buy. The variety is enough that you don't get tired eating here. I prefer the chicken enchilada chili bc it's very tasty and s little lower calorie than my second two favs the Wisconsin cheddar and the mushroom bisque. I always get the \"try two\" combo or whatever it's called here, you can pick sandwich, soup or salad, but the nice part here compared to Panera is that the portions seem bigger, e.g. you get a full sandwich instead of a half sandwich. I've switched from getting sandwich to getting salad, personal fave is protein cobb but the wife loves the quinoa or the strawberry harvest. My favorite new addition is the drink bar, a nice alternative to cokes/colas when you are trying to convince yourself you're eating healthy. Definitely worth a stop, it's a regular on our lunch rotation."}
{"text":"The soups and desserts are pretty good. I've had the lobster bisque and the roasted red pepper and lobster. The sandwiches I've had are just ok, not much flavor to them. I had a Cuban pork panini and also tried one with turkey and avocado. Also the portions are kinda small, especially for the cup of soup. Next time I feel like soup I'll go back and get the large bowl."}
{"text":"The food is average. I've had a few different salads here, the vegetarian sandwich, grilled cheese and tomato soup. Their soup is probably the best thing I've had here. The ordering process is really confusing and frustrating... you have to repeat your order to three different people. I don't get why they do that. I do like the chocolate-covered strawberry that's included with each meal. And it's nice that they have a big charging station for phones and other devices!"}
{"text":"Bad food and bad service! I had a sandwich and it gave me heartburn. Incompetant employees. Avoid this place!"}
{"text":"I tried it for the first time last week on the recommendation of a co-worker! I loved it! I got a salad and sandwich combo...a spinach artichoke sandwich and a berry salad. They were very good. Complimentary roll and chocolate dipped strawberry was a nice touch. It was packed and noisy because it was lunch hour, but I had no trouble finding a place to sit. The way the tables are arranged are a little awkward and close together, but it was no big deal. I love the drink area with the spritzer bar and you can't go wrong with a re-charge station with touch screens! Though I'm not sure I want to touch public screens while eating. The staff was really nice and the guy at the cashier joked with me a bit. They seemed to be prepared for the crowd and kept the line going pretty smoothly. Also, having the paper menus in the line made ordering go quicker."}
{"text":"This place has quickly become a family favorite. I love the variety of the kids meal. For the adults we always do the pick 2. My favorite is the chicken tortilla soup and barbecue chicken salad!! The variety of infused waters wins us over every time! The pricing is very affordable and the chocolate covered strawberries are such a treat!"}
{"text":"Upon entering The lined moved slowly. Stood in line for 15 minutes, and with 5 year old twins it feels even longer. The staff forgot our grilled cheese for my son so we had to wait for that. The soups are extremely salty. I ordered the tomato soup and could only take two bites. Yuck!  The bbq chicken salad is pretty delicious but nothing extraordinary. I enjoyed their coconut water berry green tea. Was hoping there would be a better selection for black tea, all they have is the \"Honest Tea\" which is never good. I will come back to try more of their sandwiches and salads. It's really the only semi healthy option for the area."}
{"text":"I love coming here! My sandwich is always perfect, the soup is flavorful and I love getting free chocolate covered strawberries and bread. The line moves very quick and they are well staffed. Definitely a must try!"}
{"text":"The food is really tasty and there a lot of different soups/salads/sandwiches/ and desserts to choose from. There's been a couple times that my order had a missing ingredient or wrong item and it always throws me off when I get to the cashier and they ask me what I ordered so I have to repeat my order twice. Once to the people putting the food together and again to the cashier which is a little weird but the food is good so its ok."}
{"text":"My daughter drug me here and I was like eh, ok. Boy, was I surprised! Fresh, delicious food and at reasonable prices. The staff was so helpful and friendly - they didn't even let me make it 3 steps with trash in my hand before they took it from me. 

Will definitely be coming here when I am craving a mouth-watering salad!!! YUM!!! Loved it!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try Zuppas for a long while now. My meal was pretty good. My boyfriend didn't enjoy his as much.
We both ordered the pick two combination meal. 
I ordered the ultimate grilled cheese sandwich & the garden chowder soup .
I really loved my garden chowder soup. I will definitely order it again . Particularly I enjoyed the grilled corn it the creamy soup. It was delicious . The ultimate grilled cheese was good . I'll try another sandwich next time.
My boyfriend choose the crab sandwich . He wasn't a fan of the intimation crab. ( we knew it wasn't going to be real crab , expectation wasn't high) Just wasn't his cup of tea. The soup he choose was the tomato soup. Which is highly recommended here. He wasn't a fan of that either. It has other veggies in it too. But he said there was just too many  flavors in it. A lot  going on in it. He prefers his tomato soup to have more of a tamato flavor. I tried it also . It was too sweet for me.
He will try other items next time. 
Oh they also give you a complimentary chocolate strawberry! I can't believe u almost forgot ! Almost the best part !!
The strawberry was SOO perfect! The temperature & texture was beyond amazing .  I LOVED it.  
The staff was nice. Nothing extraordinary . The place was pretty clean . Baby friendly :) They offer high chairs , which is nice since we had our 9month old baby with us. I love the soda fountain offers Italian soda syrups to make your drink your own . Especially since I try not to drink too much soda it's nice to have a different choice on unique sodas :) yummy."}
{"text":"Ordered the Cuban. Not quite as good in terms of flavor as the old paradise bakery version, but still delicious. I would recommend."}
{"text":"Ordered the Honey Cilantro Carnitas, fantastic! 
Very affordable sandwiches of good portion. Served with a chocolate dipped strawberry."}
{"text":"Finally got the chance to try this place out. I don't know what I was waiting for. The food is great and the people there were nice and respectful. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"My friend brought me here. I had the cuban sandwich and the mango salad. The sandwich was to die for. The salad was very good although after eating about half of it, the sweetness got to me. It either needed a dressing that was less sweet, even though it tasted amazing, or something else acidic added to it, like raspberries maybe? I would definitely go there again. My only complaint, and the reason I gave 4 instead of 5 stars was the bucket of water with the cleaning rag located next to the drink station. It stunk really bad. Luckily I could only smell it while getting my drink."}
{"text":"The food was so good. Great customer service. Love the infusion drinks. I think it is so nice that they give you a complimentary chocolate dipped strawberry with your Try two meal. I had the clam chowder and honey turkey bacon club. So yummy."}
{"text":"I ordered the berry & nuts salad/chicken pesto wrap. They were both delicious. The strawberry and bread make the portion pretty perfect. I don't think theres much else on the menu that sparks my attention which is why i rated them a 4 and not a 5. Hubby ordered the kale salad & kale soup. He really enjoyed his meal as well & would go back again."}
{"text":"Just a lesser known version of Panera's. It was good, it was edible. The clam chowder wasn't great but I'm from Northern California. I know my clam chowder. Anyways, it's a good place to go if you're boring as fuck.  Come to Northern California if you want the real shit- sandwiches and clam chowder."}
{"text":"You've lost me, Cafe Zupas. I was willing to put up with the blaring music, the sterile lobby, the overly perky line workers. But the one thing I could count on you for was great vegetable soup & basil lemonade. Which you discontinued. Just a tip for anyone who is reading this: don't bother moving outside to avoid the noise, the speakers mounted on outside of the building are even louder than what is on inside. I'm making my soup at home."}
{"text":"This is my second time here and the food is decent and great for quick service. Unfortunately, something about the food this time made my girlfriend and I have an upset stomach. I think it was the soups. Eek!"}
{"text":"The food was very tasty. I recommend the lobster bisque. The service was excellent. The ladies greeted us with a warm welcome and gave us a great selection of food. It is an overall classy but convenient place to eat. When dinner was over some even cleaned up after us."}
{"text":"Great place for a quick lunch.Food is always great, but who the hell charges extra for croutons? Lol"}
{"text":"Very yummy! I had the tomato basil soup soooooo good!! Very big sit down area it was busy, but enough seats for everyone so that's nice."}
{"text":"Four stars for fresh and flavorful food and healthy marketing.
Two stars for lack of availability of nutritional information- from a widespread chain that should have this information readily available.

I'm on a health kick and have had this place bookmarked for a while. This location is close to my work, and I viewed their online menu to make my selections prior to going. I track calories and ran into extreme difficulty trying to get any info at all on this- none on their company website, a few dishes with info around the web, but all with unusually high numbers considering the dish descriptions.

Ultimately opted for the crab avocado melt sandwich combo with the cup of mushroom bisque- love how you can sample soups before ordering. Considering I got info that the particular sandwich was nearly 900 calories, I only ate half.
Appreciated the gesture of including a slice of bread and a chocolate-dipped strawberry dessert with my combo, which was well-priced at under $9 with tax and did not ask for a tip on the receipt.

Food was tasty, but sandwich was underwhelming considering the calories I was lead to believe I was \"paying\" for it. Soup was damn delicious though. Would go back for a soup and salad combo.

Seriously though- make your nutritional information available online and in stores (even if it's a brochure behind the counter by request!). Given the number of food allergies and the healthy image projected here, this should be expected."}
{"text":"Today I got the chicken pesto again. I love that sandwich! I tried the red pepper lobster soup and was not disappointed. Very tasty with a kick that doesn't burn until it hits the back of my throat. My only complaint, I ordered it to go and wasn't given any utensils. I see complaints about loud music. I've never experienced that. The last two times I was there around 6pm."}
{"text":"Love, love, love the food! However, I can't stand the way they ship you through like cattle! I get a headache everytime I have to go through that food line! Such chaos! It's very confusing and they screw up my order every time. They seem about as confused as I am. They try to rush you through, I finally had to tell them the last visit to all stop talking at once and to slow down. With that said, the food is great and I like how they rotate the menu seasonally so as to not get boring. I would only return if I had someone to stand in that God-awful line for me."}
{"text":"Loved the place. Good options for vegetarians. I had Cream of Mushroom and Mango yogurt based salad. I didn't like the dessert, but it does not make a lot of difference."}
{"text":"I loved this place!! There was no wait at all even though it was there first day of business they did a great job at getting people seated and tables cleaned pro I well definitely be retuning and recommending this place to friends and family."}
{"text":"5 stars tot the staff and how quickly they operate givens that they were slammed. This is a fairly fresh option for people who are looking for a quick bite. I had a make your own salad and soup, my friend has the turkey panini and soup. My salad was good they make sure to keep the toppings you add to a minimum and some items looked like they might have been treated with chemicals so they don't spoil as fast. The tortilla soup was ok. I had very few veggies or chicken, it was 90% tortilla strips. The sandwich was dry but decent, but we didn't care for the jambalaya. I thought the complimentary chocolate dipped strawberry was a nice touch. If you're on-the-go this is a good option."}
{"text":"I have came to this location a few times. I love cafe zupas and what they have to offer. They have a variety of sandwiches, soups and salads. 

Since I'm Muslim (halal only), my options from sandwiches are the carb avocado melt (I ask them to remove the bacon) or their ultimate grilled cheese. I love both, just depends if I want some seafood or not. 

Their soups are delicious as well. You can never go wrong with getting the ultimate grilled cheese sandwich with tomato basil soup."}
{"text":"Closed on Sunday's yet the front door was unlocked and able to walk right on in. Restaurant was empty and lights were all off, but sound system was on playing music. Don't worry, we went next door to T Mobile and they called the complex security and landlord to lock up. I should have made myself a sandwich."}
{"text":"Located inside the food court at the front entrance. Just look for the giant strawberry sign hanging out front.

Inside is cleverly decorated with lots of glowing colored lights in different areas. Sort of space age cafeteria style with super friendly service. Started when they opened the door for me and my family. Nice!

We all took advantage of the Lunch Combo Special. Comes with choice of two items. Soup, Salad or Sandwich. I went with the Wild Shroom Bisque and a Grilled Turkey Spinach Artichoke Panini. The ladies ordered an assortment of Signature Salads as well as some Soups. Even comes with a complementary Chocolate dipped Strawberry for an extra treat.

Everything was Fresh and Tasty. The wife and daughter really loved it. Even the sister in law. Maybe not the place to take a bunch of hungry men. Give them a try. ENJOY!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and neither time did Cafe Zupas disappoint.  The first time I got the salad and soup recommended by the smiling staff member handing out menus at the start of the line, and I can see why he said they were the most popular!  The second time I tried one of their sandwiches, also good.  The sandwich was a little smaller than I was picturing based on the  menu illustrations, but it is still plenty of food.    I think their salads are amazing, although their soups and sandwiches are pretty good too!"}
{"text":"A little hectic but worth it. Great quick bite on the go. We got the grilled cheese and Caesar salad sans the pollo."}
{"text":"I love the concept, a place for soup, and many options of soup! Plus salads and sandwiches. You walk inside and it is bright and there are many many menu options. I decided on a combo of sandwich and salad which was 8.99 and came with a fresh roll and chocolate covered strawberry along with the meal. My dining partner got a soup and sandwich combo.  The clam chowder was a bit to runny for my liking but it still got eaten. The sandwiches were tasty, on fresh ciabatta rolls, one was a panini style Honey Bacon Club with turkey, ham, bacon and honey mustard, it was tasty.  The salad was a Maui Chicken Salad, it was fresh and had lots of fruit and nuts and dried coconut, the dressing was sweet and I liked it a lot. My sandwich was an Italian cold sandwich that was pretty tasty as well.  They have a lot of soup options, but most are cream style, I wish there was a basic chicken noodle."}
{"text":"I have been to their other locations in Chandler and Mesa and really enjoyed my experience but this location really needs some help. It was a Friday night and was very busy and I understand that but the service was terrible. The person serving soup told me to move down the line, that he would get our soups ready. I didn't even have the opportunity to let him know what toppings we wanted on our soup. We sat down and I went to get our drinks. I accidentally dropped a cup and told the gentleman, who was standing right next to the drink station, that I had dropped my cup and could I get a new one? He said, \"Yeah, just go up to the counter and ask for another one.\" I had to go back to the line and cut in front of a bunch of people to ask for a new cup. How hard would it have been to get one for me? This kid needs some training. Next, my salad was tasty and so was my son's soup but everything else was awful. My daughter got the tomato soup, which tasted like they dumped a truckload of sugar in it, we had asked for cheese on top and never got it. She couldn't eat it. My soup, the Chicken Tortilla, tasted like a salt bomb went off. There are plenty of other places where a family of four can spend almost $50.00 for dinner and get much better service. We won't be back."}
{"text":"I wish there was a \"chain\" category. Cafe Zupas is now the second good chain restaurant I've been to!

I had the \"Try 2 Combo\", $7.99, and chose the Boston Crab Melt sandwhich and Thai Lobster Curry soup. Both were pretty darned good!

The menu looks great, as does the restaurant itself.

The personnel were very nice, accomodating and welcoming. One strange occurance was when I went to take a picture of their brownies, a lady that worked there told me they don't allow indoor photographs (wierd!). 

All in all, I totally enjoyed my lunch and will be back.

Desert Ridge peeps...you're getting one soon.."}
{"text":"Yesterday, my boyfriend and I tried Café Zupas for lunch. It was our first time. I was a little hesitant at first, but my hunger was making me bitchy and I didn't want the usual greasy burger, fries and fountains of ranch. We were immediately greeted by quite a few employees. They were all polite and genuine. I had no idea how the place worked, how to order food, or, apparently, where to stand in line. Regardless, the employees pointed us in the right direction and helped us order our meals. One guy persuaded me into getting the strawberry salad, which sounded so weird to me, but I gave in and tried it and it was so f****** amazing that I died. The pesto turkey sandwich thing brought me back though. The chocolate dipped strawberries on the side were so f****** cute I just could not the entire time. I was literally can'ting. They have a charging station for all of you who can't live without your phones and everything was clean. The kitchen was clean and the tables were wiped down immediately after guests left them. The employee who rang up my order (I didn't get his name because I'm rude and I also lost my receipt) was awesome to talk to. He was so sweet. He was a blonde guy with a nice smile. I wanted throw dollar bills at him, but he said they didn't accept tips. I SAID WUT. WUT DO U MEAN NO TIP??! Hey management, how hard is it to put a tip jar out for your hard-working, dedicated employees?! Next time I'm in there, I better see a tip jar or I'm bringing my own the next time I'm in there after that. 

That strawberry salad was so f****** good.

Keep up the good work you guys! We may not express it all of the time, but people like all of you in the customer service industry are greatly appreciated by consumers like me.

Thank you!"}
{"text":"My girlfriends favorite place to eat.   The berries salad and the tomato basil soup and the turkey avocado sandwich are our favorites!  Awesome place!  Fresh food every day."}
{"text":"Food is delicious, only thing is its so loud there with the music and people trying to talk over it...and it's very cold in there"}
{"text":"I had a Pesto chicken sandwich here.
This is one of the worst sandwich i ever had....
its much like the sandwich you get at gas stations.

The soup was good though."}
{"text":"Food was ok. Atmosphere was terrible. Exactly 10 minutes after leaving I had to stop at a QT gas station due to an upset stomach and let's just say I'm not going back."}
{"text":"3 1/2 stars, so far! I'm rounding up.

First time here and it was pretty good! 

Tried the choice of 2 combo with the Honey Bacon Sandwich and Roasted Red Pepper Lobster Bisque. Sandwich was ok, nothing special, but the the soup was delicious! 

Wasn't super impressed with the sandwich because the ingredients were just average since they used standard lunch meat and bacon. The panini grilled ciabatta bread was the best part.

I can't wait to try more of their soups. Their salad ingredients are vast and look very fresh so i'm sure the salads will be yummy as well. 

Definitely a great place for lunch or light eating!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and I enjoyed both visits. Both times I have gotten the pick 2 combo with a sandwich and soup. I've been wanting to try a salad but it seems that most salads follow the formula of sugary dressing + fresh fruit + candied nuts/dried fruit and I am not down with sweet salads.

Today I ordered the fresh herb chicken sandwich. I am sensitive to mayo (it's gross, lets be real) and I asked the employee behind if the chicken was covered in mayo and he said no after I asked twice using different words and... it was covered in mayo. I hate to complain so I ate it anyways and it was pretty OK. The fresh avocado, bacon and soft bread made up for the unsavory ingredient, though I won't make that mistake twice.

The soups have been, by far, my favorite part of coming to Cafe Zupas. They allow you to have a sample of the soups when choosing which almost makes it *harder* to decide. Today I went with the mushroom bisque and it was so fresh and delicious. It seems like most mushroom recipes come with truffle oil these days which, if not done right, tastes like rubber, but this soup was obviously super fresh. It didn't taste weighed down with heavy creams and butters too, it was simply perfect.

Lastly, there is no calorie count for any of their items. I've lost 40 lbs over the past year, my BF has lost 65 and we aren't obsessive, but we are mindful and their lack of nutritional info irks me. I'm not scared off of higher calorie meals and indulge weekly, but it would be good to know if my \"healthy lunch\" was really a caloric splurge. Maybe soon? Then 5 stars!"}
{"text":"It's the little things that make good places great, and Cafe Zupas does that well. The food is good, especially for the value. Went there for dinner and got the soup/sandwich combo. The small soup, bread and 1/2 of the sandwich filled me up, so I took the other 1/2 for tomorrow's lunch :)

The chicken tortilla soup was slightly salty, but the flavor was still pretty good. On the other hand, the crab avocado sandwich could have used a little more salt, but again, still pretty good.

The complimentary chocolate covered strawberries are a fantastic touch! Nice end to the meal. They also have a cool drink bar where you can create your own specialty beverages. There are a few suggestions listed on the cup.

All in all, they do a great job of distinguishing themselves from Panera (or other similar concepts). Cheerful staff, bright, clean interior. Definitely coming back again soon!"}
{"text":"When Zupas first opened it was great. Recently they have changed a lot. The strawberries are not even covered in chocolate and the portions are tiny. The amount you pay for soup and salad here I feel you should get a bigger portion. I really enjoy the mushroom soup."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch and fell in love with this healthy delicious choice. Had the crab, avocado Sammie with the Asian Salad. Such a great value for fresh, high quality food. Their selection of desserts and beverages was outstanding. Made me wanna play never will I ever ? The answer is; go to Panera! Lol. They just can't compete with this place. So many choices. Lunch for 2 was $23 with an ice tea and water for drinks. The bbq ranch salad and tortilla soup was also very tasty. You get a bread roll and butter included and the best for last... fresh strawberry hand dipped in Belgian chocolate as a treat for you. Wow !!! That's extra extra and shows love to your customers! Great concept! Great execution! Keep it up CZ! I'll be hitting this place up on the regular."}
{"text":"Fast and friendly service. They even clean your table for you! I'll recommend this place to everyone I know!"}
{"text":"Well we tried this place for a second time and highly disappointed.  $26.00 later for a salad, kids meal and soup and sandwich. Burned sandwich and barely little fruit."}
{"text":"Went for a quick bite. Had the combo with a crab melt and the lobster & roasted pepper bisque. Everything was well seasoned and the bisque was meaty, though it tasted more like crab than lobster. They send a chocolate covered strawberry home with each order. My daughter raved about the grilled cheese which is great because she is a picky eater. I will be back to try the Sakai and protein bowls!"}
{"text":"Went to Cafe Zupas yesterday for lunch with my parents, sister, and daughter. It was about 1:30 and the place was still packed. I ended up getting a kids grilled cheese and cup of soup to share with my daughter. The grilled cheese was OK...cheese not really melted so that was disappointing. For the soup I chose their limited time creamy onion soup which was actually very good (and I'm not a big soup fan). For $3.99 the kids meal is a great value. 

My dad and sister got the sandwich/salad combo: turkey and avocado sandwich with some strawberry chicken salad. They said both were good. I think it was $7.99 for a full sandwich and small, decent sized salad. 

With your soda purchase you can make your own italian soda and they have a nice selection of flavored syrups. 

Overall I liked the italian soda concept and the value wasn't too bad. I liked it a lot better than I like Paradise Bakery. I'm not a huge fan of PB so it's nice that there's a similar option in the same complex. The food overall was OK but wasn't anything incredible or spectacular. If you like the sandwich/salad/soup fare for lunch I'd give this place a try at least once."}
{"text":"How Many Times do I have to say my order.? HOW many times do I have to say my order.? Again. Three stars because the food is good but the order line has a bunch of confusion calling out orders and food. You can hear frustration amongst the staff taking orders. There is no organization whatsoever. The girl skipped my chicken all together and i had to ask twice about it. Management needs to restructure this system.!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my first experience at Cafe Zupas! The food was fresh and offered a lot of healthy options. They also have a wifi hotspot inside and a recharge station where you can sit, eat lunch and charge ur laptop/devices. Also, I liked the syrups they offer next to the soda machine so u can flavor ur drinks. They give chocolate covered strawberries with every order! Overall, I'm happy with this place and it is ABOUT TIME that we started getting better (by better i mean healthier) food options on this side of Henderson! Nothing but pizzerias and tons of fast food!! This place will do well especially in the hot summer months when a HOT meal just doesn't seem so appetizing! I got the turkey cranberry sandwich. I will be posting pictures of my order along with my fiancé's. I really like the turkey cranberry sandwich the honey mustard on the bottom was sweet and not to mustard-y Like some honey mustard's tend to be & I really liked the cranberry sauce on top with the sprouts. Also, I got the chicken chopped salad with blue cheese dressing. My only complaint was that I wish I had gotten the same type of lettuce that my fiancé got on his salad instead of the iceberg lettuce they put with mine. There isn't much nutritional value in iceberg lettuce were as he got the deep romaine greens that I would've wanted. Although, I'm sure that if I had known that it came with that type of lettuce I could've asked for the kind that he got. I will make sure to do that next time. All in all this was a great experience and I highly recommend this place if you're looking for something that is not deep-fried or saturated in fat. Also, great tasting fresh ingredients!! The ambience of the place wasn't bad either!!! I asked, and they do do call in orders where you can come pick up your food if you like. Good to know. Come check this place out!!"}
{"text":"First ime at a Zupas. Arrived at 4:30pm. I was greated  by two employes behind home the counter.  When I told them I was new, they quickly explained the process.  I got the Mushroom Bisque. Rhey habe 8 different soups to choose from and they offered me a sample. I also got a the Spinach Berry Salad. Everything was going well, until I asked how much the drinks were. 1.99 for a bottle of water or Fountain drink. I took my order to go at that point and I was pleasantly surprised when I got home to see that a giant chocolate covered Strawberry came with the Berry Salad. Everything was good and I will return."}
{"text":"It is always hard finding a healthy place to eat that is quick and delicious. Cafe Zupas fills that quota.

Their price is very reasonable and cheaper than other places like panera or corner bakery.  They have a good price on a combo deal for $7.99

I usually pick a sandwich and half soup.  My favorite soup there is Roasted Red Pepper and Lobster soup and my favorite sandwich is the turkey bacon avocado.

The place is setup like a cafeteria style where you order in line and your food will be given to you at the cash register once it is done and you go find a table to sit down on.

When the place is busy a worker will help you find a table and they also clean up your mess for you when you are done eating.

Try stopping by and giving this place a chance"}
{"text":"So pleased to have one of these close to work.  Great food, good selection about time someone gave paradise a run for their money that place is pathetic.   Zuppas is cheaper and better by far. 

Let's see what do I want a free 5 cent cookie or a $1 chocolate covered strawberry.  And meal is cheaper too.  We'll done Zuppas

Not sure who the 1 star reviewer spoke to as I have ordered here for personal and work and given them all the allergies that we have between myself and people at work and Zuppas have worked with me and provides all that information."}
{"text":"If you're close to the area definitely try their sandwiches! I got the 2 combo sandwich and half a  soup. I really enjoyed the Italian club, however the lobster bisque was way too salty. I heard from other customers that their food is salty. 
They also provided a free chocolate covered strawberry for dessert."}
{"text":"I came into this store the other day and was super upset after explaining my dietary needs and why I needed a kids meal besides a larger meal and they were not accommodating to my needs at all. After saying the cost would be two dollars more I was fine but then they didn't even fill up my soup a quarter of the way and still gave me a small drink. I was super confused if they were charging me for my age or the add on of the meal. After I contacted the store, They emailed me back saying sorry but they will not accommodate to me because its policy. Obviously, they do not care if you have something wrong with you and just want to charge you extra. Pretty sad when your small meal cause more then your friends large salad next to you."}
{"text":"I needed a salad joint and this is what my phone took me to.  I was treated really well. The place was super clean and friendly. The food was amazing.  I will be back again"}
{"text":"This restaurant is located close to the Route 202 - very convenient. The food is OK, the staff was friendly and the prices were appropriate for their market. This chain, in my opinion, is targeted for health conscious yoga chicks that want something light. They hit that mark.

If a big, burly, and hungry construction guy were to visit, I recommend the sandwich, soup and extra side plus desert. Only then would he leave \"feeling full\".

One annoying thing: people leave their food wrappers and containers on the table. It looks tacky. This restaurant should either put in some garbage cans or have their staff clean better and faster."}
{"text":"Their soup portion policy is complete false advertising. Pay over $6 for a large and get cheated. Pay for a large bowl and what you get is 3/4 of a bowl. When confronted, the rude manager stated \"it's our policy\", I asked if this was displayed for the customer to make an informed decision, the response see was \"no, it's our internal policy\". Well, my policy is to spend my money at honest establishments, and this sure is not one of them. STAY AWAY UNLESS YOU WANT TO GET CHEATED."}
{"text":"Excellent service every time! They don't have the \"usual\" sandwich/salad menu that most places offer, which makes them different! Great selection and has got me to try new things. I am absolutely in love with their balsamic cherry salad (minus the chicken)!"}
{"text":"Since my original visit here, I've tried their Crab Avocado Melt Panini, Pesto Chicken Panini, Lobster Bisque, and Chicken Enchilada Chili.

Both paninis were fantastic, with a great mix of textures and flavors, blending crispy crust with chewy fillings, savory meat with sweet accents.

The Lobster Bisque I think suffers from too many chunks of \"stuff\" - carrots, tomatoes, celery, onion; it takes away from the lobster bisque as a whole, and I find the simplicity of the Roasted Red Pepper & Lobster Bisque to be superior.

The Chicken Enchilada Chili is very flavorful, but also very heavy. A bit too heavy, personally, but very hearty as a result.

Also, I don't know how I missed it before, but Cafe Zupas has a nice spice rack full of different hot sauces, right next to the condiments and beverages. That's always a nice thing to see."}
{"text":"Glad I stopped in for lunch!

I recommend the Wisconsin cheddar cauliflower soup. I had the crab avocado panini - did not care for the bread but everything in it was very good . 

The restaurant can get very messy because customers do not take the time to put away their trashes and garbage correctly . The clean up staff worked really hard keeping everything nice and clean . 

The front staff was very friendly and fast . Clean up  staff were very helpful and sweet .

I'll be back for more !"}
{"text":"Food was good but I am never coming back here.  After tasting my soup, I noticed it was cold so I brought it up to the front counter to ask for it to get warmed. They took the soup and put it back into the large soup serving bowl, mixed the soup around, then gave me a new bowl out of the soup. I spoke to the manager after and let her know that the whole batch of soup needed to be thrown out and they just committed a health violation. She apologized and nothing further happened. 
Definitely not eating here again. If this goes on in front of customers, I can only imaging what the back kitchen is like."}
{"text":"Watery clam chowder. Mediocre sandwich. Overpriced. Not even slightly impressed.

Husband got the turkey avocado and the turkey was a lunch meat. Not real turkey. 

All their salad menu said its \"house-chopped\".. What is the F-ing big deal about chopping the vegetables in your own restaurant. Too much marketing trick for me. Just an opinion. 

This will be the first and last time we will done here. Sorry."}
{"text":"I haven't been to zupa's in awhile but I have always enjoyed their bread. So disappointed to see the change to \"average\" rolls today."}
{"text":"I really love the food at Zupas. The BBQ chicken salad and tomato soup are the best.  

On the down side is that they are painfully slow. I am deterred from eating here more often as I know it will simply take too long. All seems to run smoothly to order salad and soup but then the line comes to a dead stop!. Even during extremely busy lunch hours they only have one cashier. As I stand here in line now several people have left and gone to eat elsewhere"}
{"text":"Great place, food is delicious and at a great value. Doesn't appear to be any leadership behind the counter though, bunch of kids standing around.  Not that it's a huge deal to me but they were out of 3 soups, and when asked if they would get anymore by the lady in front of me the kid didn't know what to say and kinda just stood there. Will be back again to give it another chance."}
{"text":"I've never had Cafe Zupas before but me likey. It's fast casual style where you order at the counter, but it resembles a cafeteria line more than anything. The first person you encounter starts the sandwich or salad, and as you make your way down the line to soups, you are greeted by someone new. They plate your soup, and the third person puts your order together and takes payment. Then you can seat yourself in the dining room if you are eating in. 

I chose the pick 2 combo which includes a whole sandwich and either half of a salad or a cup of soup. I chose the ultimate grilled cheese as my sandwich and the Wisconsin cauliflower soup. I like that you can try samples of the soup since there are a bunch to choose from, and I always have a hard time deciding what to get. 

The ultimate grilled cheese is cheddar and muenster cheeses, tomatoes, and a homemade pesto spread on a white or wheat cibiatta. Then it's toasted on the panini so it's hot and melty. It was really one of the better grilled cheeses that I've had. The soup was amazing as well. It was cheesy and delicious, and reminded  me of a potato soup except it was cauliflower so it's healthier! At least we'll go with that. 

Now that it's fall they have fall themed items like a turkey, cranberry and brie sandwich, and pumpkin spice creme brulee. I will definitely come back here to satisfy my salad and soup cravings."}
{"text":"DO NOT COME HERE. 

HORRIBLE FOOD POISONING FROM THE LOBSTER BISQUE. Picked up dinner with my boyfriend last night and after eating, he was vomiting all night long. It got so bad I had to take him to urgent care at 4am. We used to come here once every month or so but we will never be returning to any location again. 

Aside from that, I requested no cheese in my sandwich because I'm lactose intolerant and guess what was in my sandwich?? Cheese! And this was after they asked me to change my order since they ran out of the sandwich that I had originally requested for."}
{"text":"Everything was excellent. I went here yesterday and it was wonderful. The employees are friendly, the food is fantastic, and the restaurant itself looked very nice. And the prices aren't bad either! I'd definitely go here if you're looking for good food and nice scenery."}
{"text":"Cafe Zupas is my go to lunch spot. The staff is always friendly and I know I am getting a fresh, healthy and consistent meal. 

My favorite thing to order is the create your own salad and the vegetable and quinoa soup. They have a great variety of greens, proteins, vegetables and nuts to put on your salad. All meals come with bread and a chocolate dipped strawberry, which who doesn't love a chocolate dipped strawberry. They also have a great selection of paninis."}
{"text":"Overall, I would say this place Is pretty solid. Fresh ingredients and they make everything right in front of you so you know they're going to get it right. 

I usually go with the protein bowls and they're pretty tasty. They also have half and half combos if you're looking for a nice soup and sandwich. 

A great place for lunch and all entrees come with a chocolate dipped strawberry! Nice."}
{"text":"Good soup and sandwich place, they need to learn how to serve food a little faster to compete with the Panera Bread."}
{"text":"I visit this location often and I'm very disappointed with the cold hard rolls they serve. After showing the manager Rory he refused to heat it up for me or even to offer me an alternative saying they are all the same even though I've been given fresh rolls that were still warm from an oven warmer they keep them in. Not sure if it's because the bag they keep them in was left wide open but I'm sure nobody wants cold hard bread! I gave it back to him!"}
{"text":"Was talked into going because most of us men dont like a soup and salad for dinner thing...LOL... But I was surprised, I was happy with food and their special made drinks. However the manager was very rude and abrupt. I'm guessing since we can at 9pm, she had long day and just wanted to go home. As it being my first time, my son wanted  a caesar salad, she said we dont have stuff that simple and walked away to do something else and left me standing there. So I went back to table and let wife order before I was rude back. Is it really that hard to have customer service? Really blows me away these walk up places will put out a TIP cup but do the absolute minimum in service...If the lady that manages place actually sees this, being nice and giving customer service might actually get people to return!!!"}
{"text":"This place used to be 5-star but they changed the bread to generic rolls. Yes it does have that big of an impact on the quality of the meal. The employees are still amazing but please bring back the original bread!!"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times now. My first experience was horrible, second time was way better. It made up for the first but this is what I've noticed. My first sandwich was a good size, the second was smaller, and this last one was the smallest. Granted I get the panini but this last sandwich, I was like where's the artichoke. There were only these slivers of artichokes, 4 half slices of tomatoes, like 3/4 leaves of spinach and 2/3 slices of turkey. So based on my 3 experiences I and giving 3 stars of the overall and an extra one for the cream of mushroom soup. It's the soup that's has me coming back in all honesty.


As I was leaving, I'm assuming the manager asked about my experience. I told her about the sandwich and she rectified the situation. Customer service is a 10"}
{"text":"This healthy, no frills restaurant offers great salads, sandwiches and soups at reasonable prices. Our team goes there for lunch before their games. No reservations needed. Looks like it does mostly a strong lunch crowd. 

Menu options? Their salads were fresh and comes with many side items you can add. You simply order your food first and pick up your food later. No waiters. 

The real reason the girls liked this restaurant was the chocolate covered strawberries that comes with your meal."}
{"text":"Let's talk about good quality food. Zupas has a lot of food for different types of taste buds. It's a very fresh and diverse. Even the salads don't taste boring. The customer service here is always superb. Now for this type of quality you do have to pay a couple bucks extra but it's worth it. I love everything there from their sandwiches, soups, salads, dessert and drinks. Now keep in mind I don't eat here on the regular cause it is pricey for my wallet. I usually do lots of catering orders for my office. I love that everyone can get box lunches and make them specific to them. You can pick from 2 items from cup of soup,salad,sandwich. It comes with a chocolate covered strawberry or cookie. For catering they don't offer any of their infused drinks which sucks cause I would get a gallon of each. They did mess up a couple catering orders but since I called and spoke to the catering manager they did apologized and rewarded me for the inconvenience. These last 2 catering orders have been perfect."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I really like Zupas as a whole. However, this is easily the worst location I have ever been to. 

The staff all behave like it's their 1st day on the job. No one seems to know what they're doing, and they all seem very uncertain about everything happening.

The food itself seems...off. The portions of fruit in the salad I got (nuts about berries) seems much lower than normal. The lobster bisque was insanely watery and contained absolutely no meat (not the case at other locations). 

Personally, I'd drive the extra 5-10 minutes to a different location if I was really jonesin for some Zupas."}
{"text":"Over-priced sandwiches but they have pretty good soups.  I really like their lobster bisque soup - it comes in a small bowl, which makes it expensive for the amount of serving. And, if you order it to go, you get even less.  They have patio seating but no misters or warming lamps.  I like going here when the weather cools off - we sit outside eating hot soup & bread.  They have bottomless fountain drinks and flavoring that you can add to your soda.  They have non alcoholic beverages and they're closed on Sunday, which sucks because that's when I love to have a light lunch."}
{"text":"Quick friendly service, quality ingredients, great tasting food.  The pick 2 deal is definitely worth it as it could feed 2 people at least!  The infused drinks are really refreshing.  And if you have room, the housemade creme brulee is awesome!"}
{"text":"Wow the best soup ever. Always my go to. I love to go here because there is always a treat on the tray when you order a meal. They have the best lemonade as well"}
{"text":"Food is great. I notice some of the sandwiches do not taste the same, lack consistency. But still go back often. Amazing soups and salads too"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff, great food, acceptable prices. I recommend to anyone looking for a quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"We stopped at Zuppa's for a quick dinner with family after visiting the \"Glittering Lights\" Christmas Display at the Las Vegas Speedway.
I love their variety of Soups and Salads for a light fresh dinner. All the soups are good but my favorite is the Lobster Bisque and the Mango Berry salad was excellent. If you haven't been there give it a try you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I have eaten here 4 times in last week. Really nice option for lunch or dinner. The food tastes great and fresh. Im a fan!"}
{"text":"Although I dislike spending more than $10 for lunch, I had to give it to Cafe Zupas- this was WELL worth the $11 price tag!! Apparently, I just missed the lunchtime rush, because when I arrived, it was nearly empty, but there was a pretty long line when I walked out of the door. 

The restaurant is extremely clean and bright, which is always a plus. They have a wide variety of soups, salads and sandwiches. The soups are pre-made, but you can get a variety of add-ons, such as bacon bits, croutons, etc. The sandwiches are made to order, and they fix the salads right in front of you.

I decided to get the \"pick 2 combo\" with the lobster bisque and the crab and avocado melt sandwich. With a drink,  I was at an $11 lunch. I was mentally grumbling under my breath until I saw the size of the bowl of soup, the hunk of bread for dipping, the beautiful sandwich, and the chocolate covered strawberry for dessert! WOW!

When I took my first sip of the soup... I thought I'd gone to heaven! I seriously could have taken a bath in that lobster bisque! Rich, creamy, full of flavor and lobster. Just that alone would have been worth close to $10. The sandwich was just as good, full of crab, tomato, avocado and bacon strips. I especially appreciated that the bread, while warm and toasty, was not hard and crunchy (I have a fundamental opposition to crunchy, hard bread). I had to exercise some restraint and ask for a box so I could have the other half for dinner. 

The employees of the restaurant were all very nice and friendly and they will bus your table for you. I don't get out to Hender-tucky very often, but Zupas will be on my return list for lunch!"}
{"text":"This is a go to place for lunch. The specials are reasonable and the food is beyond good. The soups and salads are always made fresh and then there's desert!"}
{"text":"I love the food but honestly hate coming in here. Staff is unable to retain a lot of information (aka remembering salad dressing) and ALWAYS messes up my order. Manager with mustache is super creepy and super fake and SUPER RUDE. The staff makes me so uncomfortable I will drive farther to avoid this location....."}
{"text":"Fantastic place for a healthy & quick meal. I've gotten take out and catered work lunches from Cafe Zupa, and I've been very happy with everything. The menu has a lot of choices, included vegetarian friendly options, the food is fresh, portions are large, and it's inexpensive. 

I really like their salads, which are actually large enough to make a meal out of. Bonus that they include a roll of bread and chocolate covered strawberry. The Kale Quinoa is my favorite, because it's savory, healthy, and has a nice kick from the berries without being too sweet. The vegetarian sandwich is solid, and the pesto aioli makes it a little more interesting than the normal cheese/tomato/lettuce you can get stuck with otherwise.

The desserts are soooo good. My favorite is the salted caramel brownie but they are all good."}
{"text":"Love the food selections and the customer service! Very patient and friendly staff. I would recommend getting the lobster bisque."}
{"text":"The first time I was here I kept going back after. I love their pick 2 combo. I always get the soup and sandwich. My go to is always the crab avocado melt with the creamy cauliflower soup. I had their lobster bisque and it was pretty good but not really as creamy as expected. I haven't tried any other sandwich so I don't what else is good. They all sound interesting though."}
{"text":"My entire family LOVES Zupas! Their kids meals are a great deal, desserts are yummy, and everything I've tried has been satisfying & delicious. A great value."}
{"text":"Great place to grab some healthy food on the go! My team placed a dinner order over the phone and got lots of healthy food for a great price. Food was ready when we got there and the employees were very friendly. Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"Delicious salad and sandwiches
I recommend the cauliflower soup
Add on cheese & bacon are 69cent each"}
{"text":"Amazing food. I get stuffed easily for a good price! The staff is also friendly and nice."}
{"text":"So yummy! Had the Tropical Chicken salad, it had the perfect amount of dressing and toppings! The staff was very friendly, it was really clean and the food was great! Can't wait to go back with my family!"}
{"text":"Im just more upset then anything......aside from this fact the food is ok....just kind of a glorified panera.....not very many vegetarian options (been a veg for over 15 years and would like something other than salad or a grilled cheese sandwich)...anyway..my boyfriend ate there yesterday and exactly one hour after eating he got a HORRIBLE headache and stomach ache and threw up several times...i called zupas and asked to speak to a manager...i let her know the situation and told her exactly what he ate...all she said was ok thank you ill check everything..never said im sorry, never said hope he feels better..nothing....i dont know...ive owned a restaurant before and if that happened i would apologize and at the very least wish the person well....just bugged me"}
{"text":"Really good option if you're in the mood for soups, salads, or sandwiches! Everything is really fresh and always tastes good. The chocolate strawberry is the best way to end the meal. The infused drinks are a great addition too. It's my new favorite place for a quick bite to eat. You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu."}
{"text":"Went in for the first time. You are welcomed by an irritating humming sound and then a menu that seems straight forward unless you decide to build your own...I avoided that and ordered from their pre-selected choices. 
I ordered salad and sandwich combo. Did enjoy the salad and the sandwich was not as good as I had hoped it would be. 
I didn't order the soup and they didn't seem to look healthy. I did however get a sample taste of their French onion soup and that was ok, the reason why I say ok is because it was too salty.  All their soups seem to be high in sodium. 
If I were to ever make a second visit I would choose to purchase a salad and bring earplugs. 
There was another thing I found to be discouraging; I brought my child and the menu wasn't attractive so I purchased the meal with grilled cheese and chicken tenders. Neither was a hit but the kid was hungry and was willing to eat the chicken fingers/tenders (not enough) so went back to order a side of chicken fingers/tenders and they would allow me to purchase a side of chicken fingers/tenders and was TOLD I must order another kids meal. 
I will never go back if I have my kid with me."}
{"text":"Such a great place for a really fresh salad, create your own or choose off their progressive and flavorful menu.  I always get the same one since it came out Cherry Balsamic Chicken on fresh greens.  I cannot get enough of it BUT I do like just about everything I have ordered and will drive out of my way to pick up ToGo if I have the craving and I have the craving a lot.  I love that they also give you a big hunk of bread and a chocolate covered strawberry with every order.  Great for catering your parties too.

Tell them Chef Sandra sent you!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere was cool but food was ehhh! I wanted to like it but it didn't taste very fresh! More like packaged lunch meat and salad. Soup was cold and it felt like I was in a cafeteria."}
{"text":"Dizzapointing... subpar at best.  Misleading menu on try two combo.  Says pick any two of the following: sandwich, soup, salad.  But you can't pick 2 sandwiches.   Instead it should say pick 2 items out of the 3 offered. Orders a large soup and they don't even fill container.  Thought to say if I would go back."}
{"text":"What a great places a verity of stuff to choose from the staff very friendly and warm welcoming place. Very clean and drink station is fun to mess with everything is fresh and clean eats and that's hard to find. We will definitely be coming back to this place."}
{"text":"I usually go here on weekends and I recommend that as the best time. We went on. Monday and the service and food quality were terrible. I noticed the bill was MUCH higher than usual and noticed that for a bowl of soup that has bacon and cheese included in menu description (which I have purchased in past at standard price) now listed everything other than the soup as an add on. so it was 1.50 more per bowl. I had a panini and when I picked it up I noticed there was no bread on the bottom of the sandwich. it appeared that it stuck to the grill but they served it any way. The manager was too busy to discuss it so I argued with rude girl at counter glad when second location near me opens so don't have to go back here."}
{"text":"Highly recommend this place if you're in the Arizona area. The salads are fresh and tasty with mutiple toppings you can choose from. They also have a variety of soups and sandwiches to choose from. I also like how the staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"I never write reviews so the fact I took time to download Yelp and create a profile means something to me lol. 

I gave this location a 3 stars because I love the food, it's always fresh and the restaurant is clean when we go in for lunch which is why we keep coming back.

But good lord, the customer service is downright terrible every single time.
Previously We called to see if we able to place an order over the phone in advance because there were a few from the office looking to order and thought it might be easier, they told us no that we would need to place a catering order and the next one available was 1 hour and 45 minutes away. 
We didn't want to cater because we all had separate individual orders so we thanked them and hung up. Flash forward and we're actually in the restaurant and once again they tell us we need to go place a catering order and wait 30 minutes? We just wanted to order like normal, so we politely refused and did just that and ordered individually. 

Today when i went in, the man at the start of the line asked me what he could get me and when I went to start ordering he interrupted to start talking to the coworkers gathered in a huddle next to him and ignored me. Then goes back to me almost annoyed that I'm standing there. I'm a little taken aback but whatever, the next guy asks what I want I tell him cashews and he tries to put pistachios on my salad and I politely stop him and say \"no, sorry, cashews\" in case he didn't hear me correctly. He replies \"right\" and looks at me like I'm dumb and still tries to put pistachios on my salad so I say more loudly, \"Not pistachios, cashews\". This earns another look.

I'm finally done getting my order heading towards the door and two gentlemen are standing there shooting the shit, one of them half assedly opens the door for me and as I'm saying thank you he lets the door swing shut on my shoulder. He goes \"Oh sorryyyy! Anyway\" and goes back to his conversation.

I'm blown away at the lack of customer service they provide here. Probably won't go back for awhile."}
{"text":"I received a gift card to Cafe Zupas recently and my husband and I decided to check it out tonight.  My first impression of Cafe Zupas was based on their website, which is very clean and easy to use.  

Once we arrived, I noticed that they have their menu posted on a well lit pillar just outside the door.  From there my husband and I were able to figure out exactly what we wanted before we stood in line.  The set up to order is pretty much like you would see at a Chipotle, where they ask you what you'd like if you're ordering a salad or a sandwich.  The soups are toward the end of the line.  

One thing I noticed right away was that the restaurant is very clean and tidy.  Many of the ingredients up front as well as in the back room were all labeled.  I really enjoyed that you could see through to the back room.  While we were waiting to pay, I noticed a worker dipping the strawberries which comes with each meal. 

My husband and I both had the whole sandwich half soup or salad deal and the salted caramel creme brulee.   I also noticed that they have a drink station with house made lemonade and green teas.  I thought that was pretty cool since the ingredients of each drink was listed.  (There were 5 or less for each drink)

Our meals were amazing!  I wasn't able to nibble on my husbands because he must have been really hungry and he really enjoyed his sandwich and salad!  I had the Grilled Cheese and the Wisconsin Cauliflower soup.  It was all amazing!  I thought the creme brulee was really good. I even mentioned to my husband that you know it's good when you can see the specks of vanilla! Yummy!

I was very satisfied with Cafe Zupas and I can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Went to Zuppa's 75th  and Bell Location in Glendale AZ. Had frequented this location prior for lunch twice and including this time twice for dinner.  NOT a pleasant experience customer service wise on last 3 visits ...liked the food so kept coming back. Thought service would get better, but no luck.  Very stingy portions... they actually count the number of  of strawberries or thin apple slices they give you on your salad and are lucky to get maybe 5 or 6 slices. More lettuce than anything. If you ask them to add a bit more anything they upcharged you. In order to get more than 2 ozs of protein (chicken) you are upcharged nearly Two bucks. I would not be surprised if weight and measures doesnt site this place, because what they tell you is 2ozs is more like crumbs...not sure you would even taste the chicken in the salad or even see it for that matter. What upset us the most was we were in the middle of our meal  and an employee approached us letting us know he has to dump the tea because it was now 10pm and they close at 10pm. Asked if they could leave it for 5 to 10 more minutes and we would hurry to finish our meal being they had plenty of other work to do, but he said they were technically closed and it had to be dumped and said I could purchase another drink if I wanted more to finish my meal with so I would have an extra cup to fill my cup as he had to empty the tea right then. Furious that he was unwilling to accommodate us after spending $30.00 for soup and sandwiches, I asked for the manager, who said she would leave it open for a little longer and that her employee had a check list to finish before going home. I thanked her and she promptly went behind the counter and turned two customers away saying they were closed. The door wasn't locked, no food was put away, and mind you that it was barely 10pm. We packed the remainder of our food and left to enjoy our meal in better company. Will not visit this location again..."}
{"text":"For quick service, this is a nice fit for me. Good clean, not processed food . It's close to my home, gym,etc.  The salads are freshly made. The portions are just enough."}
{"text":"I just love this place.  From the time you walk in to the time you leave you feel clean and good about yourself and what you ate and have a good feeling about your lunch choice.

This location was very clean and always they are very friendly. I describe this place as like a subway type ordering system for salads, sandwiches and soups but way better. They have menus available in the line to make it easier to be ready to order and have many combo options.

One of my favorite choices is the California cob salad and the garden veggie chowder soup. Highly recommend both.  

They always give you a chocolate covered strawberry and a piece of bread!

Also many beverage choices , and options with raw honey sugar alternatives in their beverages which is nice. As well as sea salt and ground pepper options on the table.

Another bonus, the charging station bar. What a great option for people on their lunch break!"}
{"text":"Haven't been here in years.  Had sanwich  and the salad. Mango berry salad with a yogurt  dressing and nuts.only 320 calories.  Dressing had a nice tangy flavor and was very light not overwhelming. Had the California turkey sandwich . Too much bread.  Took top off. The table was not clean  it service was fast"}
{"text":"I really enjoy dining here. The soups are hot, rich and tasty, the salads are really fresh and you can customize them to your liking, the staff is very friendly, and the whole cafe has a bright, contemporary, casual ambiance. You can customize your drinks at their drink bar which has syrups and \"recipes\" for various combinations. All that and good prices too. This place is a winner."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. I'm digging the infused waters and teas. I also like the chocolate covered strawberries with every meal. 

Today I had a turkey artichoke panini with red pepper and lobster bisque. 

The soup was fantastic I expected it to just be lobster flavored, but there's a noticeable amount of lobster in there. It came with a chunk of baguette (which I wish was a little crustier). 

The sandwich was good, but it was made for gringos- thankfully they have a selection of hot sauces (I settled on chipotle Tabasco). It was also a little too mayonnaisey for my taste (I don't like hot mayonnaise), but somebody else might like it. It was still good mind you, just not great. 

I didn't have an issue with the portion size (perhaps it has been corrected). I'm kinda muscley, so I'm typically a big eater, and I was satisfied (as my second lunch)

The staff is super nice, if they're still this happy in a few months, they're service and culture manager will be pilfered by Disney. Seriously, the service standard is fantastic. 

In the end, we'll be back, however; the food at Panera is a little better."}
{"text":"I hate coming in this place- but I am a marketer and when an office requests this place I am forced to .. these girls are so concerned with their \"canned speeches\" they don't LISTEN- my order gets screwed up every time so when I questioned Aylin about my order she starts arguing with me ?? And I was just trying not to short them. The girl st the register was only going to charge me for one salad I got 3 so I brought it to their attention. Did I say I hate this place ? Lol
OMG JUST GOT TO MY DESTINATION AND ONE OF THE SANDWICHES AREN'T HERE !! 
DID I SAY I HATE THIS PLACE"}
{"text":"Ordered the Cuban - Delicious.  Service was great too.  Only problem is that sandwich was the smallest I have seen in a very long time.  If it were twice the size it would be ok, that's how small it is.  3 or 4 bites and it's gone. Disappointing..."}
{"text":"Had the worst experience at this location
For my 1st visit to a zupas, it just may be my last.
From the moment we walked in the door it felt chaotic.
I wasnt offered a sandwich (and not knowing how it works, i didnt ask) instead i stood like a deer in headlights.
Someone asked me if i wanted a salad, i said kale & quinoa. Only to be told they were out of quinoa. I added chicken instead.
When my wife noticed i hadnt ordered a sandwich, i told her nobody asked me if i wanted one or what i wanted other then the salad. In the mean time the people behind the line were yelling for salads and other stuff and dropping containers on the floor. It seemed a bit messy.
My wife mentioned to a girl that i wanted a sandwich, but ny now i was over it and just wanted to get to the register.
As we paid and went to walk away to find a seat an employee came out of the kitchen area only to bump into me and just kept walking, no acknowledgement what so ever. Any other time i would have ignored it, but this day i was carrying my 4 day old daughter, now I was IRATE.
I talked to a \"manager\" and she seemed to not care, but did tell me that, she will talk to the employees boss and probably send them home and they will reconsider their employment with the company. (I was a bit confused on why she needed to share that information with me)

All in all
The salad i had was good
My wife likes the sandwiches
And I may consider returning, but it will NOT be to this location"}
{"text":"We stopped by on a whim with our kids for dinner after school. It was our first time there and they welcomed our family and were great about explaining the menu and letting us sample the soups. The tomato soup is AMAZING! Our girls enjoyed their soup and grilled cheese and the chocolate covered strawberries are a great way to end the meal! Since it was our first time, I assumed we were supposed to bus our own table. A young lady came out and kindly let me know we could leave the rest and they take care of it for us  oops! Great experience, bright lights, clean interior, I hope they make it!! We will be back to do our part and support this healthier option in Middleton!"}
{"text":"I was quite pleased with my experience at Cafe Zupas. It was so clean that everything sparkled. The service was super fast. I had a delicious salad but the best part was the chocolate covered strawberry that came with it! Overall, I found Zupas to be very nice and definitely a place I would go to again."}
{"text":"I just got 4 wisdom teeth pulled and came here for soup, I was so happy with my meal I got 2 soups (one to take home lol) thank you!"}
{"text":"Welcome to the west valley.  I would usually stop in when I was down town, but it's so nice to have a location closer to home.  Went on opening weekend (Thanks for the 50% off coupon) and all went extremely smoothly.  Returned this weekend as well and still just as smooth.  Great food selection.  Of course I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Asian Citrus Salad and the Spring salad mix made this salad. I loved the manderin oranges and the noodles,They also gave a chocolate dipped strawberry and a slice of french toast with your meal and with a soda  and a rocky road brownie added, this meal was Great."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why this location has gotten such bad ratings so far. Yes they are newly opened, and the staff are new, but when we went, service was very fast, everyone knew what they were doing, and the food was good!

It was very busy when we went and the line moves fast. The main thing that bothered me about this place is that it's cramped. Most people will walk in the front door but the tables are really jam packed in there, so it's hard to get to the back to get in line. There is also a side door that would be a more logical entrance but I think most don't know it's there.

Also after ordering, most people will turn to the right to walk away, which puts you behind the drink station. You then have to walk back around it, which in many cases you will be walking across the people walking in, which again will be trying to walk past people getting their drinks. I think they should put a big sign on the front door to use the side door as the entrance, and use the front door as the exit. If this place continues to be this busy, I think it would control the flow of traffic much better. Or they could turn the drink station around, which I think would be a great idea, but probably out of the question.

As far as the food, prices are very good if you don't go overboard with the add ons, which are $0.69 each. But sandwiches are less than $6 each, and are small, but the size is equal to its price IMO. We tried the Cubano, Turkey spinach artichoke (TSA), Turkey bacon avocado (TBA), and Chicken salad. The best is the Cubano. It has the most amount of meat and the pork is really tender. It's the same pork as what's used in the Pulled Pork and Cilantro Pork, though I have yet to try those. The runner up was the TSA, refreshing yet satisfying.

Every order comes with a small chocolate dipped strawberry. If that's not enough for you for dessert, they do have several house made desserts that are VERY sweet!

Soups are also very tasty. We tried the lobster bisque and the clam chowder. I like the lobster bisque better. It has a bit of a spicy kick to it. The clam chowder had big chunks of clam but was a little on the salty side."}
{"text":"This place is totally amazing! Everything is so delicious and fresh, staff is super friendly! Best soups and salads, their protein quinoa bowl was perfect today!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I had been dying for a good salad place in the area for a long time. Went here for the first time awhile back... I had no idea how everything worked but loved how someone greeted me and explained not only how everything worked but the menu items as well. It was very nice. Then watched everyone make the items, one of my favorite things is the California salad. It's delicious. And their sandwiches are all very good as well. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because they r closed on Sunday's which i respect but it's very inconvenient for me , especially because I don't remember that all the time ."}
{"text":"The Skinny: similar to Panera bread, this joint features overly sweet food and not that great bread (3) service: good, counter service, nothing special (3) value: it's okay, nothing special.

The hubs dragged me here to try out this joint.

We each ordered a combo - I ordered the Chinese chicken salad with tomato soup and the hubs ordered a half sammy with the cream of mushroom soup. Each combo comes with a huge hunk of generic tasting sourdough bread that is pretty unappetizing and stone cold. Oyster crackers are available for the soup. 

My Chinese chicken salad tasted alright - it wasn't anything special. They were really light on the amount of protein served in this chicken salad. I tried the tomato soup which was really really sweet. I don't think I would order that again.

The hubs ordered the Asian BBQ pork sandwich which was again too sweet and overly sauced. The filling is minimal and the bread is really nothing special. I kind of don't like the bread - the weird overly doughy firm bread is not to my taste. Call me crazy but I think I prefer the yoga-mat chemical laced Subway bread better than the bread they use here. It really isn't all that.

I think the chocolate strawberry was the best thing that came with our meals.

The cool thing that they do have here is the different Italian syrups in their beverage station so you can customize your drink into something new. That is really cool.

Given the quality of their product, I'm not sure if I need a repeat experience. I really wanted to love it, but their food is too sweet and I'm not really a fan of their bread. If there was no where else to go and I was in the middle of nowhere, yeah, I'd give this place another shot. However being located next to all these other great little eateries, I think I'll pass on this joint. 3 starred review."}
{"text":"Fresh food, great taste, decent price. Great made to order sandwiches, salads and soups. Love the pick two option. Really good desserts too. Every meal comes with fresh, soft bread and a chocolate dipped strawberry. The only place I leave feeling \"just right\" after a meal. This location had an awesome charging center with free WiFi also, can't go wrong with that!"}
{"text":"Super tasty. I recommend the turkey bacon avocado sandwich. Comes with a baguette roll and chocolate dipped strawberry?"}
{"text":"Zupas is SO delicious. Their sandwiches & salads are unique & delectable. My favorite part is the drink station with multiple sodas and syrups to make your own fancy drinks at no extra cost besides the cup. The restaurant is clean and service is quick & friendly. We love, love, love this place!"}
{"text":"Let me start this by saying that I really love Cafe Zupas food. They have a very good selection and their food always tests fresh. This review is not a reflection of their food, it is a reflection of their service. I would also like to add that I can be a little high maintenance with food (remove this, add that) but I have always understood that I may be charged extra for this. I have never minded paying extra because I like my food the way I like it. So if you're like me and like to customize your order a little, don't bother with this location. 

When I'm in the mood for a sandwich I always get the turkey bacon club. I always order it the same way; remove tomatoes and add three cheese artichoke spread. When I asked the attendant for this she told me that they couldn't do that because they only add bacon or avocados to sandwiches. I informed her that I get the sandwich this way every time I order this and have never had a problem before at this location or any location. She seemed very surprised by this and said that they still wouldn't allow me to add the spread. I also informed her that if they needed to charge me extra for the artichoke spread, I didn't mind. She told me that per management she couldn't do that. I asked to speak to the  manager and when I did, I requested he charge me for the spread so I can have my sandwich the way I'd like. They were not willing to put the spread on the sandwich. The attendant and the manager were not rude to me when we were discussing this but I'm still very unhappy with this situation. I don't understand why any management team would not charge for the extra item and add it in. It's not as though they're losing money. It is very dissatisfying for the customer. After thanking them for their time, I left without purchasing anything."}
{"text":"Never tried this place! And let me tell you idk why, everything is fresh and the portions are awsome!"}
{"text":"The food tastes good, but I am trying to eat healthy and I found the protein to be skimpy and there is only white carbs to choose from."}
{"text":"This is a must try! So many different sandwiches, salads, and soups that are all fantastic! Oven ever been more happy with customer service in my life. And the process of which u order and receive ur delicious food is easy and very efficient. Stop in and give this place try! Every sandwich, salad, be soup come with a chocolate dip strawberry and a French baguette. Now who could say no to that!"}
{"text":"Good for a really quick bite to eat. The chocolate dipped strawberry is cute.  The noise level makes it so you don't want to linger   Clean. In the winter months I suggest eating outside"}
{"text":"Ate lunch there today and had the two combo with lobster bisque and nuts about berries salad. Both food items were delicious! Love that they provided a roll and chocolate covered strawberry. Here's my only complaint...when I was asked if I wanted croutons on my soup I never imagined there would be an additional charge. Didn't check my bill until I got home. Charge of 69 cents for three croutons. Unreasonable."}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE this place. Sandwiches are amazing and plenty soups and salads for everyone. Could get busy around lunch time but well worth the wait. Vegetarian sandwich is worth every penny. Soups are always amazing. I visit as much as I possibly can."}
{"text":"First timer! We went during lunch and it was super busy but even though the line was really long it went by pretty fast. Once we got to the front of the line we were greeted by an energetic, friendly man who explained how things worked and took our salad and sandwich order.  If you haven't been here before its very similar to paradise bakery. You order your salad and/or sandwhich first then move down the line to the soups. The service itself was fast and friendly. At the end all your food is on the tray and you are met with these delicous looking home made brulees. OMG! Its hard to resist.

We tried the California chicken sandwich, lobster bisque , turkey avocado sandwhich and Maui tropical salad. 

Loved the salad...so refreshing and delicious. 5 

The lobster bisque was a little of a disappointment. I was expecting a creamy, lobster pieced filled soup like I have had at other restaurants. This one was more like mass produced, a bit watery based, no lobster soup. I get it that they probably go through gallons of this soup and they can't have people chopping up fresh lobster in the back so maybe u expectations were a little too high. 

I'll go back to try the rest of the food..there are tons of choices."}
{"text":"This is a great place to get some healthy options. The service was fast and the food was delicious. I would choose this over Panera any day. I will probably frequent this place more often! Today, I ordered the Thai peanut coconut protein bowl. So flavorful and around 24 grams of protein. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I've always gotten the mango berry salad, but I've tried a couple sandwiches. All are totally delicous, hot, and fresh. You can taste every ingredient, and how fresh it really is. 

The only reason I'm giving this place four stars is because the ordering process is kind of a hassle and takes a while. There are like 6 people asking you what you ordered and what soup and salad and sandwich you want and then you have to repeat what you got again to the person at the cash register. 

Other than that, everyone here is always super happy and nice and the food is delish."}
{"text":"My husband and I went for the first time. We were greeted by a very pleasant young lady and she offered to answer any questions we may have. The ingredients used are fresh and taste really good. You can choose from their menu or build your own salad. 

I chose one of their new protein bowls and my husband had sandwich. We highly recommend Cafe Zupas and plan on returning."}
{"text":"Stopped in last night with my daughter and was pleasantly surprised how good their salads are. My daughter also fell in  love with their soup. Fresh ingredients and awesome deserts make this a must to try spot."}
{"text":"Finally made our way in to try this place. We wanted something quick, casual and I was craving soup and sandwich. We ordered the New England crab sandwich & chicken chili combo & cherry chicken salad with lobster bisque. Didn't really hit the spot the food is mediocre it wasn't great it wasn't bad just... Mehhh. Yes I'll probably be back again I wouldn't crave this place but I do like their infused waters. Besides that nothing else really impressed me here."}
{"text":"For the price and the quality-- pretty good.

Great variety of panini's, salads, soups and all  yummy :)

Try the 2 combo!"}
{"text":"I decided to try this place during lunch and even though it was busy, the line seemed to move quickly. I had the Mexican pulled pork salad and it was delicious. The salad came with a dinner roll and a chocolate covered strawberry. My only complaint would be that I wish the salad had more vegetables and greens and less pulled pork but at least I know how to order it next time. I really liked the in house drink selection. I had the coconut water pomegranate green tea infusion and it was great! The restaurant was clean, staff friendly, prices good and food awesome!"}
{"text":"Fast, terrific choices, yummy food.  What's not to like.  Stopped in one day in a rush on my way to Wolverine at the megaplex next day.  Wife said she loves it but I wasn't expecting much.  Color me surprised!  Salads, sandwiches, soups, deserts.  Everything looks great and everything I tried was terrific."}
{"text":"House put together, not House made... I was looking for something quick and healthier as we were hitting the road. The website made this appear to be perfect place! Very disappointed. They don't \"prepare\" everything in the kitchen. If they did, they would have a piece of lettuce available for a lettuce wrap. I have an allergy to yeast. So I asked for a tortilla, I was told they don't have those either. They said they only have one kind of bread for my moms sandwich, ciabatta. Frustrated, I moved along. Their salads looked great but eating on the road makes soup and salad a difficult choice. I then decided to at least get a water. Their ice bucket with an inch of melted ice wasn't keeping anything cold. So I asked for a cold water from the fridge behind the check out. The cashier rolled her eyes at me. I paid for the water and had to reach to the back of the counter to get it, it was not even slid to the middle of the counter before the cashier walked away. It was room temperature. That would've been nice to tell me that your \"fridge \" was simply storage. My moms sandwich? Sad. Tons of dressing, thinly sliced meat-2 microscopic slices, and a thin piece of cheese. That was all ciabatta!The only thing I can say positive, my moms sandwich came with a chocolate covered strawberry. That gets them 1 star."}
{"text":"Best salad ever! Huge fan of Cafe Zupas. Fresh ingredients, delicious meal, lots of healthy choices. Plus you get a chocolate covered strawberry! Yummy!"}
{"text":"Love the new California power protein salad, just the right ingredients and tons of flavors!!!  I will definitely be back again for this."}
{"text":"Ipod station? So I guess this place was built circa 2004 maybe? Regardless, my first Zupas experience was a great one and I hope they make their way east soon.

So Zupas is extremely reminiscent of Panera, but with many more options. We had the option of about a dozen different salads, a dozen different soups, and a dozen different sandwiches. My coworkers and I each went with a pick two combo. I got a Maui tropical chicken salad and red pepper/lobster soup for my choices.

The salad was bright, a little sweet, and made me question why I haven't seen pineapple vinaigrette on store shelves yet. And soup with actual chunks of lobster in it? Simply amazing. And even though you usually get smaller portions of each item when you do these kind of combos, I really couldn't tell I was getting half portions. My co-workers each got what looked like full sandwiches. A simple mistake or is that how Zupas rolls?

Either way, Zupas makes for a surprisingly good lunch spot that I wouldn't mind frequenting if it existed here in the arctic of Chicago."}
{"text":"I ordered a salad, very good but the portion  size was way to small,  Left hungry and unsatisfied."}
{"text":"First time here. Great food, friendly place. High quality, great price. Has a recharge bar."}
{"text":"I'm not clear why this place boasts \"you can experience the best food the whole world has to offer\".  The free chocolate covered strawberry was a nice touch but didn't make this the best restaurant.  It wasn't BAD...it just wasn't that good."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with my first time here.  I ordered a large BBQ chicken salad with no onions to go. What I got was a lot of lettuce with barely any of the other ingredients, but there were plenty of.. ONIONS! Also, it says on the menu that it comes with buttermilk ranch, but not mine apparently. I really wanted a new salad spot, guess I'll have to keep looking. 

Updated review: Glad I gave them another chance, I had one bad experience for the first time but have been a couple times since and they got it right"}
{"text":"I heard great things about Zupas from my coworkers but my expectations were not even close to being met. The atmosphere was quite poor; the line was long and between the 5 people on the assembly line they lost/confused my order three times. Tomato soup was good but the  grilled cheese was flat and tasteless (it looks much better in the pictures online and on the menu). If I had to pick a soup and salad place I would pick Jason's Deli over Zupas any day. Wont be returning or recommending. :("}
{"text":"First thing... The entrance is inconvenient. Walk in the door and you have to maneuver around all the tables to get the the counter to order.  Perhaps the side door would be best but I did not check if that was open.  

Food came out great.  A good price for a meal that is so filling.  Combo soup and sandwich comes with bread and chocolate covered strawberry.  

My first time to try the pomegranate green tea.  It was so lovely!  Lightly fruity and just enough honey for a refreshing yet slightly sweet iced tea! Haven't had it elsewhere. It could be something that would keep me coming back."}
{"text":"Craving some soup on a cold day.   Such a great price, and so much food.  You can sample the soups if you are indecisive. It's really hard to choose.  The sandwich and soup meal comes with bread and a chocolate covered strawberry!   Really hit the spot.  Got the vegetable soup just because it's heavier, and I was hungry.  Grilled cheese was delicious.  A little over board on the pesto aioli, however I can ask for less next time. I thought I might take out the tomatoes but it was perfect as is.  

Super clean spot.  The center bar seating is perfect if you want to use your laptop or need some extra juice on your phone.  Plenty of power outlets complete with USB ports.  

I wondered why I haven't eaten here before."}
{"text":"The perfect dinner.  The chicken salad was fresh and the champagne vinaigrette dressing was perfect.  The mushroom bisque was good but bland. Overall a great dinner."}
{"text":"It's always a happy day after I eat here. The mango berry salad is one of my favorite item. The restaurant is clean and with an open kitchen you can see everything they put into your salad."}
{"text":"Good soups, hot sandwiches and salads. Can't go wrong for a lite lunch here."}
{"text":"An excellent side salad, bread, sandwich, and a chocolate covered strawberry for under $10."}
{"text":"We enjoyed the meal here. We got Californian Protein Cobb and lobster bisque, so yummyyyyy! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Tasty salads and sandwiches.  I prefer Zupas over Paradise Bakery.  We often order for our office meetings because there is a nice selection to choose from, the portions are sized right and we feel like we are making somewhat healthy choices."}
{"text":"The food is good at a reasonable price and you are normally at your table eating within a few minutes of walking in. Greater variety and much better food  for a similar price that you would pay for greasy burger and fries at any of the take out joints."}
{"text":"I'm not the kind of person that utters the words \"favorite fast food chain.\" That being said, Cafe Zupa delivers. I tried the Salinas Valley Chicken Protein Bowl and it was delicious, healthy and fresh. Also fast, and comes with a complementary chocolate covered strawberry for dessert. They also feature fruit drinks with raw honey, a hot sauce spice rack, non-disposable dishes if you eat in, free charging stations and wifi. The wifi at this location was down when I was here, but I'm still giving it 5 stars because you really come here for the quick, quality eats."}
{"text":"Where do I start. Maybe I should write this review from the perspective of a probable management decision making process. 

\"Gentleman, Ladies, I'd like to propose some exciting changes for our customers when they enter Cafe Zupas. Please turn to page 739 of your agenda and follow along.
- let's make our dining experience slightly offsetting with the ambient temperature 5 degrees cooler than it should be, regardless of the season. 
- how about giving all acoustic treatments a back seat to permeate a constant drumming of noise, like a cheap bar at happy hour. Except sans Happy. 
- what about all of our staff armed with little vocal cues that sound artificial and canned 'welcome to cafe Zupas, would you like to try our Wisconsin cauliflower soup?'
- we've noticed that treating people with high pitched voices is the wave of the future. What about training all our staff with super robotic high pitch questions and statements that pierce the surrounding ruckus?
- how about confusing the customer with a constant passing of help behind the salad bar, 'John will like help you make a salad, but Jessica makes the sandwiches, and Paula will take care of your soup. But if you don't want salad than my friend Gary over there will be positively happy to assist you in your sandwich selection!' :):):)xoxo
- treat everyone like they're on a 3rd grade field trip. 
- have the cashier require the customer to regurgitate again what they ordered, commanding further confusion and holding up the line. 
- make sure the sandwiches taste like white bread. The white bread taste needs to come through over all else. 
- insist on the soups being served in thin plastic bowls that have a 0.8 on the insulation meter. 
- have soups waiting in said thin plastic bowls for over 5 mins while the customer waits in line behind regurgitated orders, or while white bread sandwich is made. 
- salads, no change. Excepts serve toppings with 1/2 teaspoon serving spoons. Try and make the customer feel as special as possible with the pinch of strawberry flakes, 5 sesame seeds, three crushed pecans and two onion strings. Give the customer a disapproving look if they ask for a generous portion of anything. Look to manager immediately if any request is outside the 1/2 tsp mark. 
- utilize the lowest grade chocolate on earth on strawberries and deserts. Go for a rubber or plastic texture. It should be similar to a child's squeeze toy, really. \"


(Ok I'll stop. But seriously, I only go here because the taste of the soups are insanely good. Not hot, mind you, but very good. If they ever figure out how to save a buck and destroy this one asset I will literally call for a wrecking ball.)"}
{"text":"This was my first time here.  The staff was very friendly and the service was excellent.  I ordered the Turkey Bacon Avocado Panini. It was really good. Love that every sandwich comes with a chocolate covered strawberry. The ice tea was also fresh. Will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner the other day. Just like the other Cafe Zupas I have been too this one was just as good. The staff was friendly and the food yummy. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious, place is nice and spacious. The only reason I didn't give it five stars, is that they do not have Wi-Fi"}
{"text":"We were nervous about this place, as our favorite soup place is across the street but they were closed. My wife and I wanted soup. So I ended up getting a soup and salad combo, and my wife got a soup that completely met her taste desires and dietary needs. The food was delicious. We could see through the counter, what they were making, how they were handling the food, the containers it was kept in. It was like daylight in there, the natural light bulbs, are definitely a plus in Wisconsin during the Winter time. The only issue was that they didn't have their publicized pumpkin spice cheesecake, and oh boy do I love cheesecake!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy coming to this place for lunch.  It has so many great options.  I love the sandwich and salad combo deals during the summer and during the winter the soup and sandwich one.  I love the chicken chili and the chicken pesto sandwich.  For the salads, any of the ones with fruit are really good and they are very good at customizing the amount of dressing you want or even leaving the dressing off.  All of your meals come with a chocolate covered strawberry as a treat, sweet!  Once in a while the soup is a little too salty for my taste, but I still come at least once a month.  The place gets pretty busy at noon, but if you go a little later there is plenty of tables to choose from.   Another thing that really surprised me was that they do not accept tips."}
{"text":"Food is so good here! Pesto chicken sandwich and Maui chicken salad. It isn't just that it's good food, its the careful balance of flavors, and the tiny details, like a bun that doesnt get soggy even if you take it home for  leftovers, the perfect bits of mango and the tiny pieces of pepper in the salad which sets off the sweetness of the amazing dressing perfectly. 
Let's not forget the choice of bread and the chocolate-covered strawberry, either. Its a gastronomic delight for under $10, and bound to be a place where I return again and again."}
{"text":"This place was amazing great food and really friendly helpful employees, many options and delicious soup...."}
{"text":"This place is horrible if you need to eat gluten free.  They told me at least 5 times that theirs is an 'open kitchen' and there is risk of contamination (they are set up like paradise bakery in that they make the salad in front of you using crocks of the various items).  But they could not tell me if there was gluten in any of their dressings.  They have no gluten free menu.  Anyone who eats gluten free knows they are taking a risk eating at this type of place and does not need to be told.  The staff even told me it is not their fault if I get sick. 

I got the summer salad with the dressing on the side - the salad was good and I did not get sick from gluten.  The small salad is not really enough food for a meal.  The kids meals are $4 and include an option of two items from the following - baked chicken tenders, grilled cheese sandwich, fruit cup, and soup.  They come with a drink (from the soda fountain) and a choice of bread or chocolate covered strawberry.  The kids seemed to like their meals.

I will not be going here again until they have a gluten free menu."}
{"text":"We heard about this place from a fellow yelp fan. From the time we walked in the door and were greeted with a friendly smile and offered to have recommendations made to us we were impressed! Also my wife loved that there are signs telling you step by step how to order. For $7.99 you get a great value I had the Italian club it was Great! And a bowl of New England Clam chowder which was awesome! All this for $7.99!!! Oh! Wait! I forgot to say you also get a piece of yummy bread to wipe the soup bowl clean and a chocolate covered strawberry for desert! My wife had the Wisconsin cauliflower cheddar soup and the Asian chicken sandwich I truly believed she was going to lick the bowl clean she enjoyed the soup that much lol . We walked out of there truly happy and full! We can't wait to go back and will tell all of our friends and family about this place!"}
{"text":"I came in here out of curiosity and now I can say that this is one of my favorite eating spots! I love everything about this place. The employees are always generous & helpful. I love how they have a wide selection of choices for sandwiches, soups, & salads. I always come here for the combo deal. Truthfully, I probably wouldn't pay the a la carte prices for the food, so the combo deal is the way to go. The desserts are awesome! The mixed berry creme brûlée is my favorite. Also, there are syrups by the drinks area & suggestions on how to make a customized drink. To top it off, the meals come with a small chunk of bread & a chocolate strawberry."}
{"text":"The staff rushed  us to place the order. It seemed that the only thing in their mind was the speed  instead of the quality of service (very cold, not helpful at all.) Food was good but the staff was awful except  the  cashier she was  kind and smiley!"}
{"text":"This WONDERFUL addition to Mesa's DANA PARK shopping center has DELICIOUS food! I highly recommend their SOUP & Sandwich combo...very reasonably priced...
with NE Clam Chowder that is TO DIE FOR!!
It will keep me coming back over & over again!
Not to mention they include fresh bread and a chocolate-dipped strawberry! YUM!!

So far, we've tried the Chicken Pesto Sandwich, BBQ Pulled Pork & the Italian Club.
And...I must say...they were ALL DELICIOUS & fresh-made right in front of you at their express counter. Their salads are also very good..chipotle (Mexican style) ...and Berry Salad blends...I really can't wait to go back & try some MORE!
For those that LOVE being outdoors..
They also have a small outdoor patio area that's GREAT this time of year.
All around great place right at the corner of Val Vista & Baseline Rd. in Mesa."}
{"text":"I really want to like them.   Their kale and quinoa salad has amazing flavor, but I swear their portions get smaller every time I go.   The dreaded shaking of the scooper left me with literally 4 blueberries and 5 grapes on my LARGE salad.   They also refuse to give nutritional information claiming their food is \"too freshly made\".  Umm Subway? Chipotle?  Pretty much every other restaurant seems to find a way to manage at least some ranges.  For a place claiming to be healthy it throws up some serious red flags.  Not suprising though considering how poorly their food service line runs.   They don't write anything down so you get asked at least 5 times what you had.   All things considered it is a decent place to eat if you are OK with small portions and a little incompetence."}
{"text":"My friend and I went to Zupas for the first time today.   The salad was great, the sandwiches was good, and the soup was rather cold.  They do have any discounts for Veterans.  I was told the company is very stingy with discounts of any kind...I thought it was a bit over price for cold lobster bisque.  Really not worth $12.10. the place was clean and busy but no Veteran's discounts what they aren't Americans.. .They don't love this great Country and our Military men and women who protect and keep them safe everyday?  Our Military provides freedom for companies to open places like Zupas.  Don't think I will go back...."}
{"text":"Been here a few times now and have always had the same great experience. They have sandwiches, salads, soups, and desserts a la carte or you can opt for a combo which includes 2 of the following: whole sandwich, half soup, or half salad. I typically opt for a combo with a sandwich and salad, but it's always hard for me to decide because there's quite a laundry list of options. I've tried getting something different each time and so far my favorite salad is the BBQ chicken and all the sandwiches I've had are so good I wouldn't be able to choose a favorite...the turkey bacon avocado or ham bacon club are pretty tasty though.

No matter what you order every meal includes a chocolate dipped strawberry and slice of french bread on the side. They also have desserts including the chocolate dipped strawberries for sale a la carte. Service here is wonderful and we are always greeted before getting into line. The greeter will usually offer you a paper menu but you could always just look up at the menu board if you're close enough in line. Even when it gets packed here there seems to be plenty of seating. I will definitely be back again and again in the future..seems to be a favorite spot at the office and there is always a group coming here it seems like!"}
{"text":"After catching a cold this past week, I was craving some soup. I asked my wife if we could go to Cafe Zupas. We had the following:

Yucatan Chicken Tortilla Soup and Honey Cilantro Carnitas Combo $8.99

Garden Chowder and California Turkey Combo $8.99

Creme Brûlée $3.49

The best tasting dish was the garden chowder. It was rich but not too rich and the salt level was just right. The Chicken tortilla soup on the other hand was very salty. I'm guessing it was bc a lot of people ordered it and the employee just happened to scoop all the bottom bits of the soup container when he served my portion. The sandwiches were good too. I give this place 4 stars bc of how clean the area was and that they offered 1/2 priced desserts toward the end of the day."}
{"text":"I've been to Cafe Zupas a couple of times.  Living in Mesa (also known as South Utah), Zupas gets all kinds of hype - there was a ton of excitement about this place opening.

So I went.

So, does this place live up to hype?  Absolutely not.  The only thing I can say about why it is so popular around here, is, \"it must be a Utah thing.\"  It's part of their cultural identity... But their cultural identity is play-it-safe, don't-do-anything-too-different, and bland.

The food here is fine.  The soup is fine.  The sandwiches are a little mediocre.  The drink bar is fine.  But the soup is not to die for.  The drink bar is not to die for.  The whole place is an exercise in being slightly better than average.  Zupas is to Subway what In-N-Out Burger is to McDonald's.

I don't even remember which sandwiches and soups I've tried.  I know I've had a mushroom-based soup that was decent...  They just weren't that memorable."}
{"text":"I dodged a bullet and fell in love.  Ok, maybe extreme like is more appropriate.  The bullet was in the form of probably a 2000 calorie dinner comprised of chicken fried chicken (yes, that's what I said) and all the caloric sidekicks that some with said CFC (gravy, butter, rolls, rum and coke, et al).  And since I'm still fighting the five pounds' l found during the holidays, this was indeed a meal I don't need right now.  I'll let you know when I do have it.

The aforementioned dodging was at the new Texas Roadhouse at Norterra.  We parked, walked to the front door and could barely make it inside to get our names in.  We decided a raincheck was in order as the wait was nearly an hour (good problem for a new business to have).  

We looked to the east and knew our future likely included fast food along the likes of Smashburger or Chipotle since Mellow Mushroom is usually busting at the seams also. Our walk took us along the store front of Zupa's and it had a nice causal vibe coming from it, almost like the 4B's cafeteria in Missoula back in the 70's.  The P and I have been mourning the loss of the true Phoenix institution, Paradise Bakery and the menu looked similar, so with a shrug and a willing spirit we decided to try it.

The layout and menu is very similar to Paradise, especially if you miss the half and half (soup/salad/sandwich) this is a great fix for what ails ya, only in my mind, a little better.  

I had the 2/$8.99 option.  Tried the Cuban panini and the limited-edition gumbo.  Absolutely blown away by how good both were. This isn't a half of sandwich either, it's the whole one and generously loaded with ham, pork, cheese, and a great sauce. I really enjoyed it.

The P had the clam chowder and a salad-couldn't finish the meal there was so much food.  Both meals came with a roll and a delicious chocolate covered strawberry.  Since they gave me a roll, I had to have butter so I strolled up to the beverage/utensil area and sure enough, there was real butter on ice for me, nice!  And since I was having gumbo, I needed to make sure it was hot enough, they have that covered with the Spice Center, great selection of assorted hot sauces-nice touch!

The service was excellent! We had a very pleasant young lady come by a couple of times to make sure we were in good shape (wish she would have had a name badge on so I could give her a shout-out).

If it's just you and your smartphone, grab a meal and plant yourself at the Recharge Bar-see photo.

I would have liked to see the floor and booths a little cleaner, it wasn't horrible but a little love was needed.  I'll definitely be back and will also hit the one at Desert Ridge which is close to work.  Well done!

3.75 stars"}
{"text":"What a surprise this place was.  Fresh salads is what goes on in here.  Great customer service as well.  I'm trying to watch my diet so I will put this place in my lineup for healthy living."}
{"text":"First time here today, ordered the turkey bacon avocado panini and the red pepper Asiago Caesar salad combo. Loved the salad, wasn't a fan of the sandwich, primarily because of the turkey. It reminded me of that smoked cheap deli turkey you get in the small package at Walmart (buddig) or something is the name? I will definitely be back for a full size salad and to try their soups. Also, the salad came with a piece of French bread and every meal gets you a chocolate dipped strawberry apparently. They have an Italian soda station that is included with your beverage purchase. 3 different kinds if cake like brownines/bars and their chocolate hazelnut creme brûlée looks tasty too. It was clean, service was quick and props to the lady clearing tables! She did a fantastic job turning them over and handling customers' trays at the garbage can after!"}
{"text":"YUM YUM YUM! 

I happen to have a sweet spot for salads that have fruit in them and Cafe Zupas offers me the motherload of choices to quench my fruit tooth. 

Their lobsterbisque is so much better than I was expecting it to be. I was happily surprised."}
{"text":"So apparently 9 out of the 9 employees working today were new? They all were standing around with a confused look on their face. California Turkey was nothing special."}
{"text":"Interesting place! The cell phone charging station is cool. The food was good and the staff was really nice and funny. I'm a sucker for smiles and cheeriness! Will definitely come back to try other menu items!!"}
{"text":"This place has seen better days. It used to be very good and the quality has just gone downhill. They have removed some of the better menu items as well, such a shame."}
{"text":"This is my least favorite location. Food is always good. Service at this location is meh they could do much better."}
{"text":"Salad fan. Tummy tells me they do not spray preservatives on the lettuce.yay!!! Soup yum. The only fast food I eat is Cafe Zupa."}
{"text":"Yu-ummmmm!!!!! :)
OMG! So my kid won a gift card to here about a year ago, and the name made it sound unappealing, we finally decided to use it.  We were bummed that the gift card had expired,  but were so impressed with the quality and taste of the food. 
The cauliflower soup is OUTSTANDING!! A must."}
{"text":"Thai Peanut Chicken sandwich was really good. Give it a try.........................................."}
{"text":"Just came in with a large order to go. The staff did an amazing job together to stay organized and getting the order completed quickly!!! It was done in less than 5 minutes. Very impressed!"}
{"text":"Went in search of Soup and found this place. We loved it. Wish we had one back in Indy! We actually ate here 2 days in a row it was so good."}
{"text":"Solid salad and soup lunch spot.  Fast service and welcoming staff.  We ordered our lunch and we got chocolate covered strawberries!  Nice bonus.  The protein Cobb was great and fresh.  I asked for light dressing and that was just right.  I can't imagine the regular dressing amount.  I also got the turkey artichoke panini and it was tasty and fresh.  Overall solid.  I personally like the open bright concept compared to Panera."}
{"text":"I only go here when forced to because my co-workers want it for lunch.  I do not understand how a place like this can be in business.  Their soups are bland, and they charge 70 cents per basic topping, such as cheese or croutons.  Their grilled cheese sandwich is a joke, tiny and tastes like garbage with the tiny bit of cheese being overpowered by what was supposed to be pesto but would be better described as liquidy mayonnaise.  The complimentary bread they gave out today was cold, like it just came out of the freezer."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is similar to Panera.  I got the mushroom soup and it was delicious.  We went two days in a row and both days I got the mushroom soup.  I didn't really see anything else on the menu that peaked my interest.  They didn't have a basic romaine salad for those of us low class salad eaters.  My husband ordered only a salad and they didn't ask him if he wanted a half or a whole and so he ended up with half a salad, not quite enough to fill him up.  My son ordered the clam chowder, my son said it wasn't bad, I tried a spoonful and personally thought it shouldn't even be called New England Clam Chowder.  I'm from New England so I'm a little biased but the taste and consistency was entirely wrong.  They give you the tiniest piece of bread to go with your soup, ummm the whole enjoyment of soup and bread is sopping up the soup with the bread and you don't have enough bread to sop up the soup.  The flavored syrup is a nice touch though.  Oh, they also don't seem to keep on top of there supplies as both times they didn't have an actual bowl to eat out of, part of the enjoyment of eating in and my husband had to rummage under the counter looking for a lid for his soda because there weren't out."}
{"text":"Loved this place, hit the spot. It was fast and fresh with a good variety. I got the try 2 combo with the full pesto chicken sandwich and lobster bisque. It was plenty of food, I couldn't finish it all. I love the crab avocado melt as well with the California Cobb salad."}
{"text":"The food was good. I am not giving it 5 stars because the reason I came here was to have a sandwich while catching up at work, but there's no longer wifi available... So there's that :/"}
{"text":"Really nice place for soup/salads/sandwiches.  Give you a chocolate dipped strawberry for dessert on the house. I had the pesto chicken sandwich and clam chowder and both were delicious.  Friendly staff, clean, and bright."}
{"text":"I love to eat here when I'm looking for something light, their sandwiches are pretty small but very filling! And their drinks are refreshing I love the pomegranate green tea"}
{"text":"So happy when this location opened. The food is yummy however overpriced for what you get. I gave this only 2-stars mainly because of their lack of customer service. I've been here multiple times on the weekdays and the young ladies specifically at the end of the line and register have been so incredibly rude. I've heard them gossip, ignore customers, sigh really loud, roll their eyes. I don't understand why you work somewhere you clearly don't want to be?????"}
{"text":"I've had a love affair with cafe zupas since this location opened in Vegas. The soups are DIVINE, food is always fresh and their employees have consistently been fantastic. I do usually sample the soup before I get it - because some of them have been too salty a couple of times. But seriously - everything they have here is delicious. Also who doesn't like a chocolate covered strawberry to finish off your meal?"}
{"text":"Food is awesome- but, there concept and check out process was horrible-!!! I orders a bowl of soup and panni. By the time i could pay my steamy hot food was just barely warm. You all need to get it together...."}
{"text":"Super good. The strawberry salad and lobster bisque was delicious. Defiantly coming back"}
{"text":"I don't know which came first this or Panera, but they remind me of each other. In my opinion this place wins, though.

When I went I had the crab avocado melt, nuts about berries salad, and of course a chocolate covered strawberry.

Sandwich was SO good. Something about crab. Something about avocado. Something about the two of them combined! Lol. Cafe Zupas got it right. 

The salad. Omg. My favorite salad to date. Fruit, veggies, and nuts... What else do you need ?! It seems quite simple so I tried making it myself. I think they got it down better than me though. It's okay I'm okay with trading money for this beautiful creation(:

And who doesn't like chocolate covered strawberries? Nothing special about them, but they are good!

Thinking back, Paneras little side bread does taste a whole lot better than their side bread that comes with their combos. I won't knock a star though because everything else is on pointy point!"}
{"text":"Great new place! At first didn't want to come because I thought it was just Panera look alike but it's much better. The food is delish. Even the drinks have better options. And the employees are great as well."}
{"text":"I freaking love Zupas! I will admit... Every time I look at my sandwich, salad, or soup, I think to myself \"This is not going to get me full.\" And I end up almost too full! The portions look small but they are packed full of goodness. My favorite 2 things to get is the Wild Mushroom Bisque and the Cuban Grilled Pork. The Cuban is almost a must in my book. Tender Pork topped with ham, tangy bread and butter pickles, sweet red peppers, melty muenster cheese, and the delish house-made citrus dijon spread. It never disappoints! I have had 1/2 of their menu from a few of their salads, soups, and different sandwiches. I have yet to be disappointed by anything I have tried. Everything is always fresh.

Zupas functions a lot like Paradise Bakery in the manner that you walk in, get in line, order as you walk down the line and then pay at the end of the line kind of like a cafeteria. Everyone gets a chocolate covered strawberry with their meal, I love that. After that you pick your seat, grab your drink, grub and go! Its really perfect for those hour lunch breaks at work. 

All I know is that I love this place way better than anything else like it out there (i.e. Paradise Bakery, Kneaders, Jason's Deli, ect...) I'm so happy they have started to open up all over the Valley."}
{"text":"This cheerful cafe is well-organized & tasteful, not only in the food but the decor as well! My son & I arrived at the end of the day (8:45pm) & the staff was friendly & so easygoing that I had no idea they closed in 15 minutes!! They asked if we would like to try samples of any of their array of items. I tried the crab salad which was fresh & light with just the right amount of flavor. I tried their lobster bisque as well & found it loaded with chunks of succulent lobster & alive with flavor that finished with just the right amount of heat!! For what I had always assumed was just a simple \"soup & salad shop\", I was pleasantly surprised by the fresh, vibrant array of ingredients; they had everything from quinoa to pistachios & from leafy kale to bright red tomatoes. Your salad options are limited only by your own imagination & your taste buds!! The paninis were crunchy & delicious & did I mention that a complimentary chocolate covered strawberry completes your meal?!? It was delicious!! They also have a mouthwatering display of decadent desserts to delight your palate & soothe even your most demanding chocolate craving! We will DEFINITELY be back for more!!! Thanks for a new & delightful dining experience!!!"}
{"text":"I just tried Cafe Zupas for the first time and it was delicious. The prices were great too - you can get a full sandwich and a cup of soup for less than 10 bucks. The meal was also served with bread and a delicious chocolate-dipped strawberry. This place has definitely replaced Panera as my go-to spot for a healthy lunch. They had so many different varieties and options, it's great."}
{"text":"this is my new favorite place in my list of yelp bookmarks i had a pesto chicken sandwich salad an tomato soup it was super good i will be returning faithfully"}
{"text":"Let's start with the outstanding. Cafe Zupas soups are REALLY, really good - Wisconsin Cauliflower, Mushroom Bisque, Chicken Tortilla, Garden Chowder - they will keep you coming back. Craving a quick soup in the hot Vegas desert? - This is where you go, way better than Whole Foods, etc..

But - whatever you do, never, ever order anything else..

The prepared 'salads' are an embarrassment to seeds and soil. Your 'tropical salad' will be  canned pineapple, canned corn and tinny-tasting mandarin sections over papery shredded romaine. The dressings taste like cleaning products. The avocado 'protein substitute' (for salad chicken) is a marble-sized dollop of tasteless green mush. The sandwiches are even worse. Imagine the nastiest, solution-injected fast-food chicken cutlet you've ever seen. Well you'll beg for one when you taste the spongy pulp they're serving at Zupas. The bread is awful too, how can bread be an afterthought at a soup restaurant? Has anyone here ever actually eaten any of this 'food'?

But again, the soups are divine. Inner turmoil!

A note on service - walking into a Zupas is like getting subbed into a high school girls' indoor volleyball game. You're screeched at from the moment you enter, by well meaning but irritating girls who look at you from behind Stockholm Syndrome eyes that cry out - 'sorry but they're making me do this'... 

\"Hello welcome to Zupas is this your first time with us! Can I help you to understand our menu today! Well then what can I get for ya! So no salad, just soup then! Would you like to add bacon, cheddar or fried onions to that! No other add-ons then! And just the one soup! Would you like to add dessert or any beverages! (slide down the line, new girls...) OK, so what did you order! Which soup was yours! And was that all for you today! Would you like to try any of our desserts!!

Somewhere the corporate bloodticks who are drilling these poor girls on upselling is probably pleased with the environment they've created. Me? I'm buying noise-canceling headphones and a neck sign for my next visit that reads:

'Lost my hearing in a Cafe Zupas takeout line last month. Please prepare for me a large cauliflower soup to go. No, nothing else. Yes, I'm quite sure. Thank you'."}
{"text":"I have been here twice & have had consistently good food. I love the make your own salad option & there are a lot of options for vegans. They had all the traditional stuff plus fruits & nuts. For protein they had quinoa, avocado & tofu amongst other things. 

Everything comes with a chocolate covered strawberry & a piece of soft yummy bread roll.

My only complaint is that each topping is very skimpy. You only get 5 toppings included in the price & i was hoping for more than 3 skinny apple slices to count as one of those 5!"}
{"text":"This Chain is great. The food is awesome, I like the chicken enchilada chili with sour cream. They even have a nice selection of sweets, the brownies always look amazing. It's one of my favorites Sandwich/Soup places to eat, it's much better than Panera in my opinion."}
{"text":"Had a really wonderful experience here today. The staff is really amazing. I had my hands full carrying my son so they brought my food to my table for me and brought over a high chair for me. A nice lady employee even noticed that I forgot to grab napkins so she brought some over for me. Then she proceeded to play with my son for the majority of our visit. Then, when I was finished, a nice young man cleaned my table for me. 

It just feels nice to feel welcome in places. So many people are so cold and unwelcoming these days, but not here. Not to mention that the food was very good, fresh and the portions are huge! I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"First time here and I can't believe I'm saying this... but I love this more than Panera Bread (and I'm a big fan)! the layout is so simple. First, you enter the line and you order sandwiches, paninis or a salad with the first person, you roll over to the next and you order your soups. They have an amazing array of soups & it was delicious! Then, there's the desserts last and then the cashier. The food is so simple and so quick. It comes out right away! I ordered a half (a panini and soup) and it was less than $10! At the end, they give you a chocolate covered strawberry and bread. Knowing me... I'm a sucker for chocolate covered anything and that just put the cherry to my sundae! I'm definitely coming back and trying their salad next time.

My order:
Turkey Spinach Artichoke panini- I love how quick it was made since I was rushing but I wish there was a little bit more artichoke!
Rate: 4/5

Lobster Bisque- mmm so creamy!!
Rate: 5/5

Chocolate covered strawberry & bread: complimentary with the meal!
Rate: 5/5

I can't wait to eat here again!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I come here quite a bit and we usually have a great experience. AND we usually feel as though Cafe Zupas, the Happy Valley location, is very clean and sanitary. Tonight, not so much. In fact, I'll never be back because of this. A few bites into my crab avocado melt and I had to pull a long blonde hair from my sandwich. It wasn't my hair either... I couldn't even stomach eating the other half, because God knows what was in that one! Another hair most likely. Needless to say, that is highly disgusting and this particular incident will be the reason I never return."}
{"text":"Fast service, great food, nice atmosphere. A no-nonsense place to pick up a good meal. This'll be my lunch hang for sure."}
{"text":"Amazingly friendly staff. There was a hearing impaired person in front of me and they were very accommodating and patient. All the soups I tried were amazing, definitely coming here again!"}
{"text":"I do not recommend. When I ordered my sandwich and asked for a couple substitions, the staff member told me, \"I better come only when they aren't busy if I'm going to have these requests.\" The food was average at best too so needless to say I haven't returned despite the fact I work a mile away."}
{"text":"Decent place! Friendly staff and tasty food. I had the pesto chicken sandwich and clam chowder. 60 cents extra for a small scoop of bacon bits and another 60 cents for a scoop of onion strings is a little much for what you're getting but I'm a baller so I didn't mind. 

For some reason my meal came with a chocolate dipped strawberry for dessert, which exactly what someone normally craves after a hearty clam chowder. The romantic aspect of this dessert was offset by the fact that I was dining with my mother. Everything was enjoyed nonetheless. Next time I'll bring a date and try that berry salad."}
{"text":"Love, love the food here!! Went in around dinner time and the line was wrapped three rows deep. The crew worked as quickly as possible and with good attitudes. It took about 15 minutes in line for me to get my food, but well worth the wait. With it being so busy, seating was extremely limited inside, but I was able to enjoy the weather outside while eating."}
{"text":"This is my 4th time here in four weeks. I try something new and everything I've tried have been winners! Plus they're really friendly."}
{"text":"This place was recommended to us by an employee at the Nordstrom Rack. It was said to be better than Panera. I really don't like Panera but I like salad so we gave it a try. I had the Cobb salad. It's ingredients are listed. I wanted to add onions. I was told it would be 70 cents. Are freakin serious? I could get a pound of onions for that price. I also ordered the Wisconsin Cauliflower soup which was a lot better than the salad. You so get a free chocolate covered strawberry with your order. Don't skip out on the water drinks. I had the green tea one which was amazing! I had to deduct a star because the cheese in the salad was weird and you shouldn't be charged to add a teaspoon of onions. Also it is a bit expensive for the serving sizes so I had to deduct another star."}
{"text":"I think I found my new favorite winter lunch place in town. AWESOME value for your money (I'm having the most flavorful lobster bisque I've ever had, for $6, and there's a LOT of it), the team is super friendly, and there's a free chocolate covered strawberry with my purchase. It's a little crowded during the lunch rush, so I don't recommend bringing a large group in, and I'm not sure whether they take reservations. But hearty and delicious soup for cheap is great for when I need a \"me\" moment."}
{"text":"Most Unfortunate! This was our first time in Zupas, we drive by all the time and they always seem busy but now we can't figure out why. The clean and modern decor mixed with the larger than life posters of their food and the word \"Perfect\" contrasted greatly with the actual food we ordered. I tried the Tuscan white bean soup and my wife tried the cauliflower. They were both so salty we couldn't make it through half the bowl, there was no garnish on either soup and little to no flavor. We split the ultimate cheese sandiwich - also underwhelming, salty and reasonably bland. The beverage selection was poor unless you like soda and the staff seemed oblivious to anyone or anything around them. The best part of the experience was only having to lose $12 on the ordeal and the highlight was leaving. 

We won't be back and suggest you stay away unless you're into poorly constructed, bad food for cheap."}
{"text":"I first discovered this place about a year and a half ago on the way back home, and ran in thinking it was a quick sub shop like firehouse or something.

Cafe Zupas is actually completely different, you start by picking a soup, salad, then sandwich if you want a combo. You can order the half sized soup or salad (4.39) depending on your appetite or a whole size. Usually a half will fill me up plenty (and I usually have a large appetite).

To do's: I would recommend the lobster bisque and tomato basil for the soup. Both are rich and creamy, and the tomato basil comes off with a slight sweet but good balanced taste. It also comes with 2 rolls, and for every item you get ie. A soup, a salad, or a sandwich; you get a free chocolate covered strawberry.

To don'ts: I would keep away from the clam chowder, although it isn't horrible, it has a strange cheesy flavor. Similar to parmesan, but it just comes off as a little awkward and rich tasting in a chowder; it just didn't belong.

Must try: the chicken pesto panini. The outer crust is a little hard and crisp, but the fillings taste great and the alfalfa sprouts in the panini don't over power any of the flavor.

Sure why not: the crab salad panini was mediocre, and had a little bit of a tuna melt taste to me. I wouldn't recommend it, but if you like that kind of rich flavor and soft texture, then I say go for it.

On days where I'm driving by, I'd recommend coming here for a quick lunch, it's definitely a good spot to just grab a bite on break from work."}
{"text":"I really like Zupas, the food is good and always fresh. The variety is remarkable and the service is quick and friendly. Try their wide variety of soups or a fresh salad with a sandwich made to order. Seating may be a lil tricky during busiest of times but usually it doesn't take long for something to open up."}
{"text":"My husband and I tried this new restaurant in Middleton (we had a 50% off coupon sent to us in the mail.) The line was long because, as it turned out, everyone in the restaurant had the same coupon! The line moved quickly though. I ordered the Lobster Bisque soup and the Chicken Chipotle salad. The salad was great. I've been looking for a good salad restaurant ever since Salad Creation closed. I didn't care for the Lobster Bisque and didn't finish it. I thought it was a little odd that even when you order a sandwich and soup/salad you get a white roll-that's a lot of bread and furthermore if this restaurant is supposed to be \"healthy\" why white bread? I haven't eaten white bread in years! Every meal comes with a chocolate dipped strawberry - a nice touch. The restaurant was bright and cheery, very clean and with contemporary decor. The acoustics were LOUD, so additional loud music not needed. My husband commented that he wasn't sure if the restaurant would survive once the 50% off coupons run out as the place doesn't serve burgers or pizza.  Don't confuse this restaurant with the restaurant across the street with a similar name, Zoups. We'll be back to try more of the salads. YUM!"}
{"text":"I really like the Café Zupas concept. 

It's very much along the lines of MAD Greens.  And similar, in many ways to: Corner Bakery, Paradise Bakery and Panera Bread. 

Café Zupas focuses on healthy, locally sourced meals. The salads are all well prepared, where you can add your favorite protein to it. Like Paradise where they included a soft chocolate chip cookie, here it's a dipped chocolate strawberry. Works for me!

Café Zupas is located on the perimeter of Chandler Mall, near P.F. Chang's on the boulevard, opposite 5 Guys, Chipotle and Jimmy Johns. I give those additional reference points, only because it's very easy to drive right past them as you come in.

My soup and salad meal, including extra protein usually runs me $10 to $13. 

Enjoy"}
{"text":"Not bad for a cheap lunch. I don't recommend anything seafood they have because you do get what you pay for....
Cute place and it's clean and fast. Food taste fresh.... they have a good selection on soups, salads and sandwiches. Those chocolate dipped strawberries are a nice touch. The reason actually why I come back! Lol! Customer service is ok. 
Lunch is worth the price."}
{"text":"Food is good, location is a little tricky to get to if you miss the turn. Inside is clean and it's never been too busy when I've gone."}
{"text":"Big fan of zuppas but I've had a couple of halfway decent meals here.. I'm wondering if they are still getting the hang of things as they are still pretty new... I'll keep trying hope they improve"}
{"text":"I ordered over the phone. She told me it would be ready within 5 to 10 minutes. Parking was tough. When I arrived, my food was being bagged. Perfect timing. I was helped right away. In and out in less than 3 minutes.
Food was okay. CA turkey, and I tried a seasonal potato soup. The soup is kind of spicy (also not creamy), but it mixes well with the avocado & cucumber on the CA sammich. Give it a dip... you might like it."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I've been a big fan of Zupas for a while.  I first discovered the Camelback location and was thrilled when the Chandler location opened.   The first couple times I went into the Chandler location, everything was great.  The last two times, notsomuch.  I always get the Chicken Tortilla soup.  The last two times, it was outrageously salty.  I've been getting this soup for over a year.  Suddenly, it has a handful of chopped tomatoes, maybe 3-4 kernels of corn, literally one slice of chicken and nearly all liquid.   It's like the guy skimmed it from the top of the pot.  Extremely disappointing.  And I have to tell them every time that when they  pack the bag, you can't put two soups and the plastic disposable containing the strawberry and bread in one bag.  It all tips over and spills out.  Grocery bags are simply not appropriate to carry soup. Zupas needs flat bottom bags."}
{"text":"We enjoy Cafe Zupas. You can get relatively healthy food quickly. It's nice to be able to customize your combo. We enjoy their soups, salads and sandwiches. I do wish they had green tea without sugar for a caffeine free low calories option."}
{"text":"I do really enjoy the food here . Back when I used to eat meat their pesto chicken sandwich and chipotle glazed chicken salad was my go too . Now I get the vegetarian sandwich and the same salad but with no chicken since I'm a vegetarian now . Only thing is is wish they had different protein options if we don't eat meat since everything has chicken"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my food & the new items I tried. This place is the bees knees his back & his arms. I found this place by looking on yelp. I took a chance & bam I'm here. The soups & desserts are so wonderful. Should u stop in you will be glad u did. And they won't let u tip them. But they are very professional."}
{"text":"I am in love with this place! I haven't met one item on Zupas menu that I didn't like. People who work at this location are awesome too!"}
{"text":"I used to love Zupas. I ate here frequently. 
Not long ago the soups were more than one scoop and the strawberrys were huge. 
This is the third (and probably last) time I came here to find that their portions were shrunk and prices were raised. I know times are tough and I dont mind price raise, but why mess with the portions?"}
{"text":"Kind of a hipster place. I liked what I ordered which was the grilled cheese and lobster bisque. The sandwich was a little on the anemic side maybe because it was flatter than a pancake. The taste was delicious though. I'd come back, but I don't think my husband cared for it too much. He'd probably like bigger portions."}
{"text":"I love this place! It's perfect for a lunch or small dinner.
The salads are so fresh and the soups are incredible! 
The tomato soup tastes so authentic and the broccoli cauliflower is so flavorful and fresh! 

The only problem I've had is that when the young teenage girls are occupying the whole place - things can be a bit unprofessional and not too efficient, so I feel more comfortable when adult workers are dominating the customer service.  

I also love the location and interior. Reminds me of a European cafe."}
{"text":"OMG YES. So delicious.  Great service.  I am actually going here today for lunch.  I wish they were opened on Sundays, but I get it...every biz deserves a day off.  I ordered the lobster bisque, grilled bbq chicken salad....everytime....well today I will try something different, since I am no longer eating meat...my favorite is the soda bar :)"}
{"text":"First time visiting. Great menu and good food. C minus on being tidy. Tables sat with guest's trays, and the trash area was overwhelmed with plates."}
{"text":"Nice fresh fast food concept. Salads, soup, sandwich....you choose or 2.They even give you a chocolates dipped strawberry. Who doesn't like that. Nice new facility with a iPod bar."}
{"text":"I tried Zupas yesterday for the first time. Really impressed! I had the soup and salad combo. The cauliflower soup was fabulous. High calorie, but fab. I also had the Cobb Chicken salad. It was very good. I liked the sweet herb vinaigrette dressing. Every ingredient was fresh and good. The star however, is the chocolate covered strawberry that's included with your combo (as is a small roll), THAT was the best. Could have eaten a dozen!!! I was there late, and the creme brûlée was 2 for one!  Can't beat that.  We needed good soup/salad/sandwich place out here. I found it!"}
{"text":"This is my little boys favorite place to eat. He loves the Wisconsin Cauliflower soup with bacon and cheese. It's a great place to come for a quick soup, salad, or sandwich. The kids meal prices are great and I enjoy the beverage area. I love the  complimentary chocolate cover strawberry and slice of bread. I swear I'm always like a dog staring at my kids while they shovel down carbs. I myself always get the bbq chicken salad, but I have to tell them to go was on the dressing. Sometime they get a little heavy handed. If you going give extra make it chicken not dressing. Just kidding.
I'd say this place is great for a quick bite if you're looking for something fresh and reasonably priced. Me likey!"}
{"text":"Our office just ordered lunch from here today. Everyone was happy with the food whether is was soup, salad, or a sandwich. Added bonus is that the wait was short. We will be ordering from there again in the very near future."}
{"text":"Cafe Zupas does a nice job of providing a light meal (at least I tell myself it's light) of salad and soups. Paninis are also available, but I've stuck to the soup and salad combo. It's a hard choice between mushroom and cauliflower. (I know - cauliflower? but the rich cheesieness really makes it). The salad I like is the mangoberry, I tell myself it's healthy, but I deny how much sugar must be involved.  It was suggested the salad could be a dessert.

I see another yelper had order/service problems, and I think I might've been there the same day, and can offer they forgot the nuts for my salad, an essential part and I had to go back and get them.  Not the quite the disaster as I read in the another review, but it was apparent they had staffing problems.  Seemed like a lot of trainees, and hopefully on the road to rectifying the service problems.  My lunch companion also pointed out some shortcomings in the salad ingredients along the way.  I guess it means being vigilant over your order. Caveat emptor."}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place! Super fresh ingredient signature salads, sandwiches, and soups put together in a thoughtful, creative and tasty way. We are still exploring the menu but have yet to find anything we did not enjoy. The employees are happy and have great pride in the place. Free chocolate dipped strawberries are given with each meal."}
{"text":"I've been a fan of this place since my grandma started taking me here a few months ago and I was hooked!

But the last time we came in here and ordered food to go it wasn't on point like it usually was :/
I ordered a cup of chicken tortilla soup for my grandma and a cup of chicken gumbo with an Asian Chinese Chicken Salad for my mom, when we got home to eat my mom said her salad dressing was disgusting and did not go well with that salad at all! Also she felt that they are super stingy with their toppings and don't want to give you extra unless their charging you for it :/ 

The chicken gumbo soup was good but it gave my mom such bad heartburn later on that night, when I went to drop off the soup to my grandma she said it was ridiculously SALTY!! I even tasted it to make sure she wasn't trippin but even I thought it was bad! She said it was so bad she went back the next day and it took it back for a different soup and that soup gave her diarrhea!

I really do love this place and just hoping it was an off day they were having :/ My mom is totally over this place but they still have a special spot in my heart!

:/"}
{"text":"4.5

OMG! I have really been missing out! This was my second trip back to NV since I'm getting ready to move out their for good soon :/ My grandma has been raving about this place since my first trip but unfortunately they were closed on Sundays. I knew I'd be back soon so I finally go to try it and I LOVED it!!

Since I've had stomach issues over the last year I don't eat as much and tend to crave soup ALOT! Even when its summer I will still eat soup I just love it! This place is perfect for me! They have all kinds of salads/paninis/soups to choose from! I went with the Strawberry salad with extra candied pecans and extra dressing on the side, everything was DELICIOUS!! The chicken they use is so fresh and the strawberries were too! Especially since it's not strawberry season anymore! 

For the soup I went with the chicken tortilla, it has nice chunks of fresh chicken too! I just don't like how they charge you for tortilla strips, the strips are just a given when you think of chicken tortilla soup, so they tack on that and they charge you for cheese :/

I guess the food makes up for it because everything tasted great! I even took a dessert home which did not agree with me (it was too rich/decadent for my tummy LOL) I didn't even taste my chocolate strawberry since I got too full! 

My mom and I shared all of this deliciousness for only $14.00! I know this is going on my food rotation once I move out there LOL!

I'm in love with Café Zupas! ^___^"}
{"text":"The cafe is very clean and very spacious. It is very easy to figure out what to order. If you are a first timer like me and open to try anything I definitely think you won't be disappointed. I ordered the lobster avocado sandwich with mushroom bisque. It was very delicious and would definitely want to come back to try other sandwiches. The staff is very helpful and attended. And they always have a smile on their face. Go try it out."}
{"text":"I'm updating my review to a 3. I still love this place, don't get me wrong, but lately the quality hasn't been as fresh and light. It has seemed heavy on the oils/fats the past few visits and not as flavorful.

It's still a good go-to for lunch, but not a top choice with how oily the sandwiches have been lately."}
{"text":"Got takeout. Put my chicken tortilla soup in a microwave safe bowl to heat it up and realized my \"Chicken\" tortilla soup was NOTHING but tomatoes and water!! NO CHICKEN! NO flavor except WATER! I've had this soup before and know this is supposed to be flavorful and contain roasted corn as well. THIS was NASTY!! I guess this is what customers get when restaurants hire air headed teeny boppers couldn't care less about customers or quality. I took a photo but I have no idea how to post it on this review."}
{"text":"Ok food,  nothing to wrote home about.  Friendly staff clean atmosphere just want impressed enough to go back."}
{"text":"The first few times I had this place I thought it was amazing with the best value compared to the salad and sandwich combo places.  Price is better than Paradise/Panera and Wildflower and you get a full sandwich instead of the half of an already small sandwich at Panera.  I was so sold on the value and the complimentary choc dipped strawberry that I failed to realize the mediocrity of the food.  The non-creamy soups aren't very good and the creamy ones are literally straight up cream and little of anything else.  I avoid the soups now and do salad and sandwich combo. The salads are fresh and good but most are meatless and all are same tier since all are same price combos unlike the option to upgrade to premium salad and sandwiches at Panera.  I like their berry salads and pair it with a heartier sandwich.  They do have a better variety of sandwiches and do taste decent but the quality is slightly inferior to other places."}
{"text":"Come here twice a week. I have an addiction. I love this place! I always get the try two combo. Mangoberry salad and pesto chicken sandwich are my go to."}
{"text":"Won't be returning.  Ordered a kale salad, manager sent back someone to replace the empty kale, 10 minutes later I was still standing there waiting.  Manager then went back to see what was taking so long, never returned.  Got frustrated and just ordered two soups.  Cashier was extremely slow and our bread was frozen in the middle.  Worst experience possible.  First and last time we will be coming to this one anyway.  Management needs to wake up if they expect to survive."}
{"text":"This location has been so many different restaurants in the past few years and now there is finally a good one! It's basically a fancied-up paradise bakery with better food, bread, and condiments. Oh and better prices too. I had a small Chipotle Chicken salad and a small tortilla soup and that was a good amount of food- with a drink, for only $10.58. The soup was great! And they let me sample several kinds before making my decision. I also loved that they had at least a dozen different kinds of hot sauce bottles on the wall that customers are free to use as they please. I tried three because I like to bring the heat and because they were available.  

My only complaint was that the dirty dish bin was overflowing even though the place was super slow. Can't someone handle that? Its gross to have to move other people's dirty dishes around in order to fit yours in there. Ts seems like an easy thing to fix- someone pick up dirty dishes every couple of hours or something."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed our experience.  There were lots of choices,  everything looked fresh and the portion size was great. My husband and I split a \"you choose 2\" sandwich and salad, which I though was just enough food and to my surprise we even got a chocolate covered strawberry! If I lived here I definitely would come back."}
{"text":"We visited for our first time just before hitting up Harkins for a movie and while the food was great, the service was a bit....frantic. It is not a very first-timer friendly place. You are rushed through the line, asked a million questions about your specific food, and if you have multiple people in your party on the same ticket, you have to remember what it is everyone ordered through each one of the stations because they will ask you--repeatedly. It's not very user-friendly in that respect. Let me break that down for you.

We were at the end of the line so with no one behind us, I didn't understand the rushed feeling we were receiving from the staff. It was lunch time. It wasn't closing time. The greeter at the first station asked us what we'd like and when you select something from the menu, there are a variety of options that go along with each menu item. Those options aren't really listed on the menu--that I could see--because if they are, we were rushed through so fast we didn't really get to see if they were. We were pushed from section to section and each time someone was asking us what our complete order was for our group. As the head of the line, this was very frustrating and the pace was frantic the entire way through the line. Almost to the point where I was wondering if they are paid based on the speed in which they get people through the line. The line set up is like how it used to be at Paradise Bakery with a sandwich station, salad station, soup station. You go down the long line, get what you want with the various options to each individual item, and then you go and pay. What they don't explain is that all these various \"options\" are actually upcharges so you're going to be in for a surprise at the register. By the time we got to the register to pay and after being asked for the 4th time what our entire group's order was, it was downright annoying. Why is it not written down somewhere? Why do I have to be asked for it multiple times like this?  Why do I feel so rushed to the point where I'm starting to feel panicked? It was weird. 

The drink station is at the far end of the restaurant so you have to navigate your way through a very narrow walkway because it's lined with tables right up the middle and booths on either side. If you are a larger person--you're going to butt check people because there's just no way around it. I'm not a larger person and I was butt checking people...if that gives you any idea how narrow this walkway is. 

I want to like this place because the food really was tasty but I am not sure about it just yet. Another visit, this time as a 2nd timer might be in order since I now have an idea of what's going on there."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum!
This place is a good find! Good soups and sandwiches! And a nice touch to add a chocolate dipped strawberry to the meal! Love it!"}
{"text":"So much similar to Panera but at less price and same quality. They offer free samples of the soup. i ordered the red pepper and lobster soup with pesto chicken sandwich. Their combos are perfect size and this place is very good for lunch with colleagues. Plus they also give a free chocolate dipped strawberry which is to fall for ;). Can't wait to go the next time!"}
{"text":"You want some soup, salad, or a sandwich?  Come on in to the Zupe Scoops (that's often how I refer to Cafe Zupas.....to myself).  I'm pretty sure that 98% of people who go get the try 2. You have to choose a 2 out of the 3 choices (those choices being soup, salad, or sandwich). Their deserts are also scrumptious.  My personal favorite is the million dollar bar (giant chocolate chips, coconut flakes, graham crackers, chopped nuts, and all the love that a grandmother can give).  If you're feeling extra fancy you can order chocolate fondue (it's made from Lindt chocolate).  It's so delicious you'll want to lick the bowl clean (I've almost done this on every occasion, unfortunately I have a wife who says society frowns upon it). Catering is a service they provide as well.  I've never had it so you'll have to ask someone else.  In conclusion,it's  derlicious (yes that \"r\" is meant to be there).  I can always find something to fill my hunger at the local Cafe Zupas."}
{"text":"Wow my new favorite place. I have now been 3 in a week. First time was just a quick bite then back to The Wood Store (also a favorite)  second time my husband came home sick so I stopped by for a sandwich for me and soup for him. (Garden chowder/ and chicken pesto sand). And then my husband loved the soup so much we he wanted it again so back I went with him for lunch. Wow the creme brûlée was awesome.   So worth it it is my new favorite spot. All the staff were friendly and very helpful. I do have to say the soup and salad is better when you stay and eat you get a bit more."}
{"text":"Always busy, so be ready for a line! They have a terrific combination of sandwiches, soups, and salads. Very affordable as well. We've been here a couple of times now with every visit being spectacular."}
{"text":"I've been to the Zupas on eastern, wasn't impressed. Since this location opened on rainbow I thought I would give Zupas another try. I'm glad I did because the soups are amazing! But I'm still not impressed with the sandwiches. I also love the drink station, they had a variety of delicious infused waters. Get the coconut water, pomegranate with raw honey!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times now. I will say I enjoy how this place is a relaxed atmosphere. However, living in Central Phoenix I tend to favor a less \"corporate\" feel in a restaurant's ambiance. That's probably the only reason why I didn't give this place 5 stars. Also, the parking is not the best because they are sharing a lot with Last Chance, c'mon! 

Aside from that, here are all the things I enjoy about Cafe Zupas: 
-The entire staff is friendly. Every person smiles at you, and is kind. I like that.
-The food is great and fresh. I have tried a few of their salads and sandwiches and have never been disappointed. In fact, when I'm craving a \"good\" sandwich I come here. Their panini's are hot and full of flavor (I was in tasteful heaven eating my turkey spinach artichoke panini today). 
-It's a nice plus that a chocolate covered strawberry comes with any salad or sandwich. 
-I respect that they're closed on Sundays. 

All in all, this is a solid food establishment, and I will continue to be a return customer."}
{"text":"No thank you. My date and I went there after a movie. She had a salad and a sandwich. I had clam chowder and knew that I would eat half of her sandwich. 

My chowder was loaded with green bell peppers, which I hate. This was not listed in the ingredients in the menu. Thankfully, they were happy to exchange it for lobster bisque. Both soups were bland. 

The date ordered that salad sans tomato and onion, both of which were not left off. The panini sandwhich was pitiful. The smallest portion and no flavor. 

Luckily for me, my date paid for all this, as it was way overpriced for what we got. She's still willing to see me and we'll probably go to Sauce next time."}
{"text":"Great place when you have to have a great homemade soup. Less than 5 for a good size bowl. Tomato basil was my choice. Came with very fresh bread five star service, clean & tasty. The large chocolate dipped strawberry was a nice finish. Similar atmosphere as chipotle."}
{"text":"I liked this a lot. 

The soup was the highlight. Both were very rich,  flavorful and perfect.

The sandwich (veggie) wasn't my favourite I've had but not bad either. The cheese one was better in my opinion. 

The 4 custom brewed teas were also a highlight by the regular drink fountains.  The cucumber infused green tea was amazing."}
{"text":"Very good service but once I found a piece of plastic in my food! Haven't been back to this location since."}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't been in Cafe Zupas before...this place is great!  I enjoyed the chicken enchilada chili with tortilla strips, a baguette, chocolate covered strawberry and an Italian soda.  Super friendly staff, nice dining room and delicious food!"}
{"text":"This place is a real disappointment compared to the one at Val Vista and Baseline. Do yourself a favor and drive the extra little bit and avoid this place Zupas. Extremely unorganized. Portions are ridiculously small. I would have given it 1 star but my soup was pretty good."}
{"text":"The food was alright, but not worth the price whatsoever. The ambience is clean and casual and the employees were great! Very friendly. However, for half a salad and half a soup it really is not worth ten dollars."}
{"text":"Great food. We needed a quick lunch and my mom said this was a good spot. Boy was she right!  Terrific variety of salads, with made to order custom or several suggested menu salads.  The best deal is the small salad an soup or sandwich combo. They throw in a slice of baguette and a chocolate covered strawberry!  The fountain drinks include an array of flavor syrups you can add and free refills. 
Seating areas are spacious, attractive clean and comfortable. Staff are super friendly and keep the place humming efficiently. 
Awesome spot!"}
{"text":"I would be so impressed if the crab & avocado sandwich had real crab & if it didn't have bacon on it. (They should announce that. Not everyone eats pork. Neither of the previous cases took place, Sooooo...meh. However, the soups are good. So is the service."}
{"text":"The food is great, always great and delicious. But they always get my order wrong. I asked Victoria for no tomatoes on my salad and no tomatoes or Munster on my other sandwich. Of course they ignored that and just threw my orders into boxes. It's kinda funny considering how many times they ask you what you got, but clearly they don't care."}
{"text":"It was our second time back with the wife who loves their salads. A new sandwich Zupas is promoting is the Thai chicken sandwich. The guy behind the counter says it's his favorite with the wheat bread. So I order it. After two bites I have to spit the chicken out. How does R & D for Zupas allow this disgusting taste get passed for consumption ? There's an herb in it that will give you the \"bitter face\" look. Seriously. This has to be addressed with corporate and taken off the menu. They need to go back to the drawing board and fire the chef or VP that allowed this recipe to be used. I guarantee Zupas takes this Thai chicken off the menu. The manager for this S. Rainbow cafe in Las Vegas should speak up to corporate before more bad reviews are written. Friend says Zupas is only known for their salads and soups."}
{"text":"This place is always super clean. The have someone always walking around making sure the tables are clean for the next client. The line can move a little slow but that's because they are making everything fresh. A few times I've had to wait when I'm the next person in line because the employees are talking which is a little annoying but the food is delicious. I lo e their fresh fruit drinks and their strawberries are amazing. I do miss their veggie chowder and I hope they bring it back soon."}
{"text":"I drive all the way from the west valley and took my family to this new location today 10/1/16. Worst experience ever, thought the staff would be friendly and everything and yet not even welcomed in. When I received my soups in two different cups to go I was given about a 1/4 less than the rim. I asked the young lady very nicely to fill it a little more and she told me straight out no. She then explained that she can't do that because that's what she was told to do. I asked for a Supervisor Kehau to see if she wouldn't mind giving us a little more in the cup even asking her to look at it for herself. She said no as well to us. She then said that there was this amount of ounces in the cup without even weighing it. Not sure how she was coming to assume that there was that many ounces in the cup without a measuring device. She was very argumentative with me and wouldn't give us a little more soup in the cups. I just explained that I'm not paying for something that isn't even remotely close to being filled. Point being, please make sure your getting an adequate amount of soup before you purchase it because it looks like there putting just barely over half a cup when putting soup in it. Now awaiting District Supervisor to call. Buyer beware."}
{"text":"Great lunch spot.  Soup selection is good.  Like the chipotle pork salad or the pesto chicken salad sandwich. Also they have sweets! Love the chocolate covered strawberry that comes with every order."}
{"text":"You'd think ordering a salad would be easy. High school dropout workers complete with gothic eyeshadow and matching spacey intellects literally scowl at you if you slightly deviate from the pre-planned food. I asked for extra cucumbers. Was given three, and an evil eye while being commanded that ITS EXTRA!  That's ok guys. I have a job, I can afford it. I asked for extra tomatoes and was given three halves of a grape tomato. They stuck seventeen toothpicks into the salad as they glared at me. Went down the line with my voodoo doll salad, toothpicks and all, and they required a powwow to figure out how much extra to charge me. Nobody could figure it out. 

It's just extra veggies guys. Not rocket science. Why glare and sneer  at paying customers and make them feel guilty about their order.   This was a painful process just for lunch. Painful. 

Soup was barely lukewarm. 

Not only do I not recommend this place, I say go elsewhere where employees and management appreciate your patronage, provide cheery service (come on its even the holiday season where's the CHEEEEER), and your food isn't doled out piece by piece served with vitriol. 

Two thumbs down, guys. I expected better. I will say the bread was good. So there's that....

Save your time and money. Don't eat here."}
{"text":"Better version of Paradise Bakery.  Fast service, and not too bad for calories"}
{"text":"I love all of their food I just really wish they would fill the soup bowls up more! And please bring back the seasonal Bangkok  coconut soup omg that was probably the best soups I've ever had!!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at other Zupas locations and so I gave this one a chance thinking it would be great. Unfortunately was very wrong. Got the kale and quinoa salad and it was gritty and halfway through eating it I discovered a worm of some kind. They offered a replacement salad and not a refund. Who still has an appetite after that?"}
{"text":"WOW! Their grand opening was today & I can't believe how smoothly everything went here! Workers were so friendly & helpful going over different popular items on the menu.  I really liked that they have a huge lit-up menu board outside so you're not just standing there holding up the line while you decide what you want.  

The line was out the door but we were up to the front in no time, seriously, these people work FAST!  I ordered the BBQ Pork sandwich & half of a chicken caesar salad with their caramel creme brule AND their million dollar bar.  It was 50% off of everything today so hubby & I went a little crazy.  He ordered the turkey bacon avocado panini, half caesar, clam chowder AND 7 layer chocolate cake.  When we went up to pay & she told us it was $17 including drinks I couldn't believe it, there was sooooo much food! Their fountain drinks are really neat because they have a little section of different syrups to create your own Italian sodas.  Every meal comes with a slice of french bread & a chocolate covered strawberry which I thought is a neat little touch. 

We absolutely loved our meals, I finished my sandwich & halfway through my salad I was stuffed! I took a bite of the creme brule & that would have to be my only disappointment item of the night.  It was more like a pudding, albeit a very tasty pudding! 

Prices are VERY reasonable which makes my wallet happy, I foresee many lunches  in my future at Cafe Zupas!"}
{"text":"They were out of lettuce for the cobb salad ,,Had to pick another , Out of goat Cheese , Out of Bacon,  .  REALLY !! Then they were out of 2 salad dressing ..We told them to never mind.. Come on people how can you run a restaurant with no Food !"}
{"text":"Delicious! Thanks to the staff who graciously made our late dinner at exactly 9:00pm, closing time. Cauliflower soup, yum! Fresh greens and proteins, yes! Perfect Cuban sandwich, yep!"}
{"text":"Came to pick up lunch for my employees, while placing my order I asked for mayo for one of my employees sandwiches and was told they do not carry mayo. I thought it was odd, so I moved on to the next order which requested extra tomatoes, to my surprise I was told they \"couldn't do that\". So I said \"charge me for the extra tomatoes\", I was then rudely told the register doesn't have a way to charge for that.? Other people that were in line hearing this were shaking their heads, anyways I finished the rest of my orders and took my employees their sort of filled orders. The sandwiches were lacking in flavor, were small and looked like a car had ran over them. The soups were also lacking in flavor, tasted watered down. The ironic thing is I wanted to change it up and treat my employees and they just wanted Blimpies, I should've listened. They would've gotten their extra tomatoes and Mayo (what sandwich restaurant doesn't carry MAYO!!!!). I should've just left in the first place after the rudeness, but I had waited a long time in line because of the slow service. Needless to say, I will never return and don't recommend this food and service to anyone."}
{"text":"Have been many times.  Disappointed because my favorite the Thai sandwich has been taken off the menu.  Liked the variety the sandwich brought to the menu. Please bring it back.  Have to say the panini sandwiches at Blue Lemon are better love the grilled balsamic chicken panini but like the larger choices of soups at Zupas"}
{"text":"What are they hiding??? They don't have any nutritional info on their food. When asked in the restaurant for some info (i have dietary  restrictions), I was told by the person who takes orders that they don't have that info. I was so frustrated that the info couldn't be found, I emailed the conpany. I was told the food was all healthy but at this time they don't offer the public nutritional info. I find this unacceptable. Everyone posts nutritional info including fast food restaurants. This leads me to think this restaraunt has something to hide. I won't be back until they join every other restaurant out there, and post the info!"}
{"text":"This place is great. I stumbled upon the Café Zupas and am in love. Great choices, very fresh, and quick service. Only complaint is that the tables. Not a good look to walk in and there are more dirty tables than customers. I understand there is the lunch time rush, but somebody should be focused on the eating area and beverage machine."}
{"text":"If you're going to have a chain, make it a chain like Zupas! With fresh ingredients, a super happy staff, and a TON of options, you really can't go wrong! Not to mention the freebies and half price days they randomly offer. 
I loved this place when I first tried it about a year ago, but now they're close to work, home and its a healthier option for the entire family. 
The 16 year old boy can get pulled pork, and the 12 year old (who went vegetarian overnight) can eat plenty without meat. Not to mention 8 different soups. I was sold at that. I love soup, and even when its 110 in Vegas, I still will eat soup. They also change up the flavors with the seasons, or popularity. (So don't get hooked on one item) 
My favorite part, they appreciate their people. They close on Sundays so everyone can have a family day. 
With good food, decent prices, a great people- Cafe Zupas is a win win in my book!"}
{"text":"One of my fav soup salad and sandwich places. I always order the Cherry Balsamic Chicken salad and I am never disappointed. Good prices. Healthy. And something for the whole family. My husband even likes coming here. He loves their panini style sandwiches."}
{"text":"Keep an eye on your food if you have food sensitivities! They put bacon on my husbands sandwich (a strictly never ever eat pork guy!). 

When we took it back they made it with bacon AGAIN, then tried to simply remove the pork from the sandwich. Luckily I watched this time and told them that simply removing the bacon was NOT acceptable. 

The food is good but not worth risking if you have sensitivities. We agreed that they're \"off the list\" unless we don't need to special order."}
{"text":"Food was good like always. We've have no issues or complaints about the food whenever we come here. The ultimate cheese sandwich with the red chili lobster soup is great. I would give a higher rating but the line is still just consuming/annoying. There seems to be a mistake/misunderstanding ever other time we come but the food does bring us back."}
{"text":"Just opened in Desert Ridge and there is also a location near the Biltmore - this soup/salad/sandwich lunch spot hits the spot!
The Try 2 is a great way to have a sandwich/soup soup/salad salad/sandwich combo for 7.99.  The sandwiches and salads are good but the soups are out of this world.  
Drinks are also excellent - yes its a fountain server a la any other sandwich place, but Zupas has Italian Soda syrups nearby that you can pump into your drink, turning a coke into a Strawberry Cola, or a Ginger Ale (I have not seen this on soda fountain before) into a Raspberry Ginger Ale.
Kids giving you trouble?  Got an iPod handy?  No problem - they even have docks and screens for the little ones to watch their favorite movies while you eat in piece.
All in all a great place for lunch.
Fair warning to weekend lunchers - this place is closed Sundays"}
{"text":"Very Disappointed!! I know you are new but I think more training should have been given before opening. Very unorganized when it comes to ordering. Customer service Horrible! I ordered the Pacific Cobb Salad when the employee scooped my chicken into the small scooper it went uneven and the manager said to her to take some of that chicken out and make sure it's even with the scoop ,folks this is a small scoop..lol.. They are so scared to give you an extra crumble of blue cheese.. Wow! Forget about the kids chicken strip meal. Looks like a frozen piece of breaded chicken they throw into the toaster oven. The interior of the building is nice enough but 1 time was enough. Good Luck hope you can turn this around. Oh by the way don't expect to use silverware , plastic only!"}
{"text":"VERY GOOD FOOD! Soups are excellent. Ordering is annoying...a cafeteria-style setting where you order the sandwich/salad first with one person, order the soup with another and then dessert and finally paying. By that time, you have repeated your order to someone 3-4 times. Suggestion to Cafe Zupas...write it down so the customer isn't constantly repeating it, which can be hard when ordering for myself and two kids. Other than that, great place!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have eaten here for a ton of our dates.  I love it because they are healty and don't charge and arm and a leg for it.

I love the chocolate strawberries too!"}
{"text":"My go to when I'm looking for a healthy, nutritious lunch or dinner.  The Try 2 Combo is my favorite.  Their desserts are way too delicious (gotta stop myself!).  It's a quick in and out without eating fast food!  The chocolate dipped strawberry with all meals is a nice touch for sure."}
{"text":"Met friends for dinner here and was thrilled.  The prices are great.  For less than $10 you can get a salad made exactly the way you want with some delicious soup.  Also comes with a dinner roll and a chocolate dipped strawberry.  I love the fresh made beverages."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed dinner here with my son.  I made my own salad and he had a lobster bisque soup with crab sandwich.  I think his favorite part of the meal is the chocolate dipped strawberries that come with the meal.  I enjoy their fresh drinks and the roll with butter."}
{"text":"I've been here twice it's and it's okay place,I prefer it over a usual fast food place,and the prices are fair. .this last time I ordered out the tortilla soup was really salty and not enjoyable as the rest of the food,also the first time we went my toddler got the kids choice of chicken strips but it's literally two tiny strips that didn't fill her appetite."}
{"text":"Really good soup sandwiches and great kids combo options.  Definitely coming back. The turkey and spinach sandwich was really fresh and good. I love that the chicken fingers in the kids combo are baked not fried."}
{"text":"I think I found a new lunch place when I'm out and about.  Lobster Bisque and Honey Bacon Club Paninis was very tasty.  Yeah....I'll be back!"}
{"text":"The location is immaculate. But that's where it stops for me. I'm sure they needed 16 employees to make my overpriced and underwhelming meal. Haven't been there ages and I finally decided to go w/my daughter on a day we both stayed home sick. The soups are all dairy based except for 2 and only one is meat free. We were sick and needed something broth based. I asked the server this and ended up choosing the quinoa veggie only have her offer feta or goat cheese. I guess common sense and attention detail isn't a job requirement. My daughter chose chicken strips and a fruit cup. Mangle mandarin slices and grapes are considered a fruit cup and slivers of what looked like microwaved chicken strips were served as the tenders. Not the mother daughter lunch I was expecting."}
{"text":"Love Zupas - fresh and delicious.  Best value around, as well!"}
{"text":"We have been looking forward to trying this place since we passed it one night after we had already eaten. The quality of the food was very disappointing. My wife and I both had the Try 2 Combo and each had a sandwich and soup. The sandwiches were fairly thin and nothing exciting in terms of taste and the soup was equally bland and tasted watered down. It wasn't cheap either. $24 for two of us. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Stop reading Yelp reviews and just go to Zupa's. If you don't like it, well, you're wrong and you're a stupid face and I just don't like you."}
{"text":"Average food at average price. Menu is small and simple and the food comes as ordered. High school cafeteria feel to it. Tables placed in high traffic spots that get you bumped all the time while eating. The place was super busy so they must be doing something right. Not my thing tho"}
{"text":"Was excited to come have dinner but what s disappointment. The BBQ Pulled Pork was syrupy sweet topped with sweet coleslaw. No contrast or relief from the, well, sweetness."}
{"text":"Boo to Zupas! I ordered their try 2 combo with 2 half salads for me and my daughter $8.79 (a full salad is $7.59).  Get to the cashier and she tells me I can't get 2 of the same thing in the try 2. Why didn't the order take tell me that? Talked to the manager and she ineptly tries to say the register won't even let her do that. 

So they throw that salad away and give me soup.  Nonsensical! Clarify things on your menu or train your staff or better yet get some better customer service."}
{"text":"Tried this place on a whim as we were driving by.  They were offering 50% off all entrees for the grand opening.  My husband and I weren't even hungry but we decided to share something just to give it a try.  We had the soup and salad combo which at half off cost around $4 and some change!

We got the White Bean & Vegetable soup because it was both gluten free (hubby) and vegetarian (me).  It was very tasty.  I wasn't expecting much and really liked it.

We also had the berry salad.  It had blueberry, strawberry, raspberry and pomegranate as well as finely chopped cinnamon almonds and a lemon poppy seed dressing.  It was really good.

I didn't think the chocolate dipped strawberry was that great.  Didn't taste overly fresh to me.  But the slice of bread that came with the soup was DELICIOUS!

I would go again.  And will be even happier if they have fresh brewed iced tea."}
{"text":"No clue how this place gets more then 2 stars. 

Soups I have ordered nasty......................... pulled pork sandwich nasty!! 

Tried this place twice but both times disappointing

One more thing you have to order your food about 3 times before you pay ANNOYING!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food.. however I felt very rushed to hurry make a choice and pay...the large soups I got for take out were not full.. nearly an inch to the top of the container, I mean I just paid 24 bucks for soup full it up!! I will still patron this cafe because of how delicious the food is but if I bring anyone I'll apologize for the service ahead of time.."}
{"text":"Zupas food was great. I had a chicken pesto sandwich and clam chowder. The sandwich was nice and hot. The cheese was nicely melted and it was a perfect size for lunch. The clam chowder had a great balance to it and had plenty of clams. The only thing that should be corrected if how I was greeted when I first walked in. I walked up towards a girl who apparently a shift lead. She looks at me and say what can I get for you! I was taken back a little and informed her it was my first time. She then went on explaining the menu during her explanation of the menu she stops in the middle and ask another coworker to get something which i thought was rude. She than comes back to me and says so what can I get for you. I was over it and proceeded down to the next girl who was amazing. Overall experience was good, just a tad bit of training on customer service."}
{"text":"Don't let the line scare you they are very quick with the food preparation, and I love the recharge bar concept."}
{"text":"I used to be obsessed with Paradise Bakery and then I found Zupas. This place is always packed but there is never a long wait. There is also a larger variety of food options and everyone is extremely friendly. I've tried the veggie sandwich, garden chowder, grilled cheese, BBQ salad, cauliflower soup, and the chocolate cake - so delicious. 

To top it off...you get a chocolate covered strawberry. Amazing."}
{"text":"Great food and a really good price. I love the Panini sandwiches and the brownie desserts. So good! This is a great place for lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"I love cafe zupas! Luckily, this place is just near my house! Yay! I always order their 2 combo, I got a sandwich and a soup. Their Wild Mushroom Bisque is so bomb! And I'm getting addicted to it. For the drink, go get the Orange Berry Infusion, you'll never resist it's delicious flavor! They use raw honey instead of sugar or anything else. I'm definitely gonna be a regular customer here. Kudos to this place for the good flavors of soups! Soups are definitely what you need in this kind of weather! Thumbs up to the people who work here, they're all pretty friendly and not rude."}
{"text":"This place is soooo delicious!!! Seriously, everything is great! The staff is friendly and happy, and that makes a big difference. This is my new favorite go-to quick restaurant when I am in a hurry. I will be going here all the time now! Where has this restaurant been all my life?!"}
{"text":"I decided to try this place for a to-go salad for dinner. I ordered the California protein cobb, and it was so good. I didn't realize the person thought I only wanted a half order. I guess people usually get salad, soup, and a sandwich, so next time I'll clarify I want a full salad. The cheesecake was pretty good, you can have berries added, but I got it plain. They also have a phone charging area that looked pretty interesting. It was very trendy, and the employees were all super friendly. I'm definitely going to eat in and bring my boyfriend here next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"I love Zupas! They have excellent customer service and great food! The lobster bisque and mango berry salad is my favorite combo.. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I am salad-obsessed and live close by so I decided to try Zupas out tonight. 

Unfortunately, it was very disappointing...

We ordered a large California Cobb salad and a power bowl with quinoa (I think that's what it was called). The size of the salad was quite skimpy for a large. And my husbands \"bowl\" was about the same size. I'm not a big eater and still felt hungry after I finished. Typically, I can only eat half of a restaurant-size salad...so the portions seem really off. 

Looking at the Yelp pictures, the \"pick two\" half portions are larger than the large salad to go that I received. I probably would have gotten more (or the same) if I ordered the half. 

The salad toppings were also very disappointing. I had 3 slivers of chicken and meager amounts of everything else that it came with. 

On top of the sad salad and lack of toppings, the brunette female cashier working tonight was quite rude. She asked if I wanted a drink and when I said two water cups she acted extremely put off and then a minute or so later bent down to grab the plastic water cup. 

The one highlight is that their ranch dressing tasted fresh and good. 

I'd recommend going to Salad and Go or even Oreganos for their salads over Zupas."}
{"text":"I don't know about everyone else, but this is the only place that has EVER denied a request for a side of banana peppers. Then when asked to speak to a manager, the teenagers on staff simply said there's not one. I will not be back. I think the food is mediocre and overpriced. They can charge .69 per topping for soup, but apparently have no way to charge for peppers. (That's what I was told at least) After paying $25 for lunch for 2, I think they could throw in a couple of peppers. Or even switch them out for that bread roll or strawberry that I don't want. With all the choices in the world today, I will happily move along and never go back."}
{"text":"I've never been a big fan of salads but all I crave around lunchtime now is the strawberry harvest salad! It is delicious and the staff is super helpful with making your meal exactly what you want it to be."}
{"text":"Saw that this location was not rated as highly as the sunset location, but I have not had any negative experiences. Red pepper lobster soup, chicken pesto sandwich, and strawberry harvest are all my favorites"}
{"text":"Love this place, I usually call ahead and pick up my lunch, because it is always super busy, but worth it.  Lindsey already knows what I order and as soon as she hears my name, she knows all the adds and take out of my order.  Great Service!"}
{"text":"This location is my favorite!! Service is awesome and the manager , her name is \"Aja\" she is very nice and very helpful . Great costumer service , food is delicious and the portions are generous. 
The please is very clean.  I recommended 100% ."}
{"text":"Visually appealing place. Has good sandwich and soup. My favorite part of the experience is the infused drink availability. I especially love the cucumber green tea. Dessert was good and similar to Starbucks choices. If you want something out of the ordinary chains, this place was fun for my wife and kids."}
{"text":"Oh this place is good for soup and sandwiches! I like that you can pick 2 of either a sandwich, soup or salad and its $8.99- if you get a soup, you'll get a hearty slice of soft crusty bread too!

I got the spinach artichoke sandwich and a chicken tortilla soup and my husband got the grilled cheese and tomato basil soup with orzo. They are perfectly sized and you actually get a full sandwich with your meal. 

If you want something light, this is a good alternative to other soup and sandwich places. They have drinks infused with different teas, berries and raw honey too. I tried the pomegranate infused tea and the cucumber basil infused tea and it was refreshing and light. before I forget, they gave you a piece of chocolate covered strawberry as well for an after meal treat!

All in all, I'm coming back for a light dinner or lunch!"}
{"text":"Four stars for this style of restaurant. Good variety of sandwiches & soups. Hot soups, all from scratch on premise. Loved the cauliflower & mushroom soups !"}
{"text":"The food here is okay, well I've only had the same sandwich the two times I've been here. Nothing else seems appetizing. What I definitely don't like is the customer service. I've only been here twice and I thought the second time since there were different workers it'd be different. Nope. Still shitty customer service. The first time the cashier was really rude I asked if they had a certain soup on the menu and she replies with \"the menu is there, can't name every one because I'm about to help another customer\" but I couldn't go back to see the menu cuz there was a line of people standing in front of it. she hands my food while talking to an employee and doesn't even say thank you or looks at me. The second time which wasn't long ago the guy kept asking what I was having and I told him like 3 times not only that the girls were messing up on two orders behind me. I don't understand why they don't keep the orders in ORDER and organized so they don't mess up. Definitely not returning, at least not to this location. Or once they have people who actually know about customer service."}
{"text":"Love the freshness of their ingredients.  My go-to soup and salad combo is usually the Maui tropical chicken salad with macademia nuts and yummy Wisconsin cauliflower cheddar soup-- so cheesy and yummy.  Their drink bar with syrups is a great idea as well.  The chocolate dipped strawberry is a nice touch and are always great.  Love this place and the customer service is always on point!"}
{"text":"Food is always great here and the prices are great compared to other places that do the same thing. The staff is always friendly and seems like they want to be there. I've tried most the soups and they are all good"}
{"text":"Living across from this strip mall, it is always exciting to see the new adventures taking place. For a few weeks I watched the corner of Eastern Ave and Richmar Ave, develop into this bright red decored restaurant advertising soups, salads, and sandwiches. Definitely a place I needed to try!

I ventured over there this past Friday, and found it absolutely amazing! I was greeted at the door by an employee who was extremely friendly and knew the menu well. I tried the Nuts over Berries salad, which was incredibly fresh and the crushed cinnamon almonds definitely offered a pizzaz!

And if that wasn't enough to make this experience memorable, it came with a chocolate covered strawberry! 

New. 
Favorite. 
Place."}
{"text":"My expectations for this place wasn't so high but it was so good compared what I thought it would be. The place itself is really cute looking. Parking lot shared with other business' next to it. It's huge inside and really clean! I tried the Cuban and the clam chowder. I haven't had chowder that good since I was in San Diego! The Cuban is so good. That was the first time I've ever had a cuban sandwich and it was amazing. I feel like the pickles made it a little weird, but in a good way. When we walked in, everyone was so busy but the line died down so quickly. It's so weird because as soon as someone walked in, 7 more would follow out of no where! So don't let the lines scare you off, because within 2 minutes you'll be in the front! Their chocolate covered strawberries are amazing too! Can't wait to come back here."}
{"text":"As always, greeted by very friendly people. They were quick to get my food ready and could see I was in a hurry. Everything tasted great and the chocolate covered strawberry was delicious. 

My only complaint is that there was no fork/spoon with my to go order. I was a little annoyed when I got to work to eat my yummy food but had to hunt down a fork and a spoon first."}
{"text":"5 stars for the soups
3 stars for the sandwiches 

Whenever I eat here, the lobster bisque and the wild mushroom bisque are a must. The consistency of both soups are always perfect - thick, very luscious and creamy. They are also slightly sweet, richly decadent, packed with quality ingredients and incredible flavor.

On the other hand, I'm not too crazy about their sandwiches. I haven't found a sandwich that that blew away my tastebuds yet. Their sandwich options are unique, but they are also lacking the body of flavor and substance that would typically impress me - they are all so dry and bland.

SOUPS:
- Lobster Bisque - I am seriously addicted to this soup! Plus, I love the generous chunks of vegetables swimming in the soup, it makes for a satisfying and comforting meal in itself. 5/5
- Wild mushroom bisque - This is another winning soup. The wild mushroom flavor is extremely complex and savory. You can really taste the earthiness and nuttiness of the wild mushrooms in every sip. 5/5
- Tomato bisque - Slightly tart, slightly sweet and very comforting. This is a great choice with grilled cheese. 4/5

SANDWICHES: 
- Honey Cilantro Carnitas - the pulled pork was moist, but it is also pretty bland and not seasoned properly. Also, the honey cilantro glaze sounds amazing, but it didn't have a pleasant taste to it - it tasted like processed ingredients and chemicals (even though they advertised it to be \"house-made\") The sandwich filling: cabbage, non-existent pickled red onion and bread were also very dry and not memorable. 3/5
- BBQ Pulled Pork - they used the same pulled pork as in the carnitas sandwich above - so the meat was moist, but bland. I also wasn't a fan of the BBQ sauce that they used. The sauce didn't have any bold, sweet, or tangy flavor - it was too basic and generic. The overall filling and flavor was very dry and boring. 2/5
- Pesto Chicken Panini - the pesto flavor was extremely weak and the chicken was very plain. The overall panini was dry and bland. 2/5
- Crab Avocado Melt Panini - my boyfriend enjoyed this one the most. The crab flavor isn't strong, possibly because they used imitation crab? But the avocado made the sandwich creamy and the bacon added a necessary saltiness. 3/5

This is a dependable lunch spot and I hope I find a sandwich I'm crazy about soon. I love that they stand out in a crowd of sandwich shops by giving away complimentary chocolate covered strawberries! A sweet treat is always appreciated at lunch."}
{"text":"I've been to this Cafe Zupa several times since I've been in Vegas.  Every time I go here, the food is extremely tasty and is presented well.  The young employees that work there seem to enjoy their jobs and are pleasant.  Effective customer service which can be a challenge in a city like this.  I plan to keep coming!!"}
{"text":"Do you ever just have that craving for a delicious sandwich and a bowl of soup without all the fuss and goings-on..........this is the place.
I've even used this for company events, catering in for my work group - everyone loves it.
Chain or not - this place is just simple goodness.........friendly staff, modern surroundings, an amazing beverage bar..........you gotta try it."}
{"text":"I LOVE LOVE LOVE this place.  Their ingredients are fresh, unique and the variety is outstanding - not to mention delicious.   I usually do the make your own salad and love it.  They have so many things to choose from that each day you can have something different.   When I am in Vegas on business, I eat here every day for lunch.  Oh, and the to-go boxes are really nice.  Getting take out for a meeting is awesome.

Please Cafe Zupas - open in San Jose CA!"}
{"text":"I ordered a pesto chicken panini and a bowl of gumbo. Both were excellent. The sauce was just perfect on the sandwich, and the toppings went very nicely with the chicken. The gumbo was tasty, not that spicy or peppery, but still had a nice flavor.

The chocolate-covered strawberry was a nice addition to the meal.

I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Those previous \"reviews\" must be from Paradise employees. They are nervous now!
We've visited this cafe three times now having different sammy & soup each time.
The food is good and the variety of options is great. My only concern is the prices. They are on par with Paradise down the walk - both a little high.
The difference in volume of soup btwn large and small - if there is one - is not worth the additional charge. Stick with the small.
Great place to eat before catcjing a movie next door."}
{"text":"Have been here several times, love the food, the customer service, heck I even like the jams they usually play here! Though I wouldn't go every day for lunch, the 10 buck deal is great for having that variety you sometimes need. This location hasn't let me down yet ^_^."}
{"text":"Usually I come in to Zupas to eat my soup and salad but since they don't have anymore blood orange vinaigrette for your salad anymore don't bother coming if that's your favorite salad dressing just letting you know this will be my last time here maybe I'll try Panera and see if they have blood orange vinaigrette next time but this is off the list for now"}
{"text":"Beat selection of soup, salads and sandwiches. Even the pickiest eater can find something here! Love that we can sample the soups before ordering. Best price & value for combinations vs competition. The chocolate strawberry is a delicious touch, and healthier than a cookie."}
{"text":"Got two combos (strawberry salad and New England clam chowder / BBQ pulled pork and the Maui tropical). I thought the salads were really good... the BBQ pulled pork sandwich and the soup were okay... both combos included a dinner roll and a chocolate covered strawberry.... the place is very clean and even has a charging station!!"}
{"text":"I'm glad they are opening new restaurants on Rainbow, which is in dire need of new restaurants, but this place is not that good. I do love the atmosphere and I do love the location, but the food was just okay. I felt as though this place didn't live up to the hype that others have created for it. Maybe it's because I am not a health nut and that is why I didn't favor it. The food didn't make me sick so they get one star for that, the service was great, so that's another star, and a third star because the food is supposed to be healthy for you and is made with fresh ingredients. 

I ordered:
Honey bacon club with New England clam chowder  = The sandwich was 'meh' and the chowder was too watery

Husband ordered: 
BBQ pulled pork with chicken enchilada chili soup = The sandwich had a nice tang to it, but isn't a 'must-try' by any means; soup was decently good, hate that add-ons are $0.69 each for just a sprinkle of shredded cheese

I personally would not come back, unless I was outnumbered by a group of friends that wanted to go here, but try it for yourself!"}
{"text":"Food was fresh. Service was fast.  The Enchilada soup was the bomb. I was not disappointed with my choices.  Lots of sandwich choices. At least 10 soup choices. They offer soup samples. Try them all! Bathrooms are clean and comfortable."}
{"text":"Fresh sandwiches, soups, and salads that are a great deal. We got two sandwiches, two soups, a salad, and a drink with some complimentary chocolate covered strawberries and bread for less than $30. We really liked the flavored waters/teas. They had pomegranate infused green tea as well as lemonade and other drinks. Looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"I love Cafe Zupas.  I wish I tried this place sooner.  The key to their success is fresh ingredients and all hand made.  The Maui Tropical Chicken salad is to die for! It's filled with fresh mango and pineapple along with coconut, macadenia nut pieces and a wonderful pineapple vinagrette dressing.  The Wisconsin cheddar soup is so cheesy and smooth and the tortilla soup creamy with just enough zip and goes well with the tortilla strips.  Nice on a cold winter day!  For dessert the creme brulees are delicious, but I am hooked on the million dollar bar with butterscotch chips - it's soo good!   The servers are all so cheerful and friendly."}
{"text":"Food was Amazing, the sandwiches and paninis are so good, the salads were delicious and big for half a salad. I feel like all of the food had so much flavor, only reason I didn't give them 5 stars was because of the desserts. That was the main reason I came there and they were just so sweet and felt like it was too much, I tried the caramel salted creme brûlée that basically was just pudding with caramel on top and the rocky road brownie, and I have to save my favorite thing out of all the sweets was definitely the free chocolate covered strawberry"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! The menu is great, prices are affordable, service is quick and attentive. The only downfall is the seating. It is a very crowded place, but that obviously speaks highly of the business itself. Another downfall is that the chicken tortilla and white bean veggie soup is a tad bit too salty for my liking. Other than that it's a must go!"}
{"text":"I have had this placed bookmarked on Yelp for several weeks now.  Finally while my family were in the area and craving something different from our usual spots.  I said let's give this place a try and they agreed.  

I was expecting a quaint little mom and pop style cafe, boy was I wrong.  I was  surprised to see how large  and full of energy this place was even though it was a Saturday afternoon.  We were greeted and shown menu's and the host even explained there combo special which seemed like a fair deal. The Two fer was any combo of sandwich, salad and soup.  Perfect! for me this way I could explore the menu and have a great lunch to carry us through our eventful day off from work. 

The setup was a little overwhelming being my first time but one or two more times and I should be a pro.  Once we started ordering things really started to move fast. Several team members were asking what we wanted and herding us through the line like cattle going to off slaughter, then BOOM!! We were at the cashier and paying for our food before we knew what happened.  We were a little confused as to what just occured.

As we sat down tasting our food everything was hot, fresh, and made from quality ingredients.  The food was very flavorful and while reading the menu and other things around the restaurant the food was also sourced locally (Utah and California). 

My entire family enjoyed their meal and I am sure we will be back to try the many variety of soups ,salads and sandwiches.  Oh yeah I almost forgot to mention they give you a chocolate covered strawberry for dessert. Yumm!"}
{"text":"I come here for a salad 3-4 times per week. The food is ok granted it's difficult to screw up a salad. After the staff is done asking me their usual 21 questions with an unbearably disingenuous enthusiasm they will proceed to screw up my order roughly half of the time. At the end of the day if I had another convenient salad/soup bar to go to close to home I would."}
{"text":"I love the food here, however, I have just one critique about the service, which is why I am taking away one star.  And this is consistent with all the Cafe Zupas in town, where I feel that when I am placing my order and go down the line to the register, I feel that I am placing and repeating my order 3 different times.  Whether I am placing an order for just myself, or ordering for a few people at the office, it's the same thing.  Even if I order salads from the first person, the soup person asks if I ordered anything else. Then there is a person at the dessert station who asks you if you would like dessert, then asks you what you ordered.  Then when you get to the register, the register person asks you what you ordered.  Heaven forbid you order a sandwich!  If you don't tell the register person you ordered a sandwich before you pay, you aren't getting your sandwich!  I think one person in the beginning needs to write all of it down, then pass your order along to all the people involved, then have your order ready once you get to the register.  Or better yet, have online ordering available and let customers be responsible for placing their own orders.  Other than this critique, the food here is great!!!"}
{"text":"Last time I came, I ordered the Asian Citrus Chicken salad and the Cuban Grilled Pork sandwich.  I'm a fan of the Asian Citrus Chicken salad.  It was sweet and tangy with a generous amount of chicken in it.  I also had the Cuban Grilled Pork sandwich, and it tasted good too.

In the past, I've tried the soups which are delicious, and my favorite is definitely the wild mushroom bisque.  The chicken enchilada soup and lobster bisque are good but a little bit too salty for my tasty.

Overall, Cafe Zupas is a great restaurant for healthy food.  I do wish the restaurant would adopt a new system for ordering.  You first order your soup, salad, and/or sandwich at the beginning of the line and continue moving down to the cash register, while different workers ask if there are any add ons to your order.  The problem with this system is once I get to the cash register to pay for my food, it always seems disorganized as workers are trying to sort out plates of food and figure out which order belongs to which customer.

I prefer this place to Panera since the prices are more reasonable for the portion sizes.  The choose two combo comes with bread, a chocolate covered strawberry (every order comes with this), a whole sandwich, and either a half salad or half soup for under $9.00."}
{"text":"I found this restaurant on yelp and thought we'd give it a try! Both myself and friend were very impressed from the minute we walked in! Wow FRESH food focus! LOVE LOVE LOVE how neat and organized all the food is there even their kitchen - check it out! I LOVE the photos of every item on the menu- how awesome to see what you offer! The staff was all SOOOOOOO BEYOND WONDERFUL! I would have mentioned names but literally EVERY worker here was soooo friendly and seemed to love their job!  How refreshing to see! So Thank you so much for the amazing customer service and Thank you for an amazing meal- the food was sooooooooo good! I would absolutely recommend you to all my friends and can't wait for a location in Milwaukee to open! I live right by the 84South you are opening next year!!!! I can't wait to see this company grow!!!!!"}
{"text":"Soups are OK but other than the kale and quinoa they are all cream soups!?!  The lunch meat used on sandwiches taste ok but seem to be of the mediocre quality (ie. not Boars Head or Dietz and Watson)."}
{"text":"First timer here!

Boyfriend and I came here for a lunch date around 2:30p. Really chill environment, and not a lot of people. Super clean, even the legs of the tables are shiny haha. There is outdoor seating in case you want to enjoy the \"amazing\" Vegas weather too. 

I enjoyed the 2 combo with Garden Chowder Soup and Italian Club Sandwich. It was absolutely delightful and the chocolate covered strawberry was a nice treat as well. I would order this again. 

My boyfriend had a 2 combo with Lobster Avocado Sandwich and Mushroom Bisque Soup. He says he enjoyed it but expected the broth from the soup to be a little creamier but the taste was still good. 

The staff is pleasant and helpful. They all smiled and had no problems answering any questions or helping either one of us. I'm very pleased with the service and food here and will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Ordered catering for a work event. Service was great! They were prompt and my order was ready when i arrived. We had sandwiches and salad all were very good item. Definitely come back here in the near future for catering orders and personal as well."}
{"text":"I could not decide on getting the lobster bisque or the roasted pepper lobster so I got both!   The lobster bisque was delicious, full of flavor, filled with more ingredients (think celery, lobster, etc. etc.) while the roasted pepper lobster soup had that nice flavor kick to it.  I prefer the latter.   

Walking in, you're greeted by smiling staff at the door and you walk into a large, bright, clean room.  You make your orders going down the line (memories of high school cafeteria lol).  Besides the soup, I did half a sandwich with the crab pesto.  It was pretty good.  Not many places in town where you can get a real crab sandwich.   A chocolate covered strawberry added was a nice touch.   

I also ordered a kid's meal for my daughter.  1/2 a cup of soup (she had the mushroom soup which was good) and two chicken fingers.   The weird thing is the kid's cup is like a regular plastic water cup you could buy at any store.  It didn't really work well with their plastic lids.  The first time I tried to push the lid down over the cup, it cracked the plastic cup causing a spill and I got my clothes wet.   Apparently a gentle, REALLY gentle push while supporting the upper half of the cup was necessary the 2nd time.  

I would go back if I ever have a lobster soup craving as this was  one of the best I've had in Vegas."}
{"text":"Great food, but not open on Sundays--disappointing. And when they say they close at 9pm, they really mean they lock the doors at 8:40 while I just wanted something to go, and could see all the food still out on the bar. Business lost to Panera down the street that night."}
{"text":"Place: clean and modern
Staff: polite but forgets stuff in your order.

I had:

- the Cuban pork sandwich : it was very bland, the meat has no flavor at all, same thing with the bread, the only thing you can taste in this sandwich are the spicy pickles ( not good, felt dry and old ). Just no for that sandwich.

- the strawberry harvest chicken salad:  there is almost no chicken in that salad.... I complained, they said that's how they make it...
Otherwise the salad wasn't bad if you ask for the strawberry vinaigrette on the side. 

- Caramel Crème brûlée : not bad, it is actually more like a creamy pudding, too sweet for my taste, the caramel takes over.

- Million dollar bar: horrible, not fresh at all, it tasted old, like it has been there for weeks ...

- fountain drink: the lemonade tasted like soap.

I won't go back of course and I wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"Everything I've gotten so far has been awesome! So hard to choose only two for the awesome try two deal. 

Favorites are Red Pepper Lobster Bisque and the Cherry Balsamic! 

Great customer service!"}
{"text":"This has been added to my lunch rotation, and despite it constantly being packed, it is a great place for lunch! I love the many options they have for salads. It's a nice treat that they give you a chocolate covered strawberry with each meal, and if you're still hungry after that they have pretty good creme brulee. It's not traditional (just pudding without the carmelized top) but still tasty! I also really enjoyed the different flavors of tea & beverages that they have."}
{"text":"I placed an order today for several \"try 2\" combos with sandwich and either salad or soup to go. All of the sandwiches and soups/salad were excellent. Good portions at a very reasonable price. Tiffany was very helpful and even gave me a drink while I waited for my order. I will definitely be back very soon."}
{"text":"Favorite new place to eat, the food is fresh and delicious. Great place to grab a quick and healthy bite. I hope they add wifi soon, it would be a great place to work on school work."}
{"text":"I love this place so much . My friend took me here for the first time and i was in love with how fresh everything was and how filling it is too. The staff here is really nice and so is the mangers. Their menu is super unique and i love that!  10/10 recommend for a quick bite to eat or a girls day out!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Prices are just right, and everything is natural. Not to mention: recharge zones! Will be returning soon!"}
{"text":"I had a bread sandwich with a tiny little piece of meat. When I showed it to the hostess she told me she couldn't guarantee that the majority of the meat wasn't on the part that I ate. Poor poor customer service move. Won't eat here again."}
{"text":"I came here on a Thursday at noon w my 4 year old. It was pretty busy mostly with what seemed to be business employees from close by offices. First impression, a friendly girl greeted me at the door to tell me the house favorites. A nice gesture but could be skipped in my opinion since I can read the menu myself and none of the house favs appealed to me at all. An over abundance of (friendly) staff behind the counter took my order and I received my lunch immediately. They offer samples of all of their 10+ soups which was nice. The salmon chowder tasted good but when I dug into my bowl I was disappointed to find it VERY thin w zero bits of salmon or anything other than 2 or 3 bits if corn to be found. In fact, I easily could have drank the entire bowl w a straw. Bummer for a chowder that they compare to the ones found in Washington State!

My Thai chicken salad was alright but nothing to write home about. It had very few small pieces of chicken in it, all iceburg lettuce. I did liked the fresh mango, peppers and small kick of spice it had going on. 

Signs on every table tell you To Not Save Your Table (?) and I couldn't help but feel rushed to vacate mine with several staff hovering over us scoping out our plates. If you are looking for a fast, simple meal on your lunch hour this place will do. If you want to sit and enjoy your lunch, not so much. 

Bottom line: above average customer service, average at best food."}
{"text":"The people were friendly and the soup was good. I got the chicken tortilla and it was good Flavor. He got the lobster bisque and liked it. However the sandwich was skimpy. The kids chicken was good as not overly fried but no ketchup! How do you not have a basic condiment? The chocolate strawberry is a nice treat and good selection of fountain drinks. The price is very reasonable and for a quick lunch we would go back for soup or salad only."}
{"text":"Was out of town with family looking to grab a bite before heading home.  Catching a flight and looking for something light and refreshing.  Café Zupas is one of my cousin's favorite eating spots that she wanted to introduce us to.  

The set up is cafeteria style with a variety of soups, salads and sandwiches, desserts too.  The food is made to order as you pick and choose fresh ingredients and healthy options. The calories range from 300-800.

 I had the Strawberry Harvest Chicken Salad and it did not disappoint.  One cousin had a sandwich and the other had soup.  Being family, we always sample and share each others food, it was all delicious. Loved that Café Zupas also gives you a chocolate covered strawberry as a little treat to end a great meal.  It was a nice sweet surprise.  

The prices were reasonable and affordable, from around 6-9 bucks or a little more for a two item combo.

I plan to make this a regular stop when in AZ."}
{"text":"Always great service and amazing food! My favorite place ever. Love the roasted red pepper lobster soup and the strawberry chicken salad!"}
{"text":"This started off bad and they turned it to fantastic! I ordered for my place of business (several people) and twice it got screwed up. Spoke with the manager Tatiana (hope that's right) who wanted to make sure things were right. She not only took care of fixing the problem on the second order, I ordered a third time and it was PERFECT. Not only was everything right but some extras as well. She went above and beyond and took care of the order. Today we are going to order for 12 and this is the second time since. I really appreciate the great service and they have retained a customer who goes to multiple locations. 
GREAT FOOD AND GREAT PEOPLE !!! THANK YOU."}
{"text":"Soda machines weren't working. No ice. Hardly any carbonation. The crew wouldn't own up and tell us there was a problem. They just said wait a bit and the issue will resolve itself. We saw many customers bring the issue up only to get the same feedback from the crew. Bummer because the food was decent and staff friendly enough to an extent."}
{"text":"Price wise this place beats Panera, but taste and quality wise definitely not. Zupas has a wide menu with a lot of great options, but the Panera salads are more hearty and filling. Panera has an entire bakery and cafe, but Zupas does not even have hot tea. Also, the side bread at Panera is fresh made and Zupas tasted store bought. I was not as impressed with Zupas as I expected, but the food was not bad either. Compared to Panera, I would say Panera is worth paying a bit more for. The staff at Zupas is very warm and friendly!"}
{"text":"I recently became a fan of Cafe Zupas after some colleagues introduced me to it. I like that it is a great alternative to Panera. I just wish it was open on Sundays!

I tend to go with the \"you pick two\" combo. I love the strawberry chicken salad with the strawberry and champagne dressing. I usually pair it with the cauliflower soup. I love that you get a chocolate covered strawberry as a treat! 

I tried the Cuban pork sandwich, and it was horrible. It was bland, no flavor, asked for no peppers and they were left on.  I would not reorder."}

{"text":"Cafe Zupas.....I want to like you, but I think we are done.  My lunch today was far from stellar.  Here is a basic breakdown-

1. This place now has a \"B\" from the SNHD.  I almost turned around and left based on that.  How hard is it to keep it clean and store your food properly?

2. The ordering process is a lesson in inefficiency.  Too many hands in the cookie jar.  They had eight employees behind the line and I bet they can do better with four.  First you have to tell the salad person what you want.  Then you have to tell a sandwich person what you want, and then you have to tell the soup person what you want.  After all this, you now have to repeat the order to someone organizing it.  Finally, you have to repeat your order AGAIN to the person checking you out.  Seriously?  Who thought of this?  Why on earth can't you just order everything from the first person and then pay without having to repeat it all?  It's called a POS system, use it!

3. I have been here about a dozen times.  After the second visit, I quit ordering sandwiches altogether.  They are as hard as rocks, bland, and comprised of cold cuts I can buy at any grocery store.

4. The salads are large, even for a half size, and a good deal.  Nothing off the charts, but good.  I mean, it is a salad.

5. The soups are good as well, except on a few occasions.  My tomato soup today had an aftertaste of seafood.  This may be where the \"B\" from the food inspection comes into play.  They are likely not storing their soups properly, or mixing utensils.  Be very careful of this place if you have a seafood allergy.  There is no way they can verify that occasionally things get mixed up.  Especially when you have so many people prepping orders.

6. This place is very good for kids.

That's about it.  For me, there are just too many other places in Vegas to get soup, salads, and sandwiches.  Next time I am in this shopping area I will be trying Smash Burger or the wood fired pizza place.  I'm putting Cafe Zupas on the back burner for the foreseeable future."}
{"text":"My first time here. I've seen it in passing, but found it on yelp by searching clam chowder in the area. Looked on their website and was blown away by their array of choices. So the decision was made. 

I would have given it 5 stars but since it was not a \"regular sit in\" restaurant/diner as I had thought, like Applebee's or MiMi's Cafe, because we walked in through the back and did not see the \"cafeteria\" or fast food style of ordering. 

The food was hearty and had tons of flavor. I ordered the New England clam chowder and was pleasantly surprised with the layers of flavors. I also ordered the crab sandwich, with what looked like actual pieces of crab, or just really good imitation.  I was also surprised that the meal also came with a piece of bread and a cute chocolate covered strawberry (which may have been complementary,  but not sure if it's a regular part of the meal, as we came in before it was closing so they may have been getting rid of items, but hey, it was welcomed) would even just like servings of the crab alone, it had great flavor. Very friendly, helpful,  and patient staff.

Overall great experience and will come back again to try the menu."}
{"text":"I have not had anything here I have not liked. The chicken pesto sandwich is absolutely delicious. There is also a flavored tea that rocks!!! The staff is also always very friendly."}
{"text":"Awesome place
Nice food
Good Service
Low price
Nice place to have some food when come to movie at Harkins Theaters...Loved it!!  :)"}
{"text":"Love this place.  Have many favorites here and I think the price is a good value.  I have never been unhappy with my meals here and visit for lunch maybe once a month.  The ingredients and quality of the salads, soups, and sandwiches is really high.  All the staff have been really nice."}
{"text":"They filled my bowl of soup (and everyone in my group) up halfway.  And refused to at least put more than a cups worth in...  Annoyed my entire group.  So they complained while the servers were giving the soup because we were getting so little.  The workers were firm and said that this is the maximum amount we can receive in a bowl.  Seems silly to not give another half-scoop if your customers are complaining??"}
{"text":"My mum isn't feeling well. Decided to pick her up soup. She likes the soup here and based on reviews, thought I would try.
I did like that I was greeted immediately on arriving.  The staff are very friendly and helpful. They alone deserve 5 stars. However, the food NO. 
Ordered ours to go, as it was already 930pm. 
Kids combination with a wimpy side of fruit.  (Tasted like they are from cans, not fresh) & was the size of a Chick fil a cup, 2 slender pieces of chicken strip and a kid drink 4$. 
My Sandwich& Salad combo: Ultimate grilled cheese and nuts and berries salad. 8.30$ and there was nothing amazing or ultimate about the very plain pannini. 
With my mums soup it was $20.46 and I can say, not nearly what I expected. ..Based on reviews.  I guess I was expecting something with flavor, for that price. I guess the disgusting soft chocolate covered strawberry is what is suppose to make up for it. If my mum wants more soup, I will of course get it for her. I just won't be eating here."}
{"text":"Fantastic catering experience goes above and beyond.  The gentlemen that helped us was absolutely amazing with his knowledge of the menu and was such a wonderful young man.  Our company will use them again.  Super fresh and tasty"}
{"text":"Definitely a fan of this place. After my first experience, it was nothing like what I expected and reminds me of a personalized Panera.  I enjoyed a small summer chicken salad which was a nice size portion for a small.  The sandwiches and soups look delicious and I look forward to testing them out on one of my next visits back here.  The food is not expensive and the employees are friendly!

I thoroughly enjoyed the complimentary chocolate covered strawberry!"}
{"text":"Been here before and used to enjoy this place, but the quality of the food had really gone downhill. Today we had the supposed clam chowder. It was extremely oily and watery. I wouldn't even consider it a soup. I also ordered the special lobster grilled cheese. Came out with more lettuce than it did meat in it. Also, why do I have to repeat my order twice just to check out at the very end when I ordered my food less than a minute beforehand? Just annoying. Not coming back here anymore.  Pictures attached."}
{"text":"Went during lunch rush hour and got attended quick and found a seat right away. Ordered soup, sandwiches and a salad. Lunch was great and we will definitely stop by again. 

Plus they gave chocolate covered strawberries with our meals which is a sweet dessert."}
{"text":"Good food but portion size was very small. if a full size salad is what I got I would hate to see what half size salad is I was still really hungry when I left.  So pretty much get some soup too or a sandwich if you can do the carbs"}
{"text":"Love this place  the clam chowder is super yummy!!! There sandwhichs also extra yummy always fresh and tasty never dry!!! The staff is super friendly  which I love!!!! I go here often and plan to keep going"}
{"text":"Not impressed. I bought a large Asian citrus chicken salad to go & it wasn't even dressed. I had to go back & ask for a side of dressing just so I wasn't eating a bunch of plain lettuce. The portion size was really small too. I don't even want to know how small the half size portion is. The roll that was included was so cold & unappetizing to eat. Who wants to eat cold bread? However, the best part of my meal was the chocolate covered strawberry, which I had to pick off a small piece of plastic wrap off before I could eat it. Yikes! I will not be back."}
{"text":"I am a vegetarian so i had the vegetable quinoa soup. No quinoa probably fell to the bottom of pot. A little salty but excellent flavor & plenty of other veggies. Also sea salt grinder on table if you are a salt freak along w peppercorn grinder. Nice touch. I also had nuts about berries salad a little soggy w the dressing but fresh & great flavor. I like the roll given each for soup & salad they also add a touch of love with chocolate covered strawberry. I would recommend for a nice meal"}
{"text":"Fun place...clean and busy....  I had a grilled cheese that was Amazing! The grilled cheese saved the rating otherwise it would have been much lower!  I also ordered tomato soup which was cold. My daughter had the Berry Salad which also was delicious but on the small side... and my husband ordered the pulled pork sandwich but it too was ice cold like the soup... we loved the chocolate dipped strawberry which came with each meal. NICE TOUCH! We also had two sodas from the soda fountain. The total was $36 which I felt was a little pricey to it Cafe ZUPAS on my list as a regular favorite... but definitely as a treat I would come back!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place when I walked in because it smelled heavenly, the menu had a lot of options I was interested in and everyone was so helpful and friendly. But, I was pretty disappointed with my Turkey and Avocado panini - very basic, unimpressive, pre-made with really cheap deli meat.

But, as I mentioned, the rest of the menu looked good, so I think I'll go back and give it another shot - probably sticking to vegetarian soup or salad options."}
{"text":"1st time there tonight range of choices are wonderful ... Staff was friendly ... Restaurant was clean ... When I order I told them it was my 1st time and he was very helpful in giving me suggestions and favorites as I went along the cashier was a little confused when I asked her the if they had a loyalty program after getting some help they explained it was only for catering customers :( oh well ... I will definitely go back"}
{"text":"I'll start by saying this review could probably apply to all Cafe Zupas as I assume most of it is controlled by corporate, but this is the location I've been going to for the past year. I keep coming back for one thing and one thing only: the tomato basil soup is literally like some kind of magical thing in a bowl, it's delicious. The rest of the food is super fresh and pretty good, but expensive, small-portioned and nothing special.

I have 3 issues with this place: 1) the ordering process makes no sense. You start on the left telling person A what you want, combos, ingredients, and everything. But NOT the soup. That's saved for person B, who's one job is to pour your soup. Then you see person C at the cashier and they have no idea what you've ordered, so they then ask you to repeat everything you've requested from Person A and B. Oh no not just the meal number or type of combo...ev.er.y.thing. 2) they use a tablespoon sized scoop for all salad toppings and work very diligently to ensure you get not a crumb more than an even tablespoon. Kind of like how you measure flour with the back of a knife when you're baking. So they scoop up the cheese, shake the spoon until most of it falls out, and then give you what little remains. It's actually kind of funny to watch. 3) the packaging also makes no sense. Giant plastic, paper and cardboard containers for every individual item in the meal- we practically fill up our kitchen trash can after a meal for 2 people. So terribly wasteful."}
{"text":"My fave place for healthy and delish salads and soups. I actually haven't tried their sandwiches yet but I heard they are good. Friendly service and always very fast. If you can avoid coming around noon since it's packed during the peak of lunch and hard to find parking. This is my fave place to go once a week :)"}
{"text":"Some of my favorite sandwiches and soups in the city. Their hot sandwiches have always been ridiculously good no matter what I try. I've also had many of their soups and love every one. I've always had friendly and fast service as well."}
{"text":"Love this place, always come here when in town from calif once a month.  Love the flavored waters and soups but today asked for chicken enchilada soup and got chicken tortilla.  Tried to tell kid but he said that was it...it wasn't.  Will try again though...but will try another soup.  And ask for bread to be warm not ice cold."}
{"text":"WOW- I am a new fan!! Not a big fan of Soup/Salad places, but after trying Zupa's my mind changed!!  Roasted pepper and lobster soup and crab salad sandwich both so good!  My husband had italian sandwich and cream of mushroom soup! We will be back and I can't wait to pick up soup for a quick dinner to go!"}
{"text":"The food was good, and I'll chat about that in a second, but the entire setup for taking and receiving the order is a disaster and I'd like to explain that.

I counted 15 employees working however the configuration is so poorly conceived its almost like someone without restaurant experience came up with it.

When we did get to the first person (of many you deal with to place a simple order), she asked if we had sandwiches, which we did and told her what we wanted. She asked if we wanted it on wheat bread, which was confusing because it says on the menu Ancient Grains Ciabatta or Italian Ciabatta, nothing about wheat. I told her I wanted the Italian Ciabatta. Apparently, the Ancient Grains is wheat, not sure why they are pushing that or not using the same name on the menu. So, every single person dealing with this first person probably has this same level of confusion adding to delays and unnecessary questions (and probably a selection not even what is desired).

Then we wanted soup, now we must deal with another person, telling them we want soup. It became obvious that the order was not together as we were watching how they assemble things, they basically put random sandwiches on a counter behind them as they finish, no tickets or anything, and then the soup just gets placed on the counter in front of you, in the order that they are placed.

You then get to the end, and they ask you what you had. So, you must re-explain to them what you have (and hopefully you have the correct bread in your brain, because they just look at the sandwiches and try and match whatever you tell them, no idea how they determine which sandwich is yours if you customize it in anyway). They try and retrieve all the pieces for your entire order (in our case 4 sandwiches and soups). 

Keep in mind, the hot sandwiches and hot soup are sitting without any heat, getting cold.

They couldn't find one of the sandwiches we ordered, so no idea if they forgot it, someone else grabbed the wrong sandwich, or what, but nobody seemed to care. The manager said he would get it made. We took our trays and found a seat (which are so cramped, you cannot move a chair without bumping into another diner). Waited, nothing. We went back up told then, they said they were making it. Another 5 minutes, went up there, manager didn't tell us he would bring it out, apologize, or anything. Kept waiting and waiting. Finally got our missing sandwich (after going up asking 4X!) Also, you get bread and a chocolate dipped strawberry, but since they forgot the sandwich they never gave us that for the last sandwich. Didn't care at that point.

We started eating regardless of the missing sandwich and sandwich and soups were cold.

I was just baffled. It is the stupidest system I have ever seen. I thought about Schottky's or Panera. You order, talking to one person, get a number, and either a number is called, or it is brought out to you. Not sure what problem Zupa's is thinking they are solving is solving, but it is a joke, easily the worst system I have ever seen in a restaurant.

Now the food, aside from it being cold, was good. But given it took almost 30 minutes from the time I walked in until I got the order (not counting the extra time for the missing order), and it was maybe 10 people in front of me, a ton of confusion, and frustration, not sure I will ever go back."}
{"text":"I would give this place 5 stars if it was based solely on how tasty the food is! I come here very frequently because I seriously can't get enough of the food but some of the employees are in such a rush to get you down the line, they don't even smile or say hello. They have also messed up my salads multiple times by not checking what is written on the top of the box (usually saying no onions and they put onion on). Overall love the food, and some of the employees are nice, just needs a little more upbeat customer service."}
{"text":"First time coming to check this place out. Staff is extremely friendly and helpful. The  food is amazing and so fresh! Nice restaurant to go and enjoy nice lunch or dinner. Bonus** They even do soup samples so you don't get something you don't like. Amazing!"}
{"text":"Well I would say negative one star but I don't have that option. Thought I would try the Zupas by my house tonight (Gilbert Road location). They have been open a while but I thought I'd wait until they worked the kinks out. Got to the door and the line was to the door, not many full tables so we waited 25 minutes in line. Got to the front and ordered two sandwiches to go. The oldest crew member there apologized saying they were doing a lot of training tonight. That would not be a problem except while we waited the same crew member told the kid making the grilled sandwiches to wipe  down the sandwich bar. The kid picked up a filthy rag from behind the panini grill and proceeded to wipe down the sandwich bar where they make your sandwich. Then he wiped the butcher block that he makes the toasted sandwiches on, and then took a sandwich hot off the grill and put it in the butcher block to cut it in half. About this time I was trying to figure out how I could let one of the older crew members know about what happened, without alerting all of the other people in line with me. One minute later the older crew member turned around and told the kid to wipe down the front of the area he was working at. The kids took the same filthy rag and wiped down the front of his counter down the legs, along where the trash can is stored and to top it off wiped the butcher block again. That was enough for my daughter and I, we walked out. 

I would suggest to the trainers that you might want to train on the correct way to clean unless you want to end up like Chipotle!"}
{"text":"Omg not somewhere I would eat again. The quality makes the nose hairs in my nose stand up. The tomato soup made me legit wanna gag. But the workers were pretty nice, especially one girl named Bella. If they edited the menu I would give it another shot. Still not as bad as some other summerlin businesses: ex acai to the t"}
{"text":"i used to be a panera bread regular until i found this place through a coworker.  we were greeted at the door and were asked if we had been here before.  the greeter explains their system and offers recommendations.  there are a lot of people making your order so the line moves very fast. i was very overwhelmed at their huge menu the first time i went, but after that it was much easier to decide.  love the beverage bar because i am an iced teaholic and i can add many different flavors to my tea.  my faves:  soup = wisconsin cauliflower, salad:  summer chicken, sandwich: pesto chicken although i felt they were skimpy on the inside ingredients of the sandwich.  the salad and soup portions are huge. once i splurged and had a brownie.  it was choco-heaven.  my eyes are sensitive to light and i felt it was extremely bright inside with too many windows,  the chocolate dipped strawberry is the perfect ending to the meal."}
{"text":"Its a pretty decent place. It was packed and hard to find a seat. Probably because of the grand opening.  It was a long line but it goes really fast once you get up there. I personally disliked the ordering system. They have quite a few people at the ordering station. We were asked several times to repete our order by a few people. Other than that...its pretty good. Good food. Clean atmosphere. Friendly people. I will definately conciser going back."}
{"text":"Great place. Really good food at a reasonable price and I walk out feeling like I ate something healthy! Can't hate that!"}
{"text":"Went to cafe zupas for the first time with colleges and was excited ! You walk into a well decorated and laid out Resteraunt with awesome amenities like a \"charge bar\" where you can charge your phones/tablets , drink station and comfortable bright seating. The fresh produce displayed on all the TVs makes you feel like farm fresh produce is right in the back of house still in the ground ready for picking! 

Now comes the ordering! You walk up to the first station, I ask a simple question...\"do you have gluten free bread?\" Answer=no! 
Strike one.. This franchise should know many people need gluten free options. Even other delis offer gluten free bread. Ok, I get a salad. I ask if they have any gluten free dressing... \"Oil and vinegar only!\"  Depressing. I ordered a Asian chicken salad (hold the chicken) and they add chicken anyway. I press i feeling disappointed but still hopeful. I figure my stomach will hurt a little from the gluten in the salad dressing but I'll be ok. I go to pay and was surprise I received a luscious chocolate covered strawberry with my meal.

I sit down and taste the salad... Drum roll please!!!!! ..... Boom! Amazing! Packed full of flavor! It was worth the tummy risk! Strawberry was delectable and the atmosphere welcoming! 

I feel like the mistakes made as well as lack of options for those who have allergies is not good. They need to up the game a bit. But it was good. I'd return!"}
{"text":"I just went there and I was very happy with my  salad and the lobster soup it was very good the soup was tasty and the bread was very good also I got the strawberry salad and I loved it I also liked the customer service that I received all the workers were very nice and the price I think are very reasonable. I highly recommend this place to any one."}
{"text":"Wow absolute terrible customer service, I came here for the first time with my mom instead of going to Egg works because we wanted something different. But I can honestly say that I would of preferred Egg works. It was my first time & I had no idea how the menu worked & that seemed to upset each and every worker here except for I believe his name was Tyler. Great job on being patient and having a pleasant smile despite the fact that I asked 101 questions.. First and last time here. What makes this worst is the feeling of not even wanting to sit down and enjoy your food because of how your first interaction was handled. And as I'm still sitting here Jessica your \"manager\" is staring at us rolling her eyes. Here's a tip Jessica lead by example, don't talk about customers while they are still here at least give me that respect. This is your job if you are that unhappy then you should try finding a better job that suites your poor customer service. You represent this company by being the manager and today you failed at that. I understand bad shifts and bad days but I will never understand someone being upset by people not knowing how something works or asking questions."}
{"text":"Came here like at least 100 times but this visit is going be the last. They mixed up our order and my wife brought me home the sandwich that labeled pesto but it's a crab bacon. I thought it might be a honest mistake and went to exchange but there was no acknowledgement of mistake or anything. They just said they are gonna make me one and just handed one  after 20 mins."}
{"text":"Always nice to get healthy food as a fast food 
I like that they offered you 3 options and not only 1-2 
I like the portions always getting full there 
Very big place so you don't eat in each other plate 
They have a big stuff team so everything moving fast"}
{"text":"Most likely will not go back. Actually I won't be going back. Workers were very friendly but the amount of money I spent vs the amount of food I received very very very pathetic. Paradise Bakery here I come."}
{"text":"What a happy surprise!  This is not your typical soup/salad/sandwich place. I stumbled upon it driving by looking for a place to eat that was healthy and not inside the mall. I pulled up, did a quick online search, saw 4 stars and thought good enough.  My expectations were not high, so perhaps that helped, but when I took that first bite of mushroom bisque, it immediately soothed my soul and put a smile on my face.  I paired it with a Maui Chicken salad and my taste buds were dancing!!  They top off your meal with a chocolate dipped strawberry!  Oh yum!!!!!   You simply must try!  There are so many menu options, I'm certain everyone can find something they like."}
{"text":"Love zupas...the mushroom bisque is my all time favorite..my only complaint is that their portions have gotten smaller since they first opened..progressively, prices have risen, and less chocolate on their strawberries.  Everyone is very friendly though, AND THEIR FOOD IS GREAT.."}
{"text":"WORST service ever! I felt patronized as I was ordering my food, and then they got it wrong... Then as I went to use a coupon and there was big stipulation in using it, so simple, it's a coupon! Ended up not getting to use them I just didn't want the argument about it. Then as my friend, Who is ordering separately, was trying to use the same coupon, and the manager I assume, said an extremely snide comment to my friend, I said \"there's no need for snide comments\" well he got mad I said something and decided to kick me out of the store. I was in no way yelling or making a fuss. He made the store look very bad by kicking somebody out when I was walking right out anyways. And also he put his hands on me not in a physical hurtful way, but you are not supposed to touch people especially customers, again I was walking right out there was no need for touching.  Weirdest experience at a \"restaurant\" I've ever had!"}
{"text":"I've only been able to order to-go from here a handful of times, so I will have to hold out on the 5th star until I take the time to dine-in and get the full experience; but I believe it is looking very good for me to eventually edit this review and give it the 5th star it possibly deserves. 

It is a new location, so it has been in pristine condition for each of my visits. The food has been delicious for what it is: fast-casual soup, salads, and sandwiches. The staff has been polite and courteous with each visit and the food has been correct with each order (typically my order ends up being for 3-5 people when I make a food run for our office so this is a somewhat important issue for me).

Nice touches that I appreciate include the flavor syrups for the fountain drinks and the free sample cups for the soups (I hope these won't get abused and taken away as I love adding a pump of vanilla to my root beer and sampling a new soup with each visit since they have so many)."}
{"text":"Went for the pesto chicken sandwich today. It was good. Not a fan of the almonds in it though, but you can't do without them on this sandwich. I honestly think the best thing on their menu is the creme brulees. I had the mixed berry and caramel on two separate occasions and they were to die for. The sandwiches are nothing special. I came back and had another crab avocado sandwich and it was okay. I think I liked it so much the first time because it was new.I wouldn't go out of my way to recommend a sandwich here, because they're nothing spectacular. However, they ARE tasty and the atmosphere of this place is cool. I'll come back I'm sure."}
{"text":"Love this place, food is great area is clean. Only draw back is that it gets packed. Once ordered you're in and out. Recommended for anyone who likes soups."}
{"text":"The first time I walked into cafe zupas I thought the whole process was very interesting. Mostly people in their 20s worked there and they are very fast.
The food there is absolutely amazing and has really reasonable prices.
I would definitely recommend coming here."}
{"text":"The dining room was filthy. The back half was piled with dirty plates and trays. Tanisha spent a long time screwing around with a coworker who came in on their day off. It took 15 minutes to go through the line and pay even though there were only three people ahead of me. The food was still good, but they did not give me the bread that comes with the salad. One of the girls touched her hat, face, hair , and glasses and then proceeded to make my sandwich without washing her hands. Not worth the money with this kind of service. I come in here pretty often, but I'm gonna stop for a while."}
{"text":"No comparison to Panera!!!! Salad is a bowl of lettuce and hardly any toppings! The best part of my meal was the oyster crackers!!!"}
{"text":"Super tasty! Got a mango salad and a turkey sandwich. Fresh greens and soft bread! The complimentary chocolate covered strawberries were amazing and huge. Not a fan of the creme brûlée (aka pudding). Unique drink selection as well. Oh and the customer service was great as well."}
{"text":"Good food but lack coordination in fullfilling orders correctly. A bit strange being met by a hostess that did not offer me a menu and just told my friend and me to get in line. Solid soups and nice tasting sandwiches."}
{"text":"I will first start by saying that I normally do not judge employees very harshly. With that being said, the food quality is pretty good. I was impressed by the wide variety of food that Cafe Zupas offers and I was relatively satisfied with my food. However, my partner did not have the same experience. We asked for no tomatoes, peppers, or cheese on our salad and it was made incorrectly along with her sandwich, despite us being the only customers in line. The staff was lukewarm and was cleaning when we came in. I understand how food service works, I'm a young adult and I've worked in the industry before. However, the employees we're preoccupied with cleaning, the two \"supervisors or managers\" managed the employees, yet neglected to act as inviting members of Zupas. The employees were not very friendly and my girlfriends meal was not up to par. I understand that food may not always be exactly as we expect, but there is no excuse for the level of service we received. We weren't even checked on during our meal. It would require a longtime before I consider trying this location again. Employees continued chatting and socializing before the open sign was even turned off. Disappointed to receive this level of service and I've worked for restaurants before."}
{"text":"I love going to cafe zupas for a light lunch.  They have an amazing salad selection, but the soup and sandwich variety is limited.  Its good food at good prices.  They only thing I dislike about this location is that I always have to take my food to go because the dining room is always so full!  I love that they let you make your own flavored drinks, and the bread and chocolate  covered strawberry that comes with your meal is a nice treat."}
{"text":"Five stars for the fresh, consistently delicious food, swift cheerful service and cheery decor with plenty of indoor and outdoor seating. Minus two stars for the always excessively loud music requiring the staff and I to shout at each other to be heard. So loud I can't sit in the restaurant and chat with my husband during a meal. Why drive me away? Make it pleasant to stay and I'll go back to the counter for dessert."}
{"text":"Tried this place out tonight. Not too bad I had a quinoa protein bowl. The pork was very rich in flavor. I would recommend others to try it. Kinda hippie for me."}
{"text":"Strawberry harvest salad is amazing! I recommend it to everyone! They are typically pretty busy but it is worth the wait! The mango salad is good too. Always comes with a chocolate covered strawberry!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Great food. I am a germaphobe......the cashier touched my strawberries with the same cloves she touched the register with. I didn't eat them lol. BUT I do love the food! And the staff at this location was super friendly!"}
{"text":"Disappointing they offer no gluten free options. Most places today, especially health conscious restaurants, offer a few salad dressings etc. when I asked they replied \"we are an open kitchen and can't Guarantee anything\". I asked what the ingredients were and I got a blank stare and \"this one might be ok but we really don't have anything to offer you\". Too bad.  Needless to say we left."}
{"text":"Food was good but seriously this location had 1 bathroom for men that locked. So individual stall. So crazy in a place this big would have limited bathroom space.  Full capacity and men we're waiting 10-15 min to get into the bathroom"}
{"text":"Great food but when we asked for an ingredient list for allergic review you would think we were speaking another language. Nice gal behind the counter just smiled and said it's an open kitchen.   So are many other restaurants and guess what they have an ingredient list for review.  Pitta jungle here we come."}
{"text":"Obsessed with this place! Everything is so yummy! My favorite is the spinach and quinoa salad!"}
{"text":"My co-workers and I decided to have lunch here at Zupas.  I had the chipotle chicken salad it comes with bread. It was delicious, and I received a  chocolate covered strawberry for dessert. I like how the menu is broken down.  You can go for a signature salad or a make up your own. There's a lot of sandwiches,  and soups to try. They'll even let you sample the soup. All the food is fresh! The staff were very friendly and helpful. I always love coming here."}
{"text":"Perfect for lunch or dinner. Affordable healthy and fresh selections! The best part is the complimentary chocolate covered strawberry. It's a great way to make their customers feel special. I enjoyed my experience. Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I thought this place was pretty good. I walked in around 12:30pm on a Tuesday and it was slammed, however. I mean the line was almost out the door. Clearly a popular lunch spot. It was busy but the line moved very quickly and was super fluid. 

The combos seem to be where it's at. I ordered the Thai Mango Chicken Salad with the Tuscan White Bean soup. It was fulfilling and tasty! I couldn't have asked for a better meal. A little bonus, is that the meals come with a chocolate covered strawberry! Nice touch. 

The ambiance felt very much like a cafeteria or even like a food court in a mall. Really busy, but wasn't too distracting. 

I am not vegan, but have friends that are... I figured this would be a great place to take them because it's soups and salads... Unfortunately they don't have vegan options at this time!"}
{"text":"Incredible selection of soup, salad and sandwiches. My second visit here and its been pleasant so far. When I arrived, there was someone greeting all the customers at the door asking if they needed help choosing from the menu. So with that being said, this restaurant was welcoming. I ordered the tasty honey bacon club which was delicious.  Every meal comes with a complimentary chocolate covered strawberry, but because I have a sweet tooth I decided to order more. A dollar per strawberry is a bit overpriced but it was indeed amazing."}
{"text":"This is now my favorite sandwhich place!!!! So many choices with fresh ingredients. 

Here's how it works: be prepared to wait in line if you come during peak eating times. It's $7.99 for your choice of two items (sandwhich, soup or salad). Its kind of like a subway line where you can see everything made in front of you. You order your sandwhich or salad with the first person in the line. And you just move down the line. And you order your soup from the people standing in front of the soups. There are add ins to the soup like bacon, cheese or croutons for an additional charge. By the time you get to the cashier, your entire order is ready. They also have syrups to add flavor to your drinks. 

My absolute favorites are the BBQ pulled pork sandwhich with clam chowder. The sandwhiches are huge and packed with flavor. And the clam chowder is thick and chunky. The blueberry maple salad was a refreshing alternative to clam chowder on a hot day. The dressing they used was light and added to the fresh blueberries and maple chunks in the salad. 

I look forward to trying everything on the menu!!!"}
{"text":"This place is perfect for lunch, great selections of soup, salads, and sandwiches, They also offer an option of making your own salad which i love. A combo will cost around $8-$10 and trust me the portions are big so its more than enough. Every order comes with a complimentary chocolate cover strawberry and a slice a bread. I am usually a Souplantation/Sweet Tomatoes person but Zupas definitely has more variety"}
{"text":"I used to come at least twice a week. 
It's the fourth time I see this happening so Enough is enough.
Salads and desserts are great but portion are ridiculous.
I always pay attention how they prepare your food. Every time I go at cafe zip as on rainbow I noticed portion served is less and less but price hasn't changed beside zupas charging you for drinks or extra \"salad topping\" I did not even order.

Last experience was Friday 08/04/17
Ordered a \"make your own salad\", it took the guy who picked my green about 2 minutes before he was able to figure out the amount of green he will give me. Then he removes 4 leaves out of my plate when the portion was already small.
Then on my 5 toppings, the woman did the same thing. Shake out as much as possible the mini spoon so nothing was left RIDICULOUSLY GREEDY

I do not mind paying extra, I never complain about it
But las Friday was like \"really?

I like Zupas but I won't go there again. TOO greedy, staff is unprofessional 
Place could be fancy but ZUPAS on rainbow make sure quality and what clients are paying for is given"}
{"text":"Food is yummy. Lobster Bisque is my favorite. Sandwiches are awesome  any and all of them. Large portions. The desserts top things off with their prettiness without too much sweetness."}
{"text":"Great food, awesome variety, chocolate covered cookies! Great for catering department lunch. Picked up food, and added one box lunch last minute and they were great! No fuss :-)
Update, still great service! They were busy but still go out of their way to please :-)"}
{"text":"I really liked this place. It was my first time here. The place is clean and everyone was nice.. The bread was soft and tasted great! It has a bit of a cafeteria feel but thats ok. Its quick and fresh."}
{"text":"First time going and I was disappointed. It reminded me of a cafeteria. As most people as questions when you go somewhere or the first. I approached a gentlemen with menus. I asked, \"what would you recommend?\" When he started talking it was almost a script. He talked over me and when I asked a question. He did not listen to it. It just kept going down the menu. I got the Pulled Pork Sandwich an I was NOT impressed. It was gross. The meat wa dry and flavorless and they barely put any BBQ sauce on it. The cabbage was just raw and tasteless. As it was my first time being here I did not know that you get a strawberry wen you get food. The lady behind me asked if I didn't like them and then commented on how I should get one for free. I felt very rushed and did not leave happy. I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Everyone at the counter was extremely friendly, and gave good suggestions. I had the Honey Bacon Ham sandwich, and the clam chowder.

The sandwich was ok, but nothing about which to write home.

The chowder, however, was a different story. Peppery, creamy, rich, with a deep smoky flavor; it may be the best thing I've ever eaten. Seriously, if there was only one bowl of it left on Earth, and Sofia Vergara told me she would have sex with me in exchange for it, I'd tell her to piss off. I'm sitting here, staring at the last droplets in my bowl, wondering if the other dinners would notice if I just stuck my face in the bowl and started licking. I would sell a testicle for more of this. Fortunately, they take amex, so it won't come to that, yet. I never understood addiction until today. I now know what it is like to have a substance consume all of my thoughts."}
{"text":"The food is always amazing (I highly recommend the mushroom bisque) and the staff is so nice and friendly."}
{"text":"loved the service, the food, and the prices.  I got the combo and they even add a chocolate covered strawberry.  I will be here at least once a week."}
{"text":"Omg! This place is amazing. i love that there is an option to choose from. Between a whole sandwich and half of a soup or salad. First time here and I wish there was one back home. Very cheap and affordable. I love that you get a chocolate covered strawberry with your meal."}
{"text":"We are regulars and we have always enjoyed a delicious meal when we go there. I love the ability to choose whatever I want to be put on my salad and the chocolate covered strawberry is a nice touch. Soups and sandwiches are always good and tasty. Always a nice clean friendly atmosphere. Great food at a great price, Thank You!!!"}
{"text":"Perfect place to go to right after the gym. This place reminds me of Panera but way better.

All they have on their menu is soups, salads, sandwiches & few desserts. All look really delicious and somewhat on the healthier side. If you wanted you can choose to get a full sandwich w/ soup, sandwich w/ salad, or salad w/ soup for about $8. Which is a pretty darn good deal.

I opted for the crab avocado panini with roasted red pepper lobster bisque. I love lobster & I love crab so I was one happy little girl! The meal was the perfect portion. The lobster bisque was delicious and I couldn't get enough of it. They even throw in a complementary chocolate covered strawberry! I mean, who does that!?

Pretty impressed with this place. Can't wait to return and try the salads, they looked really good."}
{"text":"This was my second time coming to this location. Loved the food but my whole meal and experience was destroyed when I ordered my child's food from Bryce. She needs a lesson in customer service. No eye contact except to argue with me about what I wanted, no smile, and her argument was unnecessary. I don't want the 2nd item of the kids meal because my kid won't eat it and I don't want to waste food. My prerogative as a customer if I don't want to have it. Never once did I ask for a price change or discount. So the need to get her sidekick on me later on down the line was unnecessary. So she sent her to argue with me again? And when she walked away, even after I said \"I understand that, thank you\" she still gave me an eye roll. Why did I deserve this? Jonathan at the door was amazing at greeting us and making us feel welcomed then all ruined by something unnecessary."}
{"text":"tldr

I've been here a couple times but had a bad experience at the other location.
Usually always get the 2 combo but it's a shame they don't have light salad dressing.

Got:
-2 combo; California protein cobb salad and turkey bacon avocado panini sandwich: salad was nice and light. Sandwich was good"}
{"text":"Great food and fast service. All the servers are incredibly helpful and always happy. My favorite thing is the lobster bisque soup (mushrooms bisque is a runner up). If you are in the mood for something on a cold day or something to just warm the soul I would highly suggest it. All the sandwiches are good but the salads get a bit old and they can sometimes run out of things that are suppose to go in your salad. For instance I ordered the chicken chop salad but they ran out of tomatoes. What is a salad without tomatoes?! nonetheless it was still good. If you don't mind a packed cafe restaurant with a lot of hustle and bustle but good food highly recommend this place. Oh and did I mention affordability; my meals are always under $15 and it is a very filling hearty meal. Usually take home leftovers! Only suggestion is that they are quicker at clearing off and cleaning tables. Since this place does get busy sometimes it s hard to find a table that has been cleaned."}
{"text":"I would give itv1.5 if I could, but the service was pleasant. We finally tried Zupas! My salad was ok, not fantastic and not filling either. The soups were disappointing, don't truths cauliflower it's bland and pasty:(. My biggest complaint is that the portions are tiny!! Significantly smaller than Paradise Bakery, by way of comparison. We left hungry :(. The prices were pretty high, especially considering the portion sizes. And the crime brûlée? It was basically pudding, not really brûlée. Save yourself the time (long lines which I don't get?) and money and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Greatly impressed!

I was surprised, I finally caved and visited here for the first time today...after seeing it for over two years. I was thinking it would just be another Panera/Paradise, however the flavors in this place are very good! 

I had a sandwich and the nut berry salad...I'm tempted to get a second portion of the salad. It was a nice touch getting the chocolate covered strawberry too.

Clean, friendly staff, and free wifi. I'm definitely going to put this place into my regular lunch rotation.

Thanks!"}
{"text":"I like that this place is a quick salad, soup, and sandwich place. Other places advertise that they're pretty quick, however this place rarely has me waiting even when it is packed. (Especially packed during lunch, but don't worry, there are plenty of seats!)

The selection of soups is pretty diverse (I love the Garden Chowder!) and even the half portions that I get with my sandwich are more than enough when I'm hungry. The hardest decision you make is which pair you would like to get (soup and salad? Salad and a sandwich? Etc). 

The sweetest thing is that with every soup you get a roll of bread to dip, and with every order you get a chocolate dipped strawberry that is a perfect treat to end your meal! But if you'd like more, there is a variety of desserts you can choose from that are displayed before you pay!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing! I'm a very picky eater, so I usually eat plain foods. But the combinations they had were very delicious. I got the strawberry salad - they were out of the champagne dressing it usually comes with so I got the raspberry dressing instead (still tastes great, but I would like to go back to taste the original dressing). I also got the Italian sandwich, that wasn't anything special. All meals come with a piece of bread and a chocolate strawberry. Reminds me of an upgraded Panera Bread."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place but every time I come in I have the same problems. What I like: the soup selection is what I come for. What I don't like: the container they serve in is awful if you are having a salad. They serve it in a three compartment to go container. Get some big bowls please. Also you must remember what you ordered because you will be asked twice. Once by a person getting it together at the end of the line and again by the cashier. And finally the chocolate dipped strawberry that is a big part of their business because they do advertise it is never ready. Each of the three times I have been here it's been the same. Last time I was asked if I wanted the strawberry because she hey had to make more. Then I was given a tiny strawberry without the chocolate being hardened so it was all over the bag which they stuff into the container on top of your salad. I have never seen an actual manager in the place which is part of the reason things don't go great. 
Please please fix these things your business is such a great niche in Az we need you!"}
{"text":"Holy mother of salad goodness...I have finally found a replacement for the sadly now-closed Market Bistro. The sandwiches are interesting and have amazingly soft bread. The salads are fresh and generously portioned with dressings that are tasteful. The desserts are also yummy. This place is my new favorite and go-to at least once per week. And for $8 that gives you a FULL sandwich and salad (which you can easily split) - paradise bakery must be freaking out!"}
{"text":"This place is great for people on a low sodium diet or any other health conscious diet. I looked up the nutrition info before going and was able to build my own salad that had under 200 mgs of salt for my lunch. 

My sister is a vegetarian and she loved the sandwich that they had available for her. She's also excited to try a quinoa bowl next time she is there, without the meat. 

I tried their tomato basil soup (it's so cool that they give you samples!) and loved it. Wish they would let me get it in a kids size though (since that would have less sodium), but they only let you do the kids choose 2 and creating a salad isn't allowed. That's my one complaint. Makes it difficult for people like me who need smaller sizes for health reasons. 

My mom got their tortilla chicken soup (can't remember exact name) and loved it! We also all loved that it came with a chocolate covered strawberry! One of these days I'm going to try their other desserts, they look wonderful!"}
{"text":"Food are pretty good here. Staffs are nice. Loved their soup and salad. They are pretty good. I come here pretty often. However, I am not sure if it is just me or what, every time I come here, the portion just gets smaller and smaller? And the honey bacon club, just flat. The bacon is just on half strip on one side of the club. Really? The chicken for my asian citrus salad is not so fresh today I think, tasted kind of funny. I might start consider another option for salad bar like Sweet Tomato. Not sure how to feel about this."}
{"text":"I've been eagerly waiting the opening of this new Cafe Zupas location on the Westside. We're a bit spoiled here in Vegas with all these great places having multiple locations at every corner of the valley - I wanted to shave off 10 minutes of driving to their Lake Mead location. 

With every new restaurant opening, there are sure to be some growing pains (as other reviewers have pointed out), but I think this location still has the same great service, affordable/high quality food options, and friendly atmosphere of other locations I've been to. I get what I always get at other locations - mushroom bisque and nuts about berries salad, and my husband picks up the delicious honey cilantro carnitas with whatever soup looks good that day. My husband picked up some food for me to go the other day and he said the place was packed and even sent me a picture of the line, so be aware if going during lunch hours. He said the line still went by rather quickly and my food was still hot and neatly packaged upon arrival. I really appreciated that the salad dressing was put on the side so my greens weren't soggy. I'll be coming here a lot as part of my commitment to trying to eat healthier, but we'll see how long that holds up this year."}
{"text":"Not my favorite place but it is a fast place to eat if you are shopping around that area. My sandwhich was good but my soup was literally just broth with a few pieces of chicken. I think the girl gave me what was at the bottom of the pot. If I come back I'll be sure to choose a different soup. I did like that they gave you a chocolate covered strawberry as a mini dessert after your meal."}
{"text":"I should start by saying I am not a huge fan of sandwich and soup places and can be a little on the judgey side as I usually hold them to a pretty high standard.   I have been to this location twice at the request of a friend wanting to go.  The restaurant itself is very clean, bright in nature and pretty modern.  They have a charging station so you can bring your laptop in and work while you enjoy a meal.  The soda station they have is also unique as they have different syrups located right next to the machine.  One thing  I really enjoyed was they had saltine crackers.  A weird thing to mention, I know, but for some reason I enjoy a restaurant that has saltine crackers. no rhyme or reason to my madness.  

As for the sandwiches: I first tried a Cuban sandwich there and did not enjoy it.   Just not a lot of flavor very little pickle and mustard.  The soup I had was good but average.  I believe it was the Wisconsin cheddar one.   After my first experience I was not going to give it another try but my friend convinced me.  The second sandwich I had was much better and bumped it up to three stars for me.  It was the Honey Cilantro Carnitas sandwich.  They carnitas were pretty juicy and the slaw on top had a good cilantro flavor.  I could taste the sweetness of the Honey and it was a very welcomed addition. 

A fun thing you get with every meal is a chocolate covered strawberry."}
{"text":"Sadly, I LOVE their salads but this warrants a 2 based on missing ingredients. The workers need to slow down and focus on each order. The last two times I have gotten takeout the salads were missing ingredients. The first time it was the Kale and Quinoa. I had to remind the prep girl to put the quinoa on the salad at the end. This time, again I ordered two Kale and Quinoa salads to go......Both salads are missing the cheese. Very annoying when that is a key flavor to the salad. They try and get you to move through the line so you don't see them making the salads. I arrive at work and am entirely disappointed. Sadly I will begin looking for a new salad joint. Bummer"}
{"text":"I am a big fan of CZ. I don't like this particular location though. I know that they just opened but I am not impressed. I am from Utah and the one up there is on point. The service here is not very good. They skimp on the ingredients and its not very fresh. I am hoping to come back in a few weeks and give this location another shot. At the current time I can only justify a 2 star rating."}
{"text":"I am basing this review solely on the Cauliflower Soup. Holy Heaven in a cup. We had Zupas cater lunch at the office, so I can't speak to the actual restaurant. But man, I wish I had a bucket of that soup."}
{"text":"Went here on vacation this weekend. The place was clean and the food was excellent and fresh. The staff was also very friendly. I wish there was one of these near me. Great for a quick and healthy bite."}
{"text":"Went in because Chili's had a long wait, so I thought I'd check it out.  Should have turned around and left immediately.  Extremely bright as you enter.  Went through line and ordered soup and sandwich.  Get to pick up station, my sandwich was not made, then made wrong.  Took wrong sandwich to counter they told me to hold on to it and they'd make a new one.  Long story short ate the small sandwich and went to Chili's for a burger.

Only reason they get one star is because the place was clean."}
{"text":"This is one of my wifes and I favorite places to eat. Wonderful selection of Soup, salad and sandwiches. They even have Italian syrups for making your own Italian sodas, and for only 1.50, they are cheaper than most peoples regular drinks. They have a new featured \"world tour\" soup every couple of weeks, where you can get a \"passport\" stamped to earn free food and drinks and ultimately a grand prize. The chocolate covered strawberry at the end is a nice touch. And the service is very friendly, you can tell management has put it as a priority. 

My Favorite Combo: Pulled BBQ Pork Sandwich and BBQ Chicken Salad"}
{"text":"This place is excellent. The chicken enchilada chili is to die for. The strawberry chicken salad is incredible. The lobster bisque is BOMB. Everything is spot on and the place is clean, atmosphere is great. No complaints."}
{"text":"I had always wanted to check out Cafe Zupas. When I lived on the other side of town, just off of Eastern, I would end up going to either Pin Kaow, BJ's Brewhouse, Beach Hut Subs, Griddlecakes, Smashburger, or Taco Y Taco. It just had the bad luck of being in the same area as ALL of these other dining establishments.

So when I saw that they opened one just up the street from the new house, I knew I was definitely going to check it out! Sure enough, just the other day I experienced Cafe Zupas for the first time and here is what I took away from it...

Pros-
-Fair prices for what you get. For $8.79, you get a choice of 2 out of these 3:Sandwhich, Soup, or Salad.
-Employees were very nice and friendly. They explained the whole process and answered the questions we had.
-Sandwiches are not huge, but combined with the soup, was quite filling. My Italian Club was very tasty, but that Chili Enchilada soup was incredible! I want a large serving of that next time!
-The restaurant is new so it was, of course, very shiny and clean.
-Chocolate covered strawberry with each meal is a nice little touch....and yummy...I loooove strawberries!

Cons-
-It was 45 degrees out and raining when we dined here and they were blasting the A/C. Ummmm, I am freaking shivering, can you please kill the A/C while I eat?? I am sure that will be awesome in July, but in the first week of January? I think not.
-As others have stated, when you first walk through the door, you walk through a bunch of crammed little 2 and 4 seaters to get to the line. Must be awkward as hell on busy days. They definitely need to fix that.

Other tidbits-
-Fountain machine serves Coke products, including Coke Zero!(Yay!)
-Nice little outdoor seating area out front, with a few table settings under umbrellas facing Rainbow Blvd.

I was very happy with my first visit to Cafe Zupas and definitely see many return visits in the future!

4 stars."}
{"text":"This place is so delicious! I have eaten here 3 times in a week lol. They have so many choices of soups, salads and sandwiches. I love the lobster bisque wroth their grilled cheese. You also get a chocolate covered strawberry with your meal! They also have some yummy desserts ;)"}
{"text":"5/3/18 Another fave place of mine. Salads are fresh and their sandwiches are made to order. I got a combo which comes with a whole sandwich and choice of soup or salad but drinks are not included. I pretty much tried everything. My fave sandwich is either crab avocado, chicken pesto, or the turkey bacon avocado. For salads, i love their nuts about berries, the mango salad, and Asian chicken salad. I recommend getting the dressings on the sides. They also have desserts...so good! Oh, did i mention with your combo it comes with a dinner roll and one piece of chocolate covered strawberries. Yes, they do!!  All infused drinks taste amazing. Again, my fave is the basil cucumber. 

With all that said...staff is nice and they all work together as a team to keep the flow going. I've been here numerous times and I'll continue to return.  Happy healthy Eats!!"}
{"text":"Fresh salads and soups. Great value and quality food. You also get a good amount of food for the price and every meal comes with a chocolate covered strawberry!"}
{"text":"Chicken tortilla soup was tasty, but very salty! Mushroom soup was A+. The complimentary Chocolate covered strawberry was a nice treat with the meal."}
{"text":"great food, great service, great atmosphere, & the best chocolate covered strawberries ever"}
{"text":"Five-stars for five reasons:

1. Service is amazing. Someone is always at the front door to greet you, lead you in, and ask if you need any of their recommendations. When it's your first time here, it really helps eliminate confusion and makes you feel less rushed to pick all of the great choices they have on their menu. You go down a line of people, each at their food stations and ready to prepare your meal! They've got quite a system lined up, and it totally works. You'll see what I mean. With that said...

2. Salads, sandwiches, and soups galore! I get the Try 2 Combo for $7.99 any time I go. It's gives you so much freedom of choice and is a dirt cheap deal for what you are getting. You can get soup and salad, or salad and a sandwich... You get it. The big plus? IT IS ALL HEALTHY. You also receive a slice of French bread and a chocolate-covered strawberry with the meal to top it all off.

***My recommendation is the Mango Berry Salad and the Pesto Chicken Panini. I am obsessed with both.

3. There is tons of seating. Booths line the windows and there are tables spaced out on the open floor. There is even a \"charge\" bar for your phones and laptops with little mini touch screens in front of you to play with. They have free wifi, although I haven't gone there for business- always for pleasure in the yummy food! Then again, I find it great  that customers are provided that option.

4. This is definitely a place for socialization for me, and is also family-oriented. I mentioned booths lining the windows because at each corner there are these huge booths that could probably seat 6-8 people at least! I like that fact for some odd reason. Maybe it's because any time I've been here, I am either catching up with friends, planning events to do later in the week, or sitting down with my other half and discussing how my day was. That's the kind of eating environment Zupas gives me- one where I can really sit down and ENJOY my meal.

5. I have never been disappointed, and sometimes that is hard to come by. I leave happy and full and.. plain old satisfied. ALSO, hard to come by. I am so glad its locations is so close to home for me. It has some competition for sure, considering the high volume of other restaurants located along Eastern Ave. But once you try it, you may think a little differently in that sense, and become a regular like me! 

P.S. Don't panic when you find there are no trash cans to discard your waste or areas to place your bowls, plates and utensils! I think they do this on purpose. It's their way of saying.. \"Don't worry about it, I've got it and I'll take care of it. Have a nice day!\" :)"}
{"text":"Really expect more since this place had a good rating. This review is for the soup only. I got a large cup of calm chowder. To start off the soup was very thin with very little ingredients and at 7 dollars for this bowl of soup is not worth it to me. The only good thing is that the soups flavoring was pretty good and had a good kick to it other than that skip the soup here."}
{"text":"A fast food chain with healthier food than most. There is a large selections of soups and salads and an adequate selection of sandwiches.
I had the chicken pesto panini with (veggie chowder) soup combo. The sandwich was a little small with some chicken between decent but not hard bread.  The large bowl of soup was peppery and good even though the veggies were chopped fine. 
Pepsi is the drink vender but there were also four thermos jugs of different teas--the black tea was good; the green tea had an odd flavor. In addition Italian soda floors were at the beverage counter.
My companions had salads that they enjoyed.

Service is fast and the place is efficiently organized."}
{"text":"Not a fan of this place . The food was terrible. I got the lobster bisque and it was filled with celery and carrots no lobster meat. My mom and I went to have some lunch together and her food was terrible and she had to send it back. Such a disappointment, the girls behind the counter are so loud and they rush you while ordering. The flavors are not so good, I got the \"California Cobb\" and it was a bit soggy. 

Don't waste your time nor money here!"}
{"text":"I had the soup and sandwich combo. I chose the vegetarian sandwich on whole grain, and the mushroom bisque. The sandwich had cucumbers, sprouts, tomatoes, roasted sweet red peppers, and greens. The sandwich wasn't really big on taste, but it was good enough for the price.

The mushroom bisque was bland, I had to add salt, pepper, and a couple of different Tabasco sauces to get it to where I actually wanted it, and it was surprisingly low on actual mushrooms...I think I had maybe 2 mushrooms in the entire bowl.

I will say that the Pomegranate Coconut Water Green Tea was awesome, I'll go back there for this alone!

The meal here wasn't \"bad,\" I would just describe it as being meh. I would put Cafe Zupas on the same scale with Panera, a couple of steps above hospital cafeteria food fare. Nothing to write home about, but decent enough to put something healthier than average in your belly."}
{"text":"Seriously?!??? How in the world do you get rid of the red pepper asiago chicken Cesar salad?!?! The whole reason i kept coming back... Now i wont be back unless zupas brings it back!!!! You don't have a Cesar salad!!!!"}
{"text":"So decided to give this place one more chance. Why do I keep punishing myself. Every time you ask for anything there is a upcharge. For 5 croutons it cost .69 and for about 6 strands of cheese for my soup, yep once again a upcharge. So stingy with all their stuff and ingredients. Than every single person has to remind you that it will cost more. I left hungry and irritated. You seriously need to reevaluate your business structure. I wish I could give this place a zero."}
{"text":"Best soup and salad place I have found in the area.  Love the mushroom soup and the multitude of salads I have tried...everyone of them!  Kids love the kid menu options and the syrups available to 'mix' their own drinks.  Their mango ice tea is also a perk.  I could eat here everday with all their options."}
{"text":"What can I say? Mormons make damn good food! Cafe Zupas has a wide selection of Sandwiches and Soups (Haven't tried any Salads but I assume they would be great as well). I always go with the BBQ Pulled Pork and Lobster Bisque. Staff is always friendly and they seem to have a genuine care for how you are and the meal they prepare for you. One of my favorite parts is that they seem to be pro-gun as well (No anti-gun signs) and I have open carried in this establishment multiple times without incident. I can't wait until the next visit, thinking about it makes my mouth water!!!"}
{"text":"I really liked Cafe Zuppas but the last time I went to eat there the salad had a bad taste and it was really soggy, it might have been old salad. But I would give them another chance just because I eat there alot and it has never happened before."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness, first time here and live the complimentary chocolate covered strawberry. They have a \"recharge bar\" to charge you mobile/electronic devices. They give out soup samples with many variations to add on such as sour cream, tortilla strips, bacon, orzo just to name a few. There was someone at the front door to great you and let you know if their recommendations. I definitely will be coming back.
This is a cute soup/salad/sammich place with many tables and room so you can eat in the comfort of your own bubble!!"}
{"text":"I love this place! We have received wonderful customer service from being greeted at the door, to providing suggestions when ordering, to clearing our plates as soon as we are finished. And all this with a smile! Great food--always looking for that perfect big salad! They have a lot of soup and salad options and some tasty baked goods! The best part is every meal comes with a chocolate covered strawberry so you always have a sweet treat to finish off your meal."}
{"text":"Great place to take my healthy friends.  The crab bacon panini with avocado was delicious.  The lobster bisque was great too.  I was looking forward to the chocolate dipped strawberries but the chocolate dipped Oreos was a good alternative."}
{"text":"I liked everything about this place except for the food. I had a grilled Panini  which consisted of ham, turkey, tomatoes and way too much honey mustard. I thought it tasted awful. My wife had the Lobster Bisque soup which was lukewarm. She thought it was just ok. The person getting the soup asked me if I wanted asiago croutons with the soup, I said ok. And unknowingly agreed to be charged an additional 59 cents. I thought it was part of the deal with the soup. That really pissed me off when I got to the register. Note to management - You might think you're making extra bucks with that soft upsell method but you are really losing returning customers. Why don't you be UNFRONT AND HONEST and say \"would you like some asiago croutons with the soup for an additional 59 cents?\".

This place looked like they had great desserts. A great alternative to the ice cream places around Desert Ridge. They had an ipod/pc charging station and the seating and general vibe to the place was great.

It might be a long time before I give this place a second chance."}
{"text":"People say that variety is the spice for life. I couldn't agree more so that's why I ventured out to Cafe Zupas from my normal rotation.

I decided to get a large make your own salad along with a soda for $9.29 (inclusive of tax). They give you plenty of mixed greens and about four ingredients on the salad. I could probably fit all the ingredients that they gave me on a hot dog. If you stick out your hand and look at your ring finger and pinky that would have been about the volume of chicken in the salad. I may have gotten somewhere between a 1/3 to 1/2 of a hard boiled egg as well. They chop up the cucumber and tomatoes very fine. Maybe a couple of teaspoons of each ingredient.

It's safe to say that I won't be fooled again.  At least I enjoyed this:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1QtO2KYwVE   (start at 1:14)."}
{"text":"Highly recommended, I should say that this place did not let me down, it was clean, quick, & still fresh & yummy. I shall return."}
{"text":"This was my fiancé and I's first time to Cafe Zupas and it was a little bit different than what we expected. We were looking for somewhere to get a salad and soup for lunch on New Year's Day however when we got to Jason's Deli they were closed. We remembered driving by Zafe Zupas and seeing they were open so we decided to try it out. When you first walk in the restaurant looks amazing! However, when you walk up to order it is rather confusing. We were not sure where the line started, ended, where the menus were besides on the wall, who to order from, etc.. Once we did order the staff was nice and very helpful. Upon getting our food we were pleasantly surprised to receive a complimentary chocolate covered strawberry - my fiancé loved it! When you go to find a table it is a tad confusing since it is food court seating and you must pass the drink station before finding your seat...this leads to nearly bumping into other patrons both when you sit down or get refills. The food was decent - I say this because the soup and salad were amazing but the panini was alright which evens out. Overall it was a pleasant enough experience however I would not place it on the top of the list to return. Hope this helps and happy new year!"}
{"text":"I like the great selection/variety of choices, and  I am down for good soup anytime of year, even when it's 110+ degrees outside.

I had the mushroom soup (based on employee's recommendation), and it was delicious!  Would definitely get it again.  The sandwich on the other left MUCH to be desired.  When I first saw it, I literally thought they made a mistake and gave me a kids' combo or something because the sandwich looked like something my mom would make in one of those sandwich press machines back in the 80's.  No kidding.  The sandwich didn't have much on it, and it didn't have much flavor.  Very over-priced for what I got.  I would probably just stop in for a bowl of soup in the future or maybe try a salad next time, but I won't be duped into another one of their sandwiches, sorry."}
{"text":"Café Zupas is my favorite spot. Everything is fresh and always amazing. Truly you can't go wrong with anything here. I did the pick 2 with the Strawberry harvest salad and the Italian sandwich."}
{"text":"Here's the thing about Zupas.  I have a love-hate relationship.  I honestly love their food.  Everything I've tried is tasty.  That being said, I think they're quite overpriced for what you get.  I also feel this way about similar soup/salad shops.  They charge as much as a full service restaurant.  So while I really do enjoy the food, the lack of value prevents me from wanting to visit that often.  That is quite unfortunate.  They are also 'stingy' i.e. I was in there the other day and refused the 'complimentary' pasta for the tomato soup but was charged extra because I asked for a sprinkling of Parmesan cheese.  That is ridiculous.  Come on, like a tiny spoonful of parm costs more than pasta?  Get real.  It's the little things that irritate me.  
Their creme brûlée has no brûlée so don't think it's the real deal.  More like a panna cotta.
Also, they no longer offer a slice of yummy French bread.  It's been replaced by a bland roll.
All in all, I will stop at Zupas if I am craving something in particular or if I am trying to be a little healthier.
But unfortunately it's not a regular stop for me."}
{"text":"Could be better. We got a 50% off coupon in the mail so we figured we would try it out. It wasn't very obvious where to start ordering; their menu on the wall has small print so it's somewhat hard to read; I ordered a sandwich but the guy didn't ask if I wanted everything on it so by the time I said I didn't want any red pepper hummus (bleh) he said they had already made the sandwich (which had only been maybe 20 seconds, but at least they still remade it); then we were unsure about how to proceed as we made our way to the cashier; the bottled drinks in the ice bin weren't very cold but they had the same items in a refrigerator; the cashier took a while to get everything entered while another employee started crowding our trays with other trays that were piling up; then they said they would bring my daughter's sandwich out in a few minutes but it actually took 15 minutes (the rest of us were almost done eating by then); the sandwiches were lacking when it came to the ingredients (you don't get much pulled pork) and they neglected to keep the coleslaw off of it as requested. 

They could be a lot more helpful and informative about what to do and how things work. We felt completely in the dark and we were not very pleased."}
{"text":"Clean, bright lit happy atmosphere. Service was fast and personable - asked about my day! Nice touch. Had the Chipotle chicken salad and Chicken enchilada soup - very good and filling! Great experience and very reasonable price!"}
{"text":"Good spot for soup, salad or panini's. I for some reason (possibly the name)  thought it was a Greek restaurant.....it's not. 

They do have a very large selection of the above mentioned items and everything was fresh and tasty. 

I had the Cobb 1/2 size salad with double protein. I didn't like the small tablespoonful of everything they sprinkle on. Seems a bit skimpy and had to double down. It was tasty and quick! 

The salad did come with a cold piece of bread and a chocolate covered strawberry, Bonus! Toasted bread would be 100x's better."}
{"text":"I don't like going to Panera or Paradise because I feel like I am paying (a lot) for a sandwich that I could make just as easily at home. 

Cafe Zupas is what they want to be when they grow up. 

Fabulous soups (free samples and for sure have the Roasted Red Pepper and Lobster -- simply awesome) that are home made here and great selection of unique sandwiches. 

The sandwiches are unique and the bread is wonderfully soft. 

Combo is only $8.79 with full sandwich (not half) and half bowl of soup which is like full bowl at those other places. 

My wife says the chocolate covered (includes with all meals) strawberries are very good, too. I didn't have one by choice."}
{"text":"Meh. We visited for school \"restaurant night\" and the entire visit was a cluster. Stood in line for a few minutes, went to place our order and asked if we could do take out -- she sent us to the manager because you have to do take out at the other end of the counter. Then she says we aren't supposed to do take out for school night but she was very friendly and let us since I asked the other employee and she didn't know. 
I didn't see a whole lot of GF items, I asked if the cauliflower soup had flour and she said yes and didn't offer any options that didn't contain flour. Anyway, got the food home and was really disappointed with the size of my half salad -- it was very small for $6 but maybe I'm just used to salad and go! Hubby's pulled pork was descent, kiddo #2 didn't care for the chicken strips and I didn't blame him, kiddo #1 loved his grilled cheese and fruit. Kids meals are $3.99 which is great. 
Solid three."}
{"text":"Everything about this place is done with the customer in mind.  I love it!  
Ordering is easy - the menu board, while extensive, is clear and big.  There are lots of options here so you'd think you might get lost in it all but the menu is easy to navigate.  You place your order while in line and it's essentially made to order - right in front of you.  They have an awesome selection of sandwiches - hot and cold, hearty and healthy salads, super yummy and nutritious protein bowls and the most amazing soups I've ever had at a non-traditional fast food spot.  There's a display case at the end of the order line just before you pay with the prettiest, yummiest desserts.  Mad props to anyone who can resist one of those yummy treats.  
There's plenty of seating and they have a serve yourself drink area with fountain drinks and fresh tea.  I've been here about half a dozen times and whether it's super busy or a complete ghost town inside, the place is always immaculately clean.  
I'm partial to the crab avocado melt (minus the bacon) and the lobster bisque soup.  There's not a whole lot I can say about either menu item other than they're just good.  Just damn good!  I combine the sandwich and soup in a \"Try 2\" combo.  It's a lot of food and I don't think I've ever finished the entire thing.  
Everything is fresh here - I've never had anything that I thought was old or reheated.  Portions are huge and a super nice touch is the piece of fresh french bread you get with the soup and the chocolate dipped strawberry that comes with every meal.  So good!  So, so, so good!  
Cafe Zupas is a super fresh take on your average sandwich shop. There's even a bar area with outlets along the wall so you can plug in your devices (but really, people - can you please put down your damn phone and have a nice meal without any form of electronics?  i dare ya...).  The prices are incredibly reasonable for the amount of food you get and the quality of it.  
There are locations throughout the valley so no matter where you live, you're not far from a Cafe Zupas.  I really, really recommend it.  Your taste buds will thank you!"}
{"text":"This is my first time at a Café Zupas. I didn't think that I would enjoy eating only panini, soup, and salads. Or that it would be fulfilling. I was wrong. 

This place is actually pretty good for lunch time. I didn't leave the place feeling unsatisfied. The assistant manager was very hospitable and nice. They are looking to hire, so you can stop by this location and pick up an application. 

I ordered Pesto Chicken panini, mangoberry salad, and the Clam chowder. I honestly loved the mangoberry salad. The sweetness of the salad dressing and the mangos complemented each other. I'm not a fiend for much bread meals, but the panini were like any other panini you would order elsewhere. If you dip their panini in their clam chowder soup, it tastes better. Their bread rolls were cold. I tried my sister's tomato basil soup and it was really sweet. It wasn't creamy at all. 

They also have desserts. Their mixed berry creme brulee was much more of a vanilla pudding texture if anything. Overall, this place is alright if you're looking for a quick fulfilling meal."}
{"text":"Santa Clause, a Chupacabra, and a quality fast food salad restaurant. You hear about these three things, but never get a chance to actually see them. 

Well I can take the third option off that list because tonight I witnessed, Cafe Zupas, the fast food salad phenom. This place really surprised me, the decor is bright and futuristic and they even have cell phone charging stations!! 

The setup there is a reverse cafeteria style. You walk-up, place your order, head down the line and they do the rest...easy-peasy lemon squeezy. Definitely mention to the staff if you don't want certain things on your salad or sandwich because they will prepare them with the works!

They offer multiple salad, soup, and sandwich options, which you can mix and match if you so desire. I ordered the Honey Chipotle Chicken salad with a bowl of Wild Mushroom bisque, be still my beating heart! The salad was prepared fresh, from the chicken to the dressing and all the veggies. Plus the soup would have knocked my socks off, if I was wearing some. Summer in Vegas = No sock days. 

If you still have room, they have an amazing dessert display: brownies, cheesecake and some type of marshmallow, coconut concoction. I passed, It was tough, but I stayed strong. From ordering, to eating, we were out the door in just about 30 minutes; just like I like it when I'm on the go!"}
{"text":"Scoot over Chipotle! Zupas has got that IT factor, delicious food & an actual variety. Incredibly affordable for the quality & freshness of every meal. The employees have got their lives together & never fall under pressure even in fast paced crowds. PS- complimentary chocolate covered strawberry w/ every purchase"}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Who doesn't like sandwiches, soup or salad? It's like Panera Bread mixed with Chipotle. The atmosphere is very fresh, clean and lively and EVERYONE is sooo friendly!!! Its very contagious so watch out lol. Service and turn around for the tables are also really quick so if you see a ridiculous amount of cars parked, don't be scared, I've never seen anyone have to wait for a table.
There are many options for each of the sandwiches, paninis, soups, salads, desserts and drinks so I believe even the pickiest of eaters can find a combination they like. I rarely order salads unless it's to replace fries at other restaurants so a few favorites of mine for paninis and soup would be the Cuban Grilled Pork, Honey Bacon Club, Crab Avocado Melt, Ultimate Grilled Cheese, Tomato Basil Soup and Wild Mushroom Bisque. Yummm!!  Definitely hits the spot. So far for desserts I've tried the Mixed Berry Creme Brulee and Caramel Rockslide Brownie and they were pretty good for being around $2.50 but I probably wouldn't order them again unless I was craving since their free chocolate covered strawberry satifies my sweet tooth. They have a large selection of fountain drinks and I like that they have complimentary flavor syrups! 
Some other cool things about this place is that they have charging stations since we're all attached to our cellphones nowadays lol and they close later than most healthy ish places at 9pm Monday-Thursday and 10pm Friday and Saturday.
More cool things, soups are made in-house, dressings are hand-blended and they have this cool thing called School Night where they will donate 20% of proceeds to your school for anything ordered during 5-9pm that night!
Definitely a regular here now!"}
{"text":"Cheap! Delicious! 

Those are two words that unfortunately, do not go together as often as I would like. 

I am not exactly in the best uhhh financial situation at the moment. So I often have to sacrifice quality for cheapness.

But even when I do become wildly successful, (hopefully exactly 2 weeks after receiving my bachelors degree) I will still remain frugal. I will still have my coffee can of coins and I will still refuse to throw a penny in the pond. Like my depression era grandparents I am going to be that insanely eccentric lady that hides money under the floor boards but don't tell anyone.  

So the cheapness of the food was awesome. I only went there a couple of times because I had to head back to Detroit where unfortunately, they do not have a Zupas. 

The times I went there I got the soup and salad. The salad was pretty amazing...I expected to be kind of spicy because hey it had the word \"Thai\" in it but it had more of a kick than I was expecting! 

This is not a bad thing. I think many restaurant owners assume Americans cannot handle spicy and they might be right. In my case, I think people underestimate me...when I ask for spicy I mean it.  

I also had the Yucatan Chicken Soup. This also had something of a kick and is AWESOME!

The people are super friendly, and even gave me directions. Let's just say I can be um \"directionally challenged\" and I don't have a car so I either walk or take the bus. I prefer walking and every time they pointed me in the right direction. :) 

I wanted to get the desert but the only reason I didn't was because it was the most expensive thing on the menu!"}
{"text":"Delicious!! This place was an incredible find. We were in the mood for soup and a sandwich. Yelped for the closest soup place and found Cafe Zupas. Several selections. I tried the Gourmet Red Pepper Bisque with Lobster & the grilled chicken pesto panini. It was served with a roll and chocolate covered strawberry. We were pleasantly surprised it was so delicious. I highly recommend this place.

Servers were friendly. Place was clean. Price $8.95 for soup & panini."}
{"text":"I heard that they put red peppers and munster cheese in their Cubano sandwiches. Gross. That's not a cuban, and I'll come down there and make an authentic one and you bet that would be on the menu. In closing, make it right and stop putting peppers on it."}
{"text":"salad: 4.5 stars
sandwiches: 4 stars
soups: 3 stars

Their best feature is their salads.  the mangoberry was DELICIOUS.  all of the fresh fruit.. what more could you need on a summer day? especially under the las vegas sun.. a nice little add-on to this place is the chocolate covered strawberry you get with each order. yumm

Sandwiches worth noting: asian bbq and crab/avocado

soups: tried the gumbo and the bisque. both were decent but not the strong suit at this spot."}
{"text":"absolutely amazing food, service and prices! we will definitely go here again! YUM!"}
{"text":"I love coming to zupas. Can't beat the lobster bisque. However, this particular location seemed super unorganized and took forever to get us our food. Tasted great though."}
{"text":"What's not to love about Cafe Zupas?! Everything here is always delicious it's one of my favorite lunch spots. I love the veggie chowder and the crab sandwich. How awesome is it that they always give you a fresh chocolate covered strawberry?! This particular location has amazing staff that are kind, patient, and go out of their way to help you and make sure you get what you want. It's super organized and there's never a long wait. Cafe Zupas is doing it right!"}
{"text":"This Cafe Zupas is always so clean & the food is always hot & fresh! I go here with my group of friends a couple times a week since we go to school right next door. Love the chicken pesto sandwhich! & the salads are always amazing!"}
{"text":"I love cafe Zupas. And in particular, this store is awesome! It's very clean and the associates there are friendly and nice! Today I walked in with my boyfriend. I wish I had gotten the name of the person helping us. They were super nice and friendly. And the (I think he said district) manager, Chris was super nice and friendly. I really enjoyed talking to him. More places need to hire managers like him! :) very pleased with my visit today. Oh and all the soups are delicious. My favorites is the red pepper lobster bisque, the Wisconsin cauliflower and the wild mushroom bisque.  and if I do the half soup half sandwich I always get a panini. I'm addicted to paninis!"}
{"text":"It's always a shame when a restaurant places convenience (for their staff) over good service and a comfortable dining experience for customers.  Especially when their execution is awful. I had previously been to another Cafe Zupas. Not bad, but not great either.  I went to this location today with my family. It was a bad decision.  Atmosphere is nice when you walk in. When you attempt to order is where it goes sideways.  Ordering is chaotic and disorganized. The guy in front of me orders a salad with ranch dressing. The girl making salads informs him that her bottle of ranch is empty and to choose another dressing. He politely asks if they are out of ranch in the whole restaurant or just that bottle. She tells him the whole restaurant is out of ranch. He chooses something else. I order a sandwich and soup and a kids meal (chicken tenders and fruit).  She sends me down the line to the soup area where I'm told I will choose a soup. I wait at least 5 minutes while they work on other people's orders.  Whose orders they were, I have no idea. I order soup and get herded to the cashier area. Another girl asks me \"what did you order?\" I tell her and she rings me up and I pay. After I pay, she asks \"did you want a drink?\" I say yes and pay again. I still have no food. Yet another girl comes and asks me \"what did you have?\"  There are probably 7-8 sandwiches, 6 salads and several bowls of soup sitting in front of her. It's clear that she has no clue what belongs to whom.  I repeat my order again. It's another 5 minutes before I get my tray of food. The food looks like it's getting cold. I ask her if I can have ranch for the chicken tenders. She says yes and returns several minutes later with the ranch.  I guess they weren't out of ranch as the other girl suggested. 

My tomato basil soup was gritty and had weird lumps. My sandwich was not hot and had water dripping from it. The food was nasty. The cups they use for kids meals are the cheapest I've ever seen. I attempted to put a lid on my daughter's drink and the plastic cup crumbled under my hand. Drink spilled everywhere. 

Cafe Zupas is a joke. The meat in the sandwich was poor quality and the portions are tiny. Will not be back."}
{"text":"Wow! First time ever to a Café Zupas - this place is dynamite. So many choices and a staff that keeps the line moving quickly while being extremely friendly. The Cuban Grilled Pork was awesome, and I think the Wild Mushroom Bisque may be in my top five all time for soups. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Delicious healthy selections, friendly staff and great environment. I love the beverage selection as well as the chocolate dipped strawberries! Yummy!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food! I love the selection and the amount of nutrition facts readily available! Extremely clean dining room and friendly staff."}
{"text":"This place is amazing, I've been to the other locations and this one is the best, we tried the lobster curry and it was out of this world yum yum yum! Only thing I don't like is the way the desserts are open in the case, but other than that they are doin things right! Thanks for lunch!"}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time last week. It is very good. The cauliflower chowder was delicious. I also got the turkey artichoke grilled sandwich. I was very pleased. I love that you receive a strawberry. However the line should be set up better. Trying to find a way out after you pay is a little difficult. It's a bit of a fire hazard, especially if someone is sitting at the tables right there. You would have to make them stand in order to not bump into them."}
{"text":"I ordered the crab avocado sandwich, I thought it was meh.. but the chocolate covered strawberry they give you for free here was definitely a giant plus. I will be back next time, not to try to crab avocado sandwich but something else. I really liked how they also had a charging station in the middle of the cafe, really nice bonus for people like me who are always on the go and constantly needing a battery pick me up."}
{"text":"I love this place and would probably eat here everyday if I could! The food is so fresh and tasty. Nothing typical or bland! The infused drinks are soooo good and refreshing and you receive a complimentary fresh dipped chocolate strawberry with every meal. This place is a must!!!"}
{"text":"Quick review: Have eaten there twice, first experience was stellar, second experience was flawed and they forgot to add chicken on my chicken salad (to go order). 

In depth review: great concept. Fast and somewhat healthy options and very reasonably priced. This is the first restaurant to go into that location that is actually busy so they must be doing something right. Some fine and tasty salads, soups and sandwich options. They give you a chocolate covered strawberry and thats' a neat lil touch. 

Complaints - 
1) Forgot my chicken on my chicken salad when it was crunch time on a busy Friday night. Doh! 
2) Lack of healthy soup options. All the soup options that I have sampled are damn tasty but they are loaded with sodium and in a heavy cream sauce. Would like to see some chicken broth  stock options w/ less sodium. 
3) Parking is difficult know that the property owners have jammed 4 busy restaurants in that corner. 

Overall - I think this place will do just fine. Great concept with fresh, fast, reasonably priced and somewhat healthy food. Reminds me of that other Utah based chain across the street, Cafe Rio. Utah chains are solid."}
{"text":"The food is delicious, the staff is friendly and willing to help work you through the menu. I got the turkey spinach artichoke panini and the tomato basil soup. Both were amazing. The house made drink infusions are delicious as well, I got the blackberry basil drink. Clean, bright, inviting atmosphere as well."}
{"text":"Every now and then you stumble across a real gem.  Café Zupas is such a place.  Fresh homemade soups are the stars with about 10 varieties available.  Salad and sandwiches are also on the menu and you can combo them with the soup.  I had the mushroom bisque which comes with a roll.  It had a very earthy, deep mushroom flavor and was quite good.  The Italian sandwich was pretty good.  A complementary chocolate-dipped strawberry comes with each meal...a nice touch.  They had some homemade chilled drinks made from water infused with fresh fruits and herbs and sweetened with honey.  These drinks were very good and refreshing and far healthier than the sugar-ladened pop.  I would make this place a \"go to\" spot for lunch if one were close to where I work."}
{"text":"I've been to 2 other locations and this one is by far the worst. The staff was very loud and rude & screaming , playing around, throwing things, with no regards to the customers ."}
{"text":"Sometimes I crave a sandwich, soup, or salad combo for a meal- and if I don't want to end up at Sweet Tomatoes or Soup Plantation- Cafe Zupas is my first choice. I think of CZ as a step below Panera Bread.You roll the dice on if there is going to be a long line and crowded tables depending on what time of the day you go. 
The line usually moves rather quickly, but almost so fast that most employees don't spend much time even really acknowledging you because they are busy prepping your food. There are a few dessert options to choose from if the chocolate dipped strawberry you get as a complimentary snack is not enough. I don't think the extra slice of bread that they give you is even necessary, but it is good to use as a scoop for your soup. I've never had an issue or concern about the preparation and or freshness of the food. The soups are usually overly salty for me, but that just my preference. 
There is an employee who works in the dining area and helps keep the tables and drink station clean which is great with the cafeteria style atmosphere that CZ offers."}
{"text":"I have never had a bad experience at any Cafe Zupas! Healthy, fresh, and tasty food. Large variety of soup/salad/sandwich options. More affordable than Wildflower, and you get more for your money. Great kids options. Wish there were more locations in the valley! If you even kind of like mushrooms, get the mushroom bisque...we are kind of obsessed with it."}
{"text":"My first time eating at Zupas was absolutely ridiculous. I finally have time to eat after coming off of 24 hour hospital shift and was starving and needing coffee. First of all - no coffee! What kind of \"cafe\" doesn't have coffee? I ordered a pulled pork sandwich because I am a sucker for BBQ. Someone makes the sandwich in 2 minutes and I am left standing in line for 10 more minutes before I can pay, by this time the sandwich was cold. My meat was not hot and the bun was literally like they got it out of the refrigerator and they slapped down some meat. I asked if it can be microwaved but they said they weren't allowed to microwave things. Uh ok? So I asked for it to be remade but that of course caused a whole ordeal with multiple people checking to see if one could be remade. I just accepted the sandwich and took one bite and had enough and went to Paradise Bakery where they have coffee and the employees actually care about the food that they serve to their customers. I did however enjoy the chocolate covered strawberry that they give to everyone...just wished I had some coffee to go along with it."}
{"text":"All of the food here is fresh and healthy! I could literally eat here everyday, it's THAT good."}
{"text":"I like their menu but man they are so skimpy on the serving portion. 5 toppings but about the size of a tablespoon doesn't add up to much. It ends up being a large bowl of lettuce. Protein portion just as small. Would eat there more often if they gave bigger topping and protein portions."}
{"text":"Today I had lunch at this location and it was a terrible choice. First off the staff seemed to be scattered and confused at what was going on. There wasn't any communication going down the line and my food was terrible. My Turkey sandwich had no flavor, I ordered the yucutan chicken soup and it was nothing but a grease pit and lacked any form of chicken, and lastly the baguette slice that you used to get is now a dried up roll that is cold and not enjoyable. Definitely will not be going back to this location."}
{"text":"Just came here for the first time. Some cool things that set it apart from say, Jason's Deli: Italian soda bar, charging station, chocolate dipped strawberry with every meal. Grilled cheese sandwich was really good, as were the tomato bisque and red pepper lobster soups. Really reasonably priced. 
The bad: Caramel brownie looked better than it tasted. My boyfriend's soup had a hair in it. Limited seating. Loud."}
{"text":"The seating area is open.  the staff are helpful ad friendly.  The choices of sandwiches is really going to cover any taste your looking for.  The same for the soups."}
{"text":"I didn't put in a review from my previous visit as I got a BBQ chicken salad to go and when I got home they didn't put chicken in it. Today I ordered the half BBQ chicken salad and was told my balance and I paid and the cashier forgot to give me my change so I had to wait for her to correct that. Now that I'm thinking about it I paid almost $9 bucks for a half of salad. I paid $10 and got $1 and some change back. Not to mention I never was asked if I wanted my receipt so I have no proof to go back and get this corrected as a half a salad is only $5.79+tax. I am very disappointed with this place."}
{"text":"Great lunch place. Clean and quick set up kinda like a subway as in the fact you go down the line telling them what you want. Great soup samplesI just love all these new places popping  up that are a healthier way of eating and love  how everything is fresh, but will say I wish they had more choices in salad dressings they only have one that isn't sweet it's herb vinaigrette  every thing else is sweet.  My salad was pretty good but could have been amazing with a dressing with a kick something like a cilantro lime jalapeño type dressing(hint,hint Zuppas)
My salad had quino, snap green beans,spinach,tomato ,cucumber ,goat cheese ,egg ,chicken, baby broccoli on it.
Also there flavored tea has honey in it wish they would make one without honey in it. Just not a sweet eater."}
{"text":"I visited the establishment this evening with my family and friends. I have always had a decent experience here until tonight. After today I will not be going to this restaurant anymore neither will any of my family and friends. I will encourage them to seek food else where. To start I ordered the half  protein salad and half avocado bacon turkey sandwhich. I politely asked to have yellow peppers added to my sandwich. I was immediately shot down and was  told no they can't do that. When I asked why they offered no decent explanation even though I offered to pay the extra difference it usually costs. So I said fine you can't add them to my sandwich, can you add them to my salad that's already open and can simply just put them in there like all the other veggies. The girl told me no again with her coworker rudely shaking her head in the background. From then on I proceeded to get attitude as I checked out. To me this was absolutely ridiculous, if someone has an allergy you are tell me they can't take off what's on their sandwich? When going to a place like this you should always be able to add or subtract ingredients that they offer. I have visited the Desert Ridge location and have never had a problem. This has been the worse experience followed up by terrible customer service. I encourage the owner to really look over his staff, so he doesn't loose anymore business due to his poorly trained and impolite team members."}
{"text":"Love the selection of this place. You can eat a different meal for about two years! Soups are homemade and everything was fresh. They are really nice  good service!"}
{"text":"Never been disappointed here. Sandwiches, salads, and soups are all good. I love that the try two thing comes with a chocolate covered strawberry and a roll."}
{"text":"Someone in the kitchen is very heavy handed with the salt. When I found the Yucatan Chicken Tortilla soup inedible I kindly pointed this out to a manager and she said \"Broth can be that way sometimes.\" That, my friends, is why things will not be changing for the better in this establishment anytime soon."}
{"text":"Kids love the good here. Honey Bacon Tomato sandwich is sweet and a bit tangy. NE Clam chowder is very good. Very friendly staff."}
{"text":"... This review is based upon our first and only visit here. Staff was super nice and able to assist in finding something for our (then 12 month old) kiddo to eat. Surprisingly, during this visit we found out she apparently loves grapes cut in half! If you like Paradise Bakery, that's what Cafe Zupas reminds me of.  Healthy and fresh and decently priced."}
{"text":"I was there on Monday, August 3, 2015 line were ridiculously long it was crazy busy for a Monday I purchased a large salad and I feel like I got the amount of a half salad which was pretty disappointing. They put your salad in a large clear container to make it look like you get a lot but you really do not-bummer. It was still really tasty!"}
{"text":"Quick service even when they're packed. A lot of seating, well lit, all around goooood vibes. Pulled pork sandwich had really good coleslaw. I'd definitely come back for a sandwich."}
{"text":"I'm so upset with this location and more than likely won't be back. 
I used to work over by the the location near 20th street and Camelback. Never really had major issues except for the fact that no matter what, my same exact order would always come out to be a different price every single time. But regardless, this review is for the one off Happy Valley. 
First, the portions are way smaller than other locations. Today I ordered a large build your own salad. I asked for chicken in it and egg added on. I got MAYBE 5 chunks of chicken the size of my index fingernail and MAYBE 4 slices of skimpy egg. For the prices they up-charge you with, you'd expect a whole lot more than that. 
I also asked for cheese as well. Again, they have to keep reminding you that every little thing is an up-charge. Yes...I know, I can read. Well they gave me MAYBE a half TEASPOON of cheese. But I think I'm probably being generous here.
Asked for croutons...I got 4 of them...how generous...
This is absolutely ridiculous and if I'm gonna pay these outrageous prices, I'm gonna just take my business across the way to Paradise Bakery where I'll at least get more bang for my buck. 
Finally, why do I have to tell every single employee who is working what my order is?? Why, then, do you bother to have the first person write it down on the plastic container?! It's annoying especially for people with large orders!!!! Fix your system because it's not a good one right now. 
I really like Cafe Zupas but this specific one will never see a dime of my money again."}
{"text":"OK, my new FAVORITE restaurant!  Where to start? I can't believe I haven't been there, as I am a soupaholic. I will definitely be going on the regular!  I ordered lunch for 7 people.  Not only was it ready when I arrived, I was greeted like a celebrity! Rochelle Stone was so friendly and efficient, as was the rest of the happy staff. She advised the Box Lunch meals were prepared, and that all sandwiches came with chips, all soup with bread, all meals with a dipped cookie. I was surprised because their prices are SO reasonable to begin with!  She signed me up for rewards, which gave me $15 credit for the order, to be used next visit.  The receipt was in a nice hand written envelope, and here is the real shocker... There was no place for a tip, \"we don't accept tips\"!!! Incredible, really! $74 out the door, for 7 people, and 3 desserts to share (besides the cookies, that were great).  The order was 100% accurate. The food was delicious! I am plotting to get to there again, soon, already."}
{"text":"Food was average at best. I ordered a panini. It sure didn't look like picture on the menu. It was on the small side. The Chipotle chicken salad was okay. I don't see what all the fuss is about. I won't be coming back anymore"}
{"text":"This was my first visit and all I can really say is yummy! there is a great variety for the cost. friendly and honest employees too!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing, don't get me wrong, but your employees need a lot of work. I ordered my sandwich and then went to go order my soup. A nice boy then asked me what soup I wanted and if I wanted any mix ins. Then suddenly this employee, K.D was on her nametag, barged in and yelled at the boy \"what are you doing here? You're not trained to do soups.\" The poor kid just nervously told her that he was trying to help and K.D literally flicked her hand and shooed him away and said \"go away and stay at your little salad station.\" WOW. Talk about rude! I work in a restaurant and it seems that your employees really need to work on teamwork. She could have easily helped him and guided him, but she instead chose to be so rude to the poor kid. He was just trying to help!"}
{"text":"So, I had to feed a work group of 20 on valentines day in the office. I couldn't have been more pleased with Café Zupas. They were diligent, professional, and really surprised everyone with a chocolate dipped cookie or a chocolate covered strawberry.

They called to confirm the online order, delivered on time and with cheer, and ultimately allowed us to have a very productive day. I highly recommend their online ordering platform for large groups as well!"}
{"text":"My review is for a delivery order I had while attending a meeting. I had the salad and sandwich combo. I had the citrus salad and the bacon, tomato and avocado sandwich. Both were very good and fresh. The packaging was nice - large portion in a clear container. They give you a small roll and a chocolate covered strawberry with your order. My first time trying this restaurant. I think it's a good deal for the price. Tons of selection of interesting salads! I would come back for sure."}
{"text":"Place was dirty help couldn't keep up cleaning the tables. The soup was not hot very disappointed."}
{"text":"I love Zupas.  Sometimes I just want a salad.  Sometimes I just want a sandwich.  Sometimes I just want soup and sometimes I want 2 or more of these options.  It's fresh, tasty and always fills me up.  Get the enchilada soup, grilled cheese (add ham) and the chicken Cobb Salad.  All are delectable.  You also get a chocolate covered strawberry every time you eat there."}
{"text":"I love Zupas!!  The one over by my salon on 75th and Bell and now this one.  Fresh salads, gourmets soups and delicious sanwhiches.  Made to order, so it's always fresh, hot and ready to go.  My favorite!!"}
{"text":"Delightful , fresh & healthy food! I had the Thai chicken mango salad with a small bowl of tomato basil soup. The salad had super fresh lettuce and the fruit was ripe and delicious. It had a little spicy heat as well (not much) but nice. The soup was good tasting but I wished the temperature was hotter. It was just warm. 

Hubby had the Vermont maple blueberry salad and it was even better than mine!

The menu is big! Can't wait to try everything. The servers are above and beyond nice. (Almost freakishly over nice) 

Closed Sundays! FYI"}
{"text":"My 1st time there with coworkers on a Tuesday. I thought it would be a small cafe, but I was wrong. Clean tables, attentive staff, and fair prices for hearty satisfying portions. Cafeteria style. Order and watch the staff make your order a la Subway. Long extensive menu.  The long wait let me decide from the soups, salads, sandwiches options.  I wanted the half sandwich and soup combo, but got a full sandwich instead. But either I didn't speak up loud enough or I he didn't hear me over the super busy crowd.  It ended up fine because I loved my pickled Cuban sandwich + cauliflower soup!  So I was glad I had another half to enjoy the next day and it still tasted great! Each order came with a small slice of bread and a chocolate dipped strawberry! No one else does that! Plus a nice selection of tempting desserts like brownies, trifles and puddings. I am going back again. But the only downside was a plus.  So much lunch traffic that parking can be a challenge."}
{"text":"I am a sandwich shop junkie and have spent a lot of money patronizing different sandwich shops in the valley for lunch and dinner. Café Zupas was a winner when my daughter and I visited this location! We are very happy to have such a delicious place to stop and eat when we go shopping up at Desert Ridge. There are many restaurants to choose from there, and this will definitely be one we return to! It was delicious, a good value for what you get, and the staff was very friendly. I also LOVE a pristinely clean restaurant and this one was."}
{"text":"Loved this restaurant!  The soup (lobster bisque) was amazing and I had the pulled BBQ pulled pork sandwich which was very tasty!  My son had the kids grilled cheese sandwich and the Wisconsin Cauliflower soup.  My meal came with bread and a chocolate dipped strawberry and my son's just had the strawberry.  Every sandwich, soup and salad can be customized with different toppings and mix-ins.  

They have incredible desserts there...brownies, cheesecake, tarts..etc.  I had one of the brownies and it was fresh and delicious.  And they have fun Italian soda mix-in flavors for your soda.  They are moderately priced and the food was great!  I'm looking forward to going back there again."}
{"text":"I seriously LOVE this place.  I just got a phone that will allow me to check-in places the other day, otherwise I'd be runner up for the Duchess!!!  I can't get enough!

I LOVE the Honey Bacon Club (Turkey, Bacon, Ham, Tomatoes, Muenster Cheese and Honey Mustard panini).  I've had the Turkey Bacon Avocado Club and had bites of the Ultimate Grilled Cheese and the Vegetarian sandwiches The Boy ordered but none of them compare to my HBC! :)  

I also love that you can try AS MANY SOUPS as you want before settling on one.  AND there are toppings for your soup!! Cheese, tortilla strips, sour cream, bacon... My favorite has been the Wisconsin Cauliflower - which is like potato soup except it's cauliflower instead of potatoes.  All the soups come with a generous hunk of tasty bread AAAAAANNNNNNNDDD a chocolate dipped strawberry.  

Just writing this review makes me want Zupas for dinner! :) 

SO - why only 4 stars instead of 5? Well....its the service.  Maybe they're over-staffed because they just opened and they're training people, I dunno, but the amount of workers there wanting to take your order, say hello, wish you a nice day, etc....is overwhelming to say the least and slightly annoying.  I also appreciate the gesture of having one worker walk around (or wander aimlessly) and clear your trays for you, BUT - it makes me feel like I'm being watched while I eat.

I'm hoping they reduce their staff as they get used to their flow of traffic.  Otherwise, I'll be taking my food to go! :)"}
{"text":"I want to like this place, but I've come here 3 times and each time the service is bad. The food is good, but for the small amount you get for $10 is ridiculous. Everyone that works there seems to not want to be there. So disappointing."}
{"text":"Love this place, had their cobb salad and turkey sandwich. A M A Z I N G!  I am officially obessed with their Pomogrante Coconut Water Green Tea drink, it has raw honey in it making it taste like a little piece of heaven!"}
{"text":"We had the 2 Combo for $9. A sandwich and either a half salad or half soup for two. Pretty good deal and the food seemed fresh and tasty. My husband really liked the California Protein Salad. I liked the desserts. The question is, do we really need ANOTHER sandwich place in this area?  There are already a half dozen within a mile and they are all pretty good- Honeybaked, Panera, Wildflower, etc and there's a new sandwich shop opening up right next door to the Zupas!! My main complaint would be the flow. The beverage and condiment table are located immediately adjacent to the cash register plus there were employees crowding around-filling the butter, napkins, emptying trash. On top of that there are tables immediately across from the beverage bar. What terrible congestion.My other tip would be, get your soup in bowls-it seems as one reviewer noted; and I may be totally wrong but the cups get less soup than the bowls! Bon apetit!"}
{"text":"Well this place was a disappointment to say the least. It's basically a subway meets chipotle style of restaurant which I thought I would enjoy. 
The lay out is a little odd that you walk through several tables to get to the line, which wasn't chained off so you have no idea where to actually go. Then when ordering, the service was subpar in my opinion. Yes it's a new place and was very busy, but a smile goes a long way. It's none of my business what is happening behind the line so things that were being discussed about coworkers shouldn't have been. 
The food was decent. Nothing to rave about. My panini was tiny, squished, and greasy. The garden soup was pretty good.  
Now to the reason for one star.... I spent the rest of the day and night sick to my stomach with minor food poisoning. Still as I write this my stomach is gurgling and in knots. I will never go back there again."}
{"text":"Between this place and Cafe Rio were are starting to form a \"Little Utah\" here in Town and Country.  An expansive menu, decent prices, and a super, super friendly staff. Solid lunch offering."}
{"text":"Sandwiches? It's been done. Soup? Done. But done at this level of quality at this price? Haven't seen it till now.

Stopped here for lunch, never tried it before. The helpful staff was polite and explained the way to pick everything out and even gave some knowledgeable suggestions. Before I knew it I was through the line with a hot sandwich and fresh salad. Grabbed my soda, added a couple pumps of their Italian soda flavor shots and sat down. First bite, oh my dear Odin! Delicious! Amazing food, great help, great prices. Definitely going to return."}
{"text":"I would recommend this place because they have a variety of soups, salads and sandwiches. They even give you the option to pick two items to mix and match. Their dessert is amazing, however, if you do the pick two option they give you a chocolate strawberry and a slice of French bread to go with it. Their drink bar is amazing. I mix two pumps of strawberry syrup with half cup of light lemonade and sprite - it's amazing! I love the Cuban sandwich - it's my absolute favorite. The Cobb salad is pretty good and their red pepper lobster soup is out of this world! Also the soup goes really well with their croutons that you can add just for $0.69. You also have the option to create your own salad and sandwich. This place is closed on Sunday's so make sure to get your cafe zupas fix Monday through Saturday!!!"}
{"text":"We learned about this place shortly after they opened; we saw it driving by on 75th Ave and wondered what it was.  Then my daughter mentioned her friend worked there, so decided to try it out.
First, it's kind of cool to have someone waiting at the door and open it for you with a huge smile, hand you a menu and ask if you've been there before.  Our first time, she spent time going over the process with us, even though the place was jumping busy.  Once in line, there were a bunch of people working behind the counter and all were nothing but smiles and great attitudes.  We were through the line quickly with the sandwich and half-salad combo and drinks which came to $22.44.  Not bad at all.  The sandwiches were delicious, the \"half\" salads were huge and fresh and loaded with goodies and there are a lot to choose from.  I want to try a full salad next time and we have yet to try the soup.  I like the baguette slice and the chocolate dipped strawberry too, nice touch!   Cafe Zupas has become our Friday night dinner place now; our goal is to eat our way through the menu.  And...THANK YOU to all the staff for spectacular customer service."}
{"text":"Visited the new location on Rainbow and Badura. The first time we went the food was really good and fresh.  I must point out that the guy that was holding my bowl of soup was talking over it.  People should be conscious about that when handling food.  They stand and talk all over the food constantly.  Today I had hair in my soup.  When I took the bowl back up to them they asked if I wanted the same soup again rather than taking that soup out and putting fresh soup in. Then the salad I got had more tortilla strips than salad.  
I won't be back. Done!!!  Panera Bread here I come!!!"}
{"text":"Café Zupas claims to be a healthy, inexpensive alternative to regular fast food.  First, I am not sure how healthy their food is because they fail to post nutrition any nutritional information.  Second, read the menu for descriptions and don't add extras.  On a recent visit after seeing a movie at Harkins Norterra, my wife and I decided to try the place that recently opened in place of Johnny Rockets.  
I ordered Chicken  Tortilla Soup and Chicken Chop Salad, My wife ordered a pesto chicken Panini.  As we went through the line, I asked for some peas.  The peas were immersed in water and the preparer added no more than a tablespoon but also managed to dilute the miniscule blue cheese added at the beginning of the line. Then, I noticed there were no tortilla strips on the Chicken Tortilla Soup, so I asked for some.  Now, I was at register and I was charged $4.99 for the Panini, $7.99 for the soup and salad, $.59 for the peas and $.59 for the missing tortilla strips in the soup.  My wife and I sat down and tried to eat our food.  The amount of chicken, tomato bits, bacon bits and egg slices were so minimal that I felt cheated immediately.  In addition, it was watered down by the clumsy person who added the peas.  Worse than the salad, the chicken tortilla soup tasted like salt and had NOTHING in it but broth and tasteless chicken.  We tried twice to get the manager to complain, but they kept walking.  Finally, one of the floor bussers, came over and asked what was wrong.  He noticed something was wrong and went to get her.  The manager came over and asked what was wrong.  I told her the salad was watery and tasteless and had very little in it other than cheap iceberg lettuce. I also told her I could feel my blood pressure rising from the excess salt in the soup and the audacity to call it chicken tortilla soup when you charged extra for the tortilla strips.  She offered to replace it with anything else on the menu so I asked for the nutritional information.  She told me that was not made available by the company so I told her never mind, just get me a refund.  She said that was not their policy.  
This restaurant is so bad, I warn you to stay away.  For the same amount of money spent here, you can get unlimited soups and salads at Olive Garden which is so much better.  Even Sweet Tomatoes is a much better value with greater variety.  Don't waste your time or money here."}
{"text":"Walking in and very clean and modern style. Feels warm. Ordering is easy and the food tastes great. No complaints. The desserts that they have look amazing so after I ate all my food I just couldn't stop thinking if the desserts. So because it was displayed so sand well I went back and got one and it was totally worth it. I even had my fiancé get one so I could have some of his haha. Well with if to go here for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Food was Yummy! The combo is a lot of food, a whole sandwich and half salad but the half salad is huge! You get a slice of baguette and a chocolate dipped strawberry  with meal."}
{"text":"I can always count on Zupas to have fresh, healthy food.  The combo special is great.  I always get the soup and sandwich.  My fav sandwich/soup combo is Turkey Bacon Avocado and the Lobster Bisque.  Each combo comes with a chocolate covered strawberry and bread.  The new Pomergrante Coconut Water is very refreshing."}
{"text":"Love Cafe Zupas! Giving it 4 stars because sometimes the food is cold. I had the pulled pork sandwich once it was served cold, next time it was served hot. So very confusing on how it should have been served.

I now stick to just soup, salad, and a creme brulee. I really enjoy the freshness and feel I am at least eating healthier than some of the other local spots. We will always be back, but I probably won't branch out to getting another sandwich."}
{"text":"we had some sandwiches and salads brought into work from Zupas. i haven't tried their entire menu yet, but i love their italian club. really really good."}
{"text":"High prices, good soup. Not a good value. Decent interior. Appears be all fresh ingredients. Easy to spend over 10 bucks on a lunch which I try to avoid"}
{"text":"I'm a girl who can live on soup so this has become my new, favorite, go-to place!  With about a dozen soups to choose from and a dozen fresh salads too!  I've tried them all and each soup is rich and flavorful plus made in-house daily; my favorite is Lobster Bisque (with real lobster bits)!  The only caveat, I wish they would use a gluten free thickener in the soups.  The service line is usually quick and efficient along with a clean environment to dine in.  I highly recommend this place for lunch and casual weekday dinners!"}
{"text":"If you don't mind repeating your order four times to four different people, you will love this place.  You go down a line and are greeted by someone who asks for your order.  They call out some of it and then make your salads.  Then you come to a soup line and someone asks if you have any soup as part of your order.  You then proceed to a dessert case where someone new asks you to repeat your entire order and then to a cashier who, surprise, asks for your entire order and if you want any drinks.

As a family of four, this is the most annoying process.  Can'y you write it down, or have an electronic order system so you don't need to ask me four times?  Also, prepare to have at least on of your items be wrong and you need to ask to have it remade.  

The food is ok and I like their housemade drinks.  Oh, you walk in the door and you almost hit a table.  I want to love this place, but after a few visits in the last few months, I am over it.  And good luck finding parkin during peak hours."}
{"text":"Catering was great! Very accomodating. Showed up on time and the food was very fresh and tasty! Will definitely use again."}
{"text":"The first time my fiance and I went to Zupas, we weren't fans at all. I don't remember exactly what we ordered, but the food did not taste fresh. My finace's salad was made completely with iceberg lettuce. In fact, it became the butt of our jokes afterwards.

But for some reason, recently, all of our friends suddenly started talking about how good Zupas was. We couldn't understand it. They talked us into going back with them.  I'll admit, the food was tastier this time. I had a BBQ Pork Sandwich and my fiance had an Asian Citrus salad. It was better, at least the salad had nutrition, and my BBQ pork sandwich did taste good, but it tasted like something I could cook, and my fiance has made better herself. Look, there's Sweet Tomatoes, Paradise Bakery, Wildflower Bread Company, all of these places are much better than Zupas. There's really no need for anyone to go to Zupas when there are better places that serve similar but better food all within a mile of it. 

I will give them the benefit that the interior looks pretty sleak and clean, but that's really all they've got going for them."}
{"text":"a great quick spot to grab a sandwich and a salad.
they let you sample any of the soups which is quite a menu
I think it was very reasonably priced and they even throw in a free
chocolate covered strawberry
you cant beat that for a quick lunch spot"}
{"text":"No soup for you!

 My friends and I enjoy going to lunch at Zupas  Cafe.  Zupas resembles a cafeteria style with fresh salads, soups, and sandwiches. Once you enter Zupas you are greeted at the door as an employee pass out menus to view while waiting in line.

 I usually choose to create my own salad, well make that a  half salad and  it is always delicious. My salad creation consist of iceberg lettuce, chicken, apples, cranberries, strawberries, topped with cinnamon almonds and strawberry vingerette dressing.  Oh did I mention Zupas give a piece of bread and a chocolate cover cherry with every order.  

Zupas offers great value deals. The choose 2 deal is  any sandwich, soup, or salad at a great price. I think the sandwiches are fair but that is only because they are trumped by the delicious varieties of soup.  Zupas will let you sample all their wonderful soups before you decide.  You have to try the vegetable chowder it is amazing.

So if you want a great bowl of soup give Zupas a try."}
{"text":"My food was good. Had the turkey bacon ranch sandwich and the half bowl of the Garden Soup. The soup was ok, altogether it was good.
My friends soup was cold, she took it to the counter, asked them to heat it, the girl rolled her eyes at her and gave her a 2nd bowl; said to just keep the first bowl. The 2nd bowl was cold as well so she asked again for it to be heated. They finally heated it up to an acceptable temperature.

Ok setting
Decent food
Poor service
Dont know if I'll come back to this location again. The location in Henderson is great though."}

{"text":"Soup For You

Recently, my friends and I went to  Zupas for lunch. Zupas resembles a cafeteria-style, with fresh salads, soups, and sandwiches. We were greeted at the door as a  employee passed out menus to view while waiting in line. I choose to create my own salad  (half salad) and it was delicious. Iceberg lettuce, chicken, apples, cranberries, asiago cheese, topped with cinnamon pecans and pomegranate dressing.  Oh did I mention Zupas gives bread and a chocolate covered strawberries with every order.


Zupas offers value deals. The choose two deal (sandwich,soup, or salad) is fairly priced but the sandwiches are pretty average tasting, nothing all that special.  Maybe that is because they are trumped by their delicious soup (chicken enchilada chili).


The service is friendly and quick with no lunch line hold up. Plenty of seating with  employees who happily picked up our empty plates.  An excellent option for a quick, or leisurely, lunch that won't put a dent in your wallet."}
{"text":"Nice place!

Was here for a job interview. They have an amazing menu of things to try and whenever I get over there again I will try it. I did have an Italian Soda the day I was there, which as cool. A wide variety of add-ins you can jazz your drink up with. The soups, salads, and sandwiches I saw looked and smelled absolutely delicious. I will definitely get over there on a  weekend sometime to try their food and take in the total experience. I have had good recommendations about this place from friends."}
{"text":"Fresh stuff. Good ambiance.
Only drawback - very stingy with their portions. This place is new and I think they are still learninf."}
{"text":"This is my 3rd time here! And I Love it! Every time I walk its clean and welcoming. My only concern is the way to the line to order you have to walk through the tables to get to order your meal. Besides that customer service wonderful everyone is very attentive of the clientele and the service! With Your choice of order you get a slice of bread and a chocolate covered strawberry w your order. And not to mention any dressings on the side are free! Definitely a new eating spot"}
{"text":"Yummy food . I decided to go in a do all of my yelp reviews today and almost forgot to add this place ! Food is delicious .. one comment : workers should try and smile a little more"}
{"text":"They always mess up my order, no communication between employees, small sandwiches for the price you pay for. Not coming back to this place"}
{"text":"Love It better then sweet tomatoes &besides paneras broccoli soup I can say it's at 1 for me (:"}
{"text":"I LOVE Zupas, don't get me wrong. But this Zupas is struggling. Came in for lunch, walked right up to order and everything. But when we got our salads they were WAY smaller than our normal Zupas location ever makes them. A little disappointing especially because this place isn't cheap..."}
{"text":"Nice place, good healthy food, free chocolate covered strawberries with order. Bit overpriced, but for comfy atmosphere its understandable.
 If someone forgot iPhone today around 4 pm, ask cashier, I find that phone and give to cashier, ok?"}
{"text":"I usually love Zupas I used to work for the company in fact but this location is a bunch of young kids who don't care we went 1 hour before close maybe an hour and a half and it's like they don't even acknowledge our presence or care they were to busy talking to each other and cleaning I wasn't even asked if I wanted desserts or drinks they were to busy trying to put it all away and when we paid the food was just sitting there the cashier didn't even bother to tray it up or anything if it was busy I would understand but we were the only ones in line Zupas has gone downhill"}
{"text":"Fresh food. Good sandwiches. Great customer services, awesome menu. Im officially a fan now."}
{"text":"I don't care for the deli meats but the fresh desserts, soups and salads are delish. I don't like the loud ambiance so I get it Togo. Nice healthy lunch spot."}
{"text":"Excellent. This place is what Panera Bread wants to be. Lots of variety. Very fresh."}
{"text":"Always wanted to check this place out. Looking for healthy food options? Then this is the place to go to. The combinations of soups to salads to sandwiches there is something for everyone. Even those who have that sweet tooth can indulge in chocolate covered strawberries, Crete brûlée or cheesecake. Chicken pesto sandwich with the tomato basil soup is choice you can't go wrong with."}
{"text":"The food here is always great and the staff are always friendly.  I just wish they were open on Sunday!  Everything I have tried here is great."}
{"text":"A couple of senior citizens, my wife and I stopped in midday, midweek, and each got a delicious salad. I ordered the chipotle glazed braised pork. My service was prompt and friendly. (wasn't crowded, and they weren't working too hard, no stress.) 20 bucks, including change for the tip jar. 

I got a large size salad and ate it all. My wife brought home half of her salad, apparently bigger than mine-- or maybe I was just hungrier :-). My wife is thinking of taking a good friend there for her birthday lunch. I would go back, too, especially if someone invited me:-D. Good, healthy options."}
{"text":"Food looks and tastes fresh. I like that they have a good selection of soups and salads. However, it is not a place to go if you have a big appetite. It definitely won't fill you up. The soda machine is out in front so you can get your own drinks. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Really disappointed! Been eye-ing this place for a while and finally got to go lunch here today and it was not what I expected. 

I ordered the California protein Cobb salad and it's like those pictures of McDonald's burgers you see on commercials and when you get the real thing it doesn't even look similar. 

There were no tomatoes or olives. Hardly any chicken, like maybe 1 whole SMALL piece. Basically just lettuce and 1 egg and a few pieces of bacon and cheese...

I love a lot of vegetables in my salad and this was mediocre and false advertising lol

The cauliflower soup however, was delicious. Could of been a better first experience. Not sure if I'll go back"}
{"text":"This is my favorite location, every now then my family and I come by here and they are always helpful and nice and funny! They always have great suggestions for what to try and I love the price and the variety of what they have!"}
{"text":"Love the food here but, kids that work here are not too smart with orders...came here 2 days in a row and they made me wait and messed up my order both times...I guess it's really confusing to add extra soup on top of combo of soup and sandwich"}
{"text":"Went for lunch. Ordered the ultimate grilled cheese creamy veg soup. Soup was lukewarm but very tasty. If you wanted croutons or cheddar on top extra charge.
Ultimate grilled cheese, not so ultimate. I expected tons of cheese and there just wasn't that much.
My friend ordered the summer chicken salad, lots do lettuce but very skimpy on the chicken. 
Overall, a bit pricy for what it is.  I prefer Jason's Deli or the corner bakery, or Mimi's.  My lunch was over 9 with tax and no drink."}
{"text":"The food is really good. They have soup, salads and hot and cold sandwiches. Similar to a panera bread but what makes them better is that with a pick 2 you get a full sandwich and all meals come with bread and a chocolate dipped strawberry. The only negative this about this place is that the AC hits you right at the table making your food cold faster."}
{"text":"Zupas is a classic for a refreshing lunch. You don't leave feeling like ya sucked down some greasy soaked bun. I usually choose the sandwich and soup and like to change the sandwich up as much as possible. The lobster bisque is divine (look at my words, I'm getting Yelpy). The atmosphere is inviting and bright. The staff has always been chic-fil-a status, meaning always prompt and courteous. We'll be coming back soon. P.s. it's good place to go when you've been sick for days on end. The soup is comforting."}
{"text":"I've been a long time fan of Cafe Zupas. This was my first time to this location. The restaurant is very clean and bright inside, but a little small for how crowded of a location it is. I went during the lunch rush and had to stand with my tray for a few (like 5) minutes for a table to open up. The staff is very friendly and helpful. The man in front of me in line was unhappy with his sandwich and they quickly made him a new one without any hassle, which was nice to see. The food was great and fresh as usual with Zupas. I got the pesto chicken sandwich w/o sprouts- delicious! I also recommend the Maui Tropical Chicken salad. The pineapple vinaigrette is amazing! I like the chocolate hazelnut Creme brûlées too. the little chocolate square in it is fun to eat! My only complaint with this location is that it was quite noisy- the place was packed and there was loud music playing too. I had to almost shout my order. I'm sure it's much more quiet if you come between the lunch and dinner rush. Overall it was great! Nice job Zupas! :)"}
{"text":"Omg. there's a bug on my clam chowder soup! I had a to go of New England Clam Chowder earlier. Gonna eat it tomorrow for breakfast but I decided to eat some tonight. (Preggy cravings) As I was enjoying my soup, I noticed that there were legs and wings of a bug not sure if it's a bee or a fly :( and it looks like it is cooked along with the potato as it was so attached to it. I really love their soups but this time i'll stop going there now. Hopefully, it won't harm my baby :("}
{"text":"This place is really good.  It has a great selection of sandwiches, soups and salads.  You can get a combo for $7.99 and a kids combo for $3.99.  All combos come with a cocolate covered strawberry!  Yum!  They also have a good drink station where you can create your own drinks!  This place is nicely decorated and the staff is helpful and friendly!"}
{"text":"Solid five stars within its class - fast casual. We've come here for lunch a number of times and never have been disappointed. No matter how busy it gets there is always someone assigned to the dining room to ensure the tables are cleared and cleaned quickly for the next customer to sit down. The servers are always fast and friendly. The sandwiches, Panini's, salads and soups, are always fresh and tasty. The chocolate dipped strawberry that they give along with each meal is a nice touch!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place and have frequented it since they first opened here in Henderson. Service is always nice, but I'm not a huge fan of the line system. You usually have to repeat your order 2-3 times before you're done paying, which is not a big deal but can get a little bothersome when you've ordered several things or when it's very busy (mix-ups and misses can happen easily).

The main reason my review is less than five stars is because they don't offer nutrition information. I've asked at the restaurant and have also tried to find it on their online website. Given the amount of locations this restaurant has, I feel that I should be able to easily find this information, but unfortunately cannot.

Although prices have gone up slightly since this location first opened, I think the food here is still a good value for what you pay, especially if you order the combo. My favorite picks are the honey bacon club and enchilada soup (+ tortilla strips). They also have a bunch of flavored syrups for your drink, which is a nice plus if you like that sort of thing. Also, I love that a chocolate strawberry is added to every order! Great place for a simple and satisfying lunch."}
{"text":"A few notables:

fresh
great choices
generous portions
wifi
great service
Crystal Light! 
chocolate covered strawberries
lobster bisque
comfortable seating

I will definitely be back, and I'd recommend Cafe Zupas to anyone who likes soups, salads, and sandwiches for lunch. There were so many things on the menu I can't wait to go back and try!"}
{"text":"This is one of those places that you walk in, look at their menu, and think \"everything looks freakin amazing.\"  But then you eat the food and you realize you've been lied to. This is essentially the same concept as paradise bakery or panera bread, and you'd be better off going to either of those. The soup was bland, the salad dressings too sweet, and the sandwiches are slightly better than subway.  

The service was great though.  Very nice employees.  But still...go somewhere else"}
{"text":"Summary: Appears to be a healthy alternative but....not really. Employees are apparently completely disempowered from providing good customer service. 

The whole experience feels miserly and like you're being nickled and dimed---tightwad and penny pinching---no sense of abundance, good spiritedness, or generosity. The company seems to provide the very least for the very most money.  Not a good feeling. I won't be back.

Portions *absurdly* small.  The healthy salads are laughably little, with just a few of the ingredients listed scattered around.  Sandwiches came with the most scant, minimal amount of meat and other ingredients possible. The \"New England Crab Salad\" is fake crab that tastes like plastic. The turkey is essentially turkey LOAF. There is no roast beef. Weird overabundance of pork on the menu.  

I asked for whipped cream on my cake and the manager told me they are only \"authorized\" to put whipped cream on cheesecake---and because there is no pricing for 1 DOLLOP of whipped cream, he would not put whipped cream on my cake.

The soups are very tasty -- but portions are ludicrous for the price.  They hold up the size of the container and then LITERALLY fill it 2/3 of the way. I asked them to fill it up, and the manager told the employee \"You can reportion that\" (like a robot talking), and the employee did the same exact thing again.  I said \"I don't understand why you're putting so little in there---there's almost an INCH between the top of the container!\"  He said \"We are authorized to give you only 2 ladles of soup for the Large.\"

I felt like the character in the movie \"Oliver\" ---over and over again---  \"Please, sir....may I have some more?\" and the response an astonished \"MOOOORRRE?!?!?!?\" ha ha

So disappointing. Thought I'd found a healthy delicious alternative, but it's just customer exploitation....a mean-fisted cheap operation that doesn't let its employees go off script (not fair to them and not fair to customers)"}
{"text":"I love zupas, and have gone to every one in this city. This particular one has messed up my order almost every time I have been there. When you order, they try to rush you down the line to pay. I now tell them no, and that I want to watch them make my food because past orders have been incorrect. The times I do this, this employees are clearly unhappy with me about it. Which I'm not sure why considering I'm just making sure they do it the right way (which many times I have to tell them that they aren't). Cafe zupas has great food, and it's also a little pricey for a small little soup, salad and sandwich cafe. Which I don't mind paying extra because they're ingredients are always super fresh and delicious. But I do mind paying extra when I get all the way home and (for example) realize that my \"chicken\" salad has no chicken. Need to train Their employees better. Hoping another one opens up soon that's by where I live so I don't keep chancing that this one will learn their recipes/ingredients."}
{"text":"Love Zupas!! This Paradise bakery style fast service restaurant is one of my favorite lunch spots. Located across from town and country, within the camelback colonnade, it's perfect for when you need a break from shopping or running errands. It has very affordable options, I like doing the try two with a sandwich and soup. Every combo comes with a piece of bread and a chocolate dipped strawberry. They have an extensive soft drink selection, a syrup bar to flavor your Soda, tea or lemonade, and charging stations for laptops or phones so you can work while you eat. Generally I spend around $10 on my lunch, maybe a little more if I get one of their very rich desserts."}
{"text":"We were in town visiting from Sacramento and someone took us here for lunch and we loved it we ate there 3 days in the row .. Wish we had this place back home the closer thing to this we have is Panera Bread .."}
{"text":"Cafe zupas is fresh with great food,  good WiFi and great service. A little more for women than men I guess (chocolate covered strawberries with your meal),  But as a guy I still like it. Feels like new tastes.  I love the paninis."}
{"text":"First time here. The line was almost out the door when we got here but it moved pretty quickly. The menu has a good variety and it pretty reasonably priced. It was nice to see how many salad topping options there were. You get Italian soda mix ins with your fountain drinks and that was fun to play around with. There were some really delicious looking desserts but we didn't get any (this time, but next time...). You get a chocolate dipped strawberry with every meal too. The food was pretty good, fresh and light. 
They have rolling booted seats/car seat holders and long tables for families. We sat in a booth and had our car seat in one of the holders and felt really in the way from the people squeezing to get by."}
{"text":"Our daughter's school did a dine out night fundraiser so we decided to go eat and support that event. I'm sad to say we won't be back. The tomato basil soup was fair and my husband's red pepper lobster soup was awful. I also thought the panini I ordered was ok at best. The restaurant is kind of bland and plain too. We did enjoy the chocolate covered strawberry that accompanied the soup, salad, sandwhich but that won't bring us back."}
{"text":"I love their sandwiches, soup, and their salads! Both times I went here I ordered the cheese soup, and it was definitely good! I have tried their various salads at work where zupas was catered and all were good. I like their turkey sandwich (served hot). They also have a variety of soda flavors to make your own \"italian soda\", which I appreciated! Also mini creme brulee deserts."}
{"text":"Eight employees behind the salad soup bar, only one working. What a nice first impression the first time I came here. 

Honestly, I don't have many good things to say about this place. I will say that they do have good food. That's why they get some stars. But... The customer service isn't good and they offer small portions for the price they charge. Don't get me wrong, the pricing is fair for the portion of other things except salads. I ordered a Strawberry Harvest with Chicken Salad and I saw the girl put a very small scoop of chicken on it... meaning  she didn't fill to scoop and it was all small pieces of chicken. I said something and she said I would be charged $1.79 extra for more chicken. I told her she didn't even fill one scoop, how was that fair for what I'm already paying? She said \"Well that's just out price for portions.\" 

I have had a few friendly employers here but I've gotten a lot of attitude from employees more and they make it look like it's so hard to work... I've been here a few times because it's convenient and I like the salads and soups... But honestly, they've officially lost my business. 

If you don't care for good service and being cheated out of proportions, I would recommend their salads that have fruit and the cauliflower soup is delightful."}
{"text":"I've only eaten here once so far but I like it.  I had the Thai Peanut sandwich and the tomato basil soup.  I thought the sandwich was very good and unlike the other review regarding the tomato basil soup, I really enjoyed it.  The food is good and I enjoy the colorful appearance from the outside.  In fact, that's what drew me to the place.  I'm usually on my way to Paradise Bakery or Firehouse Subs when I'm in this parking lot but the flashy and colorful lights drew us in and we liked what we found inside."}
{"text":"Excellent food, but their process is completely broken. Getting to the register, you are forced to recite your entire order again in exact detail, or you are sure to get someone else's lunch. And every time, there is mass confusion. Zupas, please fix your broken process so I can come back more often."}
{"text":"So I noticed some fellow Yelpers checking in here and since it just down the street from me just had to try it.  I love deli food and the thought of another good deli near me was too much to pass up on.  We each got a soup and sandwich combo and a couple of salads. I had the Turkey Bacon Avocado with the Wild Mushroom Soup.  The wife got the BBQ Pork with the Lobster Bisque and the daughter got the Crab Sandwich with the Cauliflower soup.
   The Wild mushroom was very good.  Creamy and with those amazing tasty mushrooms.  It was exactly what I expected.  The Turkey Bacon Avocado sandwich was also very good.  The bread was still crisp and the turkey and bacon were pretty tasty.  It had a decent amount of avocado which was prefect as it added to the overall taste but didn't turn the sandwich into a mushy mess.  I did try the Lobster Bisque and Cauliflower soups and they were both very good.  The Lobster Bisque was chunky with more lobster than I expected.  I would definitely order it again.  The Cauliflower soup was creamy and surprisingly delicious.  I did not think I was going to like it but hey you just never know sometimes.  I did get  taste of the crab sandwich and it was pretty good too and would gladly order it again.  I didn't try the BBQ Pork sandwich but according to the wife it was nothing to write home about.  She said it was OK.  
We got the Mango and Asian Chicken salads and although they were good I don't think they are a good value so I will stick with Soup and Sandwiches next time.  
    Since they had just recently opened I am not sure if the inside was done but it had a very casual feel to it.  I would call it modern industrial but hey I am no designer so not sure what they are going for as far as looks.  The staff was super friendly but too plentiful.  I would assume this is due to recently opening and doing OJT with new employees.  I ill be back but wait a month or so to see how this place matures.  A good addition to Rainbow and the SW of Vegas."}
{"text":"For me, it's all about the soup, but they do have salads and sandwiches as well. I usually have the combo with a salad and a bowl of soup. They have a variety of stock salads or you can choose your own ingredients. I like the Chicken Chop Salad(chicken, sliced egg, bacon, and black olives) and always, but always, the Lobster Bisque. I could probably just order a couple bowls of this bisque and be happy! It's delicious! Their salads are good, but they'd be better if they didn't skimp on the toppings.Their sandwiches are served on a nice pannini bread with enough filling to satisfy. With the soups and salads, you also get a slice of fresh baguette....and always a chocolate-covered strawberry to finish. They have some amazing desserts, but the Creme Brulee is to die for!"}
{"text":"I was so excited when I saw that Café Zupas was going right by my business. I have now been there my fair share of times for lunch and the food is always yummy, quick and for the most part healthy. I love that I know which items are vegetarian without asking   and can get any type of protein (like tofu) on any of the salads. My favorite thing to eat is the mushroom soup and who doesn't love the chocolate covered strawberries they give out with each meal! One of my favorite things as a mom for 4 kids is that when our whole family goes there it only costs us around $30, that is cheaper than getting drive thru food! Definitely a win in my book!"}
{"text":"Chocolate covered strawberries with my meal as a treat? Yes please!  I went there for the first time last week and had the Thai salad with tofu and it was very yummy. They are quick, efficient and my pocket really likes their prices. The only problem was that we don't have a location near my house (aawwwhhh) BUT I just found out that they are opening another location in Dana Park (Val Vista and Baseline ) wwwwweeeeee! Do you know where you can find me for lunch in the near future?? Café Zupas!!"}
{"text":"I will never ever eve get tired of this place ..its Uhhmazing...the lobster bisque is to die for and the paninis and salads are great I keep trying something new and love it all.."}
{"text":"This review is just for today's experience with Zupas..You just opened 20 minutes ago and you're out of three types of soups? Then when I asked and employee, why they're all out of soup I get \" I dunno man\". So disappointed in Cafe Zupas today."}
{"text":"Meh.. Not great and not horrible. The salads are decent portions, and all my friends that got the soup said they really liked it. The sandwiches were small, there are three sandwich shops now all in the same shopping center.  I personally think beach hut deli has better portion, and better tasting sandwiches. While this place is good, it doesn't stand out to me."}
{"text":"Pretty good food looked pre packaged but tasted good. Interesting atmosphere, very modern."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant when it first opened expecting it to be just another sandwich shop. I was wrong. I love the way the restaurant is laid out making it more open and spacious, the people here are extremely friendly and the service is excellent. I love the Asian Bar B Que pork sandwich and the gumbo soup. Our family visit here anytime we have an itching for some food with fresh ingredient. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"I am now a fan of Zupas... not because their food is anything overwhelmingly new or world-changing, but they have clear-cut vegan options labeled on the menu.  This means I didn't have to place an order with a bunch of subtractions and additions.  =)
I had the quinoa and kale salad, no nuts, and it was awesome.  I usually don't love a lot of fruit on my salad, but these fruits go really, really well with their vinaigrette.  I want to find that vinaigrette recipe and make it myself at home!   Since they had a lunch special where you could choose 2 items (half sandwich, half salad, cup of soup), I got the roasted veggie soup, which also contained quinoa so double bonus for me!  I didn't get too adventurous with my order, but they have a full salad bar of proteins, veggies and toppings, so I'm guessing you can design your own salad or substitute something if need be.  They even had tofu (which I don't care for cold), but it is an option.  Zupas is pretty reasonably priced and comparable with other similar establishments (Paradise, Wildflower, Jason's Deli).  The big difference feels like they are churning out cleaner and healthier food, which makes me appreciate it more."}
{"text":"Is it special?  Depends on your perspective. Amongst the vast ranks of franchises or chains, yes it is. This means it's a very good and very safe option for a fresh(er) food and high quality customer service experience. It isn't special. About that Customer Service, it is good, but the vibe from the people here seems artificially happy. Almost creepy sticky sweet. Better than rude or could-give-a-crap that you get other places. Just seems weird to me."}
{"text":"Great place for a quick lunch. Customer service is outstanding! I order the salad & sandwich combo ($8). The food is fresh & prepared quickly."}
{"text":"Came back to Cafe Zupas and got a pretty good bowl of clam chowder. I've tried a lot of soups here and they are all delicious. I would say my favorites are the mushroom and lobster bisque. They also have a really good variety of salads which are also delicious. 

I really like this place but the reasons for my 3 star rating is because of the sandwiches and the conveyer belt style ordering system. It is a very mechanical system. This would work if there was better communication among the staff. Almost every time the last person I talk to is asking me what I ordered and has to scramble back down the line to find out. Also If you only do 3 things (soups, salad, sandwiches) then you should be able to pay more attention to detail. The sandwiches are sub par and not put together very well. I would recommend if you come here to stick to the soup and salad."}
{"text":"My go to place when I don't bring a lunch to work. I think I've just about tried everything on the menu and I don't have a complaint about any of them. It's pretty decently priced for the quality. My favorite has to be the ultimate grilled cheese and red pepper lobster bisque. I recently had the cheesecake and of course it's to die for!!!! This place is so yummy!"}
{"text":"The place was clean, good options but the portions are too small for the price. Salad were ok but small compared to same price salad at, say, Corner Bakery. Tortilla Soup had a good flavor and lots of chicken in it but wasn't as hot as soup should be served so after a couple bites I gave up, not wanting to take any chances. Ranch dressing was very watery which is not usually my experience with Ranch dressing, so that was an indicator that though they put on a good front this place is cutting quite a few corners. Won't rule out future visits but will keep looking."}
{"text":"Reminds me of when a guy \"messes up\" and sends flowers to your work to make everything okay. Cafe Zupas tries this trick with the delicious chocolate covered strawberry with every meal. 

Not bad. Not the greatest. I cannot give it anymore than three stars from my first meal with them. 

Ultimate Grilled Cheese- Cheddar, Muenster, Tomatoes & House-made Pesto Sauce. This was good. The bread reminds me of the two ends nobody wants to eat in the loaf. Once I got past that thought I actually enjoyed the sandwich. Good job Zupas.

Tomato Basil with Orzo Pasta- This shit was sweeter than the chocolate covered strawberry! I hated it and only took two bites (because I will try anything twice). I also sampled the Chicken Tortilla- too salty, the Wild Mushroom- too salty. Maybe I am just one picky Mofo when it comes to soups, but they just don't work for me.

Chocolate Covered Strawberry- She was a beauty. She made everything better. So much better I almost forgot how much I disliked the soups!

I can see myself coming back here to try the Thai Peanut Chicken Sandwich and one of their twelve different salads. I will have to get past the fact:

They have sooooo many minions, I mean employees. It's fucking overkill and the exact opposite experience I want to have on my lunch break. 

The way the interior is designed flares up my Claustrophobia. Again, not what I find appealing. 

Other than those minor issues I will be back to hopefully bump them up a star. For now, I am leaving this place alone until the rest of the town tries it and just finds it's nothing special."}
{"text":"4.5 stars for taste and price of the lobster grilled cheese. Yummy!

The creme brulee and lobster bisque were decent.  3.0 stars.  Nothing exciting.  Nothing in comparison to the ones I used to make.

Overall a good sandwich shop.  Will come again.  Sandwich tastes healthy and I felt great afterward for hours.  It's a good sign they use good quality ingredients."}
{"text":"Love this place, I go at least twice a week. This place is so much better than the other ones in town. They have the most amazing tomato soup I have ever had, it is very different but so yummy. Their customer service is outstanding, I'm always in and out in a timely manner. Oh and the best part? You get a free chocolate covered strawberry with every meal!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite lunch places. Try their tomato soup, it is so good and different than the typical tomato soup. Also you get free chocolate covered strawberry with every meal, can't beat that"}
{"text":"I love this place!  I visit every time I am in Phoenix.  I always have the Tomato Basil soup.  I have not had a single bad experience at a Cafe Zupas restaurant."}
{"text":"Love this place.  I don't get how it is not more popular in California or elsewhere for that matter.  I had never heard of it till we moved to LV.   
   This place is perfect for my large family to get a reasonable priced, fairly healthy meal.    We will be here often.

    I love the strawberry salad with goat cheese substituted.   And I have not had a soup that I did not like.   Cauliflower was the biggest surprise, and is amazing."}
{"text":"Today is the first day they're open and I figured I'd try it out.  I am totally satisfied. I had a small, Pina Colada salad and I can still taste it.  I had a sample of the chicken enchilada soup and will be back for that.  I am pretty excited about a new place to eat that has SO MANY CHOICES it will be easy to keep coming back."}
{"text":"Amazing.. fresh food..my new favorite Sandwich soup salad spot..so many healthy options to pick from glad I stopped by :)"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely incredible.  If you are a soup lover... this is where you need to be.  I don't even like soup, but I love being here.  We discovered it about two weeks ago, and I have been here about 6 time since.  I always eat and buy couple more cups to go home.  MUST VISIT"}
{"text":"My chicken tortilla soup was so salty I could not eat it and I should have said something.  I like salt but this really had too much. The chicken salad was fine. The chocolate covered strawberry was a nice touch. The bread was just ok. My husband had Irish stew. He liked it even though the meat and potatoes were finely chopped. He really enjoyed his salad 
My daughter in law loves it there. The idea is great but u have had better"}
{"text":"I was waiting for my friends to arrive and I notice they had electronic recharging stations.  What a Plus!!!! Cafe Zupas had my vote and I hadn't even ordered yet.  We have all been to soup,sandwich,salad shops before, but not like this one.  The options were unique, they made it in front of you, and the food was SUPER yummy.  I have to say, Zupas will be my choice over Panera now."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, so even after a bad experience the first time (thinking they were just having an off day), I decided to try again. Stale bread, off tasting turkey, lukewarm soup, and a mushy chocolate covered strawberry. Ugh! When I spoke to the manager, she obviously wasn't interested in what I had to say. I didn't necessarily want my money back but an \"I'm so sorry\" would have helped! Don't waste your time and $ here. Just go to one of the many other restaurants here who serve good food and care about what their customers think."}
{"text":"Turkey avocado sandwich and Caesar salad are really good!!! But the breads all get hard quick"}
{"text":"Love love the food here. This place has healthy food.  From the salads to the sandwich"}
{"text":"Went to Zupas for the first time and was extremely disappointed.  The food served didn't match the pictures of the food on the wall in the least which was very confusing.  I ordered Lobster Bisque soup, got something that didn't look like Bisque at all, but when I asked if a mistake had been made the counter person argued with me and didn't listen to my concerns.  Ambience is mixed, they want you to feel comfortable dining in but the plastic silverware and multiple tables sitting with the remnants of meals for an extended period of time makes me feel uncomfortable and rush to leave.  The service was simply disinterested, teenagers chatting with each other and ignoring the customers.

In summary this was a hugely disappointing visit and I would strongly not recommend Zupas as a dining choice due to so-so food and very poor service."}
{"text":"This place would get 0 stars if the pulled pork sandwich wasnt spot on. salads were very mediocre. not sure why this place gets the reviews it gets but it is fast and has some unique features such as the charging station. food was blah. got the tomato soup mac n cheese couple diff salads and a carmel cookie. You can get better soup from the can and better salad at sweet tomatos. not for me"}
{"text":"This place is off the chain, please continue and keep up the CLEANING of the restaurant. Oh and get bigger strawberries. Lol"}
{"text":"So I'm price conscious about salads.  But I can never get my homemade salad to look or taste as awesome as Cafe Zupas.  Every salad option looks appetizing.  I like one to fill me up since they're just greens.  The Thai Coconut Tofu protein salad bowl does just that!

I'm peculiar about the way they fill their soup bowls though.  Is it by weight or does it depend who's serving?  Well a half order is already a premade bowl so if its by weight that's just ppptthhh.  I'll give em yay points for their soup selections anyway.  So far I've tasted three - all really good.  I don't yet have a favorite.  The great thing is they allow you to taste it before you order.

Dessert is available! Yeah-uusss... Not too many selections, but its nice they sell it, especially their creme brulees.  Yep go ahead LOOK and STARE.  

The customer service greetings are pretty general: Hi welcome! How are you? For here or to go? Would you like to try a sample? Will there be anything else for you? Can I offer you a dessert? There you go kids... if you're about to start the job experience workforce in foodservice, that's my 10 cents right there.

Customers walk thru a people guided ordering system.  With their sometimes long lines, it helps and the lines flow pretty quickly.  The pay system is also jiffy; run your card, no signature, and your receipt spits out.  Have a nice day!

Review is a one star lacker only cuz the soup issue and maaaaybe so-so pricey.  I'd still come back anyway."}
{"text":"Been here twice now. Only had soup. But they seem to have a wide variety on their menu. Sandwiches , soups and salads. I think the soups border in the Salty side ( but I like salt ). My only critique is that they don't fill the container. \" we leave room for toppings \". But I guess it's how they portion their stuff. Will definitely return. Great lunch spot."}
{"text":"You cannot customize the sandwiches, all I wanted was spinach and told with a crappy excuse that they cannot add it on to charge it..."}
{"text":"VERY small portions. I ordered a LARGE chicken chop salad and it was surprisingly small with hardly anything in it and whatever was in it was miniscule but the ranch dressing was good. Then we had the ultimate grilled cheese sandwich.....I attached a picture of it and you decide if it looks \"ultimate\" or not. The chocolate strawberry was good.  Bland clam chowder soup and just okay cauliflower soup makes this place a no return for us. I really wanted to like this place but  I could have gotten a better salad at a fast food joint."}
{"text":"Expensive, food is average at best. Portions are small, if you have more than two people in your party the checkout will frustrate you...as they have no idea what you ordered. Go to Paradise Bakery..same shopping center, better food."}
{"text":"Nice high tech decor with recharge bar for all our devices.

Friendly staff.

The food is very average but for a soup + a grilled cheese sandwich + a chocolate strawberry + an unlimited refill drink for 3.99, what can you expect ?
The soup I choose was tomato and he had some little pasta inside, my friend had the mushroom one and liked it too. 
The grilled cheese sandwich has nothing special and the cheese they use hardly taste like cheese, American cheddar I presume (looks like it).
Chocolate strawberry to end on a sweet taste. One bite strawberry as it's very small and not very tasty.

This is the place you go to when you're in a hurry and you want an healthier option than a burger or a fried chicken place. 
Other than that i'll pass my way."}
{"text":"I love this place it is clean and the food is very delicious as well healthy. They give you the perfect amount of food for the price. The staff are amazingly nice and respectful. Thumbs up for here its rare to have an awesome lunch spot that never disappoints!"}
{"text":"the California turkey sandwich was awesome! im a \"big guy\" and i could barely finish my sandwich.  the chocolate dipped macadamia nut cookies were out of control crazzzzy good!! the chocolate dipped strawberries were amazing as well."}
{"text":"Simply amazing first impression! Great layout and menus. The staff is super helpful and the food was great. I can't imagine a better heathy meal for such a quick visit."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite place to go for salad  and soup fresh made in front of you. I love the soups nice to have something refreshing. Especially their flavored waters you can pick from instead of sodas. Recommend everyone to try this place it's addictive"}
{"text":"So this is a very typical cafe style place with soups, salads, and sandwiches. I dropped in for a quick lunch on a weekday and was met with a healthy, but not too overwhelming line. I wanted to grab half a veggie sandwich and a bowl of soup, but was informed that they could only do whole sandwiches. I ended up getting a combo with the vegetarian sandwich and the tomato basil soup *comes with a bit of orzo in it*. I wasn't expecting a side of bread and a chocolate covered strawberry with my meal so that was a pleasant surprise! Tastewise, the sandwich was just okay. It was bland even though it had both hummus and banana peppers in it. I ended up putting hot sauce on it to add some flavor and ultimately dipped it into the soup for taste. The soup was good, but a tiiiny bit grainy. 

Overall, service was great, but the food lacked flavor and didn't seem to be worth the price."}
{"text":"A place we don't have in Houston. Took a chance and worked out great. Recommend getting the two item special. Ample food and good value. We found are soups and salads tasty and a good size. Not too small and not too big. The only complaint I had was the soup was not hot enough, but I like my food hot. Chocolate dipped strawberry with each meal is a nice touch."}
{"text":"Pro's.   
Good  clean location
Quality food
Taste sandwich
Great tasting soups


Con's
Not a lot of food w each order
Salads are funny....5 things on a salad. Scoops are so small its funny. 3 small cherry tomatoes, onions mini spoon full, everything is measured right down to 2 olives. Kind of comes off tacky. There are other deli's that you get better value and more food."}
{"text":"Wow no wonder this place is hoppin! The salad options are incredible. Seriously some of the best ranch I've ever had.  I ordered a 1/2 chicken chop salad & full California sandwich came out to $9 with a drink not bad considering you usually pay that price for 1/2 salad 1/2 which elsewhere.  The full salads are huge!  They have a nice selection of hot sauce and free Italian soda mix ins no sugar free ones but a nice touch.  

Customer service was great everyone was real friendly & prompt,  very clean & modern inside"}
{"text":"There isn't much in the way of healthy food near where I work, so I was very happy to see this place open up.  It is amazing.  I had the Pick 2 deal for $8.79 which I chose the Honey Bacon Club Panini and 1/2 of the Citrus Spinach Salad.  It was great!   The salad was especially amazing!   It had a Blood Orange Vinaigrette, which was one of the best salad dressings I've ever had.  It included Mandarin Oranges, Baby Spinach, Dried Cranberries, and Goat Cheese.  The sandwich had Turkey, Ham, Bacon and Muenster Cheese with Honey Mustard.  Both were very good.  The service was VERY FAST and they had plenty of help.  The place was very clean.  The ingredients were very fresh as well.  The downside of it is that the place isn't well lit at night.  I've driven by it many times thinking they were closed.  However, they stay open until 9pm, except on Friday & Saturday when they're open until 10pm.  They need some outside lights.  One thing VERY DISCOURAGING is that they are closed on Sundays.  Lucky for their employees I guess, but I don't get how chain businesses do this?!    Other than that, it was great and will be a very frequent dinner spot.

Downgraded this tonight from four stars to three stars.  The food is incredible, but we tried to call in an order for six people tonight at work.  Their policy is no call-in orders, unless you place an advance order before 10am on the day you want the order.  I can understand if you have 15-20 people or more, but what kind of casual restaurant can't prepare a call-in order for six people in 30-45 minutes?!   That is beyond ridiculous.  Your kind of business should thrive on phone in orders.  If you don't have the personnel to handle it, then hire more people for that process.  Also, why is it that you can only order on-line in Utah?!  They have A LOT of work to do in this area."}
{"text":"Love zupas! The enchilada soup is amazing and recently I discovered how amazing the salads are. Honestly, don't waste your time on the sandwiches, the salads are the answer!!! Especially the chipotle chicken and the bbq chicken! My wife loves the strawberry harvest"}
{"text":"I write this review because of pure annoyance at the services provided by the staff here at this restaurant.  The food is fresh and not bad, I will give them that.  However, the way they count the amount of cherry tomatoes to put on your salad is just ridiculous.  Because of this reason, I will not refer anybody to this restaurant.  This behavior takes away the enjoyment of coming to a restaurant having a meal.  They literally count every single item placed on a salad.  Unfortunately, I come to this restaurant as it is one of the healthier options in my area.  I wish I could record the faces of the employees when asking them to add multiple items to my salad.  They appear as if they have seen a ghost.  My most recent purchase ended up costing $17 for just a plain salad."}
{"text":"Decided to go here for lunch.  We all had the soup and sandwich combos.  The soup was good a little salty for me.  We got it to go and the chocolate strawberry was a nice surprise.  I would go back and eat here.  I'd like to give it 3.5 stars but Yelp won't let me do that.  I will round down because portions are a little small"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today - awesome!   Food is stellar and prices are reasonable.  I had a BBQ chicken salad and a turkey/bacon/avocado sandwich.   I think I may have just found my new favorite lunch spot.   The only issue is parking - don't even bother trying to find a spot on the north side, off Lake Mead.  Just head for the parking lot in the rear and walk over."}
{"text":"I reallyyyyy like this place! We had a catering order for a colleague's birthday last week, and it was fabulous! Everything came in boxed lunches with labels of each person's name, which everyone thought was great (considering every other food delivery comes in bags or a mess of plates). They have a wide variety of soups, sandwiches and salads - but, what I really loved was how different the selection was from your typical deli/cafe. Example: Thai Peanut Sandwich.. where are you going to find that?!

The customer service was awesome. They were thorough and very fast with their delivery, and even called the next day to check and see how the food was. Everyone liked their food and we all decided we would definitely use them again for our next work lunch. Even if it's not for catering or delivery, you should try this place."}
{"text":"When they first opened they were pretty good. Lately though, the quality has been dropping. They're putting less soup in your bowl, to ensure that even if you order a large soup you're still only getting half, and the soups themselves aren't as good as they used to be. The mushroom soup, for example, is a bowl of cream. Perhaps if you are lucky they'll actually give you a single mushroom. They also have a tendency to mix up your food, so definitely check it before you leave. I've also noticed this location being randomly closed when the sign says they should be open."}
{"text":"I think their soups and salad kick Panera's pants. But their sandwich bread always tastes a little dry to me. I love the chocolate covered strawberry you get with every meal. And their drink station has a ton of options. All of their soups are made in house and are super fresh."}
{"text":"UPDATE: Ok, so I went there for a second time....had the Asian BBQ Pork Sandwich. It was FANTASTIC! So so good.....BUT, most of it was bread. Again, tasted great, but c'mon guys, give us a little more substance to our sandwiches!


I had the Try 2 combo. 
Chicken pesto panini & Roasted red pepper lobster soup. The food is delicious. The soup was fantastic. The panini was also great, but I felt like it was lacking ingredients. Don't get me wrong, the mixture of ingredients is great.....but I feel like it could have been a \"thicker\" sandwich. That's the only thing I felt a bit jipped on. 

The customer service is great. There are a ton of people behind the counter. And every single one of them smiles at you and tells you to have a good day. A bit of an overload, but it's better than poor customer service. 

I'd give them 5 stars of they made Nutrition information available...which seems reasonable for a place that specializes in salad, soup, and sandwiches.
And the sandwich just needs a little more \"umph\" to it."}
{"text":"First timer here! 
My coworker suggested this place for lunch. Thank god we got here just before the rush! Food was amazing. So clean and fresh. They have a great selection of salads and soups. This sure isn't subway!! The staff was friendly, and courteous. They provided suggestions the minute they heard it was my first time  love it!  Definitely coming back!!"}
{"text":"I went there with a friend for lunch since we heard that this location was brand new and wanted to give it a try. I have to say that this is a pretty good place.

This place is located on Charleston Blvd not too far from highways so it is pretty convenient to get there, and the restaurant does offer quite a lot of parking spaces so it shouldn't be hard to park. The restaurant itself is somewhat large, but it was still difficult for us to find a free table even though we got there around 1:30pm.

We decided to take a panini and a salad since they offer both for $8.99. Service was pretty fast even though we waited in line quite a bit, but they food itself was good. This is a typical \"fast-food type\" kind of little place where you pay at the counter when you order.

In conclusion, I would say that this place offers a good quality/price ratio and I would recommend it. Feel free to message me for any additional details that you may need!"}
{"text":"This was the best surprise as far as good goes!!!
Nice place, good service and healthy choices....
But now YELP is making me write more... let me what my food yelp... suk it yelp

{"text":"I love coming here because the food is super delicious that when I'm eating it I feel like I have so much peace and just I don't know how to explain it hah but it's really good !! I would recommend anyone to go eat there , they have sandwiches, soups , and salads ; the best part is that with any meal you decide to get they include a free price of bread and chocolate covered strawberry!! Yummy !! It's always clean here also and the ladies that work there are very nice. I always order a Honey bacon club sandwich and a Yucatán chicken tortilla soup."}
{"text":"This place is new and started in Utah I believe? My boss recommended it. Great fresh ingredients and great menu for a health nut. A little disappointed in the portion sizes as the 1/2 salad seemed to be the same size as the full with a BIG price gap. So, if you go get a 1/2 salad as it's the same size as the full! Great place for lunch, clean and friendly staff! :-)"}
{"text":"Fresh, generous portions, good flavor and all at a really great value.  The spinach salad is particularly fresh and delicious.  Everyones very nice.  We did takeout and brought it home - the AZ Desert Ridge was a little too diner feel for us, but nice for what it was.  The chicken tortilla soup is a bit salty.  Overall, well done."}
{"text":"wonderful! i love this palce, the free wifi, the Food is magnificent and overall a must go for LUNCH!"}
{"text":"They wouldnt give me extra cheese? Even after offering to pay for it they said they had no way of charging me for it so they couldn't give me any extra cheese.  Deal breaker Zupas. Deal breaker."}
{"text":"Great food. Love the samples and not a bad price for decent amount of food.
Red pepper with lobster soup. .. actually has lobster! 
The complimentary strawberries are a nice touch. 
Free bread was great for soup and the sandwiches are just a right size! I will be back for sure"}
{"text":"Nice job cafe zupas! The amount of money you pay for a meal is unreal to start with but when you find a paper cap in you mushroom soup is the best thing ever said no ever! Photos are included."}
{"text":"Its great to see a alternative to Panera Bread popping up around town. 

Some friends and I decided to stop by Zupas not too long ago and it was a pretty good experience. The food offerings are simply a variety of salads, soups and flatbread panini sandwiches. There are tons of options and virtually anything can be customized. Quality wise the food has always been fresh and step above similar fast food spots. The chicken tortilla soup, pulled pork sandwich and bbq ranch chicken salad have been consistent crowd pleasers.  

Every meal comes with a chocolate dipped strawberry which can contribute as to why this place is so popular with the ladies. The menu rotates seasonally so there is plenty of variety and reason to come in regularly. I did notice the portions are pretty small, I could easily eat two of their paninis in one sitting. Also Zupas is closed on Sunday which I found out the hard way so diners beware. Overall a pretty decent experience and worth a second trip."}
{"text":"Awesome place! The food is always great but most of all, the staff is always extremely friendly."}
{"text":"First visit and very crowded so good sign right there! My friend and I went for sandwich and soup combo and it was very good!   I had a turkey/artichoke grilled Panini and a bowl of wild mushroom bisque soup and both were very tasty!!  The bread you get for dipping in the soup was fresh and great and the chocolate covered strawberry was awesome and a nice touch!  I didn't try any of their salads so cannot comment there.   The girls at the counter were on a sugar rush I think--\"happy, happier and happiest!!\"  (ha ha) but very sweet and eager to please!  Prices could be a little better but they are competing with Panera, so enough said.  I will definitely consider returning so that my hubby can try it out."}
{"text":"Too expensive. Food is ok. Not the best. Not the worst. Salads are fresh but again it is just too expensive for what you get. Not a bargain."}
{"text":"Soup was cold, I felt rushed, I felt bad for the employees, overheard them saying they only get 10 minute break which isn't enough time to EAT! I also found a poop in the toilet that had not been flushed"}
{"text":"Tiny portions and weird customer service. I got one small piece of bell pepper on my salad that lists that as an ingredient. Weirdest restaurant ever, they seem really worried about saving money so much that it makes the food bad."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday and knocked on the door, why aren't they open? Church gets out at 2? Anyway there was a man inside wearing a green shirt and he could see that I wanted to come inside but he shook his finger \"no no\" he was running around and hiding under the tables, I don't even know if HE worked there:("}
{"text":"I like the food here but the customer service is really bad!!! I came here on a Thursday night and it was not too busy however when they rang up the order they got the orders all mixed up and kept asking what we ordered multiple times.  When we paid for our food, apparently they were still working on it and I thought it would already be done. I thought it would take less than 5 minutes to get the food but instead we waited more than 15 mins for our food.  There were more than 4-5 customers behind us who got their orders ahead of us which is ridiculous and was for the same amount of food.  The cashier did not even bother to let us know anything about our order.  After waiting for a long while, I asked the cashier when it was going to be ready, she advised that they were bagging it but it still then took forever.  Basically waited another 10 more minutes. Overall, they didn't have anything together, they couldn't identify which order goes with which customers and the flow of ordering process is so chaotic."}
{"text":"This place is salt in the wound from one of my favorite local restaurants closing last year. It's basically the fast food version of the same thing. 

The concept is a good one: salads, soups, sandwiches. I welcome fresh, healthy options. But, be warned: if you order a large salad, you'll get the exact same quantity of mix-ins than you would in a small salad -- just extra lettuce. Now, let's think about that: it just dilutes the impact those mix-ins have. I find that a bummer.

If that changed, I would probably bump up my review because I do love the concept and I think the Italian soda mixer station is a rad idea! And, I love that their version of the dinner mint is a chocolate covered strawberry."}
{"text":"Great variety.... overall the food is good and worth a try. My only problems with Cafe Zupas- 1. They claim to be a healthy option yet provide everyone a roll and chocolate covered strawberry- without any healthy substitutes. 2. This location always seems like organized chaos. The lines are long and your food disappears while you're standing in the line... and you hope you get to find the food you ordered by the time you check out. 3. Their tables and chairs seem cheap and chipped- the furniture isn't well maintained. 4. They don't post any calorie info- they have great looking soups- but I have never tried any because they aren't able to give me any idea what kind of calories or ingredients are in the soups (this goes back to #1 with they claim to be healthy but don't show it)."}
{"text":"This has quickly become one of our favorite lunch spots. One of the best Cubans I have ever eaten, and for Phoenix, AZ that is saying something. I usually get the New England Clam Chowder as well, delicious! 

Every time we have eaten there the staff is always friendly and very helpful. Eager to answer questions when we have them. The restaurant is always clean and well maintained. I would highly recommend them to anyone!

Only reason this is 4 stars instead of 5 is they are in a strip mall and its an open ceiling floor plan, so it can be a bit noisy when they are closer to capacity. Other than that I can't complain."}
{"text":"the worst was the cauliflower soup  its was like paste  not soup  we didnt get any chocolate strawberries  :(  the Lobster Bisque was awesome   the Italian was awesome   i will come back  but i will not get  cauliflower soup  and i would love to get my chocolate strawberry"}
{"text":"Decent food but on two or three different occasions  we've ordered a sand which and a salad and then they go off forgetting the sand which even through they charged us for it and then having to wait extra time after complaining about it."}
{"text":"I just love The the food all made fresh to order  and the service is always good. It's a bit pricey but well worth it.
Definitely have plenty to choose from on there menu but i always get the same thing tomato basil soup and turkey artichoke sandwich totally awesome."}
{"text":"First time here ... the greeter (yes, there is a greeter) was very helpful in letting me know how to order and how to navigate the menu. 
I ordered a half BBQ salad and it was prepared in less than 3 mins, although there was nobody in line besides me at the time. 
The salad came dressed a little heavier than I prefer so next time I'll order it on the side, if that's an option. 
It was a good salad but not mind blowing, but the free chocolate covered strawberry was a nice touch.
I'm sure I'll come back some day to try one of their many soups ... or at least for that strawberry."}
{"text":"Best salad I have ever had in my life. Strawberry Harvest with chicken is amazing. I would bathe in that dressing."}
{"text":"The service is okay, the place is clean, the food is good. I do like the little chocolate covered strawberry dessert at the end."}
{"text":"First visit but it won't be my last.  Service was quick.  Prices were fair.  Selection was varied.  I love the chocolate covered strawberries!!!  I had the lobster bisque and BBQ chicken salad.  My friend had the crab and avocado sandwich.  Yum!"}
{"text":"I was really happy with this newly opened cafe, and can easily get over the few flaws that I found.
I had the combo which includes sandwich, soup, and salad for $8.79
I added the pomegranate coconut water green tea .
There are 13 sandwiches to choose from , 12 salads and 10 soups . You can also add deserts if you choose and they also look delish. 
Expect a large lunch time crowd here .
Here are the few drawbacks I encountered during my visit . At the time of this writing (April 2016) the cafe is newly opened. There seemed to be some minor confusion between the employees trying to match sandwiches to salads and soups for different orders. With time , this problem will fix itself .
The other drawback was a poor design of the cafe. Aparantly they don't have a back service entry door for deliveries. That means that the daily (because they use fresh ingredients) come through the same small door which customers are using . Awkward to hold up foot traffic for a pallet jack full of deliveries. Even more akward is they use this same customer entry door to wheel out the trash bins (yuck).
Aside from those two drawbacks ... I really enjoyed the food and will DEFINATELY come here again and again ."}
{"text":"I had never heard of this place until a co-worker mentioned it a couple of weeks ago. I have been twice since. The pick two combo comes with a full sandwich and either soup or salad. Every meal includes a chocolate dipped strawberry. The staff is as friendly as they come and gets through a long line of lunch goers in a hurry. Your lunch will run you about ten bucks, with a beverage, if you opt for the combo. Their variety of sandwiches, soups and salads is sure to include something for everyone. You order and pay at the counter so there is no problem splitting the check or waiting around for the check if you are one of those who has a boss watching the clock to make sure you don't take an extra minute during your lunch break."}
{"text":"Well let me start by saying once you have been to a Sandwich/soup/salad place....seems like they are all the same. However with that being said this new Cafe seems to be a bit different. The wife and I visited this locale yesterday (6/16/2012) and they were celebrating there opening weekend of there new cafe in Desert Ridge.  Now of course it was extremely crowded on this day because all weekend they were giving you half off on your meal. I do think that in the future however it will not be a problem with long lines because while the food here is excellent....there are several other locations at desert ridge to choose from for your dining pleasure.

Speaking of the food....like I said it was excellent.....and for the price it was outstanding. I had the Turkey Avocado Panini with the Clam chowder soup and it was only 4 bucks because it was half off. However I would definitely pay the regular price of 7.99 any day because I have never been to this type of Cafe that gives you a full sandwich..... with a nice hearty bowl of soup....... a piece of bread....and a chocolate covered strawberry...... for 8 bucks. I know some people will complain about the size of the sandwiches....but when you consider you are getting a full sandwich...... instead of half a sandwich.... and soup I think people will quickly see how truly good a deal this is.

You can also mix and match....you can have a salad and soup....sandwich and salad....soup and sandwich.....salad and sandwich....any 2 combinations for only 7.99.....I simply think that is great. The only reason I didn't give this locale 5 stars is because I think seating is going to be a problem here. When and if you visit please make sure you get a booth if you can because the tables are a bit unstable because they sit on a very slick hardwood floor. That problem will probably diminish with more foot traffic but for now just watch your step when you dine in there. 

The also have free Wi-Fi which is ALWAYS a HUGE plus for me....and they even have a separate station for you to sit at to directly plug in as well (room permitting of course...LOL) . The service is pretty good and they make the food pretty fast....so all in all I think it will be a great spot for lunch....but maybe not so much for dinner. Let me conclude by saying that for those of you who live here in the valley in AZ and have dined at Jason's Deli.....then this place is a lot like that but with better prices and better customer service. I highly recommend you give this place and shot and remember to Eat, Drink and be Merry my Friends!!!!!"}
{"text":"Clean, friendly and a healthy choice for fast(er) food. Love that it just opened in the neighborhood. Even though it is a brand new store  their staff are focused and handle a lot of people without error."}
{"text":"Come here frequently and it has been good. Today was the opposite. Food was not worth what I paid. The Cobb salad was not fresh. Boiled eggs were rubbery and grilled chicken tasted like it was old too. Only thing good was the Wisconsin cauliflower soup."}
{"text":"Checked out their new Avondale location and was sorely disappointed. The wait was super long (and that was okay) but the parking could be much better-I was concerned about getting a nail in my tire because of the construction. 
Disappointments continued inside when I got my normally yummy chicken tortilla soup. It was chicken, chicken stock and some veggies-no seasoning, no spices annnnddddd no flavor. Pass for better. Get your act together Cafe Zupas, I know you can do better most of the west siders don't."}
{"text":"I love Cafe Zuppa! But there was once instance when I ordered a salad and a sandwich. When I got my salad, they put too much dressing. I went to the counter and asked them if they could add more romaine lettuce because it was too soggy. They asked the supervisor or whoever that lady was and she said I had to buy a new salad. Wow! C'mon. If a customer isn't satisfied with the food, do they really tell them to buy it again everywhere? No! A bit disappointed, but now I'll ask for my dressing on the side. Geeze!"}
{"text":"I WANT CAFE ZUPAS ALL DAY EVERYDAY! The best damn food in the world!! I even wanted to work there just for the free food! Once this one opened super close to my house I went crazy and went for three days in a row!! Just because of the discount they were having lol but the best food ever! I wish they had one in California! One of the reasons why I want to move back to Arizona :'-("}
{"text":"I really loved the creamy cauliflower soup and the salads are great and fresh! Customer service was great as we'll! I'll definitely go back. The vegetarian options are plentiful!"}
{"text":"Terribly ran, the other location on Gilbert and German blows this one away, I did go in during a dead time at 2 for lunch but I couldn't sit outside because all the tables had trash from the previous people, all the workers just standing in talking, my salad had no dressing and nuts about berries salad had skimpy toppings, as I left I told the employees I couldn't sit outside  because all the tables were dirty, well as I'm writing this review and it's been 5 minutes not a single person came out to clean tables, quit asking if we want the bread and strawberry also, it was part of what's cool about going to zupas, terribly ran with terrible workers who don't care...."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and I love this place. Great sandwich, soup and salad place. Food is made to order, ingredients fresh. Prices are excellent and there's always plenty of seating in their well designed and clean dining area. 

They give you a chocolate covered strawberry with every order, cute touch. Give the desserts a try, so simple but so good! Gooey brownies, magic bars, cheesecake. I come here to be good and eat a light meal with greens but it's hard to turn down those desserts."}
{"text":"Food is amazing. Quinoa and Kale salad is my favorite. Honey cilantro pork carnitas sandwich..highly recommend. Tomato basil and cauliflower soup highly recommend. I could eat here every day. And for 8.79 you can get the try 2 combo. Worth it!"}
{"text":"I love eating at Cafe Zupas! I always order their Turkey Bacon Avocado Panini on wheat bread and comes out delicious every time. I've also tried their Mangoberry salad and their Garden Chowder soup. Great customer service!"}
{"text":"This Zupas in particular is an alright place to eat if you are feeling like eating light. The location of it though just doesn't feel like the best. The area could do so much better with a well known restaurant that's a burger joint or something. Something more \"bar\" related. It's just not a go-to restaurant for families or groups after or before seeing a movie. Thank goodness for the Texas Roadhouse that opened up recently, but still, it'd be nice to see a family restaurant or something with more of a night life feel to draw people in!"}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant. I came across this place way later then I should have, I did not realize this is not a brand new business in this area. I walked into a massive casual restaurant with a great layout. There are very high ceilings, light coming through the big windows and a gigantic menu board with so many choice. You start with choosing a sandwich, soup or salad. They show if they are vegetarian or have any other perks to them. The staff are very knowledgeable on every product they carry. I was asking one of the staff what soup she prefers with the grilled cheese. She told me what she likes but then asked if I wanted a sample! Um, yes of course! I tried both the soups I was debating on and loved them both. The other staff member suggested a few other sandwich options as well. Everyone was so nice, I was so impressed. The line flowed fast and easy. Every station of staff greeted me with smiles and suggestions the whole way. We got our food on trays and were able to sit wherever we wanted. 

We got our food to our table and there were so many extra things on it. They added a chocolate dipped strawberry and bread to go with the soup. I was so ecstatic!! The soup was super hot, which was great. And the sandwich had cheese oozing out of it. I was in heaven. I really cannot figure out how they make such great food, with great customer service and so much ease. I can't wait to go back and try another combination."}
{"text":"I had to go right in the middle on stars.  From the moment I walked in the door it was mass confusion.  Where do I go, how many times do I have say and remember my sandwich name?  
The sandwich (Turkey, Bacon, Avacado) was delicious, fresh, and small.  Maybe a tad too small.  I passed on salad and soup, because I was just so darn confused.  I wanted chips, but didn't even see them until I paid and was waiting for my sandwich. 
I did buy a brownie though, and it was pretty yummy!  
3 stars because my sandwich was small, I had to wait longer then expected for sandwich, and it all was so disorganized and confusing.  
But everyone was nice, and the chocolate covered strawberry extra is a nice touch."}
{"text":"If you're in the mood for some sandwiches, salads and soup Cafe Zupas is the place to go. They offer a variety of salads, sandwiches and soups and they let you sample the soups if you're not sure what tastes good. This place runs like an assembly line where one person takes your order, the next person makes the salad while another person works on the sandwich order, the next person gets your soup and then the last two people plate your orders on the tray and rings you up. One of my favorite things to order here is the strawberry salad and I always get the lobster bisque. They put the right amount of dressing in your salad so your salad using drenched with dressing. You can get a combo which are two small half orders of either a sandwich, soup or salad. Also each order comes with a chocolate covered strawberry !  It can get pretty busy during lunch and dinner but the lines move fast ."}
{"text":"If you're ever in the mood for sandwiches, salads and soup you must come try Zupas! I went here for lunch after my bestie suggested this place and I loved the food. I ordered the Thai Mango Chicken salad with a side of the Lobster Bisque and my boyfriend got the Club sandwich. The salad and soup was delicious! Everything tasted fresh and flavorful and I love that they give you a chocolate covered strawberry with your meal"}
{"text":"This is what fast food restaurants should strive to be. When you are on the go and want to eat healthy, look no further.....Cafe Zupas is your stop. Fresh, crisp and flavorful salads. A very robust variety of gourmet salads paired with a perfectly made sandwich. Feel free to mix and match. I have been here multiple times and every experience has been exceptional. I am completely enamored with the honey infused drinks. They are light and delicious, a perfect balance of sweetness and subtle flavor. The clam chowder is so good, creamy and velvety."}
{"text":"This was only the second time I've been to cafe zupas, the first time was like almost 5 years ago when they opened haha. I remember not liking it very much then, but they have certainly improved! 
There was quite a bit to choose from, lots of good vegetarian options! The sandwiches and soups looked so awesome but I decided on the kale quinoa salad. It had fruit on it too, it was very yummy and tasted fresh. The roll it came with was delicious, didn't even need butter to enjoy it which is rare for bread in my world. Also I'm a big fan of chocolate strawberries so that was exciting haha, very yummy. Also good prices, all of that was only like $6 and it filled me up. I want to go try a soup or salad next time!"}
{"text":"Zupas is my go to place for healthy lunches and I'm always here at least once a week, but during my last visit I don't think I will be coming back to this location. When I got to the register I had my creme brûlée and the girl at the register charged me for a cake instead. After she rang me up she looked at my order and said \"oh\" in a hesitant voice and asked if I got the cake instead. I told her that I got the creme brûlée and asked her if the pricing was different and she hesitated again before saying no. After leaving Zupas I decided to check the prices online to assure myself that I wasn't charged more, but instead I found out the cake was more and she ended up charging me the more expensive price. I thought it was strange when she kept staring at me as I was leaving but now I know she was making sure I didn't complain. Honestly being charged more wasn't a big deal, being lied to was the reason I was upset and will probably not be returning to this location."}
{"text":"Panera Bread style restaurant that offers soup, salads, sandwiches. Not so crazy about their salads since I like iceberg lettuce and they don't offer that. Yes I know, I'm weird I like the non nutritional lettuce haha. Their soups are good and you can never go wrong with a chocolate covered strawberry. Yum!"}
{"text":"Good if you like sugar added to everything. All soups I've tried have a odd sweetness that is really off putting"}
{"text":"What I enjoy most is that it doesn't matter why time of day the food here is great!  I just recently ate later in the evening and the meal tasted awesome.  I recommend this place over others because the quality of ingredients as well as the price."}
{"text":"Food is delicious, although the portions are extremely small. If I order a large soup I expect it to be filled to the top if not almost. Why am I paying $7 for a half size??? Please get your shit together if you want to keep customers coming back."}
{"text":"I had a Vegetarian sandwich from here today with a kale salad . The quality of the food was good . Although I know it's not a Vegetarian place I wish the sand which would of had a bit more flavor . All I could taste was a blob of hummus  I usually have a good experience here .. maybe next time or I'll order something else .. I also had to remove the cheese off of my sandwich after expressing no cheese twice."}
{"text":"Great food, quick service. The employees all seem very friendly and helpful. They will give you recommendations if needed. 
So far I've tried the Red Pepper and Lobster soup and the Yucatan Chipotle Chicken salad. Both were very good, so good in fact that I went back the next day for another salad. It was way too hot out for soup. I don't think the salad needs any additional add ons... but I really liked the cheesy bread add on for the soup. Although next time I have it I wont let it sit in the soup so long... it tasted better before it got soggy. 
 
My only complaint is they have these little signs on the tables politely asking people to eat and go. I feel like it's a little rude. I don't like feeling rushed out the door."}
{"text":"Just found the best place for a healthy lunch in my area. I was greeted warmly by a sweet young lady handing out menus of what they had to offer and letting me know about the \"Try 2 Combo\" that they offer. There were so many choices of salads,sandwiches and soups to choose from. Orders were being taken very quickly and with such welcoming staff members. The salads were super fresh!!! I tried their \"Asian citrus chicken\" salad and omg it was so tastefully delicious. I also had the \" New England Clam Chowder Soup.\" It was delicious as well. Absolutely love love this place and will for sure be coming baThe place is so clean especially when they have their staff members continuously walking around making sure everything is being wiped down and that things are in place. They have this drink bar with house made drink infusions which are so good as well. Very spacious seating and also a little patio seating area but unfortunately it was all full at the time so I couldn't sit out. That's ok because I'm pretty sure I'll be coming here often and will try the patio area the next time. After I was done with my lunch, I went to clean up and put my tray back, the staff even helped me dump my tray! What a wonderful service experience at this place. Absolutely love love this place and will for sure be coming back."}
{"text":"Fast and quick for those days you're in a rush. Love that I get to custom my salad and a must have is their roasted red pepper lobster bisque. Quick and healthy at the same time. That's why I come here all the time."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Everything was super fresh and tasted amazing. i had the mexicali quinoa bowl and it was even better than expected. I definitely recommend this place!! Also, they have great teas!!! I had the cucumber mint one. So good!"}
{"text":"Had the grilled cheese with tomato basil soup and it was fantastic. The grilled cheese is with a pesto and tomatoes and cut into these triangles perfect for dipping.
I also ordered a creme Brule salted caramel and it was delicate yet creamy."}
{"text":"Love this spot! Good sandwiches, good soup... The desserts are a lil sweet for my taste but good if u like chocolate.. Only issue is it gets a lil busy during lunch hour but for a good reason."}
{"text":"Everything I said in my tip and more. I could eat there every day. This place pushes all my buttons. And If I could open a franchise, this would be the one!"}
{"text":"First timer for dinner tonight. They were very friendly and the food was tasty!
It's kind of like Subway-esque where they make the items for you, not like Sweet Tomatoes where you make your own. I had a large salad (cobb with ranch) and my hubby got the pulled pork and cauliflower cheese soup. We also splurged on a chocolate cake slice and rocky road brownie, cuz you know that is needed after a semi healthy salad :p
On my cobb, I wanted to sub cucumbers for olives and asked for extra ranch. It felt like pulling teeth to get a substitution and extra dressing. Hubby asked for no cabbage on his sandwich, but got it anyway. His pulled pork sandwich was mostly cabbage. The little meat that was on the sandwich and they bread were really good though. My salad was crisp and fresh. The soup was decadent and creamy. We mostly just dunked the bread into the soup like it was fondue. So good. The meals came with a chocolate strawberry and bread which was tasty.  The brownie was super rich and my hubby who is a sweets-aholic could only eat a few bites. Same with the cake. I recommend splitting a dessert or just be happy with the strawberries lol.
When ringing up they rang us for a salad and a separate soup. We almost didn't get our sandwich. They had already slid my card when I asked where our sandwich was and then they had to charge my card again for the difference. 
All in all there is high hopes for this place after they get their grove on. I do wish they had a build your own salad instead of just subbing things on their current menu without having to do extra $.50 charges for adding simple things like tomato or cucumber."}
{"text":"lunch time  the best food on camelback"}
{"text":"We use to go to the Desert Ridge location in Phoenix, AZ every week.  Last month we went there and my son wanted the baked chicken on the kids menu.  The menu says choose two, so I asked him what else he wanted.  He said chicken.  When I asked for double chicken the person serving said no that they had to be two different items.  I said that was dumb, it doesn't say select two different items, the sign says choose two.  I was then told it was \"corporate policy.\"  Really?  Corporate policy to be down right rude to your customers about it?  Well tonight my son wanted to go back.  Dreading the trip, I fought the same battle.  To prove how shady this location is, after having the same battle, I asked for the corporate office phone number.  They REFUSED to give it to me.  Again really?  Do they not understand the Internet and power of social media?  Rather than handling the situation in a customer friendly way, they gave me a tough sh*t attitude, refused to give me the corporate number, and were very rude over all.  Let's see if they understand the power of social media and review sites now.  Unreal a company this day in age could be so rude to people...numerous times!"}
{"text":"Love the idea of a fast food place where you can actually get healthy stuff! I've been here twice now and the first time was great, even my son with egg, beef and milk allergies found something to eat. We enjoyed our first visit and the only complaint was that it was overpriced. Everything they have is so cheap to buy, their markup is incredible.

Today we went again and I ordered they make your own salad. As the young lady made my salad she went really light on the toppings. Apparently they only give you five pieces of whatever the topping is. For example: five slices of cucumber, five pieces of chicken, five slices of tomato (which is actually a cherry tomato cut in half so you really get 2.5 cherry tomatoes). I paid $5.59 for a half salad and while good, incredibly overpriced."}
{"text":"I can't complain. Brand new location, brand new employees, packed with new customers, but they still managed to get everyone through in a timely manner and keep the place looking clean/organized, plus they've been giving out 50% off coupons during their first week in business, which is a nice gesture.

The Honey Cilantro Carnita sandwich is pretty mouth-watering good. The tomato basil soup is also a winner. I recommend both. I also like the selection in drinks. Aside from the soda, the in-house made juices are all pretty good, and seemingly healthy...ish. 

Nice to see this chain make it to the west side. I'll be back."}
{"text":"My toddler LOVES Zupas and asks for it all the time.  He is a big fan of their Wisconsin Cheddar and Cauliflower soup mixed with the Tomato Basil and so am I!  I always order it and the Asian citrus chicken salad.  We love how fresh the food is and the homemade dressings are all out of his world!"}
{"text":"Whatever you do, do not come to this location. I am a huge Café Zupas fan and have been eating at the Rainbow location every single day. The location on Lake Mead is on my way home so I periodically stop here for dinner as well. Every single time that I come to this location after 7:00 PM, they are out of something. They do not offer an alternative to the items that are missing out of your salad, they just say sorry and send you down the line. The food here is not cheap spending nearly $10 on a large salad which I would say at best is a medium. I really praise the Rainbow location for their customer service and dedication to the regulars and I wish that I could say the same about this location. Every single time that I come here I swear they are out of something. It's either my bad luck or their poor strategic planning."}
{"text":"Expensive...plus I hate the way they measure the ingredients. .. How tactless. .. They rush you through the line with the assumption you've eaten there before..."}
{"text":"Good food but confusing to order and REALLY LOUD music. Asked if they has 1/2 sandwich and soup combo, the answer was yes.   I ordered panini and soup.  Got to register and full sandwich showed up.  Cashier was barely audible...\"not for\", what?  \"1/2 not....\" what?  I can't hear you.  He rolled eyes...and finally said panini were not availble 1/2 sandwich combo.  Really?  The two servers who helped me didn't tell me that, but I even if they had, I couldn't hear them.  Paid full price then asked where the silverware was. Cashier barely pointed to a wall.  I looked...huh?  What??? Another half point...wall.  Dawns on me it's on other side of wall.  Good thing food was good but doubt I would go back"}
{"text":"Loved this healthy alternative for dinner! Went in with my best friend to eat and chat. Atmosphere was great. Had fun being able to enjoy healthy food and just hang out. I had the chicken pesto sandwich and it was really good! Also ordered the clam chowder. It was good but i had better. It was a bit plain to my liking but it wasnt horrible. I loved that they had a lot of varieties of foods there and even delicious looking dessert! Will go again :)"}
{"text":"Zupa's has excellent food. I've been here multiple times and am always left satisfied with my eating choices. Of course, the food loses some flavor when the service is so awful. Every time I've come here(different times, different parts of the year, ordered different food) the staff is completely apathetic and doesn't seem to know how their own restaurant works. They pass you and your food along through the line(salads, soups, sandwiches, dessert, drinks, and register) and yet don't have a system to know people's orders through the line. It's a bummer this place has such awful customer service(I blame management) because their food is wonderful."}
{"text":"HIGHLY recommend it. Everything on the menu is delicious. I like the Asian chicken salad and chicken tortilla soup. The only thing I don't care for our the naturally flavored drink options. My family likes them though."}
{"text":"Not a bad place to grab a bite.

Think of it as a variant on Paradise Bakery or Corner Bakery with your soups, salads and sandwiches. I had a ham and cheese panini along with a chopped salad.They were fine but not enough to make me come back again.

The service is very friendly and enthusiastic. The placed is brightly lit so you won't necessarily feel compelled to stick around."}
{"text":"1st time trying this place, not bad! The strawberry salad (not the right name) was so delicious, I'm coming back just for that!!! My kids liked their food too, but they want to try something different next time. I love that they gave chocolate covered strawberries, those are my favorite. Definitely liking this place!!!"}
{"text":"Food was good, but double check your order!!!!!! We arrived home and half of our order was wrong. Also, I wanted to contact their office directly or take a consumer survey; about my experience, but they do not offer anything like that... :("}
{"text":"Plain & simple... a light & delicious meal of soup, salad, & sandwich. Friendly staff, clean restaurant, & pleasant atmosphere. I will definitely frequent this eatery again & again... trying some other unique sounding sandwiches & soups. This is a must go place to eat!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place! I dragged my sisters and boyfriend here for lunch... Highly disappointed :( I love soup and was eager to try all the soups they had... I ordered the mushroom bisque after having samples of the lobster and cauliflower. Needless to say, I prefer Campbell's mushroom soup from the can. I got the pick 2 combo, turkey bacon avocado. Again, first bite I was disappointed. For some reason, the sandwich was sweet? I asked for regular yellow mustard, and when I opened my sandwich the bread looked like it was drizzled with honey. I literally took a few bites and called it quits. My boyfriend and sisters, also not impressed. Only thing my boyfriend liked was the sauce they used on his Italian club. I did enjoy the complimentary chocolate covered strawberry though. Definitely made the lunch better. Sadly, I will not be returning. I'll stick to canned soup and homemade sandwiches or Panera Bread."}
{"text":"I understand you're training kitchen staff, but sending out a cold sandwich and then sending me back to my table with that same cold sandwich and doing absolutely nothing about it, is complete and utter bullshit. You're a damn business and you fix a problem when one occurs, you don't tell me \"sorry, we cant fix your sandwich\". And to top it off, the girl with nice eyebrows making the salad had the worst attitude and looked at me like i was dumb the whole time. The cashier woman was nice, and probably the only one with a brain. Food is so hit or miss here because they change staff more than I change clothes. When it's good, it's really good; but when it's bad, it's reeeeeally bad. I guess if you're feeling lucky, eat here. But definitely don't expect good customer service."}
{"text":"Another let down. Will not be returning. Why do you think it's ok to short your customers on the soup that's really not that good. Each container was an inch and a half below the top of the container and enough salt to choke on. The soup I had was the YUCATAN CHICKEN TORTILLA. I must say it was terrible tasting. My wife liked her salad. I think it's because she got a chocolate covered strawberry????"}
{"text":"I dig their \"try 2\" combo, where you can choose two of the following: whole sandwich, half soup, half salad, for $8.29.

Their TOMATO BASIL w/ ORZO PASTA soup is fantastic! It is rich, tangy, and just plain  delightful. This is my boyfriend's go-to. The taste can get overwhelming though when you get to the last third of it because it's so flooded with flavor that your taste buds get too tired and surrender.

I've only tried the NUTS ABOUT BERRIES salad, but didn't find anything particularly lasting about it. It looked and tasted fresh, and was still a sizable portion for it being half-sized.

As for sandwiches, I've had the PESTO CHICKEN and the HONEY CILANTRO CARNITAS. Nothing worth mentioning, really. I think what ruined it for me was the bread that they use. To me, it seems too dense and dry. The flattened sandwiches are bearable, but when it's regular, the bread just seems annoying. I ended up just completely removing the top bun off my last sandwich. Panera does bread better.

As for the beverage flavor bar they boast about, Cafe Rio beats them by a mile. 

The complimentary chocolate-dipped strawberry and baguette slice is a nice touch, but again, the bread is forgettable. And sometimes you end up getting the baby strawberry. If you go here, the soup and perhaps salad is where it's at. Avoid the sandwiches!"}
{"text":"I love Cafe Zupas. It's delicious, I've been eating here for years. BUT prices have gone way up since I've first gone. I used to be able to get the Try 3 combo where I could get a salad, soup, and a sandwich for under $8. Now I get an Try 2 Combo for over $10. For that simple reason I go far less than I ever have. It used to be a weekly spot for me to go eat, now it's every couple months. But you can't really go wrong with anything on the menu, try the lobster bisque!"}
{"text":"I love Cafe Zupas. Everyone does. But bring back the bread! The good stuff. That new bread is dry, we want that fresh slice loaf back."}
{"text":"I love their unique and very filling salads. Much better than any other soup/sandwich place. A lot more ingredients in the salads. But I'm sad they got rid of the cherry balsamic chicken salad. It was amazing."}
{"text":"Love their food used to eat here at least once a week but they screwed up my husbands order twice and he had to go back out and pick it up! Also, new staff has terrible attitude two even we're making fun of a bigger person outside the window when making my stuff then I found out that it was the manager!!!!!! Not on our agenda anymore! 

-great food but check down to the ingredients before you leave!"}
{"text":"i ate here and...not so hot...all i gotta say, 2 stars bc they didn't spit in my food THIS time :\"}
{"text":"Love this place the staff is always supper friendly. The service was fast. I always get the lobster bisque always tastes fresh and fills me up every time. The desserts are also really good too. 
Would recommend getting the pick two combo because it also comes with a chocolate dipped strawberry!"}
{"text":"That was hands down the best Tomato Bisque I've ever had. And the Italian sandwich...WOW! Everything was fantastic. The ice tea with the raspberry flavor pump was delicious and the brownie was to die for! Service was excellent and the place was very clean. Just an all around wonderful dining experience. Can't recommend Cafe Zupas enough!"}
{"text":"I literally can't get enough of this place. I would eat here everyday if it was near where I work/go to school. The food is hearty, healthy, and delicious. A half salad is huge. Pair it with a soup and you have perfection! I love the BBQ chicken salad and chicken enchilada soup so much I can't bring myself to try something else. 

The only bad thing I have to say is that if you are an adult and order a kids meal item, they charge you $2 more! So if you're craving chicken nuggets like I was, get ready to pay the price. 

This location is super clean and nice. They just opened a few months ago and I'm so glad! Cafe Zupas makes eating healthy easy!

Ummm, and how can you go wrong with a chocolate strawberry served with every meal?!"}
{"text":"This is a newer fast casual lunch spot near the Chandler Mall. They have several salads, soups, and sandwiches made to order. The variety is fairly good and all of the ingredients were very fresh. I had the Cobb salad with avocado and their homemade herb vinaigrette. The portion size was excellent for the price, and it came with rolls and a chocolate covered strawberry for dessert. The restaurant is bright and clean inside, and the service was very friendly for a casual spot (think Chick Fil A)."}
{"text":"ARE YOU KIDDING ME???? My favorite new place!! OMG, Are you tired of the same old burger or boring sandwich? Get your behind into your car, get over here and be ready to taste quality and freshness like never before. I can't believe how good the food is. The Sandwiches are SooOOOoooOoooO different!!! So insane good!! The soup, Look out!!!!! WOW!!! I have been here twice, My family loves it as well. FRESH food, so different, such a nice change! My taste buds were blown away!!!!!!! Very long line today, I DON'T CARE!!! The wait is so worth it!!! Great prices, but the food itself, is why we came back and will come back again and again!!!! This review was so easy to write. It's so nice when you finally try a new place and your exceptions are met beyond what you had hoped. Great staff here, nice and courteous as well. This is a no brainer, i give \"Cafe Zupas\" in Gilbert Az. A great big \"WOO HOO!!!!!!!!\"'Happy Holidays to everyone here and everyone who reads this!!!! 

PS...... They are closed on Sundays, DOH! but how nice is that? They let their employees have a day off on the weekend, too cool.!"}
{"text":"SOMMER IS AMAZING!!! She was extremely helpful. I walked in, not knowing how to order and she explained the menu and took my anxiety away. Such a friendly girl, best service I've gotten from cafe zupas in a long time. Kale and Quinoa salad is great. Thumbs up from me!!"}
{"text":"So I got the half size salad and Italian club. The food tastes pretty good. The salads are pretty short on greens but otherwise they're good. Good prices."}
{"text":"I love the food here! It's a shame they've let their customer service go down. Everyone used to be so nice and friendly and now it seems as if it's a bother for them to serve their guests."}
{"text":"Honestly, I enjoyed this place more than I expected to. Tasted less like fast food and more like food. I'd put it on par with Chipotle for taste vs fast foodishness. Is that a word? The comparisons to Paradise Bakery are spot on, but each one has their niche. I liked that there were essentially make your own salads available, and everything in the salad area looked fresh and yummy. The half soup + sandwich combo was great, but too much food for me. I would LOVE if they did half a soup and half a sandwich. Oh, and the meals come with a chocolate covered strawberry on the side.
I had what was essentially a grown up grilled cheese sandwich with tomato soup, and it was really good. The tomato soup came with orzo, but it was a tiny scoop of it and the orzo didn't add much so I'm kind of glad I didn't pay extra for it as an add-on."}
{"text":"We visited yesterday and were excited to see new menu items. After reviewing the menu we ordered. Everything was rapid fire but the answers to our questions generated crickets. The staff was absolutely ignorant on whether a salad dressing was vegan or not. They couldn't even suggest which dressings could be substituted.  

I asked for a sample of the roasted veggie soup which was vegan. It was so salty and overwhelmed the flavor of the soup. I asked the employee if they had a cup soup size. She took forever to answer me and was very vague mentioning a child size soup. There were other employees but she didn't ask them. I replied that it was just as well.

We were rushed through the line and they weren't busy. Perhaps the employees wanted more time to shoot the breeze? Hmmmm.......

We found a perfect place to eat after paying a whopping $29.00+. Zupas doesn't offer a military, student, senior discount,  etc.  It's what I deem true greed. I realize it's a business however they would still make a profit even if they offered a 10% discount. 

The meal- my Thai coconut tofu protein salad. Where is all my protein?! There was perhaps an infant's handful size of tofu, some edamene not much, lots of kale, quinoa, a few slices of English cucumber and too much dressing.  My husband's sandwich was good and his soup was ok. The cake was a good size but overpriced of course. The chocolate dipped strawberries were the best part.

Another irritating aspect of Zupas was the lack of calorie and nutritional information.  I asked for this info because I log my meals on my fitness pal. Some employee blithely answered that \"they might get that info in a few months.\" This one employee provided a Greek chorus by apologizung for every little thing.  I say keep your info, keep your food and keep your apologies because we will be eating somewhere else. 

Next time we will be eating at the NY Bagel Cafe, Rubio's or one of the many choices here in this fine city of Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I visited Cafe Zupas many times in Utah but now that I'm moving to Las Vegas I get to be a regular! I love their sandwiches and their salads are to die for! The ingredients are all fresh and the people there are always very friendly and helpful. I haven't tried any of the soups yet but my husband said they're really good."}
{"text":"Cafe Zupas is consistent. I had the California sandwich which was fresh and warmed to the perfect temp! They always include a chocolate covered strawberry which hits the spot! It is quick to get in and the team is friendly."}
{"text":"I really do enjoy the food at this place which is why is why it's so disappointing that it just isn't run very well.

After eating here several times I've decided not to return to this location. 

Every time I've been here I've been greeted by half a dozen super cheerful people behind the counter, who take my order and make my food. I pay for my meal and then the challenge begins.

It doesn't matter if the restaurant is busy or slow, it's almost impossible to find a clean table. The dining room is always a wreck and the area where you get your drinks and silverware is usually a mess. Tonight was no exception, there were dirty tables everywhere and the tables that weren't covered with trays of left behind food were not wiped clean.

I understand that this isn't fine dining and it's a counter service restaurant, but if I'm paying $12 for soup and salad I should be able to find a clean place to eat."}
{"text":"Used to love coming here until they changed their recipe for the quinoa and veggie soup. Now it tastes like water."}
{"text":"Disappointing. Only one person manning the salad topping station which created a backup in the line despite the restaurant being fairly empty. Why didn't anyone help her as the line got longer and longer. The soup lady just stood there doing nothing. The Zupas at Norterra is more efficient and more enjoyable to eat there. 
To be fair the food is the same, fresh and tasty. Just the service is different."}
{"text":"On my most recent dining experience at Cafe Zupas I had a slightly unpleasant experience.  My favorite Turkey Spinach Artichoke sandwich was very different.  The turkey definitely tasted like ham!  As someone who doesn't eat any pork I was a bit troubled by this.  I went up and inquired about this, I was informed that the restaurant was testing a new kind of turkey, supposedly a higher quality ... but was smoked.  

For any others who can't or don't eat pork you know smoked anything still tastes like pork, and for some the mental association from the flavor as pork is too much.  I let them know at least my feedback on this and that others who don't eat pork would at least appreciate smoked* being noted on the menu, as I would have avoided this dish.

Now, I believe I was talking to a manager, mostly because I have seen her working every single visit, said she appreciated the feedback and asked if she could make another sandwich for me.  Thank you Noe!  This is exactly what I consider excellent service!  

While I am bummed my favorite dish has changed - I increased my rating from 4 to 5 stars because of the continued good experiences and now proven great customer service."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Great lunch spot with delicious salads and soups! Vegetarian friendly. But the customer service really sets it apart from other salad/sandwich places. Specifically Jacob, he demonstrated such excellent customer service and kindness that it prompted me to write a review for the first time in the 2 years I've been coming here."}
{"text":"I can't decide if this place is nothing like Paradise Bakery or similar to it. It definitely has it's uniqueness but also reminds me of PB. I walked in and was immediately greeted by staff and given a run through of the menu (I told her it was my first time in). I did the $7.99 lunch combo with a sandwich and soup (you can also choose salad). I liked that you went down the line to order everything (like PB). I ordered the chicken pesto Panini and was able to sample soups before making a decision. I liked the tomato basil with orzo so I went with it. Then I saw the desserts and couldn't say no to some chocolate mousse. I got a drink and went to find a table. In the center of the restaurant, there is a technology center with small TV's mounted. I definitely thought that was cool. The drink station was behind it and I also liked the drink recommendations you could make with the different beverage options. Overall, I liked the food that I got, the chicken pesto sandwich had almonds in it and wasn't really a fan of that. The soup was good just couldn't eat an entire bowl of it. Unlike PB, they give you an entire sandwich and a big bowl of soup (with a chocolate cover strawberry). I left feeling extremely full! Overall, I liked Café Zupas and would return!"}
{"text":"SO HAPPY this place has finally opened. I was just complaining about how this area needs a fast casual, healthy eatery... And here it is! I was driving to Chipotle and veered off course when I saw Cafe Zupas was open. 

So many choices, and everything is made in-house. Sandwiches are better than places nearby like Paradise Bakery, and finally we have actually delicious salad options. 

Now there's an affordable alternative to the usual processed, greasy junk. The chocolate strawberries are a plus!"}
{"text":"First time and I'm satisfied. Fast food joint but looks real clean and workers actually seem happy to work here. Tried the pesto chicken and cuban sandwich. All sandwiches come with a chocolate covered strawberry, which the strawberry was ripe. Perfect pick. Looking to satisfy your sweet tooth, the Rocky road brownie was a great choice."}
{"text":"Very creative menu did enjoy the Mango Salad, Califlower Soup, and Pesto Chicken Sandwich and their dessert display was nice great quality, detail and freshness.

 One thing to take notice their portions TO GO are a bit small I am a size Petite so when I say small the portions TO GO are Small you are better off eating there.

 Lunch is great food is real good they do have fresh pepper and  Sea Salt that to me is DETAIL also in the drinks area there are mini crackers to add to you soup along with an array of different flavored syrups you may add to your Unsweetened ice tea they have coke product which I like over Pepsi product.

For two people which ordering 2 soups, 2  sandwiches, and 2 desserts and drinks comes out to $ 33"}
{"text":"This place is the best lunch spot, and I'm kind of mad at myself that I didn't come here sooner @.@ this lobster bisque us going to make me so fat."}
{"text":"Love the concept. Good sandwiches and soup. I feel like the soups are more on the salty side. But still pretty good soup. The price is reasonable and food rates good. Service is a amazing amazing as well. We love this place during the cold season! Would recommended for sure!"}
{"text":"Gave it a try on the recommendation of a friend.   Both of our sandwiches were sub-par.  Mine, the Ultimate Grilled Cheese was bland and only had tomato on one half, my Boyfriend had Honey Bacon Club, his bacon was fatty and chewy. Ick.   My soup, the tomato basil was OK, but nothing to brag about and his, the Wisconsin Cauliflower was also very bland and needed salt & pepper. 

We had to tell them over and over again it was a to-go order.  At check out they rang us up wrong and over charged us.  The manager did correct that, but it was a very disappointing experience.   I will not be back."}
{"text":"Food is good, but service sucks.  Ordered clam chowder soups and sandwiches.  Got two lobster bisque soups... Told the staff to exchange it for clam chowder. Ate in and needed a box to take home left overs, stood by the register for 5 minutes, finally asked cashier for a box, she said wait and rang up 7 more people and continued to ignore me...had to go to the regular line again and wait to asked for a box, by that time my daughter threw the food away. The cashier thought she was smart and took her name off her name tag.  Not going back for a while, not until the staff gets better training. It will be a while.  Hiding your name doesn't give you the right to be rude."}
{"text":"With lots of soup and salad options, I thought there would be ample gluten free choices. Unfortunately the server at the salad bar had some strange answers to my questions. When I asked about soups, he said all vegan soups were gluten free. I asked why it corresponded to vegan and he didn't know. When I pointed out the tomato soup had pasta he said they would make it without. I chose a salad and asked about the dressing. He didn't know and was reluctant to go check. He wanted me to order the herb vinaigrette. I asked him to please check and he quickly came back announcing it had mayo therefore was not. I pointed out that mayo rarely has gluten and that seemed odd. So I chose another salad. \"No, that one has sugar.\" I pointed out that sugar is not gluten. He was growing impatient with me and clearly was guessing about something he knew nothing about. We left. I was disappointed and embarrassed because my friend thought she made a great choice for us. I looked online later and saw that other GF diners have had similar experiences at Cafe Zupas."}
{"text":"This has become my go to place when I want something healthy, filling, and nutritious. Each time I go, I try something new.

I'd describe it as a healthier, better version of Panera. They have a variety of salads, sandwiches, soups, desserts, and drink options. Regardless of what you order, you receive a roll and a chocolate dipped strawberry. 

Everyone is always friendly and the service is quick, as it's assembly line style. Their portions are pretty big; I almost always have leftovers. You can also try their try 2 combo, which is a whole sandwich and half a soup or salad.

I've been pretty happy with my experience here so far, and would recommend it for anyone who is conscious about what they're eating."}
{"text":"Not all chains are created equal and this is a good example. On first glance it might seem just like Panera but as the folks at Cafe Zupas will tell you, everything made fresh, including the soups which are made from scratch on the premises daily. The food is a step up from the majority of fast-casual eateries. The Asian BBQ pork sandwich is reminiscent of a banh mi with its flavors and the size is great for the price ($7.99 for a whole sandwich and small soup combo). The lobster bisque was full of potatoes, vegetables, and other goodness but lacked lobster. I only counted two or three small chunks.

The kid's menu was disappointing. While my kid liked the chicken strips (2 per order), they were rather small and unimpressive looking. The kid's meal requires them to choose 2 of the four options (chicken strips, soup, grilled cheese, or fruit) but they're not allowed to double up on a single item (like 2 orders of chicken). My kid didn't like the texture of the bread for the grilled cheese and I knew he wouldn't touch the soup or fruit. So, on future visits it looks like he'll only eat half of what we pay for. 

Desserts were highlights of the meal. The chocolate cake was plenty rich and we loved the different layers and textures of cream, cake, fudge, and crust. The chocolate hazelnut creme brulee was more like a pudding with it's creamy texture, but was good nonetheless. Each meal also comes with a chocolate covered strawberry.

Prices are reasonable and the staff was friendly and informative. I just wish they had a greater selection of bread for sandwiches (especially for the kid's grilled cheese) and a more diverse kid's menu. Otherwise, it's a great option for a quick meal."}
{"text":"I attempted Cafe Zupas on opening day and the line was so long out the door that I decided to wait. It was worth it! Cafe Zupas is kind of like Panera Bread, serving sandwiches, soups, salads and bakery stuff. The only thing different is Cafe Zupas is much fresher and tastier! 

When you first walk in they have large easy to read menu boards. You place your order telling them what you want on what, pay for your food and find a table where your food is brought out to you. They have a pretty good amount of seating offering tables as well booths. 

Sandwiches by themselves are $4.99 each, salads by themselves are $4.99 for the half size and $6.99 for the large size, soups are $3.99 for the half size and $5.99 for the large size.

There is a  \"Try 2 Combo\" priced at $7.99 where you can pick from two of the following:
- Whole Sandwich
- Half Soup
- Half Salad 

I ordered the \"Honey Bacon Club\" and \"Summer Chicken Salad\" from the try 2 combo. The portion size was great. The honey bacon club is a grilled panini with turkey, ham, bacon, tomatoes, muenster cheese and honey mustard. So good! I will order this one again for sure. The summer chicken salad has chicken, fresh strawberries, cashews, dried cranberries, grapes, mixed greens and strawberry vinaigrette dressing. The salad tasted to fresh and yummy! They have over a dozen salads to choose from so there is a nice variety to choose from each time. A really nice touch was the chocolate covered strawberry that came complimentary with my meal! Hubby got one with his too! Hubby ordered a \"Wisconsin Cauliflower Soup\" that was put of this world delicious! I ended up getting a spoon and sharing it with him it was just so good. The soup is whole heads of cauliflower blended together with cheddar and pepper jack cheese. Bacon was added for an additional 59 cents. Fresh bread also comes with the meal so it was nice to dip in the soup!

So I saw a dessert in the case that called my name. It was the \"Sinful 7 Chocolate Cake\" priced at $4.49 and I got it to-go. This cake is any true chocolate lovers dream come true! It lives up to it's name and is sinfully good.

The drink bar offers 16 different fountain drinks with free Italian Soda flavorings. If you have a device that needs some juice then you can take advantage if the recharge bar. They do offer catering, but if they offer online ordering I didn't see anything about it. There is a sign that says they do not take tips, but will gladly clean up your dishes (yep they use real dishes) and table when you are finished. The customer service was fantastic and the inside was very clean. I will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is so clean and well done, I recommend any and everyone.  The staff, though typically in their teens are on their customer service game.  The ingredients are fresh and tasty.  If you are soup, salad & sandwich person you'll be in heaven!!  The Strawberry Harvest is my fav... the clam chowder is usually good and the lobster bisque is loaded w/ goodness!"}
{"text":"The sandwiches are amazing and lately I've been treating myself to the creme brûlée cheesecake too. Just do it you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Yum Yum Yum... My wife and I love this little place. The food was delicious. My wife got a chicken salad and I got a Ultimate Grilled Cheese and a bowl of Clam Chowder. The staff was friendly and the restaurant was clean and bright! We even shared a fresh brownie for dessert. I left full and satisfied."}
{"text":"We love Cafe Zupas!!  Every time we come the service is wonderful and the food is even better!!"}
{"text":"This place is closed on Sundays.  I never remember that. Also, every meal comes with a chocolate covered strawberry.

The food is good, I have never ordered anything that I didn't like and there is a good variety of choices for pescatarians and vegetarians. 

Don't be scared off by the long lines, they move very quickly. You order your food and pay, deli style, and it keeps everything moving. They have a good variety of drink options and flavored syrups to add to the sodas, as well.

It's a good place to go for lunch, with kids, that isn't the typical fast food place. My kids will take take the chocolate covered strawberries at Zupas over a happy meal toy, any day."}
{"text":"All the staff are friendly, knowledgeable and prompt which is pleasant.
I have tried 4 of their sandwiches and wasn't impressed by any of them.  They were very small and thin.  The sandwiches are not meant to be reheated because they were pressed in the panini already.
The soups are an entirely different story.  The ingredients and taste of all the soup are extremely superior to any of the soups in our area.  I have enjoyed the lobster bisque, roasted red pepper and lobster, chicken enchilada chili and wild mushroom bisque.  Anything they suggest to go on the soups is .69 per add on just so you know.  All of the soups were phenomenal but the red pepper lobster is my fave so far.   My suggestion is go for any of the soups in a large to go container as you will get more than if you order out of the bowl for dining in.  I basically go there simply for the soups.  They also have several desserts which were all decadent and very tasty"}
{"text":"Cafe Zupas is me new favorite. I normally eat lunch at paradise bakery, but Zupas is my new go to for lunch. I've tried most of the sandwiches and salads and they are all great. The food is always fresh and the lines move very quickly."}
{"text":"Zupas is the best! They have such a great proportion for lunch too. I love how all the meals come with a chocolate covered strawberry :)"}
{"text":"Best mushroom soup ever! Good lunch proportions! I love how they give you the chocolate covered strawberry with every meal :)"}
{"text":"Hubby wanted something healthy so we stopped by Cafe Zupas so we can indulge in a salad, after our baby registry.  It was fairly simple, we get in line, the salad section was first.  We let the lady behind the counter know we wanted a kale quinoa salad, add chicken, and half a strawberry chicken harvest salad.  Then we moved down the line where sandwiches would have been placed.  We didn't order sandwiches so we shuffled on to the soup section.  I ordered a half tomato basil.  Then came the dessert section before hitting the cash register.

My hubby noticed that there wasn't any chicken on his salad so he let them know right away that he asked for chicken.  So for our meal of full kale quinoa salad with chicken and extra pistachios, a half salad and soup, along with a drink cost us a bit over $20.

I liked my salad, but the soup wasn't a wow as it was creamy and sweet, vs the tartness that I was looking for.  Also, the half salad alone filled me up.  Our meal came with a slice of baguette and choco dipped strawberry.

Overall, I did enjoy the freshness of the salad, the easiness of ordering, and the cleanliness of the spot.  We will return."}
{"text":"I really liked the options. There were lots of them.
For me, though, it was almost like too many options and it was too complicated. I also thought the ordering system was very disorganized. I ordered a salad and a sandwich. I ordered my salad at the beginning of the line, but then I got to soup and was asked if I wanted soup when that wasn't what I ordered. Then, I go farther down the line and order my sandwich. Then I go farther down the line and the person asks what I ordered and then she puts it in line for the cashier and then the cashier asks me again what I ordered. Seems like I should just be able to order once and be done with it.
As I had not been here before, it was helpful that there was a greeter at the door who explained the menu and how to order. Yep, if you have to have a greeter tell you how to do it, maybe it's too complicated.
My dining partner customized his salad. I wish I had thought to do that. The salad I had was with iceberg lettuce, which I don't care for. I wish I had ordered spinach, which I love. 
Just a little to hectic for me when I want a relatively healthy and relatively relaxing lunch."}
{"text":"The foid was very good..berry nutty salad w poppyseed dressing...turkey sandwich good.
Would've given higher rating except for the absolutely disgusting stench before entering the restaurant...sewer or trash nearby..it's nauseating.  Last time it was bad but w the heat it was over the top bad.  Kills your appetite.  For that reason we won't be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Went in for soup after disappointing experience at a place up the road.  The soup was pretty good and you get more for your money.  Had lobster bisque and the sw green chili soup...it was very good."}
{"text":"Went to east side cafe zupa this week it was so great we decided to have lunch at this location near dr appt today. It was terrible!! Had tur avocado panini..it was not warm so cheese was coagulated..I asked them to warm it and bottom was then completely burnt.  Tomato spread added to that and on other Turkey sandwich was sour tasting ruining both sandwiches.  We had veg soup and also clam chowder...both had so much pepper could hardly swallow...tasted like they knocked pepper container in pot.  Based on this location would not go back!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food! The Wisconsin Cauliflower Soup is to die for! Great and friendly staff and they give you all these little extras as well. I love coming here and so glad to have them close to home. Perfect food for any mood!"}
{"text":"Tired of the same soup and sandwiches?   Everything is homemade from their kitchen, and SUPER TASTY!  Only confusion was there is a line you stand in to order,  then move through the line."}
{"text":"The food is really good, leaving the customers with a variety of choices in soups, sandwiches, and salads. It was my first time there and my mom had been there so she explained to me how it works and what she recommends. I got the chicken pesto sandwich (which was yummy, but I should have read what was in it before I ordered it because I found myself crunching on almonds-which I hate, but it was really good)! Service was good, our table was a little dirty but that was fine. Next time I would like to try their abundance of desserts! I recommend!"}
{"text":"The soup! Love the soup.  I was very excited that they opened restaurants in Vegas.  Each time we visited family in Utah, we made a priority of eating here at least once each trip. Now I get to drive a few miles to eat the same great food.  I have several coworkers hooked on this place now.  Try it out, you'll love it."}
{"text":"Loved this place in the beginning. Then they took my fav salad off the menu. I can't find anything that comes close. Until they bring it back, I'm done"}
{"text":"Well.....We were going to anther place in the area that we frequent!  I decided I wanted to check out the menu at Zupas!  The menu is a little overwhelming, along with the workers trying to talk to you ( shussssh please)  So anyway I got the Italian sandwich, as he made that he told me I can go and taste some of the soups!  OMG!  I thought I was a clam chowder gail!   NOPE  I'm an Italian German Sausage girl.  You also get a chocolate covered strawberry with your meal!    Only problem I had, the sandwich had too much bread on it.  So once I got home, I shaved a little off the top.....And I shaved a little off the bottom, and I was good to go!"}
{"text":"Amazing.

Nuff said. 

I had the most delicious Italian sub here. Fresh bread, fresh meat, great presentation. I am now hooked. I will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"We eat here on occasion since the food is actually very good. It's a little too expensive for what you get. If you order a large soup, they fill the container just a little over half way. Hmm... we pay $31.00 for two people to eat there - fill up the cup! Also not giving five stars because they don't have hand held menus! Some people have trouble reading close, some people have trouble reading far. The menu on the wall is good for some, but for others, they need the hand held! It takes us forever to order because I have to read the wall menu to my wife. She could have read a hand-held while in line. Print some menus please! Also, sheesh... every time we go, we have to repeat what we ordered two to three times while walking down the line. It's annoying because it's hard to remember the exact name. I want to say \"a sandwich but I can't remember the name you gave it\"... they need a better system for ordering. Employees on the line are great and friendly. Managers need to fix some things here though for sure."}
{"text":"Delicious and affordable for lunch or dinner! Wish they were open on Sundays. Be sure to try the tomato basil soup, it's my favorite!"}
{"text":"I used to love this place but it all got ruined when there was a spider on my chocolate covered strawberries. They basically didn't want to do anything about it. They wanted to give me a new one but not even check if the rest of them have spiders on them."}
{"text":"Seriously overpriced. Especially when not that great tasting. Can't customize any order. And I can't just get chicken strips (I have to select two different items... Which she doesn't like the other items) for my kid or order more without ordering an entire new kids meal. And I can see them visibly counting pieces of lettuce or beans and they will pick one or two off if it's over. It's crazy. Terrible business for customer satisfaction."}
{"text":"I really like this place. I am all about variety so I love mixing and matching. They have a good amount of vegetarian soups that the staff is more than happy to have you try. They had a greeter which was kinda weird. She literally just opened the door. It wasn't busy when I was there which might of made her standing there awkward. 

I hate sandwiches so I didn't bother trying the veggie sandwich. I did try the ultimate grilled cheese which had cheese, tomatoes, and pesto. After trying ALL the veggie soup options, I came to conclusion to get the cauliflower soup. It was unique and my first time trying it. Perfect idea to dip your grilled cheese in. My friend love it and eats it. the soup is too thick for me to just eat by itself. If I wanted just soup, I would of picked one more with just veggies and a broth. 

To top off this awesome experince, they give everyone a complemetary chcocolate covered strawberry with your meal. I will definetly be returning."}
{"text":"1st time eating in at the restaurant.  
Very good build your own salad.
Found Tuscan White Bean & Vegetable soup to be so unbearably salty that I could not eat it.  I had gotten an orzo add-in and tried to ascertain if it had added salt somehow ... or perhaps since it was from the bottom of the pot????  No help from employees ... no offer to try a different soup ... just defensive, uncaring people
SO enjoyed the wild mushroom bisque with crispy onion add-in ... his was salty ( the way he likes) though not even close to the over salted soup I was served.
Not interested in returning and would never recommend to a friend or anyone with heart, kidney, or any even slight health concerns.

too loud and a non-responsive, non-helpful staff;  couldn't get by the salt to say if the soup had any merits;  I had hoped they really knew how to use spices and herbs they keep secret

We had already picked some up and eaten it at home some months prior which is what brought me back.
Went last Sunday for soup but they are closed on Sundays.

Would really like to find someplace to get great soups.  For now, as long as my health holds out, it's back to my own homemade soups."}
{"text":"I had a great lunch here with my wife. I had the turkey bacon avocado with clam chowder. They were both delicious and filling. It really is a nice touch to give every order a chocolate covered strawberry and piece of bread. It is kind of pricey but delicious and a nice place to meet someone or a group."}
{"text":"Now I've been to alot of sit down restaurant, fast food joints and everywhere in between. And when I came here I was astonished by the fact that the will measure everything out exactly and never will change it even for more money . Yes thats right they will say no to your money.  For instance I ordered a large salad and wanted some spinach with it. So what do the do, bit take out half the lettuce and pit spinach. Now I did not ask for a half lettice salad. I asked of the could make me a normal salad and add spinach. They said no we can't  do that. I about s#*t a brick. What place does not offer you extra items even when offering to pay for it. The next part was even worse.  When putting the topping on the LARGE salad you would think you would get more toppings then a small salad. NOPE! You would be wrong. So I  now have a bunch of lettuce (no spinich) and a table spoon of toppings. The same amount of topping you get on a small. Next was the soup, when you ask for 1 cup you get 1 cup. And when it is put in your bowl it seem there is quite a bit of room left for more,ie half the bowl . And when you ask to fill it up the answer is yet again NO. Even the staff thinks its the nost dumbest thing they've seen by the looks on their faces. Dont get me wrong the food is good and the staff can sometimes be good with the exception of the team leaders who always seem to have an attitude. On this night (12/27) this team lead was making sandwiches and was not very costumer friendly. All in all the food is good when you can get what you want but the service is lacking"}
{"text":"Attention Corporate: This is the ONLY location in the Phoenix valley that is failing all customer standards. And I highly suggest to any customers to go elsewhere. Zupas other locations are far better at everything from customer service, food portions, cleanliness of the restaurant. The management needs to be let go and this location revisited by your corporate office. 

Let me say this review is after 7 visits. All visits have been about the same. Poor or rude customer service, an issue that is easily resolved by good management. Portions way under serving compare to other Zupas. (for ie. The soup was not even half full and she insisted she was correct) I refused it and so did the next 2 people after stating the issues to make a point. My last visit she missed the cup and didn't even clean it off. I had to ask them at the register. No sense of pride, for your brand. Salads are also skimpy here. I frequent your establishment to eat and be filled up. A half cup of reg.soup and 3/4 of a half salad will make any customer question if they should continue business with you. My $30 a visit could easily be spent elsewhere.

To top this location off, the staff is lazy. From dirty prep areas as you watch them prepare and question if you would pass a AZ health dept inspection. The dining room is also always dirty, which as a manager myself Im always tempted to take off the soda fountain nozzels because I'm sure they are dirty too. I am a long time customer of your Biltmore location and thank them for the great service, I hope you take care of this locations issues.
Sincerely,
Annoyed and Done with this location."}
{"text":"This review is for the multiple visits of continuous horrific service and today has drawn the line. The food itself is good and fresh but that is only if they actually get your food right. You typically give the first staff member your order and she will write it on the box and you go to the end pay for your food as you wait for your order. I have learned from experience that they quite frequently mess up my order or forgot required menu items so I now sit at the glass watching as they make the salads to make sure. 

Today I went in with my fiancé and we placed our order. We had to repeat our order cause the lady wasn't even listening to us. My fiancé asked if they could put peppers on the sandwich and they said no! We would of even paid extra but they said they couldn't do it. They started our sandwiches and I stood and watched them prepare the salads. They forgot to put the chicken on my salad which you could clearly see before adding the topping and saw bare lettuce. Then they put chicken on my fiancé salad that was suppose to be the shredded pork. They finally got our salads correct so they bagged everything up, we paid, and went home. 

When I got home and opened up my wrapped Italian club sandwich with No Modifications with sticker that said Italian club I noticed it was a BBQ pork sandwich! Not even close to what I ordered. I was so frustrated because I had to babysit them watching my salad and I can't watch them make the sandwich and trusted the sticker was right. I called them right away and the lady on the phone wouldn't even listen or hear me speak she just said sorry and will remake it and hung up. We picked up my sandwich and i expressed my concerns in the nicest way I could and all they could say was we are short staffed since everyone quit. That has nothing to do with them being incapable of making a simple no moderations meal. I noticed they threw in a brownie when I get home. I came here for a healthy option and good service, not a stupid brownie that I can't eat. 

I will not be back to this location and recommend that there needs to be huge changes in the staff that runs this place. Do not waste your time!"}
{"text":"An alternative to Paradise Bakery. Had the Asian BBQ sandwich & tomato soup, both tasty and I would return. I prefer Paradise however."}
{"text":"The roasted red pepper and lobster was amazing!! As long as you don't mind a bit of spice. Plus you get a little bread and a chocolate dipped strawberry. It doesn't get much better."}
{"text":"Great place for a sandwich or salad. The Italian club is my go to. The chicken chop salad is nice as well. They give you a chocolate covered strawberry with your meal as well. $10 for a salad and sandwich is a great deal. The quality of everything will make you think that you should be paying more. Love their attention to detail!"}

{"text":"Decided on the soup and sandwich combo for my meal. I ordered the BBQ Asian Sandwich and was told to order my soup down the line. I made my way around a woman ordering a salad and there were 2 other people waiting on soup. It seems that you just move around the same people in line because the system is either broken or the staff is just as confused as some patrons. The food was just ok, I prefer other delis over this place. I like the fact they let you sample soup before picking you selection and the staff is friendly, just not organized. They give you bread with your order and a partially dipped chocolate covered strawberry. Nice offer but not worth another visit."}
{"text":"The food is really good but it's so noisy and crowded especially during lunch rush. I would go more often if it wasn't for the that."}
{"text":"We worked up a hunger at the gym and up the street, there just happened to be a Grand Opening for Café Zupas so we figured, why not?

There was a line out the door for one reason-50% off your bill....WHAT!?!?!? Luckily the line moved swiftly and I was already in attack mode! Their system is quick, easy, and painless:

1) Order your salads and sandwiches
2) Order your soups(toppings are additional charge)
3)Order desserts and drinks....pay for your order

After you pay for your order, a worker is waiting at the end of the line offering to take your tray to your table for you!?!? Oh, and each order comes with a chocolate covered strawberry, so if you choose not to get a dessert, you still end your meal with something sweet....:)

Here's what we got:
Nuts About Berries Salad
Berry Mango Salad
BBQ Pulled Pork Sandwich
Crab and Avocado Panini
Cauliflower Soup
Lobster Bisque
Rocky Road Brownie
Salted Caramel Crème Brulee

Everything was tasty, and the price for all this???? Just over $13 dollars!
Great for the kids too, and Zupas won't break the bank either. Another unheard of thing is that they DO NOT accept tips AND they will clean up after you too! Hey, they may be on to something positive???? Welcome to the 702 Café Zupas! Now if only the folks at Chik-Fil-A follow your lead(CZ is out of Utah) that could be another win-win situation!   ALOHA!!!"}
{"text":"The soup and salads are better than 2 stars. This rating is due to the lack of customer service, and the format. The food, albeit nutritious and tasty, is not overcome by the snooty, unknowledgeable drones who work behind the counter. On the night we went, they got our order wrong, were unapologetic about it, and added insult to injury by chiding US for not knowing their procedure! (And yes, that was the manager). It's pretty awful. If you have a strong stomach for this sort of thing, then you can have a good meal here. It's a bit pricey for what you get, but at least it is a lot better than the average fast food."}
{"text":"Long slow moving line. Employees look angry. I asked for ham instead of turkey and was told no. Very disappointing. I asked why, and she pointed to the \"no substitutions\" sign."}
{"text":"Always used to walk by Zupas but never really tried it out. So one day we had some time before the movie and me and my friends thought of trying it out. Was impressed with their menu but the food is average. The soups are very creamy and a bit sweet.  The sandwiches not filling and well can do without. The salad was pretty good. Better than expected. Had heard a lot about their sinful 7 cake but was highly disappointed. Would go back only if other options nearby are unavailable."}
{"text":"This place is not close to me. I come here when I specifically want Zupas. Today they were apparently having a meeting because there were like three people working behind the counter and the rest were all together eating. It took FOREVER to get food down the line and I ordered a salad that I couldn't get as a pick 2 because it's a \"protein bowl\" (summer garden bowl with chicken). 
I get home and open the container and there is zero chicken or any other kind of protein on it. So $14 for half a soup I had to add on extra and a salad with no chicken on it."}
{"text":"I had a mailer coupon for their opening to take 50% off our meal, so the kids and I stopped in for lunch yesterday.  We ordered a lot of food, BLT and Caesar salad for the kids, chop salad and red pepper lobster soup for me, chocolate creme brulee for the kids, it also came with bread and chocolate covered strawberries.  With the coupon, we were still under $10! That was way cool! If I were to consider paying full price for a latter visit the portions were small.  I was really impressed with some of the food (Caesar was freaking amazing, and the soup was surprisingly realllllly good) but disappointed with others (chop was meh, the ingredients weren't fresh enough).  I will come back for a chicken Caesar for sure! and to try other stuff, the sandwiches looked awesome! (When I wanna splurge)  The house made sauces and dressings really make all the difference, they taste amazing and make the meal for sure!"}
{"text":"I've tried this place 4 times now and the price is high for what you get. They won't even fill up the soup bowl when you get it to go. Why make the bowls bigger than what you plan on serving? Feels like a rip off. The sandwiches aren't very big. They try to make for their short comings by giving you a strawberry."}
{"text":"Not really a fan, came here for the first time a couple days ago. I thought it was pretty pricey for the quality/portion. I did like the chocolate covered strawberry they give with your meal. Nice touch. Might as well take yourself to Sweet Tomatoes, at least it's endless."}
{"text":"Great salads, nuts about berries every day. Asian chicken is also a favorite of mine. Service is awesome, friendly staff"}
{"text":"It has now been over a month and nothing has been resolved from my visit when they had a fire. It took weeks for the store manager and now district manager Jon Poole to even acknowledge my complaint. Once I did hear from him he offered (via email) for us to dine again but said nothing of the way we should go about doing it. After how poorly this has been handled so far and no one being on the same page I was not going to just go back to the location hoping someone knew that I was told to return for a complimentary visit. I of course responded to his email invitation immediately and guess what?! He has NOT responded and that was now almost a week ago. AWFUL CUSTOMER SERVICE. 

I called the corporate office back this morning and pressed the prompt to speak with a receptionist hoping to get contact info for someone at a higher level to help me but I was transferred to a lady in accounts payable who could tell me nothing but to email their generic address \"info@cafezupas.com\" mind you, this was the first step I took when the incident happened and nothing. It's becoming a running joke now.

All I want is to be reimbursed! If you choose to dine there just hope there isn't a credit card issue or an issue with your meal bc solving guest issues clearly isn't a concern of theres"}
{"text":"Freshest ingredients! They're soups are the best I ever had with so many choices. Salads are great. I also got the Cuban. I wasn't into the sweet pickles. Not my thing. Other than that. Amaze balls!"}
{"text":"I quickly became a regular here as soon as I discovered cafe Zupas. Every time I feel like to eat healthy and cheap, Zupas is my to go place. For $7.99, you will get to chose to have 2 of fallowing. (whole sandwich, half salad, half soup) You will also get one complimentary strawberry dipped in chocolate and one piece of bread with your meal. I usually order half soup and half salad if I want to eat light. And the complimentary bread is carb of my meal. Everything here is very fresh. My fav soups are roasted bell pepper, cauliflower and lobster bisque. Fav salads are Vermont maple blueberry and honey chipotle chicken. My fav sandwich is Asian BBQ pork. All sandwich and salad are made to order, and they only use fresh ingredients. Zupas also does catering for party!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome and surly beats Wild Flower and Paradise Bakery! YUM!
I had the Cali Cobb salad, mushroom Bisque soup and a Carmel nut brownie... Oh my! My son ate like 6 covered strawberries we will most def be coming back"}
{"text":"Forget about Paradise Bakery for soups, salads, and sandwiches.  This place is my favorite spot now because they have an array of choices for everyone.  The yummy soups are what keeps bringing me back.  The Lobster Bisque and Chicken Enchilada soup are out of this world.  The combo meal is priced around 7 bucks and can't be beat.  How could you not resist the amazing desserts and the chocolate dipped strawberry they give to you at the end?

Plan your excursion accordingly as they are closed on Sundays"}
{"text":"Tbh the food is good with plenty of healthy options... but a lot of the times when i ask for a large soup. They always put one scoop and the second scoop is all broth. Making u pay double for just extra broth"}
{"text":"The food is not bad but they rip you off in portions. I ordered a soup and was given only half the portion of the container. They gave me no viable reason for a half portion soup. I paid for a full portion soup. As a customer a proper portion in alignment with your container is expected-what a disappointment. If you pay for a small to go soup then give that to a customer don't skimp on portion amounts."}
{"text":"I ordered a half soup half sandwich combo.l for lunch. Lobster bisque was my soup and turkey bacon avocado was the sandwich. The soup was fair at best. It did not taste fresh despite their claims that all soup is made from scratch daily. The sandwich was terrible! The turkey was cheap, packaged, thin and filled with preservatives. The sandwich was made panini style which I was not expecting. What made it completely gross was hot avocado in the panini. Ick! My total was almost $9 WITHOUT a drink! Don't see the greatness in this place. Will not return"}
{"text":"I really did not expect what I ended up getting at this cafe. From seeing it on yelp the pictures made it look like a nice sandwich place comfortable with seating and possibly having a waiter. We entered and it was kind of a shock. You just ordered the sandwiches at a desk and when they came out it was literally the poor mans version of a panera bread. It made it worse that they tried to be innovative with flavors and failed so badly. I was extremely disappointed and to anyone who just looks at pictures and not reviews the pictures do not represent this place at all. I would not recommend them ever again and I will not be going back."}
{"text":"First time here, ordered the Mushroom bisque and crab avocado melt.  The soup was so delicious, it wasn't that hot but warm enough.  The sandwich was great as well!  Great customer service and the chocolate dipped strawberry they include in your meal was a perfect little treat!  The fall specials look yummy so I plan to go back soon!"}
{"text":"Seriously... ordered a large soup for pickup.. got home and this is what I got... I also ordered a slice of ham on my sons grilled cheese and they charged me 1.79!! 
#stingy"}
{"text":"You think you know sandwiches but this place really opens your eyes to quality! I tried this place for the first time and I am mad at my self for not coming here sooner. The quality of the food is AMAZING, everything is sourced locally and everything is in house made. You can get a soup or salad with your sandwich but that's not all, you also get a chocolate covered strawberry with a slice of french bread along with drinks like green tea lime cucumber.  This place is just one big flavor explosion waiting to happen! Stop reading this and come here, this gets a best restraunt ever!"}
{"text":"This place is new to me and I love it! The food digests quick! Never feel bloated after eating here! The staff here is amazing and sweet they look tired but they are just so polite and helpful! You can tell they work hard. I absolutely love this place!! Will be coming here as often as I can for sure!"}
{"text":"This is the WORST Cafe Zupas. This was my 1st visit and it'll be my last. I love Zupas.  My regular location, by the Boca Park Target, is amazing. The people are friendly and the service is A+. THIS location however should be secret shopped. 

I ordered my usual a large create your own with mangos, strawberries, blueberries and a double serving of cinnamon almonds. I wasn't watching the guy make my salad but it looked a little light on the lettuce. The lettuce usually fills the 3 compartments of the to-go box. While I was asking for an extra mango dressing,  I couldn't get over the lack of lettuce, so I finally said that it looked a little light and could I please have more. 2 girls looked at each other then told him that I wanted more lettuce. He said that, THAT was the serving as he continued to wipe up around the lettuce container, but made no movement to add more. It gave me the feeling that he personally harvested that lettuce and he didn't want to part with it. Finally 1 of the girls put about 6 extra pieces of the shredded lettuce in my box.

I was so upset about the ridiculousness of it all, I didn't realize my 2nd dressing wasn't in there. While I was getting napkins, 1 of the girls from the line brought me a large dressing cup barely half filled. She told me they had ran out of the mango dressing, but \"here's what's left\". So you mean to tell me that at 1:30 in the afternoon they have COMPLETELY run out of dressing? After the lettuce fiasco, I feel that it's more likely that they wanted to be stingy with their dressing as well.

I'm glad that this isn't the 1st Cafe Zupas that I've visited. It would likely be the last time that i gave them my business. Do better 7521 Lake Mead location!"}
{"text":"My husband and I tried a different salad each and he had the Italian sandwich and I had the enchilada soup. We got a good sized piece of bread and a chocolate covered strawberry complimentary . Everything was really fresh and good, the salads were a little dry that is really the only complaint. Staff very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"It's been about 2-3 months since this location opened & it's still packed during lunch. That's a sign that their food is good!

I ordered the 2 combo special: Whole Sandwich of the Pesto Chicken Sandwich & Lobster Bisque Soup w/ free bread & a chocolate covered strawberry.

As expected, their food is very filling & delicious. Their service is friendly & quick, and the restaurant is very clean.

I'll definitely be a regular here!"}
{"text":"I heard good things about this place, especially the generous amount of food they give you. I decided to take my mom here for dinner & I honestly wasn't disappointment! 

I ordered the sandwich & soup combo and I was excepting half a sandwich like how other restaurants do. However, I received a full sandwich, a full bowl of soup, bread, and a chocolate covered strawberry. My mom got the same thing, except she got a salad. 

The food was very tasty & filling. I'd definitely go back here! I wish they had a location on the west side of town."}
{"text":"Be prepared to repeat your order at least a few times. You literally need to have what you order memorized. It's pretty annoying but you have no choice but to go with it. Have had one of the employees actually get short with me because I couldn't remember the name of the soup i ordered. The food is really good overall though and usually the people are nice...they just need a better system for taking and delivering orders....write it down or something! Quit relying on your guests to keep your ordering process organized."}
{"text":"It was my first time to a Cafe Zupas.  My friend wanted to come because of the chocolate covered strawberry.  I was not that hungry so I got the Chicken Enchilada Chili soup.  Made with red & green enchilada sauces, delicious chunks of chicken, black beans, & fresh southwestern veggies.  It came with a chuck of bread and the chocolate covered strawberry.  It is kinda like a paradise bakery.  The soup was good.  The drinks are with a twist.  They have the regular coke soda foundation, but they have these syrups on the side to make your OWN flavored drink.  Everything was good!!!  Need to try a sandwich next time."}
{"text":"It was after my workout and it was close by and they had soups...  Craving soups for some reason.  I got the Try 2 Combo (whole sandwich and half soup):  Chicken enchilada chili and honey bacon club.  The lines were crazy long, the ordering system is kinda of confusing, if you do not have a sandwich, you can skip the area, but then you have people in front of you so you do not want to seem like you are cutting them.  OH well!  Ordered and moved on.  They try to match you with your order by the time you pay.  

The food was pretty good, but the sandwich bread was super hard.  It is ok, I had soup to drunk it in.  The tables were dirty had to wait for someone to get it cleaned up."}
{"text":"Loved it!  I am so happy they are finally open.  Soups, salads, and sandwiches are my favorite things (okay, in addition to sushi, pho, and Thai beef salads...).

You can definitely tell they just opened because everyone was SUPER helpful and friendly, and the place was as clean as can be.

I was unsure about which soup I wanted because they all sound awesome, and they let me sample a couple.  Be sure to ask for a sample if you don't know which one you want!  I ended up getting the red pepper and lobster, and my husband got the lobster bisque.  Mine was better!  haha.  But they were both delicious.  I also got the California Turkey sandwich, and my husband got the BBQ pulled pork--both good.

LOVED the chocolate-covered strawberry that came with my meal.  It's a good deal for $7.99.  Next time I'm going to try a salad.

Anyway, I recommend this place.  It's really good, cheap, and yummy.  I would be here every single day if I worked nearby and needed a lunch spot.  Try it!"}
{"text":"I had the chicken pesto sandwich. My question is how the hell do you make anything with pesto in it and still make it absolutely tasteless? This place is a waste of time."}
{"text":"A impromptu dinner decision & turned out great! The stuff are all so helpful & friendly. The food are all delicious! The whole family enjoyed themselves. Even the kids loved it! Definitely will be back again ?"}
{"text":"I love this place!  My favorite is the crab avocado melt sandwich with the tomato bisque soup. Try it!  

This place is clean and the staff is courteous. 

And you get a chocolate covered strawberry!"}
{"text":"Had the try2combo today. Half California Protein Club and. Bowl of Chicken Enchilada Chili. Excellent! My only complaint was the soup could have been a little hotter."}
{"text":"Best lunch deal around the area!  You can get a full sandwich plus soup or salad for $7.99.  They have a great selection of salads, soups and sandwiches. You will not leave her hungry.  You also get a chocolate covered strawberry with every meal.  They offer catering too."}
{"text":"I used to like this place, but today they gave my kids frozen chicken strips and my diabetic sister couldn't get a diet soda because \"they're only for catering.\" They tried to give her the runaround when she asked for a refund on the drunk cup she bought...30 seconds after she bought it.

This used to be my lunch spot, but I'm not interesting in supporting some place that doesn't care about their patrons."}
{"text":"The food is so gross! I don't understand why people eat here. Selection is poor and the food tasted like it came out of a nursing home. Yuck."}
{"text":"This place is trash. Literally. We have been here twice and both times there were several tables that were dirty even though it was not busy and there were 4 and 5 employees standing around talking. I could understand if it was busy but there was no one in line. The napkin dispensers were also empty. 

At one point we saw one of the girls leaning on the food prep counter with her forearms. Why wear gloves then?

My advice, skip this place. I know we will be from now on."}
{"text":"Today was my first day going in and I loved what I got! I honestly already forgot what it's called but it was delicious. However only complain I have is they're ridiculously slow. I was the only one in line and they took forever. My boyfriend was a couple of people behind me and some people behind him ended up getting their food first even though it's a chipotle-line style type of restaurant where you get your food as you go. Not to mention there was a long piece of hair in his food. He didn't want to tell them anything though because he was too shy. Great food though with vegetarian and vegan style food. Customer service is good too."}
{"text":"Extremely loud at lunch time.  Between the acoustics and loud adult contemporary on the Muzak system you don't want to stay long.  The Cuban sandwich is the best in the valley and the Wisconsin cheese soup is delicious.  Staff is friendly and if you have a sweet tooth lots of great choices."}
{"text":"This was my fifth and last visit to Zupas.  I always get the soup and sandwich combo.  The issue I have with Zupas is that their bread is cold and if you ask them to warm up your bread, they won't.  Pair a warm/hot filling with a cold bread, versus on a warm bread and you will taste and feel a world of difference. I keep coming back hoping they will be able to warm up my bread but it doesn't happen.  I will be back in a year to give them another try if they are still in business.  In the meantime I will look for a similar place that gives me the option to warm up my bread."}
{"text":"Unsanitary food handling!  Went through the line and when I got to the cashier stand, the person assisting me was named Edgar. Edgar was also the person putting the strawberries in the bags and slicing the bread. He helped the person in front of me - who happened to be another employee. He took her cash and gave her change and then without changing the gloves he was wearing, grabbed the bread and sliced a piece as if he was going to put it on my tray. I told him I did not want that bread nor the strawberry and that he needed to change his gloves.  Edgar looked at me with surprise - not knowing what I was talking about. The lady in line behind me also told him that he needed to change his gloves. I then explained that it was unsanitary to handle money and then, wearing the same gloves, handle food. I told him I know longer wanted the food and asked to speak to the manager.  Edgar was very nice during this process and went to get the manager.  A minute or so later a young lady came through the doors and stated in a loud voice to Edgar \"What do you want?  I was on the phone with my boss!\"  Edgar then looked at me and said this customer would like to speak with you.  Tantine (the manager) looked at me and asked me what I needed. It was apparent that she lacks in basic customer service skills! I explained to her what happened and she just kept shaking her head and saying the word yes - as if this is a routine practice.  Tantine was very nonchalant about the whole situation and stated that Edgar was still in training.  I asked her twice for her bosses name and she refused to give it to me on both occasions - stating that the bosses don't like for their names to be given out.  Perhaps that's because no one wants to be held accountable for the lack of sanitary food handling processes at this restaurant?  

With so much news about people getting sick because of poor handling of food and overall sanitation not being up to standards, you would think that there would be more vigilant training conducted and certainly more empathy on the part of managers. Maybe there is elsewhere but certainly not at this location!"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE SALADS!!! Our office decided to grab take-out today. First of all we were unable to place our order over the phone because \"they were no longer taking take-out orders\" according to the recording. So we weren't too fond of that, but the salads looked amazing online, so a co-worker went there and placed the orders in person for take-out. It took longer than expected because its kind of out of our way, but again everything online looked amazing so we weren't complaining about the time. When she finally makes it back to the office with our food you get something no where near close to what you order. I ordered the Glazed Chicken Salad. It should even be called a chicken salad. There was maybe two small thin sliced pieces of flavorless chicken. There were no \"sliced tri-color peppers\" like the description states and the tortilla strips were stale. As for the rest of the ingredients that were on the salad, it was more of sprinkle of each. My salad consisted of mostly greens. Everyone had complaints about their salad. Only compliment they gave was that the Strawberry Champagne Vinaigrette dressing was good, and that was on the Strawberry Harvest Chicken Salad. Needless to say that we will not be getting lunch from Zupas again. It was mighty disappointing and overpriced."}
{"text":"Love ALMOST everything about this place, the food, the service (though they sometimes forget to add some ingredients in a salad), and the desserts.

My question is why doesn't Cafe Zupas post their nutritional info anywhere???? When they are asked the person replies, \"It's coming.\"

PLEASE POST NUTRITIONAL INFO! This is very important!"}
{"text":"my last review of this location was bad and I have stayed away for months gave it another try today and same horrible service. Today they served me a salad with no dressing. Too far to go back and get ot corrected. This location is the worst they can never get anything right"}
{"text":"I love this place!  Came here for lunch. I heard that there's usually a long line and wait. I guess I got lucky. It was busy though but not to bad. I decided to get the Asian BBQ pork sandwich with Roasted Red Pepper & Lobster. So when you get up to the counter the worker will make either your sandwich or salad then you move down for the soup next is the dessert  then last well be where you get a drink and pay. You take your food, find a seat and eat up. I got a drink with my order and the total came to a little over $10. The food portion was very generous. My sandwich had a lot of pork and veggies. My soup was in a big bowl. It also comes with a chocolate covered strawberry. The staff was very nice and friendly, store was very clean. well definitely be back to try other things!"}
{"text":"So l discovered this place like a month ago and the food is very good, but the reason why l am giving it 3 stars is because 1. Portions are so little, even at the kids combos my son is always stays hungry, after we ate there yesterday l had to buy him 2 combos so he could have 4 chicken strips instead of only two. Wich takes me to point number 2 they are not flexible with their menus it is what it is period they don't let you change anything because that how it is. And number three the main reason why l started going to this restaurant is because l saw a picture of a soup that is only for this month the Bangkok coconut chicken, well let me tell you it tastes good but here are the pictures of what it is advertised and the picture of what they give you. You judge by yourself.!"}
{"text":"Omg! Finally a healthy food option for the west side. I'm completely obsessed. You get a free chocolate dipped strawberry with your meal, bonus! And I love their infusions. No added sugar all real raw ingredients. YES! 

Customer. For. Life. Now we just need a Trader Joe's over in these parts! :)"}
{"text":"Zupas is my go to place. They have soup, salad and sandwiches. Amazing taste and fast service. No waiting. They bus the tables with a smile!"}
{"text":"I love Cafe Zupas! Their combo options (soup + salad, soup + sandwich, or salad + sandwich) make for an affordable AND satisfying meal. In my opinion, they beat out the other soup & salad place in the neighborhood, Sweet Tomatoes. Sure, it isn't an AYCE buffet of sub-par soups and other just-okay finger foods... but anything you order here is sure to get you your fill!

They have a menu that seems to change often and according to the season. The last time I went - which was almost 2 weeks ago - I ordered their chicken pesto sandwich with a generous portion bowl of wild mushroom bisque. Both so good! They also had a bunch of other colorful, yummy-looking salads and several vegetarian options to choose from. I had a hard time deciding! Although I think any route I could've taken would've been a good one.

Their service is also great. I was greeted immediately upon arrival and they were very patient as I decided what to order. I noticed that the lady behind me was super rude... I felt bad! But the employee handled it very graciously. Kudos to them!

Anyway, if you're in the area, I highly suggest trying Zupas! You'll love it."}
{"text":"Just found this place on here, I was wary cuz of some of the reviews that said prices increased and portions were lowered but thankfully I went anyways!  I got the Maui Tropical Chicken Salad and Turkey Spinach Artichoke Panini, My boyfriend got Turkey Bacon Avocado panini and glazed chicken chipotle salad, and we split the yucatan chicken tortilla soup cause we didn't want to leave without trying one.  We both tried each other's foods and thought everything we ordered was great.  The soup was to die for , puts any chicken tortilla I've had to shame . and props to this place for having Tapatio. Just when I thought it couldn't get better. ( I was already sold when I read about free chocolate strawberries)"}
{"text":"I really try to like this place. The best thing they have going is the menu - I love the salad combinations especially the kale & quinoa salad and chicken pesto sandwich. I'm addicted to both. The nuts about berries salad is pretty good too.

The con about this place is the portion size...pretty skimpy for a large salad particularly when I can go across the street and pay $1 more for 2x the food. C'mon,  greens are cheap....don't skimp the customer! Also I don't like having to repeat my order 3x down their cafeteria line system. Give me a number or something.

The staff is nice but on more than a few occasions I've had an ingredient left off my salad. I order to-go regularly so a pain when I get home and notice. Not a huge deal but I like my salad the way it's supposed to be. Consistency is key people.

I keep going back because of the menu...and I keep telling myself to stop...but I don't."}
{"text":"Love Cafe Zupas! Even when they're busy, they're fast and efficient getting through the line. Everything tastes homemade and the soup is perfect for these chilly vegas days!"}
{"text":"I went here today for the first time.
All of the employees were SUPER nice! They were helpful in making some suggestions and although the place was crowded for lunch they didn't rush me.
I had a soup and salad combo; the soup was great, I really liked it. I had the strawberry chicken salad, which was fine, not as great as the soup I thought, but decent. It definitely tasted fresh.
The chocolate covered strawberry was a nice touch!
Will definitely be back here for a quick, easy, lunch at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"The soup here is very good. The family and I tried the tomato basil , wild mushroom bisque and lobster bisque. All very delicious ! 

My son ordered the chicken strips and fruit, they had no ketchup so he dips his chicken and bread in the lobster bisque lol which he loves ! He's a very picky eater so we were happy to see him enjoy the food. 

Wife ordered the crab melt. She said it's very good but it's imitation crab. 

I tried the BBQ chicken salad and it was tasty. If you've had bbq chicken salad it's at the same level for a good price! 

Will come back again to take the family:)"}
{"text":"The first time I went I was happy to find a healthy take out place. After a couple of times I saw the portions are kind of small for the price. It drives me crazy that the \"to go\" soup bowls are only filled 3/4 of the way. 

It is a  healthy option which is good, but there are definitely better and more consistent places to go to. 

The chocolate covered strawberries are a nice plus but I'd rather have a better portion for the price instead of a free strawberry. The bread they give you is not the best either."}
{"text":"I gave them several chances, really wanting to have better experience. But every time I leave unsatisfied. Food is either bland, or so salty that it's inedible. They don't have that many meatless options, which is kinda lame. I do like the price however, last time 2 of us had lunch for $13 which is awesome, but next time I will probably just stroll the Camelback to Paradise bakery or some other soulless chain with slihtly tastier food"}
{"text":"WoW! I was blown away.  

Service great.  There is someone at the door if you want some suggestions.  Need something there are some attendees on the floor addressing your needs.

food - Fresch delicious and quick. :-O 

Ambient - causal and full of energy. Vibrant.

I love that the food that I ordered and saw on others plates was so full of color.

Price - Its pretty reasonable."}
{"text":"Craving soup or salad for lunch? Want something quick and easy? This is your spot. Think of it as a new spin on Panera style offerings. They offer a hefty mixture of salads, soups, sandwiches and some sweet treats. Make sure to ask for a sample of their soups while you're in line. You order at the counter and grab your grub before you hunt for a table. 

I've been here a handful of times and have thrown this spot into my work lunch rotation. It's a great option for my coworker crowd because everyone can pick out something they like without a scuffle. You can build your own salad or choose one of their customs mixes. Want light dressing? No problem-o. Want spinach vs romaine? Done. Want extra toppings? Sure, but it might cost you a little bit - just ask to clarify before you load up. 

I generally order a flavorful salad filled with nutritious and tasty fillings like spinach and berries. I also always enjoy their soup and try a few flavors before deciding on what I want for the day.  They have items that rotate seasonally so it's a nice touch that they let you sample before you pick one out. Their friendly service and fresh eats will have me coming back. 

Tip: Expect a hefty lunch line on the weekdays. They do a great job on keeping the line moving rather quickly.... so don't let that stop you from trying them out.  Also, enjoy their chocolate covered strawberry they provide with every order."}
{"text":"I went to Cafe Zupas on a Friday evening to make use of the coupon mailer they sent out. I went with my 2 kids and my parents. It wasn't too busy, which was nice. General consensus among us is that the food is good and service was friendly.

I do think the assembly line set-up was a little confusing. I had to repeat my order to multiple people and, since I was simultaneously ordering for my children, had a hard time remembering exactly what I had ordered. 

I was mildly disappointed in the kids' meal - my 2.5 year old wanted chicken strips and the 2 he was given were quite small. The fruit cup was mandarins and grapes (cut in half! excellent touch), but barely covered the bottom of the cup. He was able to eat it all, so while it's a great amount for him, an older child would still be hungry. 

I had the clam chowder and it was excellent. Very savory and flavorful. My parents both had the mushroom bisque and also thought it was excellent. We all enjoyed the chocolate covered strawberries included in our meals.

Overall, I would be happy to return. Prices are comparable to Panera, and in my opinion the food is a little better."}
{"text":"I just love coming here. The food has been always great. Their salads are super tasty. My favorite is the chipotle southwest chicken. They also have a syrup bar to make your own drink. Love it! Prices range about 7-9 for food. 3-4 for deserts. Drink is 2 dollars."}
{"text":"Just found this place in Boca Park. Delicious!  Love the tomato basil soup.   The serving line was busy, yet they were having to run to the back to get refills of soup. Doubled the serving time. Should have someone from the kitchen keeping the line running smoothly. I would have given 5 stars otherwise."}
{"text":"What happened to the chocolate covered strawberry that comes with the combo meal? Or maybe that's an Ahwatukee signature. 
A small whole sandwich and a \"very small\" large salad (16$) ... it seems that the portion doesn't match the price. Also there needs to be a healthier choice of bread, other than white flour breads. I've become disillusioned by this restaurant, unfortunately."}
{"text":"I went with my family and friend, my friend ordered 3 strawberries (apart from the strawberries that already come with the meals) and we were missing 2 but still charged. We were also charged for a 3rd combo but only ordered 2 and didn't even receive the other combo item to at least show for it. My nephew's club sandwich was a huge joke, it looked smashed and barely had any cheese in it. (We literally had to look for it in the sandwich). The lady who helped me regarding the missing cheese made another for my nephew and it was still a smashed disappointment, we had to look for the cheese again. I also mentioned we were charged for 3 extra strawberries but only had 1, and that we were charged for a 3rd combo. My friend never got his strawberries but we did get our money back for the 3rd combo charged and was charged the reg. salad price as we were suppose to. This was my 3rd time here and it will be my last."}
{"text":"I came in to order a bunch of food at arrowhead or Glendale location one of them was crab sandwich salad soup and 2 kids meal but in the end I was told they run out of crab sandwich so ok . Then I was told they also don't have milk for kids meal so I told the manager that can you substitute it for apple juice instead, bec. I don't want want soda the manager her name is Christina p said no it's an additional charge for it I said you run out of crab sandwich and no milk and u can't substitute to apple juice? So I ask if I can talk to another manager or if she can give me the corporate # she said she doesn't have it this place sucks btw I spent $36"}
{"text":"We like the food here okay but the way they work the line and how you get your food is terrible. After they make your salads and or soups it goes on a counter with everyone else's until you get to the cashier... soup is not as hot as I would like b/c you're waiting and today they lost my daughter's salad so it took twice as long to check out and ended up remaking it. They said they would bring it out and if they are too busy so I went to get it.. had to make it a 3rd time b/c they made it wrong. For $35 for 3 soup/salad combos they should figure out a better way to get your food to you done right and hot (for the soups). Not excited to come back..."}
{"text":"I've been to this place several times, and I have to say I like it a lot. The concept is pretty cool: you can get half-salads/half-sandwiches and soup combos, which I like. 
Favorite soup: Tuscan White Bean & Vegetable
Favorite salad: pretty much all of them, to be honest. Usually I make up my own (which I like that you can do)
Favorite sandwich: Turkey Cranberry or Turkey Spinach Artichoke.

I like that everything is customizable. It's not too fancy, and in fact a lot of it is fairly basic, but it's simple and healthy and I like it. Kind of like Paradise Bakery. Good atmosphere. Will definitely continue to come back."}
{"text":"This place wasn't anything special. In my opinion there are better places to get better quality soups and salads.

I ordered the BBQ chicken salad which wasn't terrible but they mix the dressing in, and there was so much of it, the salad was almost completely white. I also got the tortilla soup in which I took only 2 bites because it was WAY too salty. The sodium level in it exceeded the canned stuff! My husband is a health nut and hated everything about this place. 

Most likely won't be back. With all the options of eateries in Henderson, I know I can find better."}
{"text":"Ordered the Cuban Pulled Pork sandwich with the wild mushroom soup. Both were deliciously tasty and even got a chocolate dipped strawberry to boot. Food feels fresher than Paradise Bakery but the lines are kind of crazy at lunch. I was also not thrilled with the portion size compared with the price. Seemed a bit more expensive than I thought other places were for the food. 

All in all it was a great experience and will definitely return but maybe slightly earlier to beat the lunch crowd."}
{"text":"I do not recommend this restaurant! I asked to have more vegetables then broth for the  KIDS meal soup, they were unable to accommodate me because they stated that they were trying to save more for other customers...SMH!"}
{"text":"A solid place for soup and a sandwich.  Sometimes you just feel hungry but can't decide what sounds good.....this is a great neutral choice that will satisfy your hunger without sapping your wallet.  The first time I went, it was perfect in every way, the 2nd time I went they were out of a few items and the restaurant was dirtier than I would prefer, but the service is always excellent and the food is delicious."}
{"text":"Love the food but it's so bright in there they really need to change from direct lighting it's really blinding. The dinning area will be much more inviting if the light is diffused feels to sterile"}
{"text":"Not impressed one bit! After seeing the menu online I was very excited to try a new restaurant close to home. It was nothing special, AT ALL! The BBQ chicken salad I ordered had a very slim amount of the ingredients mixed in and it maybe, maybe, had 2 ounces of chicken breast. My daughter had the chicken strips and fruit from the kids menu. She's a toddler and eats ketchup with most items. They didn't have ketchup. The lobster bisque soup was okay. A small salad was not enough food and was not offered a size portion when I ordered it. The bread that comes with the meal is just a section of a cold hard loaf and the butter is over ice so there's no way you're spreading that on your hard loaf. The chocolate covered strawberries were a disappointment as well. Only less than half of the strawberry was dipped. Sad to say it but this place doesn't stand a chance with the other restaurants in the shopping center"}
{"text":"Just had the strangest takeout experience of my life here. Called ahead to place my order order because I'm in a rush. Told the girl on the phone that I'd be there in 15 minutes to pick up the food, and she told me that I should just come in and wait in line because it'd be faster. I'm very confused but I guess I'll just get food somewhere else. Why can't takeout be ready in 15 minutes?"}
{"text":"Average \"fast\" soup, salad, and sandwich place. Really love that they give you a chocolate covered strawberry with every purchase. I like their variety of items. Love the lobster bisque and all the panini's. Love the mangoberry salad because I love fruit in my salad. It gives it more substance and mango's are yummy. Definitely better than Paradise Bakery. Plus, everyone is always so nice."}
{"text":"This place is on the right path, but needs some major changes...they use processed lunch meat and there tofu taste like somebody's science project! They should use real multigrain bread, not the generic junk there selling. They don't even have a vegetarian burger....come on guys, if your gonna go healthy sell us real food, not processed food!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Cafe Zupas is one of the best places to grab lunch or dinner. Their soups, salads, and sandwiches are made fresh and to-order and everything tastes great. They have plenty of options for the picky eaters and even have quite a few dessert options for those with a sweet tooth. You can also get split your meal to get a soup and sandwich if you'd prefer.

Overall, this is a great place to get your foodie fix, the prices aren't bad, but if you're on a budget, you might want to share a meal. Every meal comes with bread and a chocolate-covered strawberry!"}
{"text":"When greeted by a staffer to 'explain the menu' I thought, this is going to be bad, I mean, I've been in hundreds of eating establishments, you order what you want to eat, right? Turns out the guy was just being helpful, pointing out the popular choices and what your meal options are. Easy enough, Thanks man, well done.
I'm off to order my sandwich soup combo, which was tasty. I got the turkey avocado and the lobster bisque soup. Very tasty. Very light (read: not huge portions) but fresh and tasty.
The restaurant was a little loud (people noise) and the temp was pretty chilly but overall I had a good experience."}
{"text":"This place is good but what  I didn't like was I ordered a ultimate grill cheese sandwich. When I made it thought the line it wasn't finished so I had to sit down and they had to bering it out to me no big deal. When I got my sandwich there was nothing ultimate about it is just a basic grill cheese sandwich with wet tomato juice flowing out of it. It was good but not worthy of being called Ultimate. They should change the name and call it The House Grill Cheese Sandwich."}
{"text":"Nice place! Everything is super fresh and tasty. Soups, Salads, Sandwiches, and Deserts is what you can find at Cafe Zupas. Customer service was great too. They were definitely doing the business! I'll be back for some more Wisconsin Cauliflower Soup very soon."}
{"text":"YUM! Great food at a good price. The place does really well mixing up the food choices.  I eat at the one in Desert Ridge and the Biltmore and the food is consistent and great!!"}
{"text":"First time trying Zupas and first time at this location. I really like the choices of food they offer, healthy and fresh! I did a Try 2 Combo, half a salad and half a soup, the Lobster Bisque was awesome. The greens for my salad was veru fresh.

The drinks they have are wonderful, aside from fountain drinks, they have fresh juicea and infused water. I had the Orange Berry Infusion, naturally sweet and all th fruits are fresh!

The service was great, everyone was smiling and willing to explain the choices, since it was our first time here.

Definitely returning."}
{"text":"Zupas is like a really intense Panera. The employees are intense, the flavors are more intense, and my like for it is a lot more intense than that of Panera. I will be back again and again!

There are so many options and for $8, you can get a whole sandwich and a half salad or half soup. There is nothing half about the latter--they are huge. You get more than enough food for $8. I got the ultimate grilled cheese with some chipotle salad, and to end the meal a pistachio \"creme brulee.\" Every bite was excellente of every thing. 

The creme brulee is less of a creme brulee and more of a pudding. Didn't stop me though...I still nearly licked the bowl clean.

Can't wait to go back and check out more offerings and potentially bring in a laptop for a late afternoon work session? I Lovez Zupaz."}
{"text":"Delicious food accompanied with a friendly atmosphere! Will be returning. Love it!! If you like healthy food and quick service definitely try it out! There is no better time than lunch time when you're here."}
{"text":"YUMMMM

this is the food of my dreams. I'm a vegetarian, so it's hard to find places that are meat free as well as tofu and mushy eggplant free. This place hit the spot.

Cauliflower soup... omg. Delicious. I talk about it still. I had the strawberry salad and soup combo. It was an easy 8 bucks. My sister and Mom had some other stuff, I was way too proccupied with my delicious soup to give notice. And it came with a dipped strawberry. heaven.

Is this place a chain? It is such a good chain if it is. Everything was great. My only complaint is that they're closed on Sundays. I hate establishments that are closed on Sundays, I think it's dumb. I drove my whole family here one Sunday afternoon, all excited to introduce my husband to the delicious selection and they were closed. ugh. We're going tomorrow. Maybe that will ease my bitterness of the Sunday thing and cause an extra star to be added.. we will see."}
{"text":"I love this place. Whenever I want a salad soup or sandwich this is the place I go. Fresh and really tasty stuff. They have all different types of soup and they're all really delicious. Defiantly come in on a lunch break or a night dinner."}
{"text":"Everything about this place is great--the cleanliness, the staff, the variety--the only problem is while the food is delicious, the soups are SO SALTY. I am not able to finish the soup because the sodium content is a exploding blood pressure level. Why can't they lower the salt in the soups and let people add salt if they want more? This can't be healthy, and as someone with kidney issues, it makes it impossible for me to eat here. If you have access to an unlimited diuretic pill supply, then this this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Came at 12 o'clock in the afternoon and was not prepared with all the food had to choose another sandwich very loud, worker's not paying attention to orders. Very over priced on what we got. Would not come back."}
{"text":"This. Place. Rocks!!! Ive never had a bad time here, I always have the best service/food! The amount of variety is just to die for! My personal fav is the crab/avocado sandwich with the bbq chicken salad!! The mango salad is also good!! Not sure why anyone would give this place lower than 4 stars... The fact that you get a piece of bread and a chocolate covered strawberry at the end just tops the cake for me! I used to come here all the time before I moved to Colorado, and now when I come visit, Zupas is one of the first places that I'll go!! Yum yum!!!"}
{"text":"I usually come here and it goes really great and don't usually have any complaints. But today I ordered a California Protien Cobb, upon getting home realizing there was no chicken or egg on my
Salad. Also they seemed very disorganized today, the line took way longer than usual."}
{"text":"I was happy to know they were putting a zuppas in my area. We needed a good salad a s sandwich place. I use to go to the henderson location and loved it. 

I have come to this new location a handful of times and only the last 2 times did I notice that two different people both would have their clear gloves on to handle food then afterwards grab a dirty white rag to then clean their station and then go back to handling food. Mind you this rag is dirty and is pulled from underneath or from the other side where more dirt and dust collects on it and it's sole purpose is to clean dirt so you can image how I cringed when I noticed they touched food right after with the same gloves. 

This is a health cleanliness code issue for me and I would think it was for others. I noticed that a few places do this as it is so easy to forget to change your gloves but I strongly think this needs to be an INFORCED RULE as I do not want to now eat my sandwiches after they have been touched by a dirty rag prior. It  is very unfortunate because I really do like their menu. 

Other than that--customer service and smiles are great and consistent. 

Also the togo containers are great for half and half choices but NOT for a whole fill salad-reaaon being that there is a divider in the container and it's hard to mix your salad with the dressing. The smart thing to do would have a clear round container strictly for dull size salads just a thought. 

Lastly- it would be nice if the menu or online provided the calorie counts. Of fast food venues can provide this why can't Zuppas. How have they not thought of this!!?"}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic place. Been here twice already and left pleased both times. Staff is very polite and always gets the order correctly. There's plenty of variety in the menu and everything is delicious. It's always kept clean and you are welcomed as you approach the counter. The honey bacon club sandwich and strawberry chicken salad were incredible. Definitely gonna be one of my new favorite spots to eat. This place is doing things right!"}
{"text":"So happy! I've had Cafe Zupas in Salt Lake City and when my husband and I found out there was one here we were there! I love love love the Turkey Bacon Avocado panini and the Wisconsin Cauliflower soup is definitely my favorite! The atmosphere is fantastic and the food is great! We have a 3 month old and the greeters always offer to go get us a booster seat for his car seat. Really makes getting our food convenient!"}
{"text":"The team here is absolutely amazing. The customer service is unlike anywhere else and the prices are more than fair. In addition, the food tastes great- I truly have no complaints. Thank you so much :)"}
{"text":"Cafe zupas is one of my go to places for a healthy meal. There's so many options to choose from; I always have a hard time choosing only 2 options out of all of the salads, soups, and sandwiches. The sandwiches are a little small, so its best to get a sandwich as part of a \"pick 2\" meal. I love the soups. The creme brulee desserts are amazing! Sometimes I come here just for the dessert. My only complaints are that I don't think the chicken is very good quality, and half the time the lettuce in my salad tastes gritty like it was never washed. Ordering can be a little hectic if it's busy, but I generally get my food pretty quickly."}
{"text":"Ever been to Paradise Bakery? It's the same thing ...at least to me.

I got the Thai Chicken sandwhich and half Thai salad. FYI - the half salad is HUGE! I felt rushed to order, so if I knew the Thai salad came with iceburg lettuce, I would've passed on it. The Thai chicken was ok, had a slight kick. I didn't like the huge bread, it almost took over the inside flavors. The order comes with a chocolate covered strawberry and a slice of french bread. WAYYY to much bread in the meal.

It was okay atmosphere, pretty up to date. But why the hell is the drink fountain in the middle facing the other side of the room? I thought I lost my coworker when she got her drink. I didn't see where she went. LOL

This place is egh. I grabbed a to go menu so next time I go, I can take my time looking it over and try something different before I get there."}
{"text":"First time here and I was overwhelmed at the endless possibilities of lunch combinations! Soups, salads, sandwiches... how do you decide?! It's a $10 lunch combo, super affordable and super tasty. 

I had the BBQ chicken salad & ultimate grilled cheese. The salad had just a little too much dressing but other than that, everything was spot on. The sand which could have been a little bigger but it was worth the price. 

All the lunch combos comes with a bun & chocolate covered strawberry :) 

Like I said, there are endless combinations that you can choose from depending on your liking! With that, I will definitely be back to try something new."}
{"text":"We were heading to the airport to take a short trip and decided to drop by and pickup something to eat on the road.  I've always heard about this place from colleagues who work nearby.  I remember them telling me that the Pesto Chicken Sandwich was amazing, so that's what I ordered.  Here's what is in the Sandwich:

Creamy Chicken Salad w/Pesto, Almonds, Roasted Sweet Red Peppers, Muenster Cheese, Sprouts, Tomatoes

The Chicken is high quality...no fatty pieces.  The Almonds and Sprouts give it a nice crunchy texture when you bite into it and provide a unique flavor that you don't find in most Sandwiches.  It's really good!!!

Since that first trip, we've come by a few more times for a quick bite on the go.  I wish I lived/worked closer so that I could visit more frequently.

Return Factor - 90%"}
{"text":"I had heard a lot of good things from co-workers about Cafe Zupas, but had never been myself until yesterday. I was amazed at how friendly and patient the staff was, how quickly they prepared my meal, how much food I received for such a small price, and how delicious everything was! I will most definitely be back."}
{"text":"Tried for the 1st time. It was super busy but the CZ team has their assembly line down! It was very quick & efficient for such a long line. I tried the \"Try 2 Combo\" - California Protein Cobb salad & Garden Chowder soup. It also came with a small piece of bread & chocolate covered strawberry. The food was delicious! Fresh, tasty, perfect portion! I'm so glad we finally tried! We will definitely be back & soon!"}
{"text":"Talk about busy! Went in on a Monday for lunch & wow, it was crowded! But we were helped right away & snatched a table up quick! Tried the glazed pork chipotle salad & garden chowder soup. My friend had the strawberry harvest with chicken salad. It was all so fresh & tasty!"}
{"text":"So I went in and ordered a sandwich and asked if I could have alfalfa sprouts instead of spinach. I was told that they can take things off but they can't add anything on and it's their \"policy\". So I'll just go somewhere else. If I'm going to pay that much for a sandwich it's going to be the way I want it"}
{"text":"My new favorite place with delicious infused water and great prices on their pick 2! Generous amounts and not very expensive! Great staff and great environment! My new go to for salad, sandwich and soup!"}
{"text":"There are aspects of this restaurant that I love and aspects that I hate.

The Food (5 stars)
Today I had the lobster bisque and the turkey cranberry panini. Both were flavorful with the right blend of texture and temperature. The meal cost $10.12 with tax.

The Customer Service (1 star)
I have only been in this restaurant a handful of times but every time I come in there seems to be a customer service issue. Here is the issue today.  I don't eat chocolate so I requested to swap out the chocolate dipped strawberry with an undippped strawberry. I was watching a worker dip the strawberries through the window so satisfying my request was as easy as stepping around the corner and picking out a strawberry before it was dipped. My request was denied.  I was shocked and protested.  Still denied.  Not too happy, I went to my seat momentarily before asking to speak to a manager.  The manager explained that they don't cater to specific requests because they also use strawberries for salads but that he would get me one.  I found his explanation to be lame but was grateful for the strawberry.

The woman ahead of me in line asked in there was a way she could buy one extra chicken strip because the standard order size wasn't filling enough for her daughter. Her request was denied as well.  

Unfortunately, Cafe Zupas will lose customers due to their hardline inflexibility.  Up to this point, it doesn't seem like they care.  I don't know if I'll be back."}
{"text":"Modern sleek atmosphere. Love the device charging station bar. Very clean. Food and service is always great."}
{"text":"Excellent!  My soup and sandwich were very good. The salads looked awesome too. Meal came with a chocolate covered strawberry.  Wish that I could afford a franchise.  Beats Panera bread."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this place! Always a great experience, the staff is always smiling and super friendly (weather they're faking it or not I will never know!). Very spacious and clean and the food is bomb.com. Mangoberry salad is my fave, as for soup, if you're down to try something different mix the tomatoes basil with cauliflower soup.. you won't regret it!!"}
{"text":"Came here on Wed at 12:45 lunch rush. Parking lot is shared with several other restaurant so very diifucult to find parking. Was incredibly loud and felt like I was being sold a used car. Only 3 people in line but they were in such a rush to serve me i really didnt get to look at their menu. Felt like \"hurry hurry hurry\". Sales staff is really hyper. I like to be quick but this was something else. Food was so so. Nothing special. Most soups were cream based. Wanted to choose my salad ingriedents but they were so hyper i didnt feel i could so i just order a 1/2 dalad and sandwich. Receive a full sandwich and was charged for this. Would be nice if they lowered the volume of music and let you have salad dressing on the side"}
{"text":"This was our first time at Cafe Zupas and it was exceptional. The service was great and fast. My sandwich (seasonal turkey) was among the best sandwiches I've ever had. I also had the Chicken Enchilada Chili. Everything I ate was delicious, and my total meal was less than $11. Will absolutely come back."}
{"text":"To start let me say that the quality and flavor of food is above average. My continued problem is the portion amounts. The sandwiches look nothing like the pictures. Today I ordered A pulled pork and avocado with honey cilantro on white bread and a lobster bisque. When I opened the package the sandwich barely had any ingredients. It looked like they put one scoop of meat in the middle of a whole sandwich and barely put enough the cover one bite from each side when cut in half with a slice or two of avocado and barely a spoon full of cabbage. Like I said. Nothing like the menu pictures. Totally disappointed especially after being so tempted with how delicious it was then the soup had only one chunk of lobster when the menu states a chunky lobster soup. Yea right. Sad experience for me."}
{"text":"I knew we were in trouble when we paid too much for a gnarly arugula salad with a half sandwich.  That, together with our drinks and no dessert cost $31.00.  The salad came tossed with its own dressing.  It was very tasteless and not worth the money."}
{"text":"I love this place! It's always quick service with a very friendly smile! The food is good. My favorite is the crab melt and lobster bisque!"}
{"text":"I would not recommend this place. They have a lot of hidden fees and extra charges that you don't know about until you see your receipt after you paid.

The tall blonde hair guy in the green shirt was the cashier today and he up-charged me an extra $2+ for my to-go kids meal that was for a kid at home... without even asking me if it was for an adult or child. If I hadn't looked at the price when I had walked in I would've been ripped off without knowing it. As I was leaving the restaurant I saw that a drink should have been included in the meal which had not been offered to me at all. So I had to go back in line and get one. 

Good job cafe zupas for almost ripping me off twice in one encounter!"}
{"text":"This place is very good however is kind of pricey. I always get the half soup and sandwich deal with a drink and it is like $13.00. Which is okay sometimes. The food is always very fresh and the special drinks they have are amazing I like the honey cucumber one the best! I have had several things on the menu but I like the Cuban pork sandwich the most ( no mustard for me) and all the soups are good it is always too hard to pick one!  I occasionally get dessert which has always been the mouse cake... it is sooo good! 
The staff is always very friendly and speedy. Also very helpful with the menu items.  They have a nice patio area as well as inside dining. I would say I eat here at least once every two weeks. And every time I go the pace is always very clean!"}
{"text":"As a vegetarian I really like the idea of \"build your own salads\" but was disappointed to find that you only get 4 toppings before you are charged additionally. I had a salad and the wild mushroom soup and both were pretty decent. I wouldn't call this an amazing place but wouldn't mind picking up lunch here again in the future. The french bread and chocolate covered strawberries that came with my meal was a delicious bonus."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch.  Service is quick. There is a sign that asks you to make your decision before you order.  There are lots of choices and prices are very reasonable.  The food is good.   They do need to improve their service because as I proceeded in line, was asked 2 additional times what I ordered.  Really?  Why can't the initial order be logged into the register with a name associated?  
This eatery is located in a Mall so there is a lot of traffic.  The noise level is very high.  The music is way too loud.  Also the wait staff bus the dishes to a common area and throw the plastic dishes into a dirty bin.   That was not necessary!  If you want to have a conversation, go somewhere else.  
I would go again but not during a heavy eating time.  By the time we left, it was much calmer."}
{"text":"Is it a new year and you have new goals set? If you're a person who has to go out and eat for lunch this is a healthy food option for you! 
 
They offer a variety of salads along with soups and sandwiches. You have the option of getting a combo, so you can mix up your choices and save. 

The place can get crowed and congested as the tables are close together. It has a nice environment and the staff is very friendly. The line moves pretty fast as there are a few staffers there while you are ordering your food. This place is a defiantly a place to try out!"}
{"text":"My sandwich was good and tasty, the clam chowder was nothing special.  Staff was great."}
{"text":"My new all time favorite lunch spot especially if you are looking for healthier options for a good price. They are in the same category as Paradise Bakery and Wildflower but in my mind much better and more cost effective for what you get. They are efficient going down the line and very have friendly Customer Service. Not to mention the desserts are amazing for those with a sweet tooth!"}
{"text":"First time here today and I was impressed to say the least. I had the Cuban pork Panini... This was THE BEST sandwich I have had in a long time and I genuinely mean that. I saw a picture of it on their online menu and knew right away that's what I was ordering and man was I glad I did. This was my first time to Café Zupas but the entire visit was excellent, from an employee holding the door when you show up welcoming you in to your food being ready by the time you are through the line and paying to the awesome selection of drinks in their \"Drink bar\".. I will definitely be back.... Probably later this week!"}
{"text":"Decent food, but they are very petty here. I paid an extra 69 cents to get croutons on my lobster bisque. They provided 5 croutons. When I went back to ask for more croutons, the dunce behind the counter had to confer with another coworker with regard to whether dispensing a few extra croutons. They then had the audacity to inform me he limit is 5 croutons and i needed to purchase more croutons - you know, the stale pieces of toast you are free to shovel on your salad at the average salad bar. SMH."}
{"text":"I have been here twice in the last 2 weeks.  I ordered the Take 2 each time with a sandwich (panini) with either a cup of soup or side salad.  Both were great.  They love to have you sample the soup. Wisconsin cauliflower was awesome!  I had the turkey artichoke panini both times.  Yum!  The refresher drinks are so delicious.  I had the honey lemonade and the orange version too. Yeah!  Huge upgrade from other \"salad and bread\" joints.  Only caveat is the bread is not so good.  Who needs it!"}
{"text":"If pizza rev or chipotle had a soup-sandwich restaurant, it would be here.  Price for quality is decent, but I remember coming for the grand opening and they gave enormous chocolate strawberries.  The strawberries have shrunk since, but I \"get it\".  Overall great experience. I most enjoyed the lobster bisque.  I can't promise I will come here regularly, but they didn't disappoint me."}
{"text":"Eh. Not too bad. Not great either. My wife and I weren't sure what to get, so we tried a few different things. Between us, we tried the Honey Bacon Club, which was decent. The Mediterranean Turkey was ok. And we tried just a regular turkey just sort of plain. They let us build our own sandwich for that one. We asked if they had brown mustard. They didn't know. One girl said it was 'kinda yellow'.  The other girl said 'we have balsamic dressing. That's brown'. Really?! Are you that dumb? I'm not a salad person, but some of their salads looked pretty intriguing. Their soups on the other hand, well although they are different, none of them looked appetizing at all. It's a shame because I was really in the mood for soup. Desserts were ok. Guess they forgot my chocolate-covered strawberries, and I was looking forward to those too. They get a star for the overly nice employees(even if they aren't the brightest bulb in the chandelier), and for their surprisingly soft ciabatta bread. My wife may want to come back. I really could care less."}
{"text":"Definitely my new favorite lunch spot and it's a perfect location being just down the street from me! 

I've been wanting to try Cafe Zupas for some time now being that my work gets it catered sometimes but I'm never working the days they order. 

They have combos available which is what I decided on: a crab avocado sandwich with a half portion of the mushroom bisque! The soup was my favorite! I can't get over it. There are many options that I'm excited to go back and try. A bread roll is included with the combo and they also throw in one chocolate covered strawberry! Yum! 

They have many desserts on display and I couldn't resist! Especially my favorite creme brûlée! They had many different kinds but I went with the salted caramel creme brûlée and it was delicious! 

They also have a recharge bar to charge your electronics which is a plus! And also flavored syrup pumps for your sodas!"}
{"text":"Not my first time here but I like it so I went tonight when I needed a salad. I got the new strawberry harvest chicken salad because it was a nice balance of carbs and protien. I swapped out the cheese for quinoa for an additional .69 which was fine by me. I took my food to go and sat outside with my family. I was so hungry that by the time I got halfway thru I realized there was no chicken!! I finished off my dinner a little upset wondering how do I bring it up?? Do I tweet it out, yelp it? Well since I was still there I decided to go back in the store and let them know they forgot the chicken. They first said I can get you the chicken,  but I told him I ate it all. I was hungry. So he just kinda shrugged his shoulder and said sorry. 

I came home and grabbed a bite of a protien bar in hopes to get some protein I needed but I'm still annoyed that I paid over $8 for a chicken salad that had no chicken!  Ugh, wish they could have somehow compensated me when I walked in and confronted. or is it my fault that I ate half of the salad without realizing and then finished off the salad knowing it was missing. Idk... I was seriously starving and didn't want to go back in after I sat down outside."}
{"text":"This is some serious eats!

Tucson needs to get one!

This is better than Paradise, Panera, and even better than Beyond Bread. This is a beyond bread experience.

First, the menu is neatly organized. Sandwiches, first column paninis. Next panel, salads. First column more sweet, second column more savory. Third panel, soups.

The sandwiches are incredible. I had the Crab Melt. The salads are delightful. I had the Super Foods with blackberries, pomegranate, walnuts, spinach, other stuff topped with blueberry pomegranate vinaigrette. One of the best salads I've ever had.

The second day, (YES, I went back the next day because the previous day I sampled their...) soup! Homemade from scratch. You see, they have a combo special for only $8.xx where you can get a full sandwich and a half salad or soup. Or you can get a half salad and half soup. Or you can get a sandwich and a half soup. I had the sandwich/salad combo the first day. The soup samples sent me to heaven. I returned the next day.

Tucson needs one of these.

Next day I had the Thai Mango Salad and the Roasted Red Pepper Lobster soup. My wife had the Shanghai Chicken salad and the Wild Mushroom Bisque. So, so, so good. We also shared a berry creme brulee and a Rocky Road brownie.

They actually had fountain ginger ale. I've never seen that anywhere. That alone gets a star. And then you could squirt some Italian soda syrup in. At the soda station for free. I put in a dash of raspberry. Yum.

Tip: only get a half size for the salad and soup. I really do not see how anyone could eat a full size as the half size are SO generous!

5 stars. No less."}
{"text":"Well.., not a good experience to start off with order the food got to The cashier they were confused about the order and very rude about it... Okay let's get to the food... Claim chowder was water down had no flavor The creamy chicken soup was overloaded with everything else but chicken also the salad we couldn't find a chicken couple little pieces and that was it I don't think they should advertise that as chicken salad. This should be first and last experience at this place."}
{"text":"Terrific place, great decor, huge flat screen tv's encouraging you to eat eat. I stood in line and decided on a soup, sandwich combo. I said I would like to try the \"such and such\" soup. To which the attendant promptly gave me a sample in a little cup after having asked if I have peanut allergies. The sandwich seemed a bit small but the bread made it worth all the while and heavy to prove to be just enough to satisfy my wolf-like-appetite that I can have. All in all what a great joint, can't wait for the weather to cool down so I can spend a mindless afternoon on the patio."}
{"text":"I've been here about three times now and I like how it's so close to my house. They finally opened one near by. I always get the Pick Two Combo: a sandwich and a salad, which also comes with a small side of French bread and a chocolate covered strawberry. Today, I ordered the Turkey Spinach Artichoke sandwich and the BBQ Chicken Salad. You get a decent portion and it fills you up. 

I like to come here for lunch and even a late lunch. This place does get pretty busy and crowded though. I feel like there's too many tables for the space they have. Other than that, the staff are friendly and provide good service. 

I'll definitely be back and I'll try a different combo next time."}
{"text":"I love this place!!! It's so yummy, and tons to choose from. If you want to eat freaking, and healthy give this place a try. They offer soup, salads, and sandwiches. You can even choose options where you can create your own combinationd. I have never had any problems with this location, busy but worth the wait. It runs fast and smoothly. Clean and friendly services, and great food, what more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"I am so confused by all the poor ratings. I have tried many many things at Cafe Zuppas including: 

Strawberry Harvest Chicken Salad
Garden Chop Salad with Blue Cheese
Cherry Balsamic Chicken Salad
Glazed Chicken Chipotle Salad
Tomato Basil with Orzo Pasta Soup
Wild Mushroom Bisque Soup
Chicken Enchilada Chili 
Roasted Red Pepper & Lobster
Hungarian Beef Stew (World Tour Special)
Honey Cilantro Carnitas 
Ultimate Grilled Cheese
Cuban Grilled Pork

Clearly I keep coming back. While some of the aforementioned items were less amazing than others, none of them were bad. 

I read some previous reviews mentioning salads being too wet or too sweet, but in my opinion that's your poor review of the menu. I found the Glazed Chicken Chipotle salad to be too wet but I take responsibility for not asking for lite dressing knowing they include two dressings in the salad. I don't think that means Zuppas makes a terrible salad. If you don't like a sweet salad or salad dressing don't order a menu salad, you have the option to \"create your own\" 

While I do agree the layout was poorly conceived and it's annoying snaking through tables full of people during lunch rush, the amount of fresh food for the price made me get over it fast. 

Simply put, I love Zuppas and can't wait to try more menu items."}
{"text":"I enjoy coming here for soup and salad. Lots of great, healthy choices. Favorite salad is kale with quinoa. Great drink bar selection!"}
{"text":"Ugh!!! So amazing. Their ordering station is set up \"Subway style,\" so the options and various toppings are laid out in front of you and you select whatever add-ins make you happy. Unlike Subway, however, Cafe Zupas gives you the option to TRY THINGS OUT before you eat them. I didn't even know how much I needed that until someone gave me the option. This time I had the 9$ combo with a chicken pesto sandwich and a half bowl (half is way more than enough) of Tortilla soup. It was fabulous! But based on the little taste I got of both the clam chowder and the lobster bisque, there are a ton of viable options, and I am indecently excited to try them all."}
{"text":"Terrible service. My first time going. The girl taking my order didn't help me at all, I was trying to get a simple sandwich with a fruit cup and was practically ridiculed by her and the girls making my food. They said I couldn't customize my sandwich and then when I ordered their custom one with none of the fancy stuff on there, then they all just started laughing and looking at me like I was dumb. Then I tried to get a fruit cup instead of a salad or soup and she told me that was pretty much for kids. Wtf! Who cares I'm trying to give them money for a little thing of fruit and she's worried about me not being a 10 year old. So I tell her fine just give me the sandwich, so she's like OK and literally throws the box, that has my order written on it, to the counter where they were making it. I was polite and smiling the whole time but these girls were not helpful at all and very rude. I would not recommend."}
{"text":"Well I found my new go to spot! I ordered the strawberry harvest salad and the chicken enchilada chili, they did not disappoint. I liked the salad so much that I had it for dinner the same night. Their infused drinks are great. My only suggestion is that they add more toppings to the salads. They are a bit stingy with the toppings as if everything is counted before adding it on."}
{"text":"Lobster bisque and roasted red pepper soups are my favorite!  Great place to come for a healthy sandwich or salad and soups."}
{"text":"nice little casual lunch spot. I'd like to say I go here at least almost once a week. if you can't make up your mind between a salad, soup or sandwich - there's a combo option for only $9, which the portions are perfect and fulfilling for the price. they also let you sample the soups which I should have done from the start but didn't until my 2nd visit.

the pesto chicken panini is great. if you're into sauces like I am, definitely get a side of honey mustard to dip that bad boy in it. 

next time around, I did the combo and went with the chicken chipotle glaze salad with the chicken tortilla soup. I'm officially addicted to the salad and get it every time I go there. I love the combination of spicy and sweet dressing on it. I also asked for extra onions which they wanted to charge extra for. normally I can see them charging extra for a meat/protein or even guacamole but for a veggie like onions? alrighty then. what threw me off was when the one employee met me by the register and had this disconcerting look on her face. she said there's olives in my salad, which it normally doesn't come with. she didn't apologize but instead asked if I wanted a different one.. I just went with what I already had cause she was making me uncomfortable. 

a few times, when I got to the register they always ask what I ordered and other times they already know. I feel like they should probably get that down a little better. sometimes the staff is really nice, and other times they're stale. customer service needs to be consistent.

as far as the soups go, do what I mentioned earlier and try before you buy. a couple times the tortilla has been overly salty. I changed it up and went with the roasted veggie quinoa which was delicious. 

less salt, more friendliness."}
{"text":"Turkey spinach artichoke sandwich with two stubs of tomato slices and two leaves of spinach. No thank you. New England clam chowder. More like water scallion soup. Brought my sandwich up to the counter and asked Janet in her green chef coat if it was normal to have only two leaves of spinach on this sandwich with it in the name and all and she says yes it is instead of trying to fix this easily fixable issue. I went and said if that is the case that is fine and I won't be back. Sorry to say $30 later a pile of trash in front of me I wish I went to subway. Would have been a better meal. Believe me this is not a plug for subway this is just how horrible Zupas was in my experience at this specific location. I did rather enjoy them in Henderson on eastern but they rather have hearded guests through the line then rather make sure they put out the quality expected of this fresh food chain."}
{"text":"Wisconsin cauliflower soup.  Love it anytime of day or year.  Not much for any of their sandwiches but can't  go wrong with any of the soups or salads.  Salads are made to order and chocolate covered strawberries  are a nice touch."}
{"text":"I really like this place and you will also!

Its awesome with customized sandwiches to your order and liking!  Yum!

Add some chips and soup and you are set to go!

Maybe even some yummy desert!  OMG  Calorie Over Loads!

Lets go workout!  LOL

The staff is very professional, restaurant is very clean, and the atmosphere is Nice!

A must go with your friends, family or a casual date for lunch!

See You There!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place! It's great for a Saturday lunch (closed on Sundays). 

We've tried most of their soups, but the mushroom bisque is absolutely the best. All other soups pale in comparison. It's delicious with an Asiago crouton.

The sandwiches we've tried are all good, but none of them truly stand out. That's the only reason why I'm giving them 4 stars instead of 5. The Mediterranean sandwich they're currently featuring is pretty yummy.

I love their soda fountain. They have a variety of flavored syrups, some of them sugar-free, to make your own Italian-style soda. I love Sprite with a bit of raspberry, strawberry, and/or blueberry.

With their you-pick-two meals you can get a half size soup, whole sandwich, and a chocolate covered strawberry. After a couple of trips the hubby and I figured out that one meal was plenty for the two of us. This makes it a very wallet-friendly eatery."}
{"text":"My first time eating here. A Friday evening, with a line that moved fast. Was greeted & assisted by friendly employees. I ordered the 2 combo and got a soup & salad. I tasted several soups, Tomato Basil, Chicken Tortilla & chicken Enchilada- the Tomato was creamy but a little sweet, The Tortilla soup had a little too much Cumin, and the Enchilada soup was creamy and tasty- that's what I got. I also ordered the Chicken protein Cobb salad with ranch dressing. The food was fresh and flavorful. The small roll would've been better warm and the chocolate dipped strawberry was a nice, complimentary touch. I had their juice/water infusion. I tasted them all and preferred the Lemonade with raw honey- but I added a splash of raspberry flavoring. Overall I enjoyed the food. The place was busy but clean. The only complaints -it was freezing inside and I'm normally not cold, and the bathroom didn't have toilet paper."}
{"text":"Love this place. But went in to try something different and ask what was in there herds vinaigrette and they told me oil vinaigrette and other stuff we don't know ..... I think this should be known especially if zuppas says everything is made fresh everyday"}
{"text":"The service was great (for the most part). There was a young lady holding the door open for customers and helping them with the menu/process, which is nice. The girl working the soup counter was very pleasant, but the group of kids working the salads and sandwiches were kind of rude.

The lobster bisque is phenomenal. I like that you can actually get a whole sandwich with a salad or soup for the \"You Choose Two\" deal. The sandwiches are a lot smaller than the sandwiches at Paradise Bakery, though. I thought that the BBQ Chopped Chicken Salad was delicious.

It was $18 for two salads, a whole sandwich and a cup of lobster bisque. Not terrible price wise."}
{"text":"I came to this place with low expectations because my friend told me that they heard this place wasn't that great. Little did I know that this would end up being my favorite soup/sandwich place in Las Vegas. I usually go to Panera Bread but as a vegetarian find my options limited there, here there are so many unique options for vegetarians and non-vegetarians alike. The tomato soup here is also a perfect blend of creamy and salty. The ambience of the whole cafe is also really nice and brightened my day."}
{"text":"Was just there for 45 minutes. Ordered a salad without cheese  and a Turkey bacon avocado sandwich without tomato. I had cheese on the salad and after 4 attempts at the sandwich and them not getting it right. First one had tomato. 2nd one wasnt the right sandwich at all, 3rd time it had no bacon and 4th time no Turkey. I asked for my money back and left."}
{"text":"I love café zupas as it's fresh food, freshly prepared and not overpriced. The people are genuine and provide a great experience. They have fresh soups, salads, and great sandwiches. Every meal comes with a free chocolate covered strawberry. Great location, people and food. It doesn't get better then this."}
{"text":"A really nice find. I usually avoid the Colonnade shopping center since the parking is HORRIBLE. But, sigh, we had to be there and I was starving. Amazing lobster bisque! I am usually disappointed in lobster bisque, but this actually had the lobster flavor and small bits of lobster. Good salad, nice drink selection and Italian ice flavorings for your beverage, gratis. Portions with a salad and small soup were perfect! We got 2 choco covered strawberries-is that something they just do? I don't remember ordering them, but yum. It's an order at the counter place, and carry your food to your table, but the guy behind the counter saw that my mother was using a walker and volunteered to carry the tray of soups over for us. They have an outdoor seating area too. I am adding this place to my list of yummy food spots. Very reasonable too!"}
{"text":"My experience here was amazing i ordered the Red Pepper Lobster soup with the Chicken Pesto sandwhich, they have a combine 2 for 8.95 alot like panera bread, actually this was a bit if a replica. The soup was heavy with lobster in my opinion it was a little too much it took away from the red pepper taste, but still DELICIOUS! The sandwhich was to die for i loved everything about it, the second combine 2 dish i tried was the New England Clam Chowder with the Honey Bacon Club sandwhich, the clam chowder was eh, nothing to special but very good.. The sandwhich was amazing as well but after awhile the taste of honey mustard became a little too much, to me it tasted like a corn dog. The place was clean and the atmosphere was very nice, not to mention the infused drinks they had were amazing! My favorite had to be the Raw Honey Lemonade.. super good everything seemed healthy definitely worth the 4 stars. Oh and the chocolate strawberries are what made this place worth coming for! Even tho sometimes you get a smaller strawberry than someone else."}
{"text":"I love coming here for lunch today it was a lil bit busy and took awhile for all of us to get our food but still it's so delish .. One of my fav places always clean and the employees are so friendly"}
{"text":"Great selection of soups, sandwiches, and salads. The place is really busy and parking sucks. Really helpful and eager to please staff. Tried the lobster bisque and was a bit different than what I have had in the past, but still good. Really enjoyed the Cuban sandwich. The sandwich had a really good flavor combination."}
{"text":"Why? Seriously, are you so mad balling that you just have money to burn? Make a donation to your favorite charity, and go across the street and hit up the Cafe Rio. Win, win. 

This place is half assed on a good day, but costs full ass. The food is nasty, in miniature proportions. 

I'll never be back. $60.00 for $11.00 worth of food. Then, they insult you with a chocolate covered strawberry at the end, like that makes up for it. 

Nobody, is this hungry... Not even those little Ethiopian kids on the television. No thanks!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to grab lunch.  I love their fresh ingredients and get the pick 2 deal.  Love the kale and quinoa salad and the wild mushroom soup, also the cauliflower soup is great.  I usually add the crispy onions as a topping.  It's nice how the include  bread and a chocolate covered strawberry for dessert."}
{"text":"I tried Café Zupas today for the first time, for lunch. I didn't really know what to expect going in, and ended up a little underwhelmed. I tried the half soup and half Sandwich. I ordered the chicken pesto and the cauliflower soup (with no bacon on top). A roll and a chocolate covered strawberry were provided automatically with the meal. I have to say, the half-and-half was way too much food for me. I would've been fine with just a half sandwich or just the half soup... and I was very disappointed that chips are not offered as a side. 

Zupas also offers salad's and protein bowls. All
of the food seems very fresh, and customizable for those picky eaters. They also offer 4 different kinds of refreshers. This seemed like their own version of the Bai drinks. I tried the coconut pomegranate which was delicious. In the future, I would stop at Zupas just to grab one while I'm out shopping at Greenway Station. 

My only other complaint is that the music seemed a little too much like club music, and that they only offered plasticware instead of silverware as an in-dining option. In the future I would be definitely go back but it wouldn't be on the top of my list."}
{"text":"It was our first time here and it was very good.  I didn't know what to expect and the four stars is really because I'm not a fan of cafeteria style restaurants . I think
If there was more of a line there would be a great chance of messing up orders as I've read in other reviews . Fortunately , we were the only ones in line ordering .The kale quinoa salad  was delicious . More restaurants should embrace kale . The pesto chicken sandwich was really tasty . My husband had the mushroom soup and California avocado sandwich and really enjoyed it . A nice touch is the little chocolate covered strawberry . The $23 tab was very reasonable . The atmosphere is busy and chaotic so it's not the place to go for a leisurely , mellow dining experience. But for a good lunch made with high quality fresh sourced ingredients , it fits the bill ."}
{"text":"I would come here over and over again for their tortilla soup and salads. Everything is so fresh and full of flavor! I came in for lunch one day and even on a busy day, you still get really good customer service and the line moves along pretty quickly. You def must try this place if you havent already"}
{"text":"I've been to Cafe Zupas before but each time it never fails to overwhelm me lol. It has a WIDE selection of sandwiches, salads, and soups. They also have desserts but each meal comes with a chocolate dipped strawberry. 

When I came to this location, I just went with my usual Chicken Enchilada Chili soup and the Nuts About Berry salad. They have A LOT going on which isn't bad but is a little overwhelming. I feel like it's kind of a Panera Bread on steroids lol. 

Anyways, my soup has add-ins of sour cream, cheese, and tortilla strips which are all 69 cents each. The soup itself is really good! I like how filling it is and how it really tastes like a chicken enchilada.The Nuts About Berry salad is a little on the sweeter side but pairs nicely with the soup since its that salty/sweet combo. Overall the food is good, but it's just a little hectic in there. Maybe it depends on the location though."}
{"text":"Is it possible to have the perfect lunch?

Yes! And I found it here at Cafe Zupas!  

There are enough soup, salad, and sandwich choices to please every palate.  It is the perfect light lunch that is very reasonably priced.  You can get a combo for under $10!

Healthy? Questionable but that depends on what you get. The soups are mostly cream based and the dressings are rich. I got my dressing on the side but found my salad to be so flavorful as is that I hardly needed dressing.

And the strawberry on top is that you get a free chocolate dipped strawberry with your meal!  Awesome!

Service is amazing too! Everyone is so friendly and helpful. I couldn't have felt more welcomed."}
{"text":"Zupas is like that ex boyfriend you keep going back to even though they aren't that good to you. I will catch myself craving it randomly though. Service is great and consistent for sure but the food? It's just okay and they're so shiesty with portions lol. Like literally they count how many grape halves go on your salad like wow. I love the nuts about berries salad, chicken pesto panini, citrus pork carnitas sandwich, grilled cheese and cauliflower soup. They used to give you this really good French bread and a chocolate dipped strawberry with every meal. Now you get a dry, store bought roll and a strawberry that's never ripe and it's barely dipped in chocolate you'd think it was a mistake lol. Even still I find myself here a handful of times a year. Good enough."}
{"text":"4 stars because I love this place but, I want to point out something that happened. 

There was a child in the restaurant running from table to table, putting the salt shakers in his mouth. When we pointed it out to an employee she said, \"that's why we clean them frequently\" and went back behind the counter and did nothing about it. All of the salt shakers were sitting on the tables with kid spit all over the part where the salt comes out and the employee did not care. Unacceptable. I know how hard it is to find invested help, however.

The food is delicious and healthy and you get a free chocolate covered strawberry with each order. I really like it here. I wish it wasn't so dangerous to eat out. Lol."}
{"text":"I'm loving this place fresh ! They spend hours on their recipes and believe me you can tell ! I got the Turkey avocado  sandwich  Grilled and it was a great choice! I'm very impressed... This place reminds me of a subway but everything is fresh and organic ,"}
{"text":"The food is good, but the portions are ridiculous. When you ask them to give you more it seems like it pains them to do so. You would think that they're taking food out of their kids plate to give to you.  You would figure for an $8 salad they would be  a little more generous with the portions."}
{"text":"Food was actually pretty good, very fresh. But I have never seen a restaurant be so stingy with portions. Geez! They get out an exact measuring device for each and every ingredient. I'm surprised they didn't weigh the salad at the end to be 100% certain it was 5.7897 ounces. A little short on the portion size and you pay a little too much for what you get. 

It is clean, and staff is customer friendly."}
{"text":"I have probably eaten here a dozen times and finally decided I have to to say something.  This place is CONSISTENTLY excellent.  The paninis are my favorite in Phoenix. I also love the Italian soda bar.  I always leave this place very happy with my meal."}
{"text":"The food is terrific, healthy, and with a wide variety of options. 

Only reason not 5 star is because they ask you multiple times what you ordered... You think there's be some sort of ticket system instead of it being as hodge podge as it is."}
{"text":"Great service, fresh food, and super fun with my daughter. Also enjoyed the chocolate strawberry on the side."}
{"text":"This place rocks.  I love it here.  If you like soup this is for you. 

I love the wild mushroom soup it's the best I have ever had.  

How I order the combo with Italian and wild mushroom soup (but I ask for a large bowl). 

All the good is great the chocolate covered strawberry is a nice touch. 

Only one complaint I have been to two locations now and it seems like the ordering part is still working out the kinks."}
{"text":"So I have been to zupas a couple of times, and every time I get soup I notice they always under fill the bowl (to go and dine in). I understand leaving a wee bit so it does not overflow but this is just ridiculous. Is there a legitimate reason for this or are you guys like chip manufacturers where $1 of the $1.50 goes towards the air in the bag? I would be ok with that if I was not paying $6.39 for the soup. Or maybe next time i will just pay $5.75 since im only getting 90% of what I paid for. I think it's only reasonable to get what you pay for right?"}
{"text":"I have a feeling I will be here at least once a week.  The Strawberry Harvest Chicken salad was yummy!  And it came with a chocolate covered strawberry on the side."}
{"text":"Noisy-- loud-- terrible customer service-- The place is new and we were there during opening. But it was a mess. The drink dispensers were dry--- no napkins. Food orders were mixed up. The staff was undertrained. The food mediocre at best -- somewhat expensive if compared with a sit down full service eatery.
Nothing inspired us to ever return--"}
{"text":"The soups are amazing. Try the lobster bisque. The salads are very good. Skip the sandwiches!"}
{"text":"I love Cafe Zupas, but the quality at this location is lacking. I find the Eastern location to be more consistent. I've had good food and service here, but I've had disappointing food as well. Seems to be about a 50/50 shot from my experience. I was so excited when this location opened, but it did not deliver. I'll be traveling the extra distance to Eastern from now on."}
{"text":"I've eaten another Zupas before but I ordered a Cuban sandwich and that sandwich was lousy it just didn't taste right never go there again"}
{"text":"We go here pretty often to eat in,and for take out the food is great! The only issue I would bring up is that they give you small portions for the price you pay. Plus they even have vegan options for soup and salad."}
{"text":"I love Cafe Zupas! This is a new location, but the food is still amazing. I went during lunch time and they were slammed!! But that didn't stop them from being very friendly while efficiently moving the line along. I almost turned around and left when I saw how busy they were, but I'm glad I didn't because I was in and out with a great meal. I did the \"try 2 combo\" with a Cuban pork sandwich and my fave salad the cherry balsamic chicken. Both were delicious! I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I love this Café Zupas! Always very professional, ALWAYS early (but not too early), we have never had a bad experience with this place. We are a large construction company and we cater from here all the time. When they arrive the drivers are always so courteous and always help set up and arrange the meals. They always do their best to accommodate us, even if it is super last minute and I need to add one more sandwich to our order, this place can handle it!! They are rock stars, love love love this place. Highly recommend it for catering or just going in and dinning. Never had a bad experience here. 

Thank you Eastern Café Zupas!!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Maui Tropical Chicken salad and it was delicious.  I also ordered the Chicken Pesto sandwich which was also good but they still put tomatoes when I said specifically no tomatoes because I'm allergic, very disappointed.  Overall food was good but their listening to my food allergies is very poor.  I'll try again later, maybe."}
{"text":"I was hesitant of going here after seeing their 3.5 star rating on Yelp but I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of food here. House-made healthy soup/salad/sandwiches served at an affordable price.

Though I did like the food, I thought the service here was just odd. They have an assembly line where each staff seems to have a set station but it's extremely unorganized and inefficient. I also think the ordering system here is plain confusing. I don't know if it's just me but I had a hard time figuring out how to order or what to get. Also didn't help because I'm at one station ordering a sandwich and a staff at a soup station is already asking me what soup I'm ordering. \"Would you like some soup today?\"...\"Sorry I'm still deciding.\" 

Then 20 seconds later, \"Would you like some soup today?\" \"WOULD YOU LIKE SOME SOUP TODAY?\" ....Holy moly, how many times are you going to ask me? Calm down soup server. I'm not ready yet.  I guess it is my fault for not knowing what I want on my first visit? Then come to the register and we are met with a rude cashier. Ugh.

On the bright side, our food was fantastic. We got kale and quinoa salad, cuban grilled pork panini sandwich, wild mushroom bisque and asian citrus chicken salad. Salads were drenched in dressing so I did not like it too much. However, I did enjoy the sandwich and mushroom soup. 

Cuban grilled pork had a smoky taste to it. Panini was thin and sandwich was a small portion but I loved the flavor. Small bite and I was instantly in love. One bite kept me wanting another. Mushroom soup was rich and creamy, wish it had more mushroom in it instead of few small pieces. I got to try a sample of tomato basil soup and that was one of the best soup I had. Wish they sell it by gallon. 

Unpleasant service but enjoyed the food. I would come back in a heartbeat especially now that I know what I like from here."}
{"text":"I am so frustrated with this chain restaurant. I've been there several times as I like to walk to dinner and it is within walking distance. Protein quantities are slim and fat seems high. I order triple chicken on a salad and still am only given what other good restaurants would offer as one serving of chicken. A serving of tomatoes on a salad was about six halves of cherry tomatoes.  The red onion was equivalent to a loosely packed tablespoon.  They are super modest with their ingredients, except for the fatty or sweet sauces.  I'm not sure if the honey-cilantro dressing really has honey as it is SO sweet... It tastes like corn syrup.  My order has been made wrong several times and seems to get mixed up with other people's food (coming down the disorganized food line), as workers grab as several different items with their hands, asking me what I had for the second or, usually, a third time, before pulling food off of the line and ringing it up.  One time, I even asked the worker to write down my order as I make a few modifications, and he did not (he memorized it instead), and still, it was wrong.  The process from ordering to paying is disorganized and requires that one keep a close eye on their food, then hustle out of the line as lines behind come through the register (which has limited space for the size of the trays).
 
I have been undergoing the extensive process of learning to eat healthy for personal health reasons and suspect that this chain is coming off of my healthy food list.  I do not eat out often but decided to try this place and learn about their food/ingredients/nutrition in the process.  I pay attention to food sources, fillers, preservatives, and quality of ingredients as much as I do calories/macronutrients.  Twice I have asked for nutritional info. The first time, an employee told me they \"didn't have them for 2017, yet\".  The look on her face seemed as though there was something more she wasn't saying.  The second time, I spoke to the general manager, she said they don't provide nutritional info but she could guide me through making a \"healthy\" selection. I told her that I feel cautious of restaurants that don't provide nutrition info and I can't tell if their soup is 300 calories in a serving or 1000 calories (a serving, as in one cup/8 oz.). She, in her own words, told me that the chain was not going to provide nutritional info until required by law, but that she understood my frustration. HUGE RED FLAG that this restaurant (the higher up corporation) is hiding something!!!  Even in looking at their food sources on the main website, they try to persuade the viewer that the food is from a \"healthy\" source. There is no commitment or label of USDA organic or non-GMO, which places them in category of \" ???\" and probably not as healthy as one would hope.  Not that this us unusual in the fast or restaurant food industry... I was disappointed to see a place that could be \"healthy\" hiding information from consumers.

My experience at your restaurant last night felt dishonest and misleading. My $$$ is going elsewhere until I know what I'm eating.  I would not recommend this place for people with food allergies or for those who are trying to be nutrient-conscious.  There are also several things they could do to hasten and smooth out the ordering process."}
{"text":"If you can't get to Nordstrom's cafe come here...WAIT...as a matter of fact, just skip the pricey, long drive to the Fashion Show eatery and COME HERE!

YUM YUM YUM YUM YUM...you get the picture.

Great speedy FRIENDLY service. Perfect place to grab a quick fresh bite to eat.  

Everything on the menu looked amazing...13 types of sandwiches, healthy berry and chicken types of salads, and ten soups to choose from:

CLAM CHOWDER
LOBSTER BISQUE
WISCONSIN CAULIFLOWER
GUMBO
TOMATO BASIL 
CHICKEN TORTILLA
CHICKEN ENCHILADA SOUP
TUSCAN WHITE BEAN
WILD MUSHROOM BISQUE
ROASTED RED PEPPER AND LOBSTER

I know, I know, I said the same thing...\"which one should I get, they all sound so good\"! Start with one and come back the next day...and the next day...and the next day...

A friendly greeter meets you at the door and since this was our first time eating here it was helpful to have some guidance.  She made some recommendations based on \"popular\" selections but we went our way.  My only complaint was that the dining room was freezing! It was warmer outside and it was 59 degrees that day! Turn the heat up during these chilly days please!

Honestly I'm not a fast-food soup person...I'm a total Soup-Snob. I've been to Sweet Tomatoes (bland) I've been to Panera (not impressed). I like my soup tasty hot and full of flavor. I prefer to have it at my favorite white linen tablecloth restaurant cafe or bistro. But, I have to say... I was pleasantly surprised with our order.

Trying to choose a combination lunch here was like trying to choose between chocolate covered strawberry's or creme brûlée...hmmm tough decision.  Oh, and by the way, both are served here for dessert.  And the strawberries come with the combo meal.  Yipee!  I told you this place was awesome.

We had a lunch combo which lets you order soup or sandwich or soup and salad.  I had the roasted red pepper lobster bisque with the mango berry salad- and the hubby ordered the cream of mushroom with fried onions and a avocado turkey bacon panini...oh my goodness, can you say a contender for my last meal on earth? Soup was hot spicy and fabulous.  Sandwich was warm, crispy and tasty. We shared every bite and I suggest you bring a few friends and do the same. 

This is the only Cafe Zuppas in town and the other is in Henderson.
  
Well, what are you waiting for?  Go Now!"}
{"text":"Came to Cafe Zupas thanks to their colorful flyer in our mail toting 50% off your order during their grand opening!  I told the wifey & kids, \"I know where we're going this weekend for a cheap lunch!\"  And that was that.

Upon arriving at the new Cafe Zupas location (next to that yummy Pinkbox Donuts), imagine my surprise...BUSY!  PACKED!  Line out the friggin' door and almost around the building.  Come on Zupas....thought that flyer was only meant for ME!?  Apparently not.  Half of Las Vegas was at Zupas on this lovely afternoon.  Probably waiting in anticipation for me to arrive.  But most likely not.  But...maybe.

Cafe Zupas serves house-made soups, salads, and sandwiches.  I do like me a good sandwich.  This Utah chain boasts good food at good prices.  I'm happy to say the prices for their eats are more reasonable than aforementioned places like Panera Bread (got I hate going there for the mere fact everything is overpriced), and the now closed Atlanta Bread Company (which I kinda liked).  You know me, if it's cheap then I'm down.  But it's gotta taste at least somewhat good.

The line for the day was long, but it went rather quickly.  Cafe Zupas is kinda like a cafeteria, order on down the line, pay at the end.  It was nice that everything looked fresh and not frozen, and your food wouldn't be made until you ordered it (unless it's a soup of course).  Very, very reasonable prices at Zupas, a large bowl of soup runs $6, a half order $4, sandwiches are $5 each, and salads run $7 for a large, a half for $5.  Desserts run for around $3 - $4 each, and there's a kid's meal combo for only $4.

But the best deal on the menu is probably the Try 2 Combo for $8, and you get two choices of soup & salad, salad & sandwich, or sandwich & soup.  Your selections can be from anything on the menu.  Very nice if this is your first time to Cafe Zupas, gives you some options to try a bit of everything.  This is what our family stuck with, four of the Try 2 Combos.  We had:

-New England Clam Chowder
-Nuts About Berries Salad
-MangoBerry Salad
-Shanghai Chicken Salad
-Crab Avocado Melt Panini
-Asian BBQ Pork Sandwich
-California Turkey Sandwich
-Italian Club Sandwich

Food?  Not bad for a healthy lunch!  Salads were full of fresh fruits and veggies, especially the berry salad.  The crab panini was very good, grilled and gooey.  The big surprise though was the Asian BBQ pork sandwich, it tasted like a bahn mi!  If it was on French bread it would have been killer!  That is my main gripe about Cafe Zupas - no choice of bread.  All they have are ciabatta buns.  I love ciabatta buns but it depends what kind of filling is in between.  Ciabatta goes great with the Italian Club, the bun just sops up the fat lovely from meats like salami.  If Zupas had another choice of bread it would be stellar.  Maybe a ciabatta OR a French roll?  But I know you gotta keep food costs down.  

Overall a great lunch.  Like how if you order soup you get a chunk of French bread for dipping, and with each order you get a chocolate covered strawberry.  Very chic, making me feel like I'm at some fancy bistro.  I did the corner of the vast array of hot sauces, I do enjoy a good kick!  I also like how Zupas serves Coca-Cola products!  Also very cool of them to have a section for Italian syrups so you can create your own Italian soda!  But guys, you need to have some cream or half & half on the side to complete this.

I got away super CHEAP for lunch on grand opening.  With the 50% off special, for our orders, drinks, and a little dessert, the tab was just over $20!  We had some leftovers for later too.  That's cheaper than going to the local Buffet @ Asia.  Just too bad the 50% off wasn't everyday!  Not a bad deal even at regular price for this type of food and atmosphere.  Workers were very friendly and helpful, even on a super busy grand opening day.  I will probably be back here again for a cheap lunch when I'm thinking healthy."}
{"text":"First time visit! As someone who frequents soup and salad places- I walked in and was very surprised! Everything was very crisp and organized- from the dining area to the soup and salad bar. I tried to ask for a recommendation from the girl at the salad bar but she wasn't helpful and seemed to be hurrying me along. So I chose the \"pick two combo meal\" which allows you to get any two items (soup, salad, or sandwich) for 9$ and some change. Seeing all the menu options I thought this would be a great deal. The sandwich options didn't appear appetizing. I opted for the build your own salad, I picked my greens, dressing, and choice of 5 toppings. Then I moved down the bar to the soups - they only had one that seemed good so I tried the tomato. The server asked if I wanted pasta or Parmesan cheese to which I replied no- I wanted some cheese however but she hurried me along also. I asked and the gentleman checking me out was able to add cheese for me. Toppings such as cheese cost extra of course. Then I went to check out and I was shocked that I was paying almost $20 for a small salad and a small bowl of soup and a drink. Once I took a few bites I was also unimpressed. My salad was nearly dry- hardly enough dressing at all! And the soup was barely even warm and definitely not that great either. Overall- the food wasn't worthy of returning and the cost far too high for what It is. Better off going to a Panera or Sweet Tomatoes for this kind of food."}
{"text":"The restaurant looks great, the staff were friendly and very efficient, and most importantly the food was delicious. Might be my new favorite place in the area!"}
{"text":"The problem I found was as soon as you enter the door they ask what you want before you can even look over the menu. I ordered the first sandwich I saw because I didn't want to hold up anyone. I ordered the soup and was asked if I wanted croutons. I said yes and got 4 small croutons on top of the soup. I was then rushed to the cashier where I hurriedly paid and was given my receipt and change all wrapped up together. The sandwich and soup were good. The next day I looked at my receipt and saw I was charged 69 cents for the 4 croutons. I was never told they were an extra charge and 4 croutons are not worth that amount of money. That is a rip off. Also, I think they need to count out the change when handing the receipt to you. I don't like hidden charges. I called the next day and told them but the girl who said she was the manager said there was nothing she could do about the charge for the croutons. I told her I was disappointed on there method of handling customers."}
{"text":"I lived in NYC for a couple of years and healthy soup, salad, and sandwich places are available everywhere for lunch. I always complain how there aren't those quick salad places here in Vegas so I was seriously excited to see this place open up not too far from my office. Additionally, my younger brother had recommended it to me. He had tried the Honey Cilantro Carnitas sandwich and claims they make better carnitas than a Mexican restaurant.

While I'll give this place another chance, I am initially not a fan. I looked at the menu online and was wowed by their salad selection and the affordable prices! I try to eat really healthy during the week and I know that salads aren't always as healthy as they seem so I searched for their nutrition information, which was nowhere on their website. I headed there anyway on 3/21/16 and decided to ask the staff.

When I got there, it was mayhem. It was super busy with a large lunch crowd. I approached the line and a friendly staff member asked me if I had ever been there before. When I said no, he explained the menu to me. I asked him for the nutrition and allergen information and he told me they would have it at the front of the line, after I order. I asked, \"after I order?\" to which he said, \"let me go get it for you.\" He came back and said that he was unfortunately mistaken and that they do not have this information. What?! Okaaay..... so I ordered the Asian Citrus Chicken salad, as Asian style salads are usually a healthy option anywhere. The half size was $5.59 and the full size was $7.59 and I opted for the full size, very happy with the fact that I would be having lunch for under $8.

They rush you through the line. When I ordered my salad, I was told okay, it will be at the front of the line for you. I figured they would let you customize as they build your salad? I told the guy please leave off the wonton strips before I headed to the front of the line. I don't know the size difference between the half and the full size but wow the full size portion is small. If your salad is to go, they put it in a compartmentalized plastic container and just fill 3 of the compartments, leaving the 4th and largest compartment empty. It was not enough food for me for lunch and I was very disappointed. As for flavor, it was okay. The mandarin oranges were mushy but the dressing was flavorful. The chicken was plain chicken. I was missing the sesame seeds, cucumbers, and cashews from my salad which I didn't notice until I was already back at my office. So that sucked. They give you bread and a chocolate dipped strawberry with your meal. I would rather have had more salad.

I'll give it another try someday as I would really love a quick salad place nearby work for lunch. But as of right now, meh. I'm hoping I just had one of those one-off bad experiences."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place.  So much variety to chose from, I really like that they provide you with samples to try each soup. I am defintely going to become a regular!"}
{"text":"The plaza is amazing! So many restaurants to chose from but of course we had to chose Zupas!! The staff here was very friendly and patient!! They also made great suggestions! I particularly like that your meal comes with a dipped strawberry, yum!! The restaurant was very nice, big, and clean! They did forget about one of our sandwiches but it wasn't a big deal, they had it ready in no time!!"}
{"text":"We love zupas. The food is simple yet so delicious. I love the berry salad and the enchilada soup. So yummy! It's a little pricey but we'll worth it! I only wish there was one go over to my house. The yummy menu consists of sandwiches soup and salad.  Everything tastes so good and fresh too. I  gotta add that the desserts are over the top fantastic!  The only thing I would change is the way you order the food .it's kinda awkward. Other than that I just love zupas"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place when I want to go out to a healthy lunch. They actually make kale palatable for me! Lines can definitely get long here during the lunch rush, and ordering can be confusing but the staff is great at getting the line moving and being helpful. They also have some interesting fruity tea concoctions available if you get a drink with your meal!"}
{"text":"So goooood! The sandwiches and soups are always so delicious and tasty. The service was super fast. If you want soup/salads/sandwiches for your meal, this is def the place to go!"}
{"text":"The food is decent, I have more of an issue with service.  I have a 9 year old son who has sensory issues and cannot handle certain textures and flavors... Which makes finding something for him to eat a real struggle.  Cafe Zupas was one of our favorite places to go... He will not eat cheese, breaded chicken, soup, anything hot.  We used to order him the grilled cheese kids meal, with no cheese, not grilled.. But with ham (which I am more than happy to pay a little extra for the protein as it is something I can actually get my son to eat) he even used to eat the fruit cup (aka grapes) until they started being cut in half.  I'm a single mother that gets no child support.. The kids meals are relatively inexpensive, but policy is now no substitutions on the kids meal.. So If I want to feed my child here, I have to pay for an adult meal and leave everything off of it... So I pay quite a bit more for a piece of ham on plain bread.  Great news is I bought my son a gift card for this place for Christmas... And out of principle, we no longer eat here.  Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Heard you let a great employee go today. That's very unfortunate for your company,  workers like her are very hard to find especially in this town. People simply don't greet one another or genuinely  smile at one another anymore. She had a great personality and she brought a smile to my face everytime I went in. This company doesn't care if you have a life outside of the job. Getting let go for no reason before the holidays goes to show that this company is ruthless. Good luck to that special girl and to the company that gets her, you'll be the lucky ones to have her work for you."}
{"text":"I can't believe you got rid of my favorite worker but then I found out that she was transferred to sunset so I followed her there. She just brightens up my day when I walk in. She knows exactly what I order and how I like my salads made. She's worth the drive. I went in yesterday and they told me that she no longer works for the company,  I don't know what happened but you lost a great employee and in this town it's hard to find someone like her. I wish her the best and the new company that gets her is very lucky to have her. Best wishes from a loyal customer."}
{"text":"I am sure you have all been through this scenario...
It's lunchtime
You're hungry
You have no idea what you want to eat.
Do you like sandwiches?  Do you like soups?  Do you like salads?
Look no further than Cafe Zupas.  If you come here and can't find something that looks good then you are wayyy to picky.  Take it down a notch Mr/Mrs Picky McPickerson
5 stars.  Great lunch spot and great for a quick dinner as well."}
{"text":"I LOVE CAFE ZUPAS!! Never knew of this place until I got a postcard about their grand opening. Came here the day before grand opening and even though I forgot to use my postcard which would of given me 50% off my meal, I was not bummed at all because at around $5, I got a half very yummy salad, chocolate dipped strawberry and bread!

Of course, I told my parents and boyfriend about this awesome place, and we hit up this place the next day. Everyone was very satisfied :) 

I like to create my own salad, with mangos, strawberries, blueberries, pistachios, chicken...things of that sort.  

I've been there 4 times...and I've had a great experience each time. The food is great, the prices are right, and the service is excellent!

I would love to try one of their desserts sometime...they look so delicious!

Also...I'm not a soda drinker, but for those of you that are...they have this syrup bar right by the soda fountain so you can make italian sodas!! So cool!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to grab a quick bite to eat. While it's not truly healthy, at least everything isn't fried in a vat of grease. On this visit, I had the choose two combo with an ultimate grilled cheese and a half bowl of mushroom bisque. The grilled cheese was done panini style which made the outside crunchy and the inside nice and gooey. It comes with several types of cheese, pesto, and tomatoes. The flavors were light and bright. The soup was meaty with lots of good sized mushroom pieces adding to the flavor. Next time, I will try one of the salads, which also looked good."}
{"text":"I absolutely love their chicken pesto sandwich and their lobster bisque soup!! However, I always send my husband and to go pick up the order because he is more patient than I am. Whenever he goes in to pick up my soup and sandwich the creators of the food seem to not know what's going on. From one person to the next they always tend to forget my order and it delays everything-- it frustrates my husband. With your soup and sandwiches being so good I continue to come back but the frustration is always there. Try to teach your staff to have a better method of communication, please!"}
{"text":"Hey important review if you're diabetic or have high blood pressure this place is not for you! The amount of sugar that is in the homemade dressings have a ton of sugar in it like about 6 cups of sugar for one batch on dressing that is sick no dressing should have that much in it, also all the salt in the soup is a extensive amount  which is not necessary. I ate only half a small bowl and I got so dizzy I felt so sick and I am a healthy person. They also have no calorie chart to count your intake of calories in each dish. The manager that I tried to talk to at this location was dismissive when I asked why is the soup so watery her responses was it was made this morning when I got there 12:34 PM. so giving any kind of constructive criticism wasn't in the cards. The manager's name is Alisha she was not only rude but rolled her eyes when talking to her in line. The other 2 employee's that I spoke to apologized for her actions. I told them that was not necessary that it was not there fault for her actions. I asked some employee's if they ate here at Zupas they said they will never eat the food because of how much sugar and salt was in it! Shame! They also said the manager there is always dismissive often and they have to work with a person like that and they said again sorry for her actions. They told me to contact district manager for her being that way. His name is Lyle. The only high light was I got to meet a news anchor from channel 8.  So if you want to eat healthy this is not the place for you SUGAR SUGAR SUGAR PLUS SALT SALT AND MORE SALT. NO CALORIE COUNTER CHART! If you need a sugar salt rush and want to feel like you want to die for that day ha-ha go here. Hope this is helpful to the wise. You would think it's healthy but after going to several Dr. office's on just normal visits they tell me they would never eat at this place. Just alone the amount of sugar in the dressing is so unhealthy... Followed by so much salt be wise and ask.. Don't be fooled with taste!"}
{"text":"Be careful using your credit card at any Cafe Zupas! Two times now ( of the three times I've ordered) at two different locations they have placed multiple pending charges on my card. Managers say they can't fix it. Tell you to call corporate. The corporate lady is nice, but at the end they tell you  to just keep watching your credit card and make sure that the pending charges drop off.  The food may be good, but not worth all the hassle."}
{"text":"Usually pick up Soup and salads to go.  Used to be good few months ago when it had just opened but recently since about a month ago they changed their containers and have become very stingy with their portions. You order a medium soup cup but will get only half cup (equivalent to small) I had ordered their Gallon soups too which come in a small bucket (not even close to half gallon).  Same goes with the salads, very less quantity and ingredients.  If you add chicken to your salads you get couple small pieces of chicken (not worth paying extra).  I ordered chicken Enchilada soup, you have to pay extra if you need to sprinkle with half a spoon of cheese or sour cream!!!
You need to order 3 salads to make it equal to one regular salad from other restaurants.
I had just tried the Glendale location, not sure if all other locations are like that too!"}
{"text":"My first time to a Cafe Zupas.  During lunch time, expect a crazy busy establishment. Upon just parking, you can already see the lines through their windows.  But one thing you have to keep in mind...it's new, it's lunch time, and it's located off Eastern Ave.  So many restaurants off Eastern Ave is super packed during lunch time.  Zupas was no different.

After finally getting parked, you walk in.  The line is organized somewhat like what you see at Disneyland (minus the fast pass).  However, the line for ordering does go pretty quick.  Your food is built in an assembly like fashion starting with your salads, sandwiches, soup, and finally desserts. The place is packed and the other concern is whether or not you will even have a seat.  Go ahead and try to save a table.  Can't do it, it's not allowed.  They even have signs posting that you cannot save a table.  This wasn't a problem since there's was at least 3 tables opened when we ate. But I'm sure there are days where seating in limited. 

As for their food, I got their Turkey Spinach Artichoke Panini with their Lobster Bisque.  The soup portions are huge and the food portions are just okay.  My sandwich wasn't bad, actually was pretty good.  It's the soup that I rave about.  The the price and taste of their lobster bisque rivals other sitdown, more expensive restaurants.  Just wish there was thick pieces of lobster in there.  My total order came up to about $10 which included the sandwich, soup, drink, a strawberry, and a lunch roll.  

Prices are about average for the rest of the menu, but they do have a lunch special for $7.99.  This includes sandwich and half soup.  By the way, if you have a sweet tooth, then you have to try their desserts. I'm not saying it's good, because for one, I don't have a sweet tooth. And two, I didn't have any.  The presentation looks good. I guess I will just have to wait for someone else's review to see how good the sweets truly are. One of my issues with this place...so many damn calories in almost everything here.  I know there is because myfitnesspal told me. Overall, I am giving this place 4 stars just because I will probably be back and so far, I'm a fan.

PS:  I still think Beach Hut Deli, which is located in the same parking lot, is better.  Also, not as busy.

{"text":"Drove up from SoCal that day and didn't want fast food. Wife and I got California Turkey and Honey Dijon panini. They were delicious and we loved the chocolate covered strawberry with our meal! Only complaint would be size of sandwiches and the overall presentation. I definitely will visit on our next Las Vegas trip!"}
{"text":"This place is a joke, ask for a little extra vegs on you salad and they up charge to make the mundane crappy salad 15 dollars. if they served adequate food then i wouldn't need to ask for extra. Complete rip off, hope they go out of business!!!"}
{"text":"Salads are pretty good but they only put a measured teaspoon of each item in the bowl. Very tight on the portions! The most annoying thing about this place is the disingenuous staff. Saying \"Perfect\" every five seconds and trying to up sale extra food. Please tone down the fake nonsense! It's just a sandwich shop, not 
Nordstroms!"}
{"text":"The food is great and fresh. Easy way to pick up a fairly healthy meal when you don't have time to cook. Love their natural waters lemonades. The reason I give it three stars it's the service. They are extremely disorganized when it comes to checking out at the register and figuring out your order. I come here on a weekly basis since it opened an it has not changed. I'm finally writing this because its happened too many times. You hear other customers complain, I've complained and employees agree but still they don't make changes to their order check out. It's not rocket science other restaurants have figured it out. I'm giving it one more try and jf nothing changes I won't be returning permanently. Hoping management reads this and gets a clue. By the way the employees are extremely nice and polite so nothing to do with their willingness to help and be friendly."}
{"text":"Worst lunch in a long time. No one said hello when I walked in, yes I get your busy for lunch but come on. I ordered the California Turkey,  it came with 1 slice of turkey and 4 sprouts. Super sad.. I also ordered the mushroom soup, they asked if I wanted a topping, they forgot to tell me it cost a freaking arm and leg to add five little onion crisps to the top.  When I paid and asked about the extra price, they never even offered to take off the .69 cents , once I paid, no one said thank you ,or have a good day. Doesn't matter how busy you are for lunch. Won't be coming back here any time soon."}
{"text":"The employees are extremely nice, but I didn't find their food that great. It's definitely edible and good if you don't have anywhere else to go, but it wouldn't be my first choice."}
{"text":"For their niche I think they totally nailed it! Great clean tasting food, clean, bright atmosphere and friendly service! We decided to come here after our workout and left feeling awesome. They close early so be mindful, also they are closed on Sundays :/. Five stars from me!"}
{"text":"This sandwich and soup shop is ok. My issue is the price doesn't match the food quantity. This is nit the place for budjet watchers. I paid over $12 for a cuban grilled pork sandwich, a drink and ut came with one chocolate covered strawberry. No sides. Zuppas is geared towards catering, as their loyalty benefits is only for that demographic. Nothing for the individual consumer, and no other discounts( i.e. no military discounts) are available.
 The sanwich was ok, but it'll be a while before I go back. A better alternative is Potbelly's right next door."}
{"text":"Ordered the Cuban sandwich it was horrible bland no taste or flavor. I had a Cuban sandwich in Ft launder dale at a 7-11 it was better then the one I had here"}
{"text":"For this price range, Cafe Zupas definitely earns 5 stars! You could spend as much at many other places and not come even close to the quality of the food or the experience.  First time here, and will definitely be back. I had the chicken pesto sandwich and the tomato basil soup. Perfect!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Cafe Zuppas. I love the chicken pesto sandwich and the tomato basil soup. All the soups are delicious! I have tried a few other sandwiches and salads and I have yet to have a bad thing. All the fruits and veggies are so fresh and tasty. All meals come with a bun and their signature chocolate covered strawberry. This place is cafeteria style and the line goes by quickly. Service is always wonderful and speedy. They are closed on Sundays."}
{"text":"Zupas has always been a favorite, but this location sucks. Tonight's visit was a major cluster- the employees are scrambling and Taylor, I think she must be a manager, was real bossy and unpleasant to the employees in front of customers which I don't think is good. Ordered a chicken chopped salad- and my salad came without chicken and with a dressing that doesn't belong with my salad. If you're in the mood for BS, I guess this would be the place for you."}
{"text":"The quality of the food at this location is poor compared to the other two Las Vegas and Henderson locations. The lettuce in the salad was wilted, the soup was cold and the chocolate \"covered\" strawberry was just sad. I'll post a pic."}
{"text":"Imagine a Panera bread but with a focus on Southwestern style foods. That's Cafe Zupas in the nutshell.

This place was busy. Probably still busy as of right now. It can be a little intimidating ordering, but they have menus in line and they have a huge board of what's available. They also have deals where you can get a sandwich and a 1/2 or soup or salad at a combo price. You may also want to designate a seat saver, if you are traveling in a group as seating can be hard to find at times.

I ordered the Cuban sandwich and the Chicken Enchilada Chili soup. The Cuban sandwich is my downfall. I have a tendency to order those in places where I feel they won't get it totally right. You want that nice hard pressed bread, cuts of warm ham with mustard and pickles. Well, technically, it had the correct parts but I wasn't a fan of their little twists. There was pressed bread, but it was some special bread they used. Multi-grain bread is fun and all, but not the same taste. They weren't skimpy with the ham, plenty of that to taste. The pickles were bread and butter chips. Again, technically they are both pickles, but normal dill pickles are a little tart and crisp. Bread and butter chips are soggier and much much sweeter than normal pickles. Throw on some of that citrus honey mustard and sweet red peppers and you are swimming in sweetness.

The chicken enchilada chili was pretty good but look at the name, of course it's going to be good. It's cheese city. You can get cheddar on there too (for what I assumed was a fee, everything happened so fast!) You can never have too much cheese though. You also get a chocolate dipped strawberry with your meal. I don't know the significance of the chocolate dipped strawberry but it was tasty dessert snack.

Again, this reminds me of a Panera bread with the emphasis on Southwest style foods. I do think their strengths are soups and salads more than sandwiches."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by how yummy their Tomato Bisque was. I love tomato soup and theirs is by far my favorite. I also tried the Honey Bacon sandwich which was fantastic as well, bursting with flavor and making me savor the last few bites! 
The  chocolate strawberry and roll are a great addition to your meal, although I would of preferred two strawberries over the roll since I already was eating a chibatta sandwich. I thought the food was great my first visit and I intend on exploring the menu."}
{"text":"First time trying zupas and I'm really disappointed. I ordered a turkey club panini with tomato soup, everything was extremely sweet and I'm pretty sure it's not. The tomato soup was very creamy and tasted like sugar instead of a tomato taste. The sandwich was okay nothing too bad but it had some sort of sweet sauce which I didn't like nor was it on the ingredient list. Not too crazy about the price that I paid $21 for a damn salad soup and sandwich. They overprice everything and charge you extra for spinach and croutons?!! Ridic. Other than that place is nice only cause it's new but I wouldn't waste my money here again. 

Also service here 6/10. They got my order wrong when I just asked for no bacon. Thought it's a pretty simple instruction to follow."}
{"text":"OMG, my daughter order me food. The best freshest salad at a reasonable price, That I've had in a loooooong time. The tortilla soup, Super HOT and flavorful. So impressed right now, that's going to be my 1st choice for salads and soups. My daughters sandwich was tasty as well. I'm just a soup /salad girl. #satisfied"}
{"text":"Great place for lunch!!! It was packed with people during lunch today. Every menu had pictures with description which was nice. This place is very similar to Panera. This place offers many choice for sandwitch, salad, and soups. I was impressed by soany choices. The place seems very clean. We ordered california protein cobb salad and the panini with crab along with the clam chowder. I would say the taste overall was good. I would come back for quick lunch."}
{"text":"I don't think we will be coming back to this place ever again! My husband, daughter and I tried it for a couple of times now. I figured 2nd time would be better...first we ordered the thai lobster curry, it was super salty, and so watery and nothing in it, we couldn't eat it. Sad, because i was craving for soup. Second, is the maui chicken salad the flavor was just ok, but there's barely any salad. And supposedly a large size. I think i had 7 or 8 bites out of it....Third, bought chicken fingers for my daughter. It was 2 tiny strips of chicken- I expected at least 3 for the price. And last, their strawberry covered chocolate. Seriously, who covered strawberry just half. It looks like they just poured the chocolate on top of the strawberry instead of dipping it...what a LAZY JOB! For the price, definitely not worth it, sorry. Don't mind paying more for food, if the food is great. I doubt this place will be open long. Sorry.

FYI. I should have taken pictures of all the food...but i only remember to take a picture of the strawberry. I was disappointed!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times and have tried their sandwiches, salads and soups. The food is really good but what really bothered me was how STINGY they were about their portions. Making my own salad they really made sure to put as least as possible on the scoop. It was a little annoying. I had to ask for extras and they charged $0.69 for extra ingredients so it added up the price. Otherwise like I said food was good and good location."}
{"text":"What happened to Zupas?  I am a regular to this Zupas, enjoying prompt service and good food... but not this time.  The service was much, much slower than any visit before with mostly confusion behind the counter.  I had to ask for the rolls that go with our salads.  Then one of the booth seats has an enormous tear that has not been fixed on over a month.  I like Zupas, but this location seems to be going down hill.  I will add that the food was good."}
{"text":"I was in the neighborhood, was hungry and yelped up this little gem of a restaurant. 

Everyone here was nice and eager to assist. There was a women at the entrance giving suggestions, and there were a lot of people in the food making line who were more than happy to give me as many free soup samples as I wanted.

I had the combo with tomato soup and the crab melt. Soup was delicious and if I didn't get the tomato, the other contender was the cauliflower. The melt was ok because it was made with Krab, not Crab. I guess I should have expected it with an $8 combo.

In addition, they have device charging stations, Italian soda station and ample seating.

I would definitely come back next time I'm in the area to have the cauliflower soup and honey club."}
{"text":"We used them for a catering event. The food was very good and comparable to wildflower/paradise/corner bakery.  I think they a few more options of soups and salads than the competition as well.  They staff was very friendly and helpful and the dessert presentation great!
We will be ordering again."}
{"text":"Does anyone else get anxiety as soon as they walk in the door? There are WAYYY too many tables in this place. Whoever is in charge of design needs a lesson in feng shui.  There is no clear path to the area where you get in line so you're always trying to shuffle between people eating and the tables are very close together.  There is only about 6 feet in front of you when you walk in the door before you hit a table with people eating. This is the first thing I notice every time I walk in.  

It's pretty obvious that Café Zupas trains their employees to do things in a VERY specific way. God forbid you make them stray from that training plan. They're usually very young, very robotic and don't know how to maneuver when there is a one off request. For example today I asked for a cookie with my soup and the girl looked at me like I was absolutely crazy. She said sorry you would've had to place a catering order for that, we don't do cookies with soup. I said 'do you sell cookies?' She said yes. I said okay we'll I'd like to buy a cookie ......"}
{"text":"I was working in Phoenix for two weeks and this was my absolutely favorite place!  My coworkers and I loved it so much that we came back 3 times (would've been 4, but Zupas is closed on Sundays).  

My favorite was the thai coconut tofu bowl! You get so much food for less than $10.  Only bummer is that it's not included in the try two deal.  I liked the try two deal when I tried it another day.  It provides a nice light meal and lets you sample different items on the menu.     

And the \"cherry\" on top is the chocolate covered strawberry that comes with every meal.  Note that sometimes your friend will get a giant strawberry and you'll get a tiny ass one.... but the amusement this causes is more hilarious than anything else.  There are also other desserts and I was definitely a fan of the rocky road brownie."}
{"text":"Great soups, salads, and sandwiches!  I love this place.  Everything is well-proportioned.  So you don't walk out too full, or still hungry.  All the soups, sandwiches, and salads have all been tasty.  I am fairly partial to the lobster bisque.  The pulled pork sandwich is also excellent.  The drinks that they offer are also very tasty!!!  I really like this place for a quick and healthy bite.  Great for lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"I have bee to this location a few different time and have never been disappointed. Great place for a light lunch or stop in for dinner. There service is wonderful everyone is always very helpful and friendly the food is great. Nice fresh salads great soups and fantastic sandwiches. You just cant go wrong here. They also have several different delicious pastries to help with that sweet tooth including crème brûlée. I Highly recommended this place. I definitely will continue going back."}
{"text":"This place is simply amazing. When you first walk in you notice how clean this eating establishment is. It was our first time so the person behind the counter took the time to explain their process. A+ for customer service. The turkey panini and berry salad were delicious. We will definitely return to this place."}
{"text":"Definitely would recommend this location. Great service every time I've gone in. The food is great."}
{"text":"This place has fresh and delicious food. The employees work ridiculously hard and the food is always consistent. I  absolutely adore coming here to eat because they never let me down. All the locations in Arizona are awesome but this one is the best! I am here almost every day. The soups are made from scratch daily and you can see how clean the kitchen is from out front. Their catering is fantastic and they deliver too. I would highly recommend this place over Panera or Wildflower. Soooo much better."}
{"text":"I went from not knowing that Cafe Zupas even existed to becoming a huge fan in one visit.
,.
When you walk in, you'll see their bright, aesthetically pleasing menu of soups, salads, and sandwiches. There are also desserts available near the register. I would skip the salads because they tend not to carry as much savory flavor.

My favorite sandwich is easily the Italian Club, which apparently has a sauce made of some sort of really addictive chemical. It was love at first bite. The Asian BBQ Pork was also good. I like to pair a sandwich in a $7.99 Try Two combo with a half soup of some sort. So far, all of the soups that I have tried are excellent: Shrimp & Sausage Gumbo, Mushroom Bisque (vegetarian), Lobster Bisque, and New England Clam Chowder. They are served with a complimentary piece of bread, and there are several options for mix-ins that I haven't tried yet but could be nice if you're into that kind of thing.

I've tried a friend's cheesecake, which was really delicious, but more conservative eaters will be satisfied for dessert with the complimentary chocolate-dipped strawberry. The fruit is so good on its own and you can taste it, and the chocolate just makes it better.

Finally, check out the recharge bar if you're alone or in a small group. You get bar-style seats on a counter, an interactive screen with drink mix ideas and other features, and most importantly, free recharging with the normal power outlets and USB outlets. You'll probably find me there if it's empty.

Cafe Zupas adds a very affordable, very delicious casual eating restaurant to the already extensive array of Eastern Ave. eateries. You're doing yourself a disservice if you don't try it."}
{"text":"Hey, every other lunch spot in the neighborhood. You'd better watch out! Café Zupas has arrived.

I was a huge fan of the first Vegas location on Eastern Ave. Now that they've opened much closer to home, I'm ready to forsake that original spot altogether. Café Zupas delivers soups, salads, and sandwiches with fresh ingredients and in-house dressings with great service. They always have someone at the door, they always clear tables without taking tips, and they follow a carefully crafted script of questions that gets customers through the line efficiently while also upselling on things like desserts and drinks. The foods are not what you would call authentic, but they are delicious Americanized renditions.

I always get the try 2 combo ($8.29), where you get to choose 2 of 3 items from whole sandwiches, half soups, and half salads. Regardless of the weather (read: summer heat), I almost always get a half soup with a sandwich. The soups that I've tried are all really good. The lobster bisque and the roasted red pepper and lobster may not have real lobster, but they're both delicious. This week, I've really grown to love the wild mushroom bisque and the tomato basil. This location seems to serve their bread almost cold, so dip it fully in the soup to warm it up.

As for sandwiches, I definitely steer toward the ciabatta bread sandwiches rather than the panini sandwiches. The honey cilantro carnitas sandwich, which is a relatively new item, is very impressive because of its glaze, the pork, and the avocado. BBQ pulled pork sandwich and Italian club sandwich are also long-time favorites, and turkey cranberry is a nice reminder of my favorite holiday. Cuban grilled pork is alright if you're into that sort of thing.

Finally, even though they're not my preferred choice, the salads are pretty good options as well. Mangoberry salad, Thai mango chicken, and superfood delight are all salads that I've sampled here from friends or family.

Oops, almost forgot about dessert! Aside from the standard chocolate-covered strawberries, which are always great, they have many options for people with a sweet tooth. The creme brulee options are all nice, but my new favorite is a slice of chocolate heaven called the Sinful 7. It's rich, it's sweet, and it's chocolatey. I definitely need to share that with somebody next time because it's such a huge portion after a meal.

One thing I do miss from the Eastern Avenue location is that one or two of the regular employees definitely recognized me on my return visits, even as early as the second or the third time. Doesn't seem to be the case just yet on Sunset, but I'm so happy with the food and the location that we'll have plenty of time to warm up to each other. Make this a stop if you're on this side of town."}
{"text":"Got carry out .The presentation was one of the best for a to go order for that price range .The sandwich was really good but the soup was ok...The chocolate covered strawberry was good . They get a + for presentation but the food was a hit N miss for me .The cream brulé was more on the ok side. Overall the food was ok."}
{"text":"I've driven by this place and have always wanted to try it since I'm big soup person.  Decided to come here since we were on that side of town and I was in the mood for a light lunch.  It was our first time to Cafe Zupas so wasn't sure the set up/ordering system.  As soon as you walk in, there is a sign that tells you how to order.  Step 1 decide what you want, step 2 if you order soup, you order at the soup station, step 3 pay and enjoy!  I decided on the combo of soup and salad and opted for the protein cobb with the red pepper lobster bisque soup.  Salad's are made in front of you with your choice of dressing and soup is ordered at the soup station which are ladled in your bowl in front of you also.  By the time you get your salad and/or soup, your sandwich would be ready also (if you ordered one).  With 2 pick choose 2 combos and 2 drinks, total came out to about $20.  The fountain drink station has an Italian syrup station so you can customize your drinks and they serve Gingerale as one of your drink options!  I enjoyed my soup and salad but can  see why people say the portions are a little on the smaller side.  Luckily I wasn't too hungry but I'm thinking the portions are not huge since there's a lot of ingredients in the salad, either way enjoyed the meal would definitely come back.  *The bread and chocolate covered strawberry was a nice surprise too!"}
{"text":"This place shouldn't have 3.5 star rating, they worth 5 !

The food concept is awesome, fresh fast and very unique.
Staff is very upbeat and friendly.
The mushroom bisque is to die for ^_^"}
{"text":"Fast, Fresh , Friendly and REALLY, REALLY clean! Great experience from start to finish! (Oh yeah... the California Protein Cobb salad rocked!)"}
{"text":"I have never been to a cafe zupas before in my life. My co workers always talk about how good they are. So I decided to go tonight :) I had the 2 combo meal with lobster bisque and the avocado crab sandwich. I loved the soup and the roll they give you that was on point. But the sandwich was little off... I think next time I'll ask for the avocado on the side and spice it up at home lol. It was bland, so it kind of ruined the sandwich . I guarantee if I didn't have the avocado on the sandwich, would've tasted way better. It's really good crab meat, just that avocado... I will definitely go back and try a new sandwich"}
{"text":"I'm just writing this review to let the employees know to \"relax and breath\" I have been to the Eastern location there was a big difference. Food was delicious but the co workers were freaking out making food and taking orders. A lady almost dropped making a salad not once but twice in five mins. They were rushing around all stressed out... almost forgot to give a lady a box with the strawberries and bread. Wasn't seven that busy for them to look crazy. Relax y'all ;-)"}
{"text":"Zupas officially opens today! I was invited to their VIP catering event a few days ago and was able to get a sneak peek. 

The soups are very good; I tasted all of them! My favorites are the wild mushroom it is very creamy and has a great flavor. The shrimp and sausage gumbo is very hearty with just a little New Orleans kick! I recommend them both! If you enjoy tomato soup theirs is a tomato basil and it is yummy!. One thing I really liked is that you can taste the soup before you order it! Bonus they have 8 varieties of soup to choose from!

I had the turkey pesto artichoke panini as well it was very good. You can get a 7.99 combo of any 2 items soup, salad, sandwich. By the way it's not 1/2 sizes with that combo either! I got a full panini and full soup.

The soda bar is nice to you can create your own drinks!

The ingredients are fresh and the employee's are very friendly. 

They also cater which is a big plus!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! The one thing were missing in Las Vegas is hot soup and sandwiches. There aren't many options here and I'm so glad to have found this place! 

When I walked in at noon it was packed! The order line was near the door but moved fast. There's a menu box while in line so you can order quickly when to the front. Plenty of room to sit at this location though. 

Salad, soup and sandwiches. You can even create your own if you prefer or mix and match two options, half order or full."}
{"text":"My first time in Cafe Zupas and Panera Bread, move aside! I have a new favorite in town!

This is located by Sunset Station Casino and Galleria Mall in the corner of a little lot by Chipotle. Walking in, it is very spacious, with a separator in the middle where there is a charging station on one side (new study area? Why not!) and a soda/utensil bar with various syrups to put into your soda for added flavor.

The customer service was impeccable! Nice smiles, quick service, and an overall amazing vibe. With some recommendations from the server, I ended up choosing a Chipotle Chicken salad, a crab avocado melt, and sweet tea. For everything, it was barely $11. You can tell that the ingredients were fresh (aside from the fact that they prepare your food in front of you). In my opinion, MILES better than Panera Bread. The food was not bland and the proportions were just right. And for the price, I ended up leaving the place full and satisfied. Not mention the complimentary chocolate covered strawberry that comes with every order! Score!

Overall, I totally recommend this place. Food is amazing, people are kind, and you get what you pay for. I'll be coming here way more often!"}
{"text":"Loved the experience! First time here! Delicious fresh ingredients! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"love it I love eating here but very sad it's closed on Sunday's, I want cafe zupas on a daily"}
{"text":"I went to Zupas expecting to have a great meal. However, I went to dinner today and I was DISGUSTED by what I found in my soup. I placed a spoonful of soup into my mouth and realized I couldn't swallow it. I was chewing on what looked like a piece of paper. I reported the incident to the manager and he apologized by offering me dessert.  SERIOUSLY!!! I dont think after coming across an unnecessary ingredient in your soup would I consider eating anything else from this restaurant. I hope no one else has an incident like mine. FUTURE CUSTOMERS should inspect their food!!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this place!! I'm so happy that they opened up right in my neighborhood. It's my new go-to place when I want something healthy-ish. My personal favorites are: Nuts about berries salad, chicken pesto panini, and lobster bisque. I usually get the try 2 combo for $7.99, which is an amazing deal. I love how they always give chocolate-dipped strawberries and bread with every order. 

My only complaint is that they're not open on Sundays!! Boo!!! But whatevs. This place is awesome"}
{"text":"I just recently found out they had a location at Norterra and I am so happy I did. I've been coming here for lunch quite a bit lately because I can't get enough of it. I love the Turkey Bacon Avocado Panini. You can't beat getting a chocolate covered strawberry with your meal either. I tried the Rocky Road Brownie last time and I highly recommend it. Everyone who works at this location is always very friendly too. If you're looking for an alternative to Paradise Bakery I'd give Cafe Zupas a try. They don't disappoint."}
{"text":"Good salty soups and specialty sandwiches. Their not open on Sunday's though, bummer for me but I do enjoy coming here at least once a month. The chelate dipped strawberries get me going every time."}
{"text":"There is a special place in my heart for Zupas. Many happy memories from my college days in UT.

Recommendations... everything. You honestly can't go wrong.

The chocolate covered strawberry is just a small token of their love for you. Just accept their love...

Pro tip- mix diet coke with a coconut flavor shot, for a Dirty Diet Coke"}
{"text":"Wonderful friendly staff. Clean and pleasant environment. Range of food very balanced and interesting. Crab / avocado panini was good and the Yucatan soup tasty. Wish you were in NY"}
{"text":"Terrible service. Not willing to accommodate customers needs at all. Just because you are a busy store, doesn't give you the right to be short with customers"}
{"text":"Good soups, most of them are a hit. The tomato tastes a little fruity though, which is strange. The salads are the same way, with some tasting great while others are questionable. Sometimes the meat in them taste off. But overall, a better alternative to places like Panera. Please expand to Tempe!"}
{"text":"I usually hit the location on 19th street and camelback but when this location opened near my home in Avondale I was excited to try it out.  Was pleasantly surprised to find that it was much better than my usual location - had whole grain bread choice and beverage bar not available at my other spot. The staff is friendly and helpful and well trained despite it being a brand new location.  Food is great and love the new drink bar choices."}
{"text":"Tried their California sandwich - it was so-so as their bread seemed thick and rather dry/bland. 

My mom had their tortilla soup and reported how scrumptious it was. 

Best part of the meal? Chocolate-covered strawberry. Such a decadent treat!

Location is great also; I would imagine a lot of workers in Camelback Corridor/Biltmore dine her for their work lunch."}
{"text":"My initial 3 visits were amazing! This was when it first opened. My second to last visit I was concerned about the freshness of the product but thought there was a possibility it had been busy. Tonight was my last visit. When I first ordered I noticed the wilted salad. When I noticed I only got 2 slivers of egg, they said, \"we can't give you anymore!\" The test of my order turned into a whole lot more of the same greed shown by...\" We're only allowed to give that....we can't do it that way...!\" There was so much of this that I can't write it all down. I will preface this by saying I never complain. I just take what is dealt. This whole situation was a perfect picture of corporate greed. Needless to say, I left with all the food still on the counter.  Guess they did a great job of suckering people in just long enough to think that lowering  their standards and significantly altering their vision of customer service was a good idea. Good luck on that one! I will NEVER go back!"}
{"text":"I'm liking Cafe Zupas. Where else can you get quality sandwiches, salads and soups? Well, probably lots of other places. But there is something about Cafe Zupas that I draws me back. 

No, I don't come here frequently. Maybe once every few months or so. But in those visits I always get something different. I always go with a choose two combo but which two I get changes from time to time. A sandwich and a salad. A sandwich and a soup. A salad and soup. And so many varieties. I like to switch it up. 

I've tried their tomato soup with orzo pasta added in. That is good. But for as far as soups go, I love their mushroom bisque. It is creamy rich and loaded with a fresh blend of mushrooms. The fried onions I had them sprinkle on top were fine but didn't add anything. Next time soup free of additions will do. 

As for the sandwiches, I've had the chicken pesto a couple of times and the Cuban once. Both are good but I think the Cuban is my favorite of the two. I want to try another sandwich next time I go. Which I try will be a mystery until that next visit. I always take a few minutes to decide before I order. Its all just too good.

To end the meal here, Cafe Zupas gives you a chocolate dipped strawberry. Maybe thats the real reason I like this place so much. Its the cherry, er, strawberry on top."}
{"text":"I normally like Zupa's and they've always been friendly with delicious food. However, the last time I went, I was a little disappointed. Due to a recent surgery, I am only able to eat small amounts. I figured Zupa's would be a great place to go because the soup would be good on my stomach. I have a special card from my doctor asking that I be allowed to order from the kids menu (since most places have an age limit). I asked for a kids meal and they said that I could order one but that it would cost me more because I'm an adult. What?! I didn't get extra food. The portions weren't bigger. It was the exact same as a regular kids meal but I had to pay 3 dollars more! It's totally stupid because I couldn't even eat the entire meal. As much as I like their food, I doubt I will go back because I don't think I should pay extra money for a kids meal just because I am an adult. Dumb."}
{"text":"If your looking for a delicious, reasonably healthy and inexpensive lunch then this is the place! They keep the menu pretty simple but with lots of options. You can have Soup, Sandwich, Salad or a combination of any. The selection comes in that there are probably a dozen versions of each. I'm generally a person who always orders the same thing anywhere I go. I like to stick with what I know I'll enjoy when I go out. Here at Zupas that's not the case, there's always 4 or 5 different things I want to try, so I'm usually trying something new or a new combination of something I like. Plus every meal comes with a chocolate covered strawberry which is a nice little treat. Unless you feel you can afford the calories (I usually can't) then there's about the best selection of gourmet style deserts you'll ever find in a sandwich shop!"}
{"text":"Our school had its first fundraiser there last night and I was pleasantly surprised with the quality and service. While about 100 school parents descended on Cafe Zupas, the line was literally out the door, they still were pretty organized and speedy as they could be. 
Items ordered were chicken enchilada chili (amazing!), glazed chicken chipotle salad (delish), berry salad (great), kids grilled cheese sandwich (great), California sandwich (great), chicken tortilla soup (excellent). 
The place was clean and like I said way packed, but it was pretty organized and well stocked. The manager was manning the register and doing his best to get the food up and paid and customers off as quickly as possible. 
I was pleased with the quality and service, price for 4 to eat combo meals (sandwich/soup or sandwich/salad) was about $39.00. 
I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"Always love this place.  Huge choice of really fresh food.  Salads, soups and sandwiches. The counter staff is really helpful and never rushes you.  A chocolate strawberry comes with every order!"}
{"text":"Super small portions. Don't come here for a salad if your hungry! The staff making the salads must be told to be super tight on every item. Not enough chicken for a kids menu salad! The soups are great but the staff tries to make you feel guilty saying..\"What sandwich did you order?\" when you reply this is my meal, they roll their eyes. Very bizarre training as if they're in a play at school with over the top exaggerated responses. Not worth it, won't be back. Btw..\"Perfect\" shouldn't be every response to the customers!"}
{"text":"The food is excellent. Very fresh. Staff is always extremely friendly. The strawberries are a definite added plus. There's 3 small(ish) things that keep from a 5 star. 1- explaining your order 3 separate times. 2- no salad on the kids meal selections. 3- the music is way too loud to carry on conversation with the people at your own table."}
{"text":"We ate there on Friday around noon. Our first experience is mixed. Our choices included the Wisconsin Cauliflower soup and the lobster bisque. In addition I had the Thai mango chicken salad. Both soups had great flavors; however, they were served lukewarm, at best. I do wish they would share their nutritional values for their food items."}
{"text":"Always enjoy eating at Cafe zupas. Their food is always really good and is not too expensive!"}
{"text":"I love this place for multiple reasons.

1. Their staff is so kind, welcoming, and knowledgeable. They were also kind to each other, and seemed to enjoy working there.
2. The packaging, believe it or not. If you get a lunch combo, you get a sweet boxed lunch that can contain soup/salad/sandwich + bread + chocolate covered strawberry...none of it touches each other, so even if you do carry out, your food stays good!
3. The food! I got the California Protein Cobb + Mushroom Bisque. I loved loved loved the soup, and would get it again and again. The salad was average...I just wasn't a fan of the black olive/goat cheese/edemame combo. 
4. The price. It is a little pricey for lunch (closer to $11 per person), but I got very full and really enjoyed my lunch. For how great the staff, experience, and food was, I thought the price was very reasonable."}
{"text":"I go here just for the Wisconsin cheddar soup. Yum....purrrrrrr.   It's smooth and tasty and warms the belly.  Sandwiches are okay.  Nothing great (I'm not a fan of pressed meats). Salads are fresh."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Everything is so fresh and housemade. They just opened a few days ago so thought I would try it and was very happy with my soup and salad. Also got a free chocolate covered strawberry. They also make \"house infusions\" which are homemade beverages using raw honey, green tea, etc. Delicious!"}
{"text":"I am impressed and trust me thats huge coming from me. I am very peticular. I had the turkey spinach artichoke sandwich and the clam chowder soup. It was amazing. My hubby had the vegetarian sandwich and the lobster soup. I tried some of his and his was also amazing. Everything is fresh, they're fast and it was very tasty. I love that this place is right near my house and its good. There are no lunch places around that I like except for sushi which I love but its nice to have a soup,salad, sandwich place nearby. They have an entire system going on in their kitchen. One group making the salads, another making the sandwiches and another making the soup. I was very happy with my meal and the atmosphere. I will definitely be recommending this place and going back again for lunch. Yum! Thanks Zupas for coming to my neighborhood."}
{"text":"The menu is aggressive, it's heathy or you think it is.  What I know for sure is, twice now, the soups have been waaaaaaaaaaaaay too salty.

The first time this happened, I told a manager (the manager?) and she politely said thank you.

I came back another time while getting tires across the street and asked to taste two soups before ordering: too salty.  I believe it was the chicken tortilla or some variation of that and the Wild Mushroom.  Two times/two times too salty...no way.

Listen, I'm not buying soup unless it 's good, someone there is not tasting the food.  And if you watch the chef shows, that's a critical mistake.  SOMEONE HAS GOT TO TASTE THE FOOD.

Everyone is friendly, too many people back there serving, not my problem."}
{"text":"I ate the lobster bisque and got really sick from it. 

I called to speak to the manager, but the lady that answered said she could help me. I let her know I got sick from it, and she said she would pass that to the main store manager and work to fix the issue. I have a lot more to say, so if the owner/operating manager would like to contact me about this, feel free to send me a direct message."}
{"text":"Seriously over-priced salad extras.
4 croutons for $.69
15 tiny diced onions $2.07. 
Good salad. Tasty and fresh.
Not everyday prices for \"normal\" folks. A nice place to go with friends once a month or so. Maybe bi-monthly."}
{"text":"Omg I love this place!! The food is fresh and tastes delicious! You can customize your meal and is very reasonably price!"}
{"text":"Super duper delish! I had the red pepper soup and pesto sandwich. Hubby had the strawberry salad and bacon turkey sandwich. Both of us loved our food! Very tasty!"}
{"text":"Love this place! It's Saturday, and the queue was long - took 20 mins before I sat with my food.

Today they weren't keeping up very well with clearing tables. I saw people clearing the table so they could sit... Napkin dispenser was nearly empty, too.

Today I ordered the large Glazed Chicken Chipotle Salad, which was very good! But here's the thing. The large is $2 more than the half. For the most part, the only difference is more greens. With few exceptions, the toppings are the same amount for half or large. The half seems to be the better value!"}
{"text":"I really like Zupas their is delicious and doesn't leaving me feeling guilty when I leave. Not greasy or heavy it's perfect. My son loves it too!"}
{"text":"Manny is terrible , he assumes what you're going to say before you say it. It try's to talk for ya. Very condescending. I dread coming to this location because of him and his customer service. Not personable all."}
{"text":"Chicken tortilla chili is amazing and the chicken Chipotle salad is way better than the competition! I love this place. When I'm in the area I always, always eat here!"}
{"text":"I got the pesto chicken sandwich on their ancient grain bread. I highly recommend this sandwich. It had very balanced flavors and the grains gives it a nice nutty taste. It was also 8pm so the place wasn't too busy."}
{"text":"The lightning here is amazing! It's so bright. You could film YouTube videos here. The service here is great. 5 stars absolutely. The food here is maybe a 3.5 but the ambiance and service is great I would pick this over let's say a chipotle or noodles and company. 

For some reason all the food seemed on the sweeter side to me. My tomato basil soup and crab meat grilled sandwich had noticeable sweetness. Also my SO's salad seemed a bit sweet. I had thought the items we ordered would be savory. I appreciate the hot sauce available to kick my soup up a notch. 

I love their fresh juice and teas concoctions. And the chocolate covered strawberry that comes with each meal is just such a nice touch. 

For 10 dollars for a meal this is a great option! I would definitely come again."}
{"text":"This place has gotten a lot better since its opening. Here are some great staff members. They make the best blood orange vinaigrette. I just don't like how small the portions are for the salad toppings. You get a little spoonful (smaller than tablespoon) of toppings. That means maybe six thin strawberry slices or five or six blueberries. But it still tastes good and isn't too expensive."}
{"text":"By far the best selection in sandwiches, soups and salads. I think i have tried most of there choices and cant say i have been disappointed. 
Reason for rating them a 3, because they have a cut of time for phone orders. Dont bother going around noon with multiple orders, you will wait about an hour. They need to extend there call-in time, to avoid such a long wait."}
{"text":"First time getting their food and was excited because my family was bragging about it, they brought it back to go in the containers but they were filled half full, we asked if they could fill them and they said sorry they can't because Corporate was getting on them about putting too much in the bowls!! What the heck!!!!!!! Corporate being cheap and forgetting about customer service. Nice. I recommend the heads of the company think truly what they are doing and quit being STYMIES!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Normally I love Cafe Zupas. Today I ordered the Try 2 combo. I got the Turkey bacon avocado sandwich with the Garden Chicken Chop salad. My salad was delicious no complains there. My sandwich on the other hand was bland and gross. I got 1 slice of bacon and 3 slices of turkey. A subway sandwich would've tasted better.
My boyfriend got the Honey Bacon Club sandwich. He got 1 slice of turkey... Are you kidding me?? It was basically bread and tomato. Plus the sandwich was almost the same price as my Try 2 combo!! That's insane. I gave two stars for the good salad. I will never come back. This is absolutely ridiculous."}
{"text":"They come off as trying to be healthy.. In reality they are not. All of the soups are cream based, and both soups i had were way too salty. Salads were average ar best. I honestly like paradise bakery and panera better. For a healthy restaurant there is bread everywhere and the bread served with the soup was at best average. We will not be back"}
{"text":"I visited Zupas a few times in Utah many years ago, and it was so-so. However, this new Vegas Zupas has really freshened things up and expanded their menu. 

All the salads are super yummy (although the dressing is a little heavy-handed sometimes), most of the soups are addicting (try their chunky lobster bisque or creamy, Wisconsin cauliflower), and I really love their ultimate grilled cheese or chicken pesto sandwiches (anything with pesto!).

I was very disappointed with the crab melt sandwich. To me, it was just gross, so I'd never get that again. Everything else I've had there is great, including the desserts. Gotta love the chocolate dipped strawberries that come with every meal.

My two-year-old loves their chicken strips that come with a little side of fruit and bread. He's not really into food, but when we go to Zupas, he digs right in! Great place for kids."}
{"text":"Everything here is delicious. Check the strawberries before you consume. Chocolate covers the bad and moldy strawberries."}
{"text":"Love it here! Everyone is super friendly and food is great. You can choose from salads, sandwiches, and soups, and I usually get a combo of the two. I like their vegetarian sandwich and the mango berry salad was delicious. I also like that each combo comes with a chocolate covered strawberry and bread. They don't accept tips, just in case you wanted to try. Also closed Sundays, which is awesome for employees."}
{"text":"No blue cheese dressing any more. 

They used to have it, now they don't. 

Cashier said a lot of people have been asking for it, but it will not return. 

That's crazy. Give your customers what they want or you will have fewer customers. And that's not good."}
{"text":"I am so glad that I tried Zupas. 
I will never ever go back to Panera again. Zupas has changed my life. 

I visited this location one day during lunch with some coworkers and I was not disappointed. I ordered sandwich and salad and OMG!!! My food was delicious. I was so stuffed after that I could try my complimentary chocolate strawberry. 

The service is super quick. You walk up and order your salad and sandwich first, then soup, then treats. They have awesome drinks and the chocolate strawberries are delicious.

I've only been to this location twice and I ordered the same thing, but I'm sure everything on the menu is delicious. I've sampled some soups and by far all the soups that I've tried are yum."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong, the food is very good but holy crap the service is soooo terrible.  It took them 5 times to make my son's sandwich correctly and all he did was ask them to substitute mayo for the honey mustard.   They never offered him anything for our inconvenience, we were all done eating by the time his sandwich was made correctly. 
Ok so I was hoping it was a one time thing but of course I was wrong.  Again, this time my husband's food was messed up.  Their excuses were just that they were training.  And again, they don't care, just say sorry.
I so love the cauliflower soup but my family won't go back."}
{"text":"Love this place for a quick lunch or light dinner. Create your own combos and super fresh ingredients. Love the roasted red pepper lobster bisque"}
{"text":"First time here and it was amazing! Tried the cherry salad and the honey bacon pinini (sp?). All of it was yummy and the service was prefect. Will try this place again."}
{"text":"I first went to 20th street location and service was sub-par.  Food was not as Fresh as Avondale location. Last week I dined at Avondale location and restaurant was dirty. Tables were dirty hours went by and no one cleaned tables but staff was carrying on flirting in line. So much so they got my order wrong twice. Today I am back at Avondale location and more of the same. Been here having dinner for over an hour and there are many tables that are dirty and no on one has picked them up. Girl at register was more focused on chatting with peers. Love the new protein bowls but not sure I want to do the dirty dining.  So sad. Wondering where managers are??"}
{"text":"Decided to stop in for lunch on Meatless Monday so I went with the Vegetarian sandwich and the Wisconsin cheddar cauliflower soup.  Both were pretty good, but could use a tad more flavor.  They were both a bit bland.  However, I love how fresh the sandwich ingredients are and the bread was soft and fresh.  Ordering can be a bit confusing and the staff behind the counter could've been a bit more helpful with that.  Also, they had no chocolate covered strawberries ready so I didn't get one with my meal.  Oh well, they do deserve another visit and a chance at that five star rating. I will definitely return and you should check it out if in the area at lunchtime."}
{"text":"The food at cafe Zupas is really good. Unfortunately this location has the worst management. The manager is the most unfriendly, rude person to deal with. This isn't the first time I've dealt with her and had a bad experience. Also they are very stingy for the price. If you even dare to ask them to modify your order, they will charge for every little request. Save yourself the headache and head to a different location!"}
{"text":"Healthy convenient and AFFORDABLE! The best quick healthy lunch I'm the area!!! I'm hooked. Staff is so friendly make eye contact and always smiling! Thank you cafe zupa for helping is stay healthy and happy."}
{"text":"My favorite lunch time quick fix! Affordable and sooooo fresh with a roll and chocolate covered strawberry every time!!! Yummy. Always so bright fun and healthy at Zupas"}
{"text":"The food was very tasty. I love the TBA sandwich and those blessed chocolate covered strawberries get me every time. The thing that I don't like and I wish they would change is the repetition in ordering to each employee as i move down the line. I had to tell the sandwich girl my sandwich then the soup girls my soup order and then...... Repeat the hole order to the lady that puts it on your tray.
This is a difficult task with a big family and little ones.
 I wish they would write it down pass it along and make it easier for us all."}
{"text":"Food cleanliness is really a concern here. Staff should wear covers when they are talking to prevent shared saliva in the food. 

This will be my last time eating here. I can't believe there is a booger on the chocolate dipped strawberry."}
{"text":"Probably one of my favorite lunch spots in the city. They have a variety of soups, sandwiches, and salads that you can combine in a two item combo or enjoy individually, depending on how large your appetite is that day. My favorite combo is the California Protein Cobb salad and the Italian sandwich, which comes with a dinner roll and a chocolate covered strawberry for dessert. If that strawberry isn't enough to satisfy your sweet tooth, I recommend trying one of their many delectable desserts including their cheesecake. You'll be in sweet heaven! Also, they have seasonal menus as well so they're always switching up their soup and salad selection to include even more variety for their customers. Plus, price are fair and portions are filling which is a win, win in my book."}
{"text":"Fast and friendly service. Food was great. Nice size portions for the price. Very Clean restaurant.  Love the menu selection specially their \"try 2\" meal."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of eating at Zupas tonight and was pleasantly surprised by the first person who took my order. His name is Eric. This is probably the best service I've had in years. Eric is soft spoken, sweet and had a genuine smile on his face. He set the tone for everyone else who worked with him. Great job Eric!! Thanks for the smile. Kris"}
{"text":"I ordered the crab avocado melt and the lobster bisque. The sandwich was okay and the soup was delicious. However, they were both cold. They make them as soon as you order them and if they're busy and there's a line in front of you, your food sits on the counter till you pay. Their pomegranate coconut water was delicious and their chocolate covered strawberry was nice to end the meal with. I may go back at a less busy time."}
{"text":"Great food but service at this locations and others has gone down. Not the same service as when it first opened. Lots of staff sitting around and taking breaks."}
{"text":"Sooo delicious! Food is to die for and the staff is super friendly! Definitely my new favorite place!!!"}
{"text":"The line was long but it didn't take too long to get through it. It was a nice overcast day so we thought it would be perfect for soup and a sandwich. I got the chicken pesto. It was awesome. The clam chowder was the perfect partner. No dessert today although they give you a chocolate dipped strawberry with your order. I little price but it was great. Loved it."}
{"text":"This place is probably my favorite restaurant and it has the yummiest food that I have ever been had. The garden chowder is to die for. The people are also really, very helpful. I definitely recommend going here!"}
{"text":"As of late I have been feeling a bit turned off to Cafe Zupas.  Been coming to a few locations for years and only this past year and a half have I been annoyed with the vibe, the service, the price and quality of the food lately.  I feel more satisfied getting more vegetables from chipotle and pizza rev.  Cheaper and more satisfying.  Healthier options are open and it's not as preppy feeling in the establishment.  They have hot sauces at the other places.  Go elsewhere imo"}
{"text":"The majority of zupas's dishes are pretty delicious.  They offer free strawberries and bread with any order.  The staff is very friendly, but sometimes a little too, creepy with their politeness xD  I enjoy how promptly you get your food and how many seats they have available.  A great foodie place indeed!"}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE ZUPAS! The nuts and berries salad is to die for!!!! One of my favorite salads ever. So delicious and sweet and fresh. And what seals the deal is the chocolate-covered strawberry! Love this place!"}
{"text":"What a brilliant concept. So quick and fast, and the sandwiches are not too shabby. I got the panini with ham and cheese inside, along with a side of BBQ ranch salad. It was good. 

The other item ordered was the pulled pork sandwich. I was not digging the pulled pork flavors to much, and the mango salad was very refreshing and tasty! I'd come back here when I'm in a mood for a quick salad-to-go. 

I'm not a huge fan of either of the breads they used for the panini or the pulled pork. Nonetheless, is is worth a try."}
{"text":"Food is delish, service is enthusiastic and friendly as well as efficient, decor in modern European, comfortable and trendy. I had the Bacon honey mustard sandwich and the Vegetable Quinoa soup, as well as the chocolate hazelnut brûlée for dessert. All were amazing and I paid about $12, including a drink. I'm impressed and will be back."}
{"text":"I really liked this quick casual place.  The sandwiches and soup were great."}
{"text":"This place takes the best elements of Saladworks and Panera, while executing them in a Chipotle-style assembly. It would totally slaughter the East Coast market. Very impressive. The food was fresh and of good quality. Service was friendly, prompt, and attentive. Soup (tomato bisque) was excellent. Overall, I highly recommend."}
{"text":"This place can rival Panera Bread...and I LOVE Panera.

Salad fresh and made right in front of you. Great selection of soups and you can add your own additions instead of settling for what they give you.  You get a fresh strawberry dipped in chocolate with your order.

When came in at noon with a party of four and we got our food and was out the door within the hour. Great friendly service also."}
{"text":"I frequently use CZ for office lunches, based upon the recommendation of one of my attorneys who would bleed Café Zupas, if cut. She eats there nearly every day :)  Recently after an order had been delivered, our group had increased and I needed more food!  Panicking, I called Shelby and within 15 min- my luncheon was ready to be served!  Truly- 5 Stars for CZ!  Customer service- from answering the phone, on time delivery to quality and taste of food.
Thank you for helping me serve and please my office and guests.  It makes me look good, too :)"}
{"text":"Loved the place! 

I drove by couple of times and have decided to finally try it out. I'm so happy we did! I ordered a make-your-own Kind of salad which was delicious. The caramelized m-something-pineapple dressing was great!   

My husband got a small salad and the incredible and oh-so-recommend cauliflower soup. 

The chocolate dipped strawberries you get for free with each order were a great addition to the meal. Overall - loved it! We're so coming back!"}
{"text":"One of the best spots in Las Vegas, except it's off the strip so you need to drive out here. It's similar to a Panera, except with better soup, sandwich and salad options. I usually like to get the Try 2 Combo ($8.99) with a whole sandwich and half a soup. You can also switch one of those choices for half a salad, but there's no better hangover food like some carbs and soup in your stomach. I got the Crab Avocado Melt for my sandwich and a mix of the Lobster Bisque and Red Pepper Lobster. All orders also come with a chocolate dipped strawberry and bread roll. This is more than enough food and such a great value. They also let you taste all the soups, which makes it quite difficult because all of the soups are delicious. The soups are the absolute best here --better than Earl's Sandwiches and all that!

The saddest part? They're close on Sundays, how unfortunate."}
{"text":"We were excited to try Zupas because we are huge fans of soup and thought it might be like Zoup! in the Northeast.  It's not like Zoup!, because soup is not the main focus.  When we asked about Vegetarian soup we were told by two employees that the green leaf identifying vegetarian soups on the menu doesn't consider chicken stock in two of the \"Vegetarian\" soups. A third employee said that the green leaf meant no chicken stock, but I am now weary about this labeling.  

The cafe is clean and bright and there's a docking/charging station for laptops. Good location, although the parking lot is always packed.

The staff was friendly and busy, but they didn't keep orders in order on the assembly line, which was kind of weird and inefficient.  You basically have to re-state your order at the register so that they can find your food.

The price was good for the quality of food. We ordered the Red Raspberry Spinach Salad (dressing on side), Vegetarian sandwich (white bread is only option), Tuscan White Bean & Vegetable soup (Veg), Wisconsin Cauliflower (mystery stock \"Vegetarian\"), and iced tea (unsweetened Nestea from fountain).  The chocolate covered strawberries they included on our tray was a nice touch.  All of it was good!

Recommendations to Zupas: educate staff about labeling on menu, offer whole grain bread for sandwiches and soups, swap out styrofoam water cup for paper, and fresh brewed iced tea would be nice.  Zupas could easily get 5 stars!

We'll be back for salads and soup, but until Zupas offers whole grain bread we'd rather get sandwiches at Wildflower or Paradise."}
{"text":"I am really disappointed with cafe zupas. They do not deliver consistent customer service.  I have been to 3 locations in Las Vegas areas previously and had NO issues substituting one ingredient on my sandwich. I was informed on my last visit there are NO substitutions allowed on their sandwiches, even if I was willing to pay an upcharge. Customers are only allowed to remove items. I simply asked for spinach leaves instead of cheese on my sandwich. I find this policy very troubling for those who have food allergies and would like an alternative ingredient on their sandwich. The employees behind the counter were rude, and tossed my to-go bag at me without giving me any eye contact. I called another location to verify this policy which they confirmed. I will NOT support or return to zupas anymore."}
{"text":"If you haven't been to Cafe Zupas yet, then you're really missing out. If you're used to eating cheeseburgers, or cardboard sandwiches, then you're really missing out. Cafe Zupas has a wide variety of appetizing and *mostly* healthy items. I say mostly, because there are various deserts and meals that are slightly less desirable for your overall health, but you could do a lot worse. The vegetables are always fresh, and I haven't had a soup I didn't enjoy. Mushroom bisque is my favorite.

The staff is always super friendly, although borderline annoyingly so. You know what they're going to say after going there 3+ times. I think they are all on a script. And besides that, the prices are on that edge of affordably uncomfortable to asking a little to much. But if you don't mind dropping the extra scratch it's a good place to eat. 

Also, don't worry about the food trays. They pick up after you. (I always hate leaving the table a mess, so this befuddled me)."}
{"text":"Yelpers to the rescue again. Looking for someplace new & different around Arrowhead Mall and Cafe Zupas popped up on Yelp. 
This is a soup/salad/sandwich place. 4 stars? Here's why:
Everyone was friendly and helpful. From those taking our order to the guy clearing the tables. 
Lots of variety on the menu. I had the Cuban pork sandwich and Yucatan chicken soup (2 item combo for around $8.50). Both were quite tasty although the soup was a bit over salted. My wife had the honey cilantro carnitas sandwich. Tasty as well. 
Their \"signature\" gimme is a complementary chocolate covered strawberry & a chunk of Italian bread for each person. Like I needed more bread. And of course I ate it. They went through all the trouble to bake it, right?The strawberry hit the spot without too much guilt. 
Aside from the good eats CZ is a wifi hotspot and has a counter with several electrical outlets for charging purposes strategically located in the middle of the dining area. 
This place is direct competition to Jason's Deli and Paradise Bakery. 
4 stars because the variety, friendliness, cleanliness, quality and bonus features."}
{"text":"CRAZY salty soup!

Let me start by saying I'll give Cafe Zupas another shot. The staff were very friendly. The place has an interesting decor and inviting, though very bright, ambiance. I'm anxious to try their salads, which looked delightful. But during this visit we opted for the soups and sandwiches - big mistake. 

The sandwiches were fine. We tried the ultimate grilled cheese, the vegetarian and the avocado crab melt. Nothing fantastic, but interesting and mostly good. The vegetables were crisp and the bread was fresh. Their \"hearty\" whole wheat bread was pillowy soft, like a dinner roll. Not what I was expecting but not necessarily a bad thing. 

We tried three different soups.They all looked good and the ingredients sound appetizing but be warned - they are way over-salted. We tried a lobster bisque, a cauliflower and a clam chowder. The lobster bisque was good, but too salty. The cauliflower was really a cheese soup with the barest hint of cauliflower, it was also too salty. Without exaggeration, I can say that the clam chowder was saltier than seawater. Putting a spoonful in your mouth was actually PAINFUL. We had to send it back. 

I'm not sodium adverse or on some low sodium diet. My friends make fun of me putting extra salt on restaurant french fries. I enjoy well-seasoned food. And still Cafe Zupas' soups were far, far too salty.  

Given that all three soups were very salty, one painfully such, I think that copious amounts of salt is part of their recipes and not just a one-off mistake."}
{"text":"They forgot the chicken and dressing in my Glazed Chicken Chipotle salad.

BOO!

I ate the strawberry first then dunked into my salad, when about the 3rd bite I was looking for chicken and realized it was a dry salad!  No lunch for me :(

I went after work and they gave me a new one after I showed the dry greens.  

I finally ate lunch while waiting for the kiddos to get off of school at 3pm in the school parking lot.  

Had it not been for this big hiccup, I might have liked it more."}
{"text":"I give three stars. I dined here today the food was OK I had the turkey bacon avacado sandwich with the tomatoe bisq soup. The soup was good kind of cold though. The sanwhich was bit of a dissapointment. Chewy bacon. 
Girl that I paid seemed kind of standoffish the girls who pre pared my food were friendly and smiling. The lady the was cleaning the dining area was awesome. I got her name it was ANA she was super nice and offered to clean my tray for me. Overall decent food good service"}
{"text":"I usually love the soup here, but today not so much. I had the New England clam chowder, which on the menu boasts to be \"an American classic done right.\"  Well, maybe the chef has never had authentic New England clam chowder because this was not so great. It was filled with under cooked potatoes, crunchy celery and onions.  There were so many that I really could not taste the clams. The clams should stand out in clam chowder not the vegetables. 

On the other hand, my turkey spinach artichoke sandwich was very delicious."}
{"text":"I Love this place! It's quick, healthy & delicious... plus good music! I highly recommend you try the TRY 2 Combo (under $10) & the protein Bowls! The drinks options are fantastic too!"}
{"text":"I am disappointed  in this location, and or the franchises price & portion. I ordered the Create your own salad, (5 topping, including chicken) there was like 5 tiny tiny bites of chicken (which normall
y is a add on for a $1.79. How do they justify (1-2 ounces of meat as an addon. It's barely a sprinkle) ... I asked them to give me a reasonable portion (they gave me attitude & another 1 Oz (Jello shot size amount). Rrrrrrrrr!"}
{"text":"They were so disorganized and rude and rushed   They were literally throwing my food at me didn't even ask me what kind of lettuce I wanted to my salad even when I told them it was a \"make your own\"and then they had accidentally put blueberries in my salad and then started picking them out by hand instead of offering to make me a fresh one I had to tell them to start over again my hot sandwich was cold and she didn't even mix the dressing well enough so there was a bunch of ranch dressing at the bottom of the bowl and the top part of my salad was dry when I told the cashier would happen she just sort of sad sorry but didn't offer to do anything. It was such a hostile stressful situation. Save your money and go to Panera"}
{"text":"When I saw the menu I wanted to try everything. I love that it's fresh and made in front of you.  They have a combo of either a whole sandwich with half soup or salad, or half salad and soup . I got the turkey artichoke  on wheat and the seasonal berry and beet salad. Normally i get my dressing on the side because most places put too much on but I had them mix it, it was a perfect mix. Also their bathroom were clean and the staff were very helpful and friendly"}
{"text":"This is literally the third time (possibly even fourth) in a row my order has been made incorrectly. Does each person there make their own version of the veggie sandwich?"}
{"text":"Don't get a to go salad, they won't give you the same amount if you eat it in the dining room. I asked for them to add more lettuce at least and they just said no. I should have returned my salad."}
{"text":"Maybe I just haven't researched enough yet, but there are not enough places with good soup near my home (in South Bay LA). I would LOVE for Café Zupas to come to my 'hood! 

My Mommy brought me here when I was visiting her a year or so ago. She already knew what she wanted so I felt kind of bad for her because as soon as I saw the options for soups and salads and sammiches AND learned I could try all of the soups, I knew we would be there for a while.
I've been to this and another location in Vegas a couple of times each (usually in the evening) and there's never been an especially long line or wait even though it's always pretty busy.

Service has always been on point except the first time I came. There was a young man who seemed irritated that I had so many questions. I'm a curious person! He seemed fine with giving me samples of almost literally every soup they had to offer, but he didn't seem to want to answer questions about them. Once he saw I wasn't going to give up, he chilled and then seemed to become my best friend!

I like that the soups are so full of flavor! My Mommy said she finds some of them too salty but sista likes salt so that doesn't bother me - I didn't find anything too salty. I went once when I was partial (Daniel) fasting and the veggie soup with quinoa HIT THE SPOT! It was delicious! I didn't feel like I was skimping on good taste at all! I also like that there are a plethora of toppings I can add to my soups and salads to make my own creations. 

All in all, there is nothing I have ordered on the menu I didn't like. Everything tastes fresh and well made. No complaints there. You get a roll and a chocolate-covered strawberry with your purchase. This is nice, in theory, but let me tell you my gripe with this... the roll is just okay. Sista loves bread but I don't have to have this particular bread. And most people adore chocolate-covered strawberries. I don't. So this leads to my two complaints...

1) Café Zupas charges extra for EVERYthing you add to ANYthing!
2) And they will not do 

I TOTALLY get that they are a for-profit entity and that it costs to be in business. And I get that I can be a pain in the rear as I modify their selections by adding and taking away. BUT they encourage me to add all kinds of stuff, and I think the cost of those additions is a little steep for as much as you get. And to charge me for onions on half a sandwich (not even grilled onions or special color onions) is ridiculous. Plus they said they said they couldn't add the onions to the sandwich for me. They ended up putting some on the side so I could add it myself, but really?!? 

I don't know... I'd rather add something like onions for free than have okay bread or a chocolate-covered strawberry. But I could be the minority.
And this won't stop me from returning! And wishing Café Zupas would open locations in California!

{"text":"I had high expectations for this place because of the review my cousin left for it, the fact that my aunt (who prefers homemade stick to your bones and thighs soul food to any other kind) loves this place, and my mom kept ranting and raving. And they delivered!

While large franchises are nice because of convenience in numerous locations, I truly appreciate the unique quality of smaller ones. Per the website, this restaurant operates in Arizona, Idaho, Minnesota, Nevada, and Utah. The \"coming soon\" locations do not detail any in California so I guess I just have to eat at this establishment when I go visit the family in Vegas...

Any place that lets me try ALL possible samples and doesn't make me feel like I am holding up the line or need to hurry is automatically ranked high in my book! The service I've received during each of my visits to this (or any) Cafe Zuppa's has been on point. I like that the bar has everything laid out for me to see so I can create extra special custom sammiches.

The vegetarian soup is really good! It was salty. Sista likes salt.

They give you a chocolate dipped strawberry with your order. That's okay, I guess. Many would call that a nice touch, but I'm not the biggest fan of chocolate strawberries so I would rather them not charge a fee for adding ANYthing, like onions. Like almost a dollar! Keep the strawberry and give me breath-stank! If I remember correctly, they charge almost a one dollar to add a very small amount of \"extra\" to any soup or sandwich. I'm not trying to put anyone out of business, but a dollar for onions? I add and pay for enough of all kinds of other stuff to pay four quarters for that, in my opinion.

BUT the food is yummy, is fresh, and there is no place like this near home I have found in Cali. So four stars, it is...

His lack of professionalism and general sense of food prep is ridiculous."}
{"text":"First time visit and we loved it!!  Great prices, delicious food (with unique sandwich and soup choices), and a free chocolate dipped strawberry with every purchase.  There was a line for lunch, but it moved quickly.   I recommend the mushroom soup and braised turkey sandwich.  Yum!!"}
{"text":"I can't wait to go back. So many choices to dig into and you can have samples of the soup before you order it.The kids size was perfect! Chocolate covered strawberries, yes please! Oh and make sure you leave room for dessert! I did the Try 2 combo and it was fabulous and a fun way to try stuff."}
{"text":"Zupas really made me happy. Although it was very busy we were greeted immediately and the hostess explained the menu to us and gave some suggestions. We got the soup and sandwich deal which has a reasonable price for what you get. I don't remember what sandwich I had but I do remember it was very good. The garden chowder was absolutely delicious. My fiance's lobster bisque was also very tasty. I like that you get a chocolate covered strawberry too. The one thing I wasn't crazy about was the young staff member cleaning the tables, she seemed in a very bad mood and sighed and puffed constantly. Guess someone had a bad day. Still five points, I can really recommend this place."}

{"text":"I like the idea of Zupas, I like soup I like salad and I like them together. Zupas deserves two stars since they are so stingy with their toppings. For example: get a salad with cucumber and they measure the cucumber squares in small spoons. Pay for extra? Another ONE small spoon that doesn't even equal one cucumber slice. Upgrade to a large salad? Get DOUBLE the lettuce, and one whole extra teaspoon of toppings!

I guess I'm just spoiled from chipotle who doesn't police their toppings like we're in North Korea."}
{"text":"I love this place, love the atmosphere, love the food. This is must place to dine when you want fresh and healthy. There's so many types of choices you have to come back and try them all. There's even a fresh juice station which is uncommon and a charging station for your cell phones."}
{"text":"The food is good and everyone is really nice. The interior of this establishment is very modern and clean. The only problem is that it is really confusing to order. The font on the menu is too small( I wear glasses) and it's really unorganized, they have you restate what you ordered when you get the cash register and half of your Oder isn't even finished yet. Overall I had an ok experience."}
{"text":"I tried Cafe Zupas with my family and we each got something different. At first, I thought it was pricey until I took my first bite. My salad was amazing. My sons ordered crab sandwiches and they loved it. It is now one of my favorite restaurants! Their cheesecake is great too!"}
{"text":"Visited Cafe Zupas for dinner on a Saturday night.  This location is in Desert Ridge.  All in all, it was pretty good and I would go again.  

Location:

Easy to find and get to.  Desert Ridge sometimes has parking problems, but that would be the case anywhere.  The restaurant was open, well-lit, and had plenty of seating.  The counter was a disaster.  Oh, it was clean, but the way that it's laid out seems like a nightmare for the poor employees, and the lack of an easy to read menu made it hard on new customers like me.

Staff:

Super friendly and helpful.  There was a young lady at the front who provided me and my wife with paper menus and offered suggestions.  The staff at the counter were also friendly, but appeared overwhelmed.  Upon leaving, multiple employees bade us farewell.  

Food:

I got the chicken pesto sandwich and a half-bowl of the white bean Tuscan soup.  The sandwich was grilled panini-style and was a good size for the price.  It was tasty, but not the best; I'm not sure that if I was drafting a menu I would have a warm pesto sandwich that had sprouts on it.  The soup was awesome.  It was very hardy for a vegetarian soup and was well-seasoned.  Reminiscent of minestrone, but without the pasta.  My wife ordered the turkey bacon avodado sandwich.  She liked it, but thought that it should come with something other than honey mustard on it.  It was also panini-style.  When we ordered there was a bit of a mix-up with our order.  My sandwich was not ready, but the ever-friendly staff wrote down our description and had it delivered to us at our table.  I was half-way through my soup and the sandwich came in hot and toasty.  

Oh yes, and the dessert.  They gave us chocolate covered strawberries gratis with the meal.  They were awesome.  I wish that I had more.  My wife ordered the chocolate creme brulee.  It was very tasty, but was more like chocolate pudding than creme brulee.  

Overall:

The food ranged from good to very good.  The location is good.  Staff is excellent.  Cafe Zupas suffers from attempting to have a service counter that's similar to a Chipotle but lacks the proper timing to do it.  It would have been better if they had simply given us a number and brought the food to the table.  With that said, it was warm, fresh, reasonably priced, and easy to get in and out of.  I would come here again."}
{"text":"Had the 'nuts about berries' salad. It was fresh, delicious, & quite large for being a 'half' salad. Their prices are great and the staff was friendly and helpful. I'll be returning for sure!"}
{"text":"There was bacon in sandwich when i asked for non bacon. I just cant stand such ignorance. I have to drive 2 miles back just to exchange that. DOUBLE CHECK IF YOU EVER CUSTOMIZE."}
{"text":"The catering team here are superheroes. 

Tiffany Claxton and team came to my rescue today for a corporate catering order, and prepared 80 perfect sandwich boxes in the matter of a couple hours! And still delivered on time! The sandwiches are fantastic; my favorite is the Italian, and everyone in my office loves the chocolate-dipped cookies. 

I'm eternally grateful for this absolutely delicious caterer and will continue to order monthly. THANK YOU GUYS!!!!"}
{"text":"Love the salads, soups and sandwiches at this cafe!  Perfect spot for lunch while out shopping with my daughter."}
{"text":"I love this place! I ordered a salad with berries, chicken, and cinnamon almonds and it was amazing. Everything was really fresh and reasonably priced. You even get a chocolate covered strawberry with your meal!"}
{"text":"The food was great.   I had the Tomato Basil soup and the ultimate grilled cheese.  Both were awesome.   So why only a three star?  Because the children they hire to run the place are pretty bad and borderline stupid.  Ordering was like talking to a wall.   Not listening, giggling like idiots just got so annoying it too away from the enjoyment.  I'll try another location because the food was so good. But not this one."}
{"text":"Wow I stepped in and got great customer service from the staff. Highly praise the workers here! All friendly and outstanding! I ordered the combo withh carnitas sandwich and California premium Cobb. It was delicious. Even my chihuahua patiently watched me eat it so he can grab a bite.  definitely recommend this place and will be coming back! I loved the little strawberry chocolate that came with my meal! Definitely love this place!"}
{"text":"The food is excellent. However the ordering process is horrible. No one communicates to one another, everyone gets confused, and in the end you have to tell four different people what you're ordering. To make it worse I gave the girl at the cash register a twenty for an $18 meal and didn't receive any change. But of course I didn't even notice this, because of how flustered and confused I was just simply trying to get my food."}
{"text":"When I checked out they didn't have my sandwich.  They told me to sit and they would bring it.  I ate my salad and no sandwich.  I went back up and they didn't even have it put in.  I asked for it to go now.  When I got back to the office and went to eat it they gave me the wrong one.  This had guacamole on it and I hate guacamole on sandwiches.  I paid $12 for a half salad and fountain drink.  It wasn't even busy."}
{"text":"Ordered a grilled cheese and wanted to add AND pay extra for Turkey on the sandwich. They stated company policy would not allow it?! So I changed the order to a grilled cheese sandwich and a side of turkey. Lol. She looked at me and realized how terrible of a rule that is. I go down the line to the soups and it is almost all liquid. I ordered the clam chowder and they put 2-3 squares of potatoes and 1 tiny clam in the entire bowl. My wife ordered the full strawberry salad which was about half the size of a meal sized salad anywhere else. The worst part is their food is very good. If they weren't so cheap this would be an amazing place."}
{"text":"Never disappointed when I come here. They have a great deal. They're attentive and quick. You can never go wrong with Asian Cjtrus Chicken and Crab Avocado Melt for only just $9."}
{"text":"Loved this place! The soup and salad combo were absolutely delicious. I ordered the strawberry chicken salad with the red pepper lobster bisque. I wanted to go back for seconds!! Definitely a place to come back over and over for lunch!  The chocolate covered strawberry at the end was a nice compliment!"}
{"text":"Salad was good. But soup was salty and lacked chicken and vegetables. Was mostly broth. The chocolate-covered strawberry was not appetizing. It was a rotting strawberry that should not have been served. This is our second time here. And it will be our last n"}
{"text":"I've gone to this place quite a few times since I discovered it a couple of weeks ago with my mom. The food is very good and fresh-tasting. My favorite dishes are the Turkey Bacon Avocado sandwich and the California Protein Cobb salad with blue cheese dressing. The chocolate-covered strawberries are excellent as well.

The only reason this place doesn't get five stars from me is because their servings are pitiful. For example, if you get a salad with strawberries as an ingredient, the spoon they use is so childishly small that you'd be lucky to get a full strawberry. If you ask for a little more, they want to charge you an extra $.69 for a mosquito-spoonfull of strawberries. However, I've noticed that stinginess is common among restaurants that fix your food in front of you like this (Chipotle, Subway, etc.), so maybe I'm just being greedy.

Still, great food that tastes very fresh."}
{"text":"Just left zupas and not really pleased. I ordered a large cauliflower soup which was $6.39 and noticed only about half of the bowl was full. When I voiced my concern I was told that they are only able to put \"2 scoops\"  of soup into the bowl. I also got cheese and bacon which was an additional .69 each. Which I feel is a bit pricey for the small amounts that were added. I have been here several times before and left feeling satisfied, but I never just ordered soup. After seeing the large bowel I assumed I would have enough soup for two meals, but to my surprise there's barely enough for one. I don't like being tricked so I will never return to zupas for a $8.40 half bowl of soup. Do better Zupas and don't mislead your customers."}
{"text":"They charged me 69 cents for not even a full, tiny cup of sour cream for my not full soup that was almost $5. Zupas, shame on you for your greed. At least give me what I pay for!! Change your portions to what they should be instead of skimping on potions."}
{"text":"First time eating here with my husband even thought our gym is right next to it. Always wanted to try this place & finally tried it!  I ordered the try 2 combo with turkey spinach sandwich & Wisconsin cauliflower soup while my husband ordered the combo of crab sandwich & mangoberry salad. Both combos came with rolls and chocolate dipped strawberries. And on top of it we ordered the chocolate mousse. AMAZING FOOD is all we can say. Very healthy & delicious! Plus the ladies that served us were very nice & gave amazing service! New favorite place. Bye Panera bread haha"}
{"text":"Blown away by this concept restaurant. You go down an order line ordering your custom made salad, sandwich & soup. What makes it special are the plethora of quality ingredients & toppings for the selections. 2 combo is under $10. Luscious desserts. Special syrup pump selection for the unsweetened ice tea. They don't accept $ tips but want comments on social media. They also remove your plates for you. Clean & open air eating area. Oh yeah, you get a soft white bun and  small chocolate dipped strawberry with your combo."}
{"text":"First time customer and Im very satisfied with the food quality and service. I ordered the Italian and the lobster bisque soup and it was very delicious and filling. I also was very pleasantly surprised to find a chocolate covered strawberry in my order  The price is great, the food quality and flavors were spot on I will definitely recommend this place to friends and family members."}
{"text":"Sandwich. Salad. Soup. Yum! Yum! Yum! I noticed Cafe Zupas before they opened, looked it up online, and was excited to try something new in the area. Since then, I have been several times, trying different menu items, and each visit has been great.

- Yucatan Chipotle Chicken Salad: I really like this salad. I ask to add corn. Fresh and yummy with a little bit of a spicy kick. Win.
- BBQ Pulled Pork Sandwich: I read somewhere that this was the most favorite sandwich, and I can see why. Tender meat and a great sauce, balanced perfectly with the slaw and soft Ciabatta bread. Win.
- California Turkey Sandwich: I don't like sprouts, so I got it without. Pretty simple, fresh and yummy. Win.
- Turkey Bacon Avocado Panini: It was good, but not great. It seemed a little too soft. Like the heat of the sandwich made the inner side of bread mush. Meh.
- Tomato Basil Soup with Orzo Pasta: Not a fan at all. I love tomato soups, but this one was just odd. Weird flavor, weird texture, way too salty. Bleh.
- Wisconsin Cauliflower Soup: OMG delicious! I hate cauliflower, but I tried a sample, and it was awesome. I've heard that cauliflower cheese soup can taste just like potato cheese soup, and it did! Win.
- Yucatan Chicken Tortilla Soup: A little too salty, but I still love the flavor. A little spicy, and the glob of guacamole, squeeze of lime, and tortilla strips help balance the salt. Win.
- Chicken Enchilada Chili: Tastes like enchiladas in soup form. I love it. Win.

Bossman is one of the pickiest eaters I know, and he has fallen for the Honey Bacon Club Panini (without tomatoes) and the Tuscan White Bean and Vegetable Soup (although he said this is also a little salty - even for the man who puts extra salt on EVERYTHING)!

The fresh bread that comes with the soup is delicious. Slightly crusty exterior and soft inside. And who can complain about a chocolate dipped strawberry? Awesome touch!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy Cafe Zupas and so every trip to Las Vegas I eat here at least once.  They have several locations and no matter which location I have tried the food and service has always been consistently excellent.  This is one of the better fast casual dining places I have tried.  You get to watch them make your order and they truly use quality, fresh ingredients.  Their salads are awesome, and the dressings taste home made. Although I am not really a soup fan they will provide a sample, and they are delicious.  The sandwiches are also really good.  The restaurant lay out is nice and the place is always very clean.  The service is great as the employees friendly and knowledgable on the menu.  Overall great value for fresh, tasty food!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Everything I've had is fresh and tasty. Place is clean and modern.  They prepare your order in front of you, sort of a Chipotle assembly line approach to fresh salads and sandwiches.   Also impressed with the customer service as all the staff are friendly, know the menu which has lots of options, and provide great recommendations."}
{"text":"Awesome fresh soup, salad, and sandwich place. 

Everything is fresh and flavorful. My favorite is the Mushroom Bisque. 

And every meal comes with a chocolate covered strawberry!"}
{"text":"Oh, Zupas. In all sincerity, this place is just fine. Just be aware...when you walk in, the staff is very friendly...a little TOO friendly, if you know what I mean. Let me give you an example: \"HEY! Welcome to Zupas! How you doing today?!...great! Are we getting a soup or a salad today?! A chicken chop?! GREAT! Any sandwiches?! TBA? GREAT!!! Thanks for coming in!!!\" Basically, imagine an explanation point after every word. Yes. Every word. Friendly? Yes. Overwhelming? Haha-yes. I just can't help but widen my eyes and try to make sense of what is going on and why I feel this sudden rush of random unexplained excitement and confusion.

They don't have normal Dr. Pepper, but have tons of other normal sodas and drinks, the food is healthy and fresh, except the salads at times have lettuce not as fresh and crisp as I would prefer. I do enjoy going here, as it is clean and comfortable to sit and eat. Just, man! Get ready to be excited!!!"}
{"text":"Decided to stop by after reading a few reviews. I was really hoping for someplace with delicious Chicken fried rice but settled for sandwiches and a salad instead. Honestly, most everything in there seemed unappealing to me but I gave it a shot. 

Ordering was a little overwhelming. I felt rushed and while it is lunch hour, I was frazzled with making quick decisions. Guacamole on your salad counts as TWO sides. But it's one tiny scoop. Disappoint. 

Anyway, ordered a Turkey Bacon Avocado Sandwich without bacon. (don't judge me.) and a create your own salad that I would've liked to add an egg to but like I said they're very rushed. 

So, ate my food. And I can't same I'm too impressed. The salad is a salad is a salad. Sandwich was soggy. And didn't taste as great as I had hoped. It was like eating sandwich meat from the grocery store. 

Chocolate covered strawberry was nice.  Bread was weird. Soft but dry and needing something. 

Anyway, it was probably just all my decisions regarding what to eat. Probably won't return though."}
{"text":"Stopped by this store for a quick bite and there were over 15 customers ahead of me yet I was able to place my order and get my food within 5-6 minutes, my crab sandwich and clam chowder were tasty. Total bill came to $9.35, I now wonder why was I spending $7-$8 for crappy McDonald's meals..."}
{"text":"What a fun place with quality food. It's located amongst lots of good shopping. It was busy during the lunch hour but the line went quickly. 

You can choose from a wide variety of soups, sandwiches, salads and desserts. 

I chose the guacamole crab panini and half Asian salad. Every meal gets a roll and a chocolate covered strawberry. 

The food was good. It was quality. Lots of different ingredients to make the dishes interesting. 

I tried a couple of the desserts that our table shared. The chocolate cake was amazing. 

All of the employees at the counter were friendly and super knowledgeable. I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite spot for a quick lunch or dinner. The food here is really good. It isn't your typical spot for salad, soup, and sandwiches. 

The menu is large and has a nice variety of items for all tastes. My very favorite item is the mangoberry salad that comes with a yogurt dressing that is delicious. A close second is the chicken enchilada soup. I love that each meal comes with a chocolate covered strawberry and some bread. The combination of half salad and a soup is the perfect amount of food for me. It's nice to get a reasonably priced meal that isn't served in excessive portions.

The service here is always good. They are friendly and do a good job of tracking the line process so that you get the correct order. This location gets very busy, but they keep things moving and clear tables quickly."}
{"text":"Great selection of sandwiches, salads & soups! I had the mushroom soup, it was great. I had the combo, so had the Cobb salad. The soup was the first to go! The salad had generous ingredients, eggs, blue cheese, edamame (nice addition to a Traditional salad), bacon, black olives, chicken. Got the blue cheese dressing on the side. My mom had the salad with glazed chipotle chicken. The dressing had a nice taste of cilantro.
I like the bright, customer-friendly menu. Makes it easy to read. I wish they had something like this in my home town of Chicago!!  It is a very nice complimentary addition of the chocolate covered strawberry with every meal!! I give it a total thumbs up!  It is a good value."}
{"text":"I like the choose 2 option. The Cuban was good-not great. The soups were excellent as was the strawberry salad. I love that they give a chocolate covered strawberry and roll with each meal. The drink infusion bar choices were a cool idea, but not enough flavor-too watered down. It is expensive though, which sucks because all healthy decent places usually are."}
{"text":"I much prefer this place over Paradise or Corner Bakery.  The service is great.  You get to actually sample the soups before you try them.  Oh and the selection of soups is pretty wide I'd say.  And the fact that they give you a chocolate-dipped strawberry with your meal will always one up a fresh chocolate chip cookie any day."}
{"text":"My mother in law was in for a visit and we were in the mood for soup and salad. I had been wanting to try Café Zupas and this seemed like the perfect opportunity. As we walked in, the young lady at the front door explained the menu and offerings - this was very helpful seeing it was our first visit. It was busy, but the staff at the counter took the time to explain things and let us taste a few of the soups, which was very helpful. 

I had the chicken enchilada chili and the BBQ chicken salad. Both were great. My mother in law loved her food as well. The meal also came with a chocolate covered strawberry. It actually was a lot of food.  The only bland part of the meal was the bread that came with the soup - it was nothing special. 

The dining room was very nice and the attendant in the room was a really sweet, helpful lady.

I'll definitely plan on returning in the future."}
{"text":"Zupas is anyone's dream place to go during lunch - fast, friendly, and efficient!  Every time I've gone for lunch, there are a good amount of people in line, but it goes by fast!  I get to the front of the line faster than I can make a decision!  

The menu is huge!!  The have a variety of soups, salads, and sandwiches.  I usually go for their combo meal where you can mix & match two of the three selections.  The combo also comes with the cutest chocolate covered strawberry and a piece of bread.  They also let you try samples of their soups, which is always nice.

This place is great if you're looking for something healthier and are crunched for time.  It's always a go to for my lunch breaks!"}
{"text":"Finally getting to try this little place after living in the area for two years!! I ordered the chicken enchilada chili. Flavor is delicious but I was shocked that they charge extra for two of the main ingredients in ACTUAL enchiladas; sour cream and cheese! Also they do not have chopped tomatoes (pico de gallo) OR cilantro. I didn't get a drink and it was still almost $7.00. For taste, service, friendliness, and cleanliness I give 4 stars. Wish I got more bang for my buck though."}
{"text":"Went back in today the mushroom soup was luke warm no one seemed to know what to do it became a big production. I had to tell the girl to go in back and put my soup in the microwave she was walking in circles. She brought it out and again it was still cool so back it went for round two. There was no manager in sight to handle this so it was very juvenile. Then the staff say down to eat with 6 tables in the restaurant and began to complain about customers asking for special requests. I couldn't believe it. Come on cafe zupa you can do better than this. I have been an Executive Chef for 26 years so i understand how these things can go on it happens everywhere the problem is it eventually ruins your reputation. It all boils down to proper training and supervision of staff. I think Cafe Zupa is an excellent concept hopefully next time i come thrse issues will be fixed."}
{"text":"Totally awesome place. This has definitely replaced Paradise Bakery as our go-to soup/salad/sandwich place. Loads of stellar eats and a super polite staff makes for an easy win. Clean and orderly is good, too.

Loads of tasty sandwiches from which to choose? Check. An equivalent bevy of tasty salads? You know it. Scrumptious soups? All day. Decadent deserts? Awww, yeah. I've yet to find something I haven't thoroughly enjoyed and I doubt that you will, either. 

If there's a negative to be had (at least for me personally), it's that they serve Coke instead of Pepsi. That's all I've got. Seriously. 

Why are you still sitting there? JUST GO. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I usually love Cafe Zupa's but this location is very disappointing:( I ordered a Strawberry Salad and asked the server how much would it be to add blackberries to my salad and she said any additions are  69 cents. So I had her add them. After I had paid I noticed my receipt had a charge for a fruit cup for $2.49. I knew I hadn't ordered a fruit cup so I went to the cashier to let them know my receipt was wrong. The manager stated that since berries are so expensive - that is why he charged me so much! I told him what the server had told me about it being only 69 cents extra and he just shrugged his shoulders and said-\"Sorry - I will have to tell her she was wrong!.\" Most managers would have at least offered to give me a refund or something but he acted like he could care less - this is not good customer service and I will not be back to this location as long as this manager is working."}
{"text":"I love the quality of the food, but for the price, it simply isn't worth it. I have been here several times now. 

This past time my husband and I ordered 1/2 soup, full soup, and a drink and we paid $16. Furthermore, they don't even both filling up the containers to the top. The simply put in one ladle full for the 1/2 and two for the full. We always get our order to go, and just to make it worth our money, we sit and refill our drink. 

It's a shame because the food is delicious. Their tomato basil soup is the best I've had. The salads are very well crafted as well. Like another reviewer said, they are very consistent with what goes on them and how much goes on. I do love that they include a roll and chocolate covered strawberry with each order, but it still isn't enough to warrant the high prices. 

Also, every single time I've come here, they are out of tofu and have to make more. If this is the case, why not just prep more every day?"}
{"text":"I just had a terrible experience at the location. Their customer service is terrible. My order was to go so one of the workers marked the plastic container (where they put your soup and sandwich) and the guy accidentally threw the container in a bin with dirty dishes and other employee picks it up and put my food in there!!!!! I was furious but i didn't say anything because I hate complaining then they gave us a little bit of soup. I will never set foot again in there."}
{"text":"Been here several times and I'm conflicted...there are some wonderful things about this place and there are some real let downs too.

Positives? Staff is very friendly and patient. They are fast, efficient, and keep the place clean. I like the flavorings you can put in the sodas. The chocolate dipped strawberry is a nice touch. I've tried several soups and they are amazing.

Negatives? Sandwiches are small for the price. The chocolate dipped strawberry is often under-ripe. The bread that comes with the soup is awful, just bad texture, and it's so easy to get good bread! Soups are never hot enough. Salads are okay, nothing spectacular, and the chicken in them tastes off. The desserts are terrible, the brûlées are nothing but a pudding or custard with some runny sauce masquerading as caramel or a few berries with a runny berry sauce. The brownie was hard. When you consider how much you've paid, you realize you've not gotten much food. And very little of it is great."}
{"text":"This place is legit. I was hesitant on trying the garden chowder because it's just veggies right? Like how good can it get. Especially when I saw the amount they put in the to-go container. It was not even full and according to my sis when someone once asked why they aren't filled to the brim, it's apparently because they only use one ladle. So already I was a bit disgusted with this place. 

So I got the half soup/ half salad but my sister took the salad, so sorry no pic on that. The 2 combo comes with a roll and a chocolate covered strawberry. 

The bread is perfect. Not too hard, not too soft. Perfectly sweet and hearty. As for the soup, awesome! Filled with roasted corn, celery, carrots, and a cream filled broth that's full of butter (I know, unhealthy but whatever). It's worth it. Every last bit. And who in their right mind wouldn't love a chocolate covered strawberry at the end of a meal? 

Definitely coming back to try more combos of soups, salads and sandwiches."}
{"text":"Had to try this hot lunch spot in the cursed revolving door location on Eastern. At first glance, the long line out the door could deter anyone who has only an hour to spare for lunch. But the good part is the line moves very fast as they have the system down. It could seem a little chaotic ordering but let them direct you and use your time in line wisely to select your items. Fresh, made to order food on demand...I'm a fan!
I recommend the pick 2 combo for $7.99. We ordered the lobster bisque served with asiago cheese croutons, Asian BBQ pulled pork sandwich, Nuts about Berries salad and Tomato basil soup with orzo. 
The lobster bisque was chunky with vegetables and surprisingly good but no lobster meat in sight. The pulled pork sandwich was delicious. Crispy vegetables with sweet pulled pork on a soft bun. I would definitely get it again. The berries salad was fresh and lettuce was not wilted, yay. The tomato basil soup was sweet, creamy with a hint of spice that reminded me of curry.
I would have given 4 stars but I got a little sick after eating here. Not sure if it was the food or iced tea. In any event, I like the concept and the extensive menu selections. Will be back!"}
{"text":"I was hesitate trying this place in the beginning. But since I live so close to it. I decided to try it out. And I have to why didn't I try it earlier?!?! I have to admit I am not a soup, salad, or sandwhich person. But I do have to say your food is so fresh!! I am hooked on your chicken glazed salad! I also think the strawberry with chocolate is just added bonus to the meal."}
{"text":"Great food 
Can be healthy
the bus girl asked me if I was done with my plate.. She was nice but didn't expect it since this is a fast food kinda feel where when your done you get up and throw away your trash.. It was nice of her but to me it was kinda weird and I felt rushed. 
Other than that I like it. 
Lobster soups are BOMB!"}
{"text":"Visiting my sis in Sin City and this place was highly recommended. With so many sandwiches, salads and soup to choose from, this place is Soup Plantation on steroids. Everything sounds tasty like a gourmet item, so making a selection was difficult. Luckily, they allow you to sample the soups. Since it was late on a weekday, there werent many people in line. The staff was extremely patient as I sampled 6 different soups. When dining out I try to order things that aren't routine, leaning towards meals that are new for my pallet or things that I would not ordinarily cook. I was torn between a brothy soup or a chowder. The gal behind the counter recommended the cauliflower soup and once the cheesiness hit my taste buds I was sold! I paired that with the kale and quinoa salad. For $8.99, I was pleasantly surprised that it also came with bread and one large chocolate covered strawberry. The salad was hearty, with a good mix of fixins with just enough kale to goodies ratio. My sister ordered the crab avocado sandwich, which I had to sample. It was a delicious, on a warm panini bread and I'd order that next time. I am a Zupas head!"}
{"text":"Clam chowder was different but good I drank it.They need to start serving a dill pickle on the side with the sandwiches and that shit would be perfect. Turkey spinach artichoke panini was great and all but it was too small for me I was still hungry after so I went to McDonald's to get a filet o fish and hashbrown. Also I don't think I've ever seen such a small ass skimpy chocolate covered strawberry oh that's why they give them out for free I see"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I happened to drive by Cafe Zupas one day and give it a try. How good was it? We went back again the next day, and we live about 25 minutes away.

The Try 2 combo for $8 is probably your best bet with a choice of a full sandwich, a full salad, or a bowl (not cup) of soup. They have a big menu of options, or you can build your own (at least for the salads - maybe not the sandwiches). I've had about four different sandwiches, two salads, and tried four or five soups. It's all CRAZY good, and filling.

Along with your order, you get a piece of french bread and a chocolate covered strawberry. LOVE IT. They have desserts, too, and they are also super good. The salted caramel creme brulee is my favorite, and it's good to combine with a brownie (ultimate fat kid status right here). Even the drink bar has flavored syrups to jazz up your soda or tea. 

On top of high quality, tasty food, the staff is really friendly. They're so nice, they make In & Out employees look like jerks, which says a lot. I've only been to the Lake Mead & Buffalo location (there's one also off Eastern), but with how good this place is, I'd imagine they're all on point. 

GO TO HERE!"}
{"text":"With the exception of very friendly employees, Cafe Zupas fails in pretty much every category I can think of.  It's the cheap Paradise Bakery.  If you've read any of my Paradise Bakery reviews, you'd know that's not a compliment by any means.  Whomever dreamed up the concept of this quick service restaurant really didn't think things through.

The counter is a complete cluster.  There are monitors with videos playing that blocks the menu board.  So if you don't know what you want, you need to grab a paper menu.  Pretty awkward for a first timer.  Standing in a big group of people steering at menus also was an unexpected and uncomfortable experience.   I then ordered my sandwich and a salad at the left end of the counter, navigated my way around the people waiting for soups, past the dessert counter (desserts actually looked awesome, so I'd bet they were not made on sight), then to the registers.  Retold the order I just made but was still waiting on to the cashier.  Then I had a brief wait for my food at the register.  I usually am not a big fan of the take a number system.  But that would be very helpful at this place.  Also, some sort of a ticket to hand the cashier or a register at the same place you order would be nice as well.

The food wasn't very good.  The summer chicken salad was short on toppings.  Plenty of lettuce, a decent amount of fruit, but only a few pieces of chicken. The french bread from any nearby supermarket would have been tastier than what they offered on the side.  The chicken pesto panini wasn't very flavorful or filling.  While the entrees are cheap, you're going to have to shell out for the sides if you want a complete meal.

There are so many fast food options in the district of Desert Ridge Marketplace.  I suggest skipping Cafe Zupa.  The short walk to Paradise Bakery is worth it if you want a quick sandwich or salad.  (Did I really just say that?)"}
{"text":"I went to this place for lunch today with my friend. She had been there before. Everything sounded great to me but I ended up ordering the turkey spinach artichoke sandwich and Chipotle chicken salad. Both are amazing!! The pesto and melted cheese made the sandwich nice and creamy. The dressing for the salad was served on the side which I like. My meal also came with a bonus chocolate dipped strawberry. I would have given 4 stars if my strawberry was larger than a nickel. Haha"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I live no where near this Zuppas but I will go out of my way to go to this one because the staff is the best (especially Harry). I love their mango berry salad and their Turkey Bacon Avocado. This is definitely my favorite place to eat and not feel guilty. Keep up the awesome work guys. I'll see you soon!"}
{"text":"Boyfriend requested extra cheese fully aware it'd cost more, but was denied extra cheese altogether. There must be a muenster shortage."}
{"text":"I come here often quick bite to eat I usually get a soup and salad love the bread that comes with the food also the chocolate strawberry is always fresh they have an abundance of dessert options I love the chocolate brownie if you love chocolate this is the place to be. The fruit salad is always fresh also the mango dressing is amazing"}
{"text":"The food is delicious, filling, and relatively inexpensive (compared to other restaurants that do the soup, salad, and sandwich menu). The staff is very friendly and seem to genuinely enjoy working there and taking care of their customers. The place is clean and cozy. This is destined to become a regular stop for us for sure."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place today for the first time and the I ordered the Mushroom soup.  Not one employee knew what the ingredients were in the soup.  Unbelievable!  The soup tasted good but I didn't feel so well shortly afterwards.

I emailed Cafe Zupas asking them for the list of ingredients in the soup which \"Jen\" refused to share.  Evidently, Cafe Zupas is not the least bit concerned about people who have food allergies.  I explained to her that I am sensitive to dairy products and she directed me to their website that states 'cream'.  No mention of any other dairy ingredients.  Also, states \"special herbs\".  I guess they must mean marijuana, right?  I mean, what else could it possible be since there is no such thing as a \"special herb\"???

Needless to say, I will not be returning to this restaurant when they don't believe in transparency with their ingredients."}
{"text":"Amazing little soup/salad/sandwich place. I've driven by this place many times and had to try it out! 

I went with a friend and we both got the combo where you can pick two items out of a soup, salad, and sandwich for around $8. You order up front (got that Subway feel; you can see the workers whip up the food in front of you) and the workers are incredibly friendly! It took literally less than a minute to get our order. 

I got the Crab Avocado Melt and the Kale Quinoa Salad. The salad was tossed in a sweeter dressing with chopped kale, quinoa, pistachios, fresh blueberries, tomatoes, dried raspberries, and grated Parmesan on top. SO delicious and quite a large portion! The sandwich was deliciously cheesy and had crab salad, avocado and bacon in it. You also get a small baguette and a chocolate covered strawberry (nice touch) with the combo.

It was a great, filling lunch and less than $20 for two people. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Food is was ok, big problem I had was that they are pretty skimpy when creating own salad.   Got 4 croutons, which counted as 1 of my toppings along with apx. 5 strands of tiny bell peppers (which person picked out one by one) to add onto salad.   Would give a better rating, but my salad \"Lettuce with dressing\" was nothing special."}
{"text":"I used to love this place. My coworkers and I would eat here at least 3 times a week. Over the past 6 months the customer service has been terrible. we kept going back because the food was good. but lately they have been messing up orders as well as being extremely rude. if you ask for no tomatoes you get an eye roll from 3 people. we will not be eating here anymore. Ill try back in a few months to see if they have gotten new staff."}
{"text":"Amazing fresh food for a good price! Very fast, made in front of you, very friendly staff"}
{"text":"Requires further inspection...

Cafe Zupas is a hot-spot for lunch. Salads, sandwiches, and soups are the stars of the show. The strangely unsettling amount of customer-service is somewhat of a put-off, but not so much I wouldn't go back. The interior is nice enough with a lot of seating, booths and tables. 

I'm not thoroughly impressed because for one the salad I ordered failed completely on pretty much every level except for that fact that is was HUGE and way too much of it for me to eat in one sitting, especially since I had ordered a salad/soup combo. Combos are the way to go though, soup/salad, salad/sandwich, sandwich/soup, etc. 

Salad: Yucatan Chipotle Chicken Salad - served with a few strips of dried-out chicken breasts, olives, way too many tortilla strips, guacamole (that was spilling over the side of the bowl), a few black beans, a few olives, and a \"chipotle\" sauce, which did not taste like chipotle and did not add any flavor at all to the salad. Overall this salad is a huge let-down. Try a different salad other than this one.

Lobster Bisque - Decent enough soup, decent enough portion. I finished the soup, mainly because I wasn't thrilled with the salad. They have saltine crackers AND the cute little clam crackers available by the drink station for your soups. I though this soup was all right for the fact its Lobster Bisque at a quick dining spot. Others have complained of it being overly-sweet or not having enough lobster... but c'mon, it's not like you're sitting in a fine-dining establishment on the Strip. For what it is, it's good. I'd order it again.

Price-point - About the same as Panera Bread, but you are getting a bit more bang for your buck here in my opinion. A two-item combo and a fountain soda cost me a little over 10 bucks. 

I think I'll try again, solely based off the fact they have a really extensive menu and so many pairing options I am sure I am bound to find something that I really like."}
{"text":"Not a fan of this place.  It is loud, hard to walk down the isles (tables are really really close together), food is mediocre AT BEST and I feel like I am ordering at a school cafeteria.  Paradise Bakery has a similar set up to their restaurant, but the food is worth it.  It is usually busy, so some people must like it (it is affordable) -- but the food is very bland and lacks zest in my opinion.  No complaints about the staff though.  :)  

My friends like this place, but I just can not stand going here due to the food; I've tried it about 4 separate times. There are so, so, so many other more flavorful restaurants to go to in walking distance."}
{"text":"Wow large menu!  I chose the Kale and Quinoa salad and it was Good.  Dressing was light and the berries hit the spot.  Bonus they give you bread roll (but I had my carbs today) and chocolate covered strawberry...I ate it first.  The bakery is worth another trip for Belgium chocolate.  Get a LARGE drink because the infused water is fantastic...I tried them all!"}
{"text":"I thought this place was great but it is gone downhill I ordered the soup they barely filled up the container I asked him to fill it and they were rude then I got my salads and there was hardly anything in the container I said that the portion should be larger and they said you can call corporate with an attitude then they started giving me some free stuff and they put the paper right on top of my salad I got them please remove the paper from on top of my salad they took it out with an attitude put it in the bag and shoved it in my face I'll never go back $26 for two teeny little salad and two cold soups went across the street to Jack In The Box had two tacos and love them"}
{"text":"This is a great soup, salad, and sandwich cafe. I really like their cauliflower soup and my husband and I both love the honey bacon club sandwich. We have always had great service and it's always clean! This time we came for dinner and decided last second we actually needed it to go and they were willing to help with packing it up to go rather than just giving us the materials to do it ourselves."}
{"text":"Cafe Zupas is the best. I almost always get a sandwich and the lobster bisque but the salads are great too."}
{"text":"Love all of their soups... Lobster with Red Peppers is my favorite followed by the Mushroom bisque as my 2nd fav! Sandwiches are pretty good too and love the fact that they give you a nice free little strawberry dipped desert on each order. Prices are just a little too high for being almost like a fast food joint but then again, it's healthy stuff so they kinda compensate in a way."}
{"text":"I really like Zupas sandwich I always get this catered to my work and I love their chocolate dipped strawberries and their half dipped chocolate chip cookies. Their salads are also really good"}
{"text":"I come in here fairly often, but coming in earlier was a different story. Usually staff is pretty friendly, even though they are a little rushy towards customers when you walk in. I came in during a little bit of a rush for my lunch break from my school nearby, and waited in line until I got to the front where you order salads or sandwiches. I ordered my sandwich and wanted soup that day, so I waited in line until I got to soups. 

The first person in the ordering line with a green shirt whose name tag I caught said Taryn, was showing absolute poor professionalism to one of her co-workers in a black shirt whose name I didn't catch. The way she was speaking to her co-worker in front of customers and their other co-workers was like she was humiliating her. It was as if she was showing her or telling her to do something but in a satirical, mocking way. It was completely unprofessional. The smug look on her face showed that she knew what she was doing. The poor girl looked like it was really bothering her, but still continued to smile and ask how I was. I wanted to say something for her to the bully in the green! 

I am a student nurse and I have compassion for others. Yes they have good food and good service to customers, but treating your staff poorly is enough for me to stop going to this location. And if I see it at another, I would happily stop going here altogether. Looking back at it now, I wish I would have spoken to a manager. Or if that woman was the manager, spoken to someone higher. You can't even tip the kids cleaning up trash and checking on you - that's sad and is a poor reflection on the culture. Terrible.

Treat your employees with respect, we can see and hear you and my classmates (who eat here as much as I do), agree with me. We will be returning to another location!"}
{"text":"The food is ok, but the portions are TINY and they are so stingy with everything and the staff is unpleasant about it. For the price, it's a TERRIBLE deal. If you want to leave somewhere hungry, this is your place."}
{"text":"I really wanted soup tonight, and this was the place. I liked my soup, but it really wasn't anything to write home about. I wanted something \"low cal\" so I went with the Tuscan White Bean, because everything else was heavy cream based. It was Just so so. My husbands Lobster Bisque wasn't hot enough and the over all feeling of the place was canned. The staff didn't greet us as we walked in & they were not busy. We didn't really know where to start ordering and not one person offered to assist us. So like I said. I guess I wanted soup tonight, but next time I guess I'll just heat up a can of Amy's"}
{"text":"Food is okay. Service is sketchy, they always mess up at the end. Why do i need to tell you what i ordered several times? Just not a good system."}
{"text":"First time for this place, which I've been meaning to try for quite a while now.  During the week they close too early for us (9:00 p.m.), and on weekends I usually like a place with sit-down service and a bar.  But we were nearby when we started thinking about a quick dinner, and it was earlier than we usually eat.

I chose a combo, the turkey spinach artichoke panini, with a cherry balsamic half-salad, but I had them substitute cranberries for the dried cherries.  My +1 got a turkey avocado bacon, along with a large Yucatan chicken tortilla soup.  We took the tray to the back room, but the many available booths all had dirty tables, so we sat at a regular table.  

My husband's soup bowl was only half-full.  Oh, it had a lot of stuff in it, and way too many tortilla strips, but jeez, how much does the broth cost?  I suggested he go back and ask for more broth.  To their credit they didn't add to the bowl, but gave him an additional bowl that had almost as much as the first one, so I got to have some, too.  It had a lot of chicken, along with corn, onions, tomatoes, and a dollop of guacamole.  It could have used more spice and fewer tortilla strips, but was very tasty and a whole lot lighter than their cream soups.

We decided to share the sandwiches, and they were both very good, but I liked mine better.  Duh, that's why I ordered it, so what was I thinking??

By the time I finished the soup and my half-sandwich I was full, so I took the salad home, knowing that I'd be hungry later from having eaten too early and staying up too late.  The half-salad was enough to share between the two of us for a snack.  Fresh salad, grapes, goat cheese, and nuts - yum!  The balsamic dressing was very thick and too sweet, so I'd get a different dressing next time.

The chocolate-covered strawberry and the baguette slice are a nice additional touch, and both have been saved for future noshing.  Another nice touch is the availability of Italian soda flavorings for adding to fountain drinks.  We didn't partake, because all I ever drink is coffee and booze ;)  We never get soda at places like this.

I'll definitely return to Zupa's.  It's great for fresh food at decent prices, with quick service."}
{"text":"The food would be good but they cheat you on the salad.  If you ask for chicken, they scoop 1 tablespoon and shake 1/3 off.  The same thing happens with the cheese.  If you ask for tomatoes you get 5 halves of grape tomatoes, which is 2 1/2 grape tomatoes.  WOW!"}
{"text":"Tried the Grilled Cheese, UMMMM O YA!!! With the Mushroom Soup And Pistachio Pudding/Mousse, The People there are so Nice and Upbeat, Only Sucky Thing was It was super busy in the parking lot & I  had to park almost across the street. I love the place so that was no Problem, it was just a 110 degrees outside, Just wish they had more parking for customers =)"}
{"text":"I usually go the Zupas in Mesa, but was in the North Phoenix area for shopping, so went to the Desert Ridge location. I ordered the Roasted Veggie and Quinoa soup. It tasted delicious, but it was pretty much a bowl of broth. There was hardly anything resembling a vegetable or quinoa in it! I took the bowl back up to the counter and was told, \"That's normal, it's mostly a broth based soup.\" Well, I'll tell you something, I don't appreciate paying $5 for a bowl of broth. I don't appreciate being told that the inferior product which does not in any way resemble the photo on the menu is correct. If this is really how this soup is supposed to be, Zupas is ripping off their customers."}
{"text":"I ate here today and really enjoyed the cauliflower soup and chicken pesto panini. All was fresh and made right in front of you. My only complaint was that the location isn't large enough for the amount of people who try to eat there. Seating is limited. They almost need an area twice the size with a large outdoor area. I will definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"I missed the grand opening for this place a few weeks ago, so I was happy to finally try it for lunch the other day.

I really like the location. It is really close to the corner of Buffalo/Lake Mead and there is lots of shopping in that area. This will be a great lunch spot if you're in that area.

When you walk in, you grab a menu, and once you decide (they will give you samples if you need help) you jump in line and order. Think upscale cafeteria! There are lots of soups, salads, and sandwiches to choose from. I was surprised at the of the menu because I was expecting it to be a very plain Jane menu. It wasn't! We ordered a BBQ pulled pork, a turkey cranberry, and chicken enchilada chili. All were delicious. 

I really wanted dessert, but I resisted. They had amazing looking brownies and crème brulees! Every order comes with a chocolate covered strawberry!!

After you pay, you take your tray and seat yourself. They have an area with different syrups that you can add into your soda or ice tea, but I didn't try them. I thought it was a nice touch, though and it is free.

I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I have been loving this place! The California Protein Cobb is my favorite salad! The pick two combo is a great deal. It has more than enough food and the chocolate covered strawberry is a nice touch."}
{"text":"This place exceeded my expectations I was a little hesitant due to the low reviews. Glad I ignored it and went anyways. I had the ultimate grilled cheese and roasted red pepper& lobster soup. The grilled cheese was exceptional and the soup equally as good. I will definitely be going back. The Resturant had a long line which made me nervous. Everyone was friendly and it went quick!!"}
{"text":"I love this place , all of their sandwiches are so good !! Their bread rolls are so soft and the lobster bisque is my favorite soup!!! They also give you chocolate covered strawberries with your meal!! The establishment is super clean and the staff is super friendly !!!"}
{"text":"Supa Zupas! Ok enough of that. Went the other day for lunch, and the staff handled a relatively large crowed with ease and efficiency. I like that food is made to order and that their lunch meat is not over processed. I was expecting the salad and soup combo to be a smaller version half and half, but it was the WHOLE thing. That is amazing for the price and it is decent fare. 
Enjoyed the Italian Soda mix in's. But, as someone else said fresh brewed iced tea would be nice.  This is a great location for them and I see that they have ventured into something that just may stick in a strip mall back corner....we shall see.
Oh and ask for a chocolate covered strawberry they are awesome!
A tiny notch down from Wildflower or Nordstroms Cafe (why the 4 star)...but a good soup, salad, sammi place none the less."}
{"text":"Love the friendly staff at this Cafe Zupas! Everyone was beyond helpful! I was greeted by at least 2 members as I walked through the door!

This place isn't out of the ordinary, soup, sandwich and salad with a 2 pick option. 
Unsure about a soup? Ask for a sample!"}
{"text":"I wish they have Cafe Zapas in Southern California! We wanted a light dinner and found this place of Yelp. We were super impressed with the over-the-top helpfulness and energetic staff. The menu looks great and everything was reasonably priced. We both ordered a soup and sandwich combo to-go. Everything was nicely presented, even in a takeout box. I LOVE my mushroom bisque and my fiancé really liked his lobster bisque. I haven't tried my honey bacon club yet because I'm stuffed from the soup and bread. My fiancé liked his California club very much also.

The desserts looked amazing, but we rekunctabtly walked away with ordering any... Although we were greatly surprised when we found two chocolate covered strawberries in our takeout order!

We would definitely come here again. The salads sound amazing so that is what I will try if there is a next time."}
{"text":"Just ate at the Chandler location. The food is AWESOME.  I just love the Mushroom Bisque. But it was sooooo slow!!  When I walked in there was a long line, I asked the girl handing out menus at the door how long the wait was, she said \"I just clocked it and it is 4 minutes\" well she needed to add 20 minutes on to that time.   The veggies, meats, soups etc are prepped.  Just place some greens in a bowl, add toppings and BAM you have a salad.  A few people in front of me had to send back their orders becuase they were constantly wrong. When I finally got to the check out I asked if I could phone my order in and I was informed hopefully in August that will be up and running for phone/on line orders.  I have eaten at the Mesa and Scottsdale as well and the service was not this slow.   I will be back........ in a few months.  Hopefully they will have worked out all their 'issues' in the meantime Jimmy Johns is right across the way and they are 'Freakishly Fast'"}
{"text":"This place is great. Harty soups and sandwiches. I also really love the beverage bar with special teas and syrups to enhance your drink"}
{"text":"Well Cafe Zupas has officially LOST my patronage (and I eat here a LOT!).  Tried to order our lunches as normal for the office and the guy had me move to the 2nd register for a gal to take my orders and said next time just go there so I didn't have to wait in line. So I did and the girl said it would be an hour wait before she could even start my order. I said fine... I will go back to the line and handle it there and she told me that would not work as the orders would get lost. I bet if our happy asses were standing in line this wouldn't be a problem. No different and you would have made good money! ...BYE FELICIA!"}
{"text":"Little on the expensive side, but I usually don't paying more $$ for good food and good ingredients. Usually don't have any complaints when I go there. However 2 things from my trip this evening. On the California Cobb the guac scoops are WAY too small for a large salad I kind of expect at least two scoops. That's just being nit picky I guess but I want what I pay for. 

Second, soups are way too salty. I want to go here to eat healthy, not to drink sodium."}
{"text":"The food is very good.  When ever we travel to Vegas it is a must stop.  The BBC chicken salad is great.   Very reasonable prices.  Helpful staff. Lots of caffeine free choices of beverages."}
{"text":"We love the soups and sandwiches. Kids pick this place time after time. It is consistent and we love the variety. The featured soups are alway nice to try but somehow we all love the enchilada soup"}
{"text":"First time here!!!  So it's a soup and salad place that serves panini sandwiches.  I was really looking forward to a chicken Caesar salad!!!  No Caesar dressing offered.  I got a second option with the recommended Italian style dressing.  While the dressing was jus \"ok\" for my standards.  I asked about soup and salad combo and went with that.  The clam chowder was the \"soup\" style and not the creamy traditional clam chowder.  While everything was very fresh, it just didn't do it for me.  This was a buffet style ordering and seemed very rushed....  I don't know.....  Just not a place for me."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place because some of my favorite foods are soups, and salads, and sandwiches! But, (and that's a big but)....I had a bad overall experience there tonight. We tried to take our family through the order line, but it was just too chaotic with all of the different options. They screwed up two out of the four kids meals and one had to wait for her food for nearly ten minutes after we had started eating. The staff seemed overwhelmed and let other people through the line in front of us. Also, the staff were getting after each other because there were a couple of other large groups all together and orders weren't being put together correctly. I hate to see this kind of stuff going on when I am out to dinner.

The Food: To me, most of the soups taste similarly....not like they are bad, but it really seems like they are all based on the same cream base with just a different theme. Also, the salads all seem very similar. Greens, berries, nuts, etc-just different nationalities assigned to each one. Not bad at all, but they are all just different green salads. Sandwiches: The first time I went there (sans kids) I got a pesto chicken panini and it was good-that's it.

There are a lot of problems with the ordering line. Just getting through the hassle of the line is bad enough, but my kids' food was not right (I think they actually screwed up my order about five different ways), they added some else's order to my bill and then some lady came up to the register and totally interrupted"}
{"text":"After practically running out of Twin Peaks (in the same plaza), we tried this place instead. We loved it. 

If you had to compare it to something, the closest I'd say is Paradise Bakery. Differences: large and creative dessert selection, better soup selections too. The desserts aren't bakery style, most of the offerings were brulee, mousse, and fruit tarts. It has more lighting and modern feel to it as well. 

The sandwich offerings are pretty similar. The only reason I gave it four stars is the turkey cranberry sandwich I had was great, but the cucumber on it made a bit of an odd combination. Also the chocolate hazelnut brulee was more like a mousse, but still delicious (and very rich).

It was pretty slow most of while we were there, the staff were very friendly and everything was clean. We're looking forward to eating here again."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible experience at this location.  The staff moves very slowly when preparing order, you have to repeat your order again at the register after ordering.  The restaurant is FILTHY.  Crumbs and food all over the table, seat, and floors.  Asked restaurant to clean table and they just wiped the food onto the floor and chair and left it.  Didn't even dry the the table, was soaking wet.  Highly do not recommend this location."}
{"text":"It would be difficult to find a better chain restaurant in the area that serves delicious healthy dishes! I used to order soups and breads here all the time, but I have changed my eating habits I now mostly eat roughage and fruits. The food here is so tasty and beautifully presented. I love the sweet attention like the chocolate strawberry for dessert. Totally delectable! Today I went to Cafe Zupas for lunch to try something new and ordered the vegetarian avocado sandwich and the very berry salad with cinnamon almonds. Yummy!  Totally exceeded my expectations. Take that True Food Kitchen! The service was very nice as well, and the space is comfortable. :)"}
{"text":"We frequent this place!! Love it! Just wish they were more consistent. This visit the chicken in the salad was frozen. Wasn't able to eat. Hopefully next visit will be better"}
{"text":"We loved this place! The food is excellent and super fast, it's perfect if you're on the go. Sierra was especially helpful in making sure our order was perfect. We will definitely be returning! There was a mistake with one of our sandwiches and when we asked about it, Sierra went well out of her way to make sure everything was taken car of and that we were satisfied. She even asked us if there was anything she could do to make it right and she didn't even take our order to begin with!"}
{"text":"Very fresh and delicious.   A wonderful menu....tons of healthy choices.   I got the sandwich/soup combo.  White been soup was delicious.... and the turkey bacon avocado sandwich...hold the bacon.  Very tasty.

The soda/ice tea drinks are many.

Everyone who worked there were happy and helpful.  Fresh cool interior design."}
{"text":"First the food:  The soups are amazing.  Two things I hate are mushrooms and cauliflower so naturally I ordered the combo with two soups - wild mushroom bisque and Wisconsin cauliflower.  The bisque made an explosion of happy flavor with colorful notes of sherry and, if I am not mistaken, real butter.  Wisconsin cauliflower has cheese, maybe bacon, onion, etc.  What you won't believe is how light and creamy it is.  The flavor is light and subtle.  

The service:  This branch seemed to be operated by a young person.  Going through the line forces too many questions.  I want to be able to say what I want once, get it, pay, sit down and eat.  The cleanliness was only so-so.  This was my third visit to the place.  The first time there was a panhandler outside going up to every customer on their way in.  The women with children were clearly uncomfortable.  The second day was a Sunday afternoon for lunch -closed!?"}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times.  Soups are good but there is no rotation.  Always the same soups.

I tried almost every sandwich and they better than average but sometimes hit and miss.  They are small in size but big in taste.  I love the honey cilantro carnitas.  The kids order the ultimate grilled cheese and the wife swears by the nuts and berries salad.

I don't usually purchase drinks as I just drink water and beer but I like their fruit infused drinks.  

Desserts are one of the highlights here as they give free chocolate dipped strawberries and the display case has a good selection of other sweets."}
{"text":"Sandwiches were trash fam. The salads and juices were on point doe. It's like if paradise bakery, kneaders, and Panera bread had a threeway and Zupas was the unwanted offspring."}
{"text":"This place is sooo good. Its an easy ordering process and the prices are very reasonable. I got the Honey Cilantro Carnitas sandwich and it was delicious. Fresh bread made in house and the sauce was flavorful. They also give you a chocolate covered strawberry on the side. The atmosphere is casual and family friendly. The service is great. Everyone behind the counter is extremely nice. I would definitely recommend this place for lunch."}
{"text":"The staff was very friendly and accommodating. There was an excellent variety of soups, salads and Panini sandwiches. The food was all delicious and every item tasted very fresh. I would definitely go back again for a light refreshing meal that isn't too much but not too little."}
{"text":"I was in the area with my wife and wanted something light and fast so we decided to stop in here and check it out. They have so many things to choose from and something for everybody. I am a vegetarian and their vegetarian sandwich was probably the best one I've had in a really long time. It was a cold sandwich with sprouts, cucumbers, tomato and a homemade basil pesto. My wife had a chicken mango salad and it was pretty awesome as well. The staff was very friendly and inviting. The BEST part of the meal was the Berry Creme Brûlée. They make all their dressings in house and desserts every morning. Definitely worth trying."}
{"text":"I tried Zupas with my son yesterday, I was expecting a mediocre experience but instead I was AMAZED! 
In fact I was so amazed we returned the next day, since I began this review I have been there four times. Still great and consistent. 
First the restaurant is clean, the staff is very professional and friendly, then the great food. The price is VERY REASONABLE and you get fresh, quality food. On all my visits I have tried a new salad and sandwich but always get the Wisconsin Cauliflower Cheese soup. So far my favorite sandwich is the BBQ pulled pork, the bread was fresh and soft, pork juicy and tender, sauce tangy and sweet, vegetables fresh. My favorite salad has been the Chicken Maui, the pineapple vinaigrette is the best dressing I have ever had, also comes with chunks of pineapple, mango, coconut, and macadamia nuts. 
I recommend this place if you are looking for a fresh healthy salad, sandwich, and soup. I also recommend the cheesecake, it was in my top five cheesecakes of all time."}
{"text":"I have been here before and had this same experience. They like to only fill the cup up a little over halfway. So now every time I stop in there I have to watch them like a hawk and ask them to fill until it's almost to the top.  My husband stopped to get soup for us today and I forgot to tell him, and when he came home he had a small chicken tortilla and it was only halfway full.  He got charged full price. This is a big problem with this establishment. It's not what I would consider cheap food and yet they skimp anywhere they can. Tomato basil with orzo means you get about five pieces of orzo with your soup. Very unhappy with today's order."}
{"text":"I went with a friend late last night who was wanting some dinner.  Being that I had already ate earlier I chose to just have a bowl of soup.  If you have never been here before, you walk in and there is a counter covered in glass, you can look but not touch.  

The staff are very friendly and will help you every step of the way.  There is a pretty good selection of salads, they have several soups (10) choices, sandwiches as some desert.  Like I said I opted for just a bowl of soup which to my surprise came with bread and a somewhat chocolate covered strawberry; well the tip of the strawberry had chocolate on it.

Overall it was good, my friend has been here several times and really likes it.  I would really love it if everything was organic but its not, however this place still puts out some great food for eating in or taking home.

There is plenty of seating and they even have free wifi and a charging bar for your devices with a plug and two usb outlets in about 5 different spots.  Definitely a place you can come with your laptop and just hang for a while.  It is comfortable, warm and the staff make it very inviting."}
{"text":"The staff makes this place. They're always very friendly and you can tell they enjoy their job.

Zupas has some of the best paninis around. I tend to gravitate to the grilled cheese they have and the WI cauliflower soup. Everything has a great rich quality to it and is made with fresh ingredients. However.. The deserts people. GET ONE. It tops it all off as one of my favorite places to go when a soup and sandwich is what I'm craving.

Oh and their salads. Also just as amazing."}
{"text":"Solid little gem in the Chandler mall area. Parking can be hard to find but worth it to find a spot.  They have awesome sandwich, salad, and soup options to satisfy your craving. I love the roasted red pepper lobster bisque and their veggie sandwich. The line moves quickly, they have awesome fresh teas on tap, and there is plenty of seating. You will likely spend at least $9-12 her per person for lunch if you do the 1/2 and 1/2 combo with a drink but I always leave stuffed."}
{"text":"I am not a fan of this location just because the parking is awful, but if you find a spot it is worth your time. They have awesome sandwich, salad, and soup options to satisfy your craving. I love the roasted red pepper lobster bisque and their veggie sandwich. The line moves quickly, they have awesome fresh teas on tap, and there is plenty of seating. You will likely spend at least $9-12 her per person for lunch if you do the 1/2 and 1/2 combo with a drink but I always leave stuffed."}
{"text":"My go to combo is sandwich + soup! Just order your food and it'll be out in no time! Quick and convenient!"}
{"text":"Used to go to Zupas when it first opened Ebro nice and friendly. Nice sized portions. Went today service sucked. Portion size smaller. It's cold and raining here,freeing inside Zupas. Good didn't taste as good and my mother found a hair in her soup, they said oops we'll give you more soup.. how about no because I found hair in my soup so I don't want the same soup.  Yuck. No other compensation offered. Charging extra for things that used to come with your order. 
Definitely never going back."}
{"text":"Fresh, healthy choices?  Yes
Stingy on the toppings? YES!  
Friendly staff? No!

They have a recharge bar to sit at for your phones/iPads etc. Very clean too.

Overall we are VERY turned off at how stingy they are with the toppings. The prices aren't cheap and we feel we should get what we pay for.  Addressing it with managers has only made it worse."}
{"text":"The soup was good and I had a panini..everything was great and staff where friendly.  Pricing is normal. Good job guys."}
{"text":"Wow I don't know how I didn't try this place sooner! I recently came here with my parents since my mom was raving about one of the soups that she had. I'm always down for anything so I figured why not try it out.

When you walk in you order at the counter and they prepare everything right in front of you. You're also able to sample the soups before you decide on a flavor which is nice. I chose to go with the Turkey Spinach Avocado (TSA) sandwich and the red pepper lobster bisque. The meal also came with a complementary roll and chocolate covered strawberry. Um yes please! 

Overall the food was great! I loved the soup and the sandwich was mad decent too. I also love all their unique drink choices. I had the pomegranate coconut green tea which was very refreshing and delicious. They also had a few other flavored iced teas and lemonades.

I can't wait to try literally every soup here as well as the whole rest of the menu. Goodbye Panera, hello Zupas!"}
{"text":"I really wanted it to be good. I love the concept behind what they do. I love the menu. But the sandwich I got tasted like the worst deli meat ever. I got the turkey club which had only 3 slices of this crap meat.  Chicken looked likethe same chicken as subway. Nasty. Stick to the soups and salads."}
{"text":"I find it annoying to have to repeat your order 4 or 5 times. I mean at each station you have to repeat it. 
Esp if you are ordering for more than one person. 
There just has to be a better way to run it. 

The food is good however I'm not a fan of their chicken they put in the salads."}
{"text":"Just opened and used a 50 percent off coupon from the mail. Very good salads, soup and sandwiches. Similar to Paradise café except now that Paradise is owned by Panera bread the quality and variety is going down hill in my opinion. Zupas gives you a chocolate dipped strawberry with your meal. I will go back to try other menu items soon."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times pre-Yelp. In review, this place is a nice change from the greasy, fast food joints that are close by. The prices are great, the establishment is clean, but the employees are a little too eager to help.

We came in last night and were only half way in and the girl behind the counter wanted our order (literally). \"Slow down salad girl.\" My wife had a salad and I had a salad and sandwich combo. As soon as we ordered they whisked away making it. My wife realized they were making her a half salad and she wanted a full. She mentioned it, so they threw the first salad away and made a new one. So point being, make sure you order correctly because they have no qualms about wasting food (it's their \"policy\", as they told us).

Overall, we got fast, friendly service of mediocre food. It just didn't seem as fresh this time and the food looked to be made in a hurry."}
{"text":"I really like Zupas.  I have only ever gotten their Combo which is a full sandwich plus a half soup or half salad.  I love their soup, especially Mushroom.  So when my wife and I went today, I thought I would try a salad.  My wife got the Combo of a full sandwich and a half salad.  But I got the Full Salad, which costs more and is labeled \"Full\" which I interpreted as 
double what the half salad is.  We ordered the same exact salad and they were side-by-side on the tray.  I was very disappointed to see that my Full Salad was nowhere near double my wife's Half Salad...in fact it wasn't much bigger at all.  From what I could tell, all they really did is make a slightly bigger salad and put it in a bigger bowl.  I wish I had taken a picture.  I looked at the cashier and asked \"THAT'S a full salad?\" pointing to mine, and she said \"Yep!\" and that was it.  Although I loved the taste of the salad, it did not fill me up...probably because it was not a Full Salad.  Disappointed but the next time we go I'll have to stick with the soup."}
{"text":"I could have easily given this place 4 stars for the soup alone.  I'm not a fan of most of their sandwiches, due to using cold lunch meat slices.  This trip blew it for me, starting with soured and spoiled iced tea. I mean, it even stunk it was so sour.  I mentioned it to Nate, who was bussing tables and he just ignored it.  Then mentioned it to the girl behind the counter, which Nate overheard, and he rolled his eyes at me.  At the end of my meal, I tried the tea again, thinking maybe it had been remade.  Nope! Still sour.  I mentioned it to Nate again, and he got very argumentative, and defensive.  Started throwing his hands in the air and telling me that the tea is just fine.  I then asked him to get a manager, at which he started to argue about that too.  I then asked for less attitude, and he threw his hands in the air again.  Finally, a manager comes out.  She was appropriate, nice and apologized, and offered a complimentary soup to go.  They finally decided to make some fresh tea.  Hopefully Nate will learn to grow up and handle customers as a professional, or maybe he needs to find do another line of work.  At this point, it really is questionable if I'll be back.  I was quite offended."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times and gotta say the overall experience is quite good. Their salad/soup/sandwich combo thingy is a good deal and the people that work there are friendly and honest. This location is a good place to grab a quick bite or even a good place to sit and chat with a friend. They won't chase you out. 
With so many sandwich type places here in phx, this location is is a good spot to visit."}
{"text":"For years I've been looking for a place to eat that I could consider healthy.  I work right next to this location and have seen the \"Coming Soon\" sign for a while.  When it finally opened, it took me a while but I finally tried. it.

When you first walk in, the staff is beyond nice.  I was the only one in there when they first opened, but was greeted by literally, 10 people.  I even made a comment about everyone being there. I felt like a King!

Never have eaten here, I asked what was popular and what was good.  The girl  was great because when i said \"its ok to be honest..\" She was.   She recommended a salad and said I could customize to how I wanted.  There's a place in Chandler that I loved and I recreated the same salad from that place.

She nailed it.

The salad was perfect and when you go pay for your food they even throw a chocolate covered strawberry in with your meal.  How cool is that?

My only beef with the place.. and actually it's not the place is that it tends to bring in the snobby people in.   I had a near bump in with some guy who had placed is cup in front of me.. I had no idea it was there and said excuse me.  He grunted and gave me this look.  Wow.. ok man.  Chill out.

So if you want great sandwiches and salads.  I highly recommend Cafe Zupas.  Love this place and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"They use deli meat that's pre-processed for their sandwiches.  That's too bad.  Otherwise, the food is decent for the price."}
{"text":"I went w/ a friend for grand opening (we had a 50% coupon dine in only)
Staff is extremely friendly which is great and were so helpful in getting us highchairs for the kiddos. You do wait in line for your order and then take it to table when ready. They moved really quickly. Its kind of like paradise bakery in that you go thru the line cafeteria style, but they were much quicker w/ making the sandwiches. I had the Vegetarian Sandwich and the Tomato soup w/ Orzo. The bread was very soft and fresh as well as the rest of the ingredients, but I feel that they were really skimpy w/ the veggies :( Especially w/ a veggie sandwich I want A LOT of veggies, but it was a very thin, 1 layer of sprouts and cucumber and bell peppers. Hope they change that up a bit. The soup was very yummy though. Their combo comes w/ a whole sandwich and cup of soup, but it was a large bowl of soup so good value for money PLUS you get a chocolate covered strawberry w/ meal!! I saw an employee dipping them in the back through the glass (yummy!!) I would have given 3.5 stars, but I don't think you can."}
{"text":"Cafe Zupas' debut into the Vegas Valley from its SLC roots finally happened this week!  They are also opening a Summerlin location soon.  The space is on the north edge of the shopping center at Richmar and Eastern, on the same side as Red Mango and Popped, next to Republic.

They are known for Soups, Salads, and Sandwiches, with soups scratch made daily and a window into the kitchen.  Today the place was packed with ladies lunching and lots of happy children.  The space is very bright and there were staff welcoming us every step of the way.  I had lunch here with Randal R.  We both did the you pick 2 combo, which is a choice of 2 from: whole sandwich, half salad, soup.  He got the Asian BBQ pork sandwich and I am not sure what else.  I got the Thai mango chicken salad and the Yucatan Chicken Soup.  

The salad ingredients are FRESH and separated and it is assembled in front of you.  A chorus of \"Thai Mango\" from each person down the line greeted me.  I did not pay enough attention to the menu until later so you can create your own salad, which will be fun for next time.

There are many salad creations, soups, and sandwiches suggested though.  I was also able to sample soups before picking one.  The Yucatan chicken soup was flavorful but a tad too salty.  I still got it because it came with free optional toppings: GUACAMOLE, lime, and tortilla strips.  Free guac?  Yes please!

The salad was DEEEElicious.  Fresh mango, thin grilled chicken (cold), crisp lettuce, wonton strips, light drizzle of peanut dressing...I definitely would order it again.  I also got passionfruit-mango iced tea - there is a cute \"Italian soda syrup bar\" with recipes to help patrons create flavors with the soda fountain.  Also, there is a hot sauce collection (Blair's Death, Dave's Insanity, etc.) so that is a nice touch.  Overall, friendly staff, fresh made food, lots of options, and very affordable.  Every order got a small piece of fresh baked bread and a chocolate-dipped strawberry!!!  Combo is $7.99, takes credit cards."}
{"text":"I rarely give 5 stars. .so this is a treat.  Let me tell you the crab melt along with the Caribbean salad was so delicious I felt guilty eating it.
If you're like me, don't believe it till you try it...you won't regret it.
Service is always excellent."}
{"text":"So I try to place an order by phone and after 5 minutes of dealing with someone who did not know how to enter the order, I get passed off to another employee who tells me it will be faster if I just come in and wait in line.

I guess they aren't interested in take out business.  Hopefully the management reads this and trains the employees on how to accept orders over the phone."}
{"text":"I visited Cafe Zupas for the first time this week after hearing the great reviews. I give it 4 stars because it does have the chain restaurant feel to it. Everyone was extremely friendly and helpful. I ordered the combo with a soup and sandwich.. I chose the lobster bisque and a grilled cheese. They both were OK. I like that I can come here and order lobster bisque whenever I want.. it's hard to find in AZ but it's not super great lol. The grilled cheese was ok too.. my cheese wasn't melted and the sandwich was a little burnt on the outside(as if they put a frozen sandwich in the panini maker). Anyway, as I said everything was OK. They do have a cell phone charging bar which is a nice touch. I will be back to try the other selections but definitely Try it for yourself since everyone's pallets are different. :)"}
{"text":"I love the chicken enchilada chili soup and the mango berry salad. I"}
{"text":"Ok so I think I may have reviewed the Arrowhead location before and it was not that great of an experience. Fast forward a few years, I received a gift card from my work so decided to give it a go close to my home. Tortilla soup, delicious! Chicken chopped salad actually I would have liked a little more dressing but it was still very good. My son got the enchilada soup, I had to try it and wow tastes just like cheese enchiladas, the honey bacon club sandwich was ok, wasn't too crazy about it but in all fairness I'm really not that crazy about sandwiches to begin with. I still feel like ordering is a little overwhelming it's an assembly line and moves fast so you really gotta now what you want. I think if I knew the menu it would be smooth sailing but I felt like I was holding up the line in all honesty I don't know the menu or really how the process works... I think it's a nice touch that they give you bread and a chocolate covered strawberry. It's a nice change from your typical fast food, something you don't feel guilty about. I wouldn't say I wouldn't come back because the food is good... it's not really a place my kid enjoys but he's hard wired into the typical fast food places."}
{"text":"Well it was my first time here.... An employee opened the door for us which seemed like it annoyed her that I was looking at the menu that was outside, we walk in still looking at the menu and was asked for us to order I felt really rushed, and confused on how to order. I ordered the turkey bacon avocado sandwich which I tried really hard to at least semi enjoy it but it was gross. I also ordered the summer chicken salad which was actually good. My son ordered the grilled cheese and he took one bite and refused to eat the rest stating it tasted funny... Which my kid can be a picky eater but a grilled cheese? I didn't particularly  care for the environment it was kind of cluttered together in my opinion. I liked the salad but not enough to go back...  Arrowhead location"}
{"text":"This location has gone downhill. Went there tonight and it was a hot mess. Tables weren't clean and the chairs were so filthy, like they hadn't been wiped down in days. It's so gross to feel dried caked on food when your pulling out your chair to sit down. The bathroom was a disaster. The paper towels were jammed. Our soup was luke warm and our salads were just ok. I loved coming here when it first opened but I don't think I'll be back again."}
{"text":"went in tonight for a first time visit .
was a bit shocked that it cost me 13.00 for a salad and soup
but OMG SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO worth it!!!!!!
the salads are huge and so damn good you dont need dressing 
wow why didnt i try this place earlier......
excellent and tasty"}
{"text":"I was excited about this restaurant opening.  I couldn't wait to try the soups. What a disappointment. No flavor at all. I had Red pepper lobster soup and a chop salad. Poor quality and small portions.  The soup cup was less than 3/4 full. I also ordered  the Chicken Enchilada soup it was flavorless and lacked any Mexican spice. My friend ordered a Italian club panini and tomato basil soup. The panini was ok, nothing to make it great, but the soup was too sweet and had a funny taste to it. If these soups are made from scratch they really need to initiate a quality check program.  Definitely not going back to Cafe Zupa again."}
{"text":"So the people are rude.    They messed up my order & when I ask my money back.   They don't want to give it back.   I will never eat here again.       This is the place for you if you want to dirty place."}
{"text":"If you're looking for quality and quick salads, soups, and sandwiches Cafe Zupas is a go to spot! Everything is made fresh to order, which I love! You can do a \"pick two\" and get is for about $9. Plus, you get a slice of bread and a chocolate dipped strawberry if your combo didn't fill you up! It's a great environment to grab a quick bite and if you want desserts they always have these mouth-watering brownies that will just stare you down at the register!

The location is prime too! It's just off the 215 and Rainbow and during lunch and dinner it gets pretty busy down there. But for me it's the perfect place to go to if I want something semi-healthy after the gym!"}
{"text":"We've eaten here many times. This time we ordered 5 Togo orders.

This time I tried the clam chowder. It was ok. But as soon as I finished it. I ended with with a bad stomach ache. I had to visit bathroom twice. No one else ate clam chowder but me. I enjoy the sandwiches and salad. Maybe I'll stay away from the clam chowder. My wife and mom enjoy coming here. 

In the past I remember someone telling about getting sick from Cafe Zupas."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Went for lunch with my husband. We had no idea what to order but we were both so happy with what we got! He ordered the carnitas sandwich which was so flavorful. I got the turkey bacon avocado. And clam chowder. The cutest thing was that you get a chocolate covered strawberry with every order. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"OMG! I just fell in love! so delish. Probably my new favorite place. I just moved from Cali and loved Panera bread but the prices were always so expensive. Zupas gives you so much food for a great price I paid $9 for a half salad and whole sandwich! I chose the chipotle chicken salad and it was to die for! the California turkey sandwich was great too! definitely will be going back! Also, I went right before noon and there was probably 10-12 people in front of me but they are fast and friendly! LOVE LOVE LOVE"}
{"text":"Zupas is great for sandwiches, salads and soups.  Everything is made fresh, daily and it tastes great! With the freshness, the taste is scrumptious.  It's hard to believe healthy food can be this good! We're at the Desert Ridge location.  It's worth the drive."}
{"text":"Red Roasted peppers lobster soup was delicious, however the bread was flavorless and dull."}
{"text":"Delicious, fresh, SUPER happy employees, all of this makes a great experience when I go to Cafe Zupas. I love their salads, sandwiches are good, not great but good. Soups are amazing!! Love the soda fountain and all the wonderful combinations you can make."}
{"text":"I ordered the Wisconsin Cauliflower soup and the Chicken Pesto sandwich.  The food is delicious and you can see it is prepared fresh.  And my co-workers were satisfied with their meals too. 

My only complaint is you give me a plastic container to hold my sandwich.  A BIG container... and then everything else is thrown in the bag individually.  Why when the plastic clear box looks to hold everything inside? I found this frustrating when trying to figure out who's sandwich goes with which soup, etc.  The boxes look like they should contain one complete order inside.  There are 3 people working the counter - 2 cashiers and 1 just to pack the items.  It wouldn't hurt to take the time to pack it right so it's easy to carry out.  Especially when dealing with multiple orders from the same person."}
{"text":"This is a great place for lunch. They offer various sandwiches, salads, and soups, with a combination option. The combination is a huge portion of food, whether you choose any 2 of salad, soup, or sandwich, so come with an empty stomach!

I've had their soups and sandwiches, and while the sandwiches are decent, I think the soups are the better of the two. I've had the lobster/red pepper, and tomato basil, and both have had a lot of flavor, with a good consistency. Each soup comes with a chunk of French bread to dip it in.

The sandwiches I had were OK, but nothing special. The grilled cheese was, a grilled cheese. I did like the addition of pesto to the sandwich though. The turkey/artichoke/spinach was the better of the two, with a nice play of textures and flavors on a grilled panini bread.

Service is the counter is fairly speedy, and they will let you sample soups before you try them out.

The drink counter is unique in that they offer different syrups, with an occasional sugar free syrup, to add to whatever soda or tea you want.

Overall, this is a good option for those that are short on time for lunch and want a filling meal."}
{"text":"No real difference in the menu or interior of this Cafe Zupas from the one in Dana Park, but I do appreciate that the drink section is more intuitive (The straws and lids are on the farther side of the drink fountain from the cash register so there is better flow from leaving the counter, getting your drink, then getting your straw and lid).

Is it healthy? Well, I suppose it's healthier than eating a burger, but do you notice that every salad has some sort of sugary dressing on it? Also, while the soups are tasty, most of them taste like they have a fair amount of cream in them. 

You can easily get full here from anything you order, whether it is a soup, salad, sandwich, or combination of the two. The added chocolate dipped strawberry is a nice touch, and although the dining area was busy, there wasn't an issue finding anywhere to sit.

Service was great, and everyone here greeted me with a friendly smile."}
{"text":"The only thing I can vouch for here is the soup which is absolutely incredible. I got the Chicken Tortilla Soup. It was amazing. I could eat it all day. Not a big fan of having to pays extra for some chip crumbs but whatever it's worth it. Soup is 5 stars. They know we as consumers will pay extra so I can't blame them. Also I was not a big fan of their choices for sandwiches. I figured most sandwich places have something close to a roast beef sandwich, but not here. That is the only reason I take off one star. I would have bought the soup and sandwich if they had that option. Overall this place is great. Many options for most people...just not if you like roast beef."}
{"text":"I am really digging this place. My wife has come here a few times, but until this weekend I had never been. The selection of soups, sandwiches, and salads is impressive. Everything is fresh and made in front of you. The best part is the sandwiches and salads (I had the combo) is larger and cheaper than other similar places. Other chains give you half a sandwich and soup for $10, but Zupas was a whole sandwich, the soup, bread, and a chocolate covered strawberry for $8. I am definitely hooked now and will go back. Nice charging station for your electronics is an added bonus."}
{"text":"Excellent food, when they make it correctly.  Wildly inconsistent service.  We have been coming here about once a week since they opened.  They almost never make salads right, even when you order them exactly as they come.  This week they made my husband a Cobb salad, incorrectly, when he ordered the Chicken Chop Salad.  They were out of fountain drinks and bottled water.  They forgot to give us the bread with our order, and when we went to get our utensils and drinks, several items were not stocked: lids, lemons, butter.  

This location has extremely high turnover and that is clearly part of the problem.  They also seem to hire only very young people, which is fine, but they screw around more than work.  Tables are frequently dirty and trash cans overflowing.  It's not unusual to have to ask for lids, etc.

The food makes up for it, but just be aware if you order to-go."}
{"text":"This is my go to spot for sandwiches. It's close to my place and everything I need is close in proximity. Service is quick and they are very attentive. The only thing I can complain about is the smell when you walk in. You become nose blind to it after a few minutes, but when you first walk in, it smells like pool water."}
{"text":"CZ is killin' it! 
For a long time I was eating here so often and got burnt out but Friday night we decided to eat in and watch a movie in the couch so I stopped in to CZ and SAAHHHWEEET so happy I did! 
I ordered the braised pork salad and southwest green chili soup that I'm still thinking about. 
How tasty and flavorful both were. HIT THE SPOT. My husband ordered the lobster grilled cheese with clam chowder and he kept trying to eat mine! Nope. Not sharing this meal buddy. I want to go back this week and order the same exact meal and suggest you do the same! I forgot how yummy and tasty Café Zupas was!"}
{"text":"Feeling the onsets of a cold, my boyfriend and I decided to give Zupas a shot with the hope of a good soup & salad to feel better. From the moment we walked into the door, we knew we made the right decision choosing here!

We were greeted immediately by a girl who welcomed us to our first visit and explained how the ordering process works. The collections of homemade soups , the variety of subs, and fresh ingredients for the salads made choosing which combos to go with more difficult - you can choose two out of the three and it comes with a slice of bread and a chocolate-covered strawberry. 

I went with the lobster bisque and the bbq chicken salad. Although the name of the salad sounds too \"rich\", the salad was surprisingly refreshing and perfect. The soup was flavorful, but lukewarm. My boyfriend got the avocado turkey club and the new England clam chowder. He devoured every bite, so I'm guessing he enjoyed his meal also. We only spent $20 for two combos, chips, and two soft drinks -- what a deal!

I would describe zupas as a nice alternative to the bland flavors that are delivered at panera bread. It feels like a healthier choice also. I can't compliment the atmosphere enough -- they have a charging station where you can plug your chargers for any of your electronics, an array of hot sauces as well as flavor pumps for your drinks, and digital menus and displays around the dining room. 

Despite the fact that this place is kinda a fast-food soup/salad joint, the staff makes you feel like you just entered a fine-dining establishment with their attentiveness. 

We will definitely be back! :)"}
{"text":"LOVE this place. My boyfriend and I come here often for fresh, good and affordable food. They make everything to order and everything is really good! You get a complimentary roll and chocolate covered strawberry when you order too!"}
{"text":"Really like this place. Everyone is super friendly and I haven't had a bad dish yet. Their clam chowder is really excellent. Have had a variety of soups and sandwiches and have never had a bad thing to eat. They are also quick so if you're in a rush on lunch this is a good spot."}
{"text":"We traveled to Henderson from Arizona.  Have eaten at this location twice in the past.  Food was always good.  This time was very disappointing!  Ordered one Pick 2 and an additional salad.  Home-made fresh from there kitchen?  Not this one.  Store bought bread. Enough salad dressing for two salads, lobster bisque soup had no lobster but had a ton of tomato so it was more Tomato bisque.  And with strawberries in season it was amazing that the one that were covered in chocolate were the size of a quarter and not ripe. Not a very enjoyable meal. Guess we need another go to restaurant!"}
{"text":"I love this place!!!! Chic decor, good for families and fast service! I enjoy coming here whenever I feel like eating healthy/ low calorie items.  I can't never make up my mind if i want soup or salad, but here I dont have to think too hard as They offer combos for about $7-$8 dollars in which you can pick salad and soup, salad and half sandwich or any combination of the above. I would recommend the summer salad and the creamy soups (lobster bisque, Wisconsin cream, potato soup) .. But truly the best part of this place is...... The complementary strawberry covered in chocolate!!"}
{"text":"Went to this place when first opened up a few months ago and was very disappointed with the speed of service and the food quantity. Food quality is ok but so isn't subway. 

Returned tonight to get some food while the wife went to poke next door. They have a very serious process problem where they have a constant bottle neck. Waited at least 15 min to get thru the line while just one person was doing the salads and one person doing the collecting of the order when completed, getting the little bag of bread and chocolate strawberry and collecting the money. All yet while the line gets longer. What made even more frustrating us you get people who think they are entitled to cut thru the line because all they want is soup. I guess they feel they don't have to wait their turn like everyone else. 

I won't go back because they have not gotten better at the order and food preparation and payment system to get people thru the line. I applaud them for looking busy so people think they are popular. Food quality/quantity and long wait is not worth it. My life is too freaking short"}
{"text":"This place is great.  The food is healthy, fast and reasonable.  I love the combos.  My sandwich and salad today was wonderful.  And Zuppas is fun!"}
{"text":"Not sure what first caught my eye about this place, but something did.  I'd been wanting to go to this place for awhile now.   I've read some reviews about how this place reminds them of a Subway and I can see why.  While Subway focuses on the sandwich, this place offers soups, salads, and sandwiches, which is ok.  (Note: Before I go to a restaurant, I usually look at the menu so I know what I'm going to order when I get to the place.  I was disappointed to see that for the CYO Salad, while they had a decent variety of dressings/lettuces/toppings/etc. to choose from, they were pretty limiting to how many toppings you can choose!  What about those people who wants lots of vegetable toppings and not just 4?) Regardless, I decided to try it out tonight.  I have to admit that I'm not terribly happy with my first time here.  Having had nursed an upset stomach for the past few days, I decided to go with a vegetable soup with a clear broth and the vegetarian sandwich.  The soup was pretty salty.  That's about all I can say about it.  The sandwich wasn't too bad, but I wasn't too impressed with it. For the portion amount, I feel like both was a bit overpriced.  

However, seeing as this seems to be a fairly new place, I'm willing to get them a second try when I'm feeling 100%, rather than just 90%."}
{"text":"Quality cafe located just off bell rd! :)
Nice pizzazz, and ordering system is very easily instructed. Super quick, quality soups/salads/sandwiches and even creme brulee and chocolate covered strawberries for dessert! 

Defiantly see myself returning based off my first visit!
(Crab Avocado Melt, Mangoberry Salad, Tomato Bisque)"}
{"text":"Yummy!!!
Recently used these guys to cater our office X-mas party, MIHS Card Clinic. The food was great, everyone loved it and the young lady that delivered it was prompt, friendly  and very knowledgeable. We will definitely use them again.
Thank You Cafe Zupas."}
{"text":"I've been going to Zupas about once a week for a year and a half. 80% of the time the order is screwed up. Most of the time I can catch it before I'm out the door. I put in the same order every time. There is going to be a very big change in the frequency of my visits. The main reason is the what they've done to the Lobster Bisque soup. The bisque is now watered down, and they replaced the chunks of lobster with bits of tomato. The soup has been a complete disappointment on the last four visits, so we're not going to try it ever again.
Also, make sure to watch your salad prep. They accidentally put the wrong ingredient in my salad, so they thought the way to fix it was to dig it out with their finger. That was gross to watch."}
{"text":"My new favorite lunch spot!  Sandwiches, soups and salads are all 5 stars!  I love everything about this place except the ordering system.  You have to order sandwiches/salads first, then walk down the line and explain what you want again and then finally repeat your entire order again to the cashier.  If you're ordering for more than 1 person it's really difficult.  How about taking our full order at the beginning of the line and letting the cashier know so we don't have to repeat everything a hundred times?"}
{"text":"Love it gere?! Come and don't miss on great choices and quick service! Plus they give you a chocolate covered strawberry :)"}
{"text":"Wow. I would like to start this review by saying Zupas is hands down the best new place I've tried in a very long time. My husband and I went in at 4PM and were welcomed by the friendliest staff. Their menu is great. My husband ordered the kale salad which they made in front of him. I ordered the vegetarian sandwich and chicken enchilada chili soup which were both to kill for!!! Not to mention every meal ordered included a free chocolate dipped strawberry. It's safe to say Zupas is my better replacement of Jason's Deli and Panera Bread. Better food, service, and prices!!! I can't wait to come back! I'm so disappointed this place only has 3.5 stars on Yelp!"}
{"text":"I had been to a Zupas in Henderson prior to my experience here yesterday, and I can't believe I didn't know about the combo deal! 

Between the two of us, we shared an Asian citrus salad (minus the chicken), an crab avocado melt (minus the bacon), lobster bisque soup & a vegetarian sandwich. 

Out of these 4 items, the lobster bisque was definitely my favorite. It was creamy yet subtle, it didn't over power the meal. I personally preferred the taste of the crab avocado melt over the vegetarian but my BF loves the vegetarian. The Asian citrus salad was one of the better salads I've had recently. It was one of the first to be finished. 

The place was very customer friendly, with a very nice lady even helping us out with customer favorites. They have a spice rack for us \"spice is life\" crazies. BEWARE of Dave's radioactive hot sauce...I was impatient and didn't read the radioactive portion  

Additionally, this location also has Italian soda shots to flavor your fountain drinks which is a PLUS PLUS PLUS. My lemonade tasted TOO DAMN GOOD after I added two shots of peach & one shot of raspberry."}
{"text":"I was very impressed by this place. The restaurant has a really cool vibe to it. I ended up getting the \"pick 2\" combo; the Cuban sandwich and a bowl of Tortilla Enchilada soup. Both were really tasty! The combo is under $10 and comes with a chocolate covered strawberry. I can't wait to come back here again!"}
{"text":"Terrible service. Manager in store was not helpful. My little girl wanted pickles on her sandwich, but they said they can't add them because they have no way to charge for a pickle. They confirmed that they HAVE pickles, just can't sell them. What?"}
{"text":"I really love this place. Had the turkey cranberry sandwich and Clam chowder soup and was not disappointed. The sandwich bread is soft, and complimented well with sprouts and cranberry sauce...perfection!   The clam chowder was not too thick or watered down, was the right consistency with the right amount of ingredients. The restaurant is clean, spacious and well designed. The beverage counters are away from the check out counters and complete with shots of your favorite berry flavor to add an extra kick to your drinks. Last, they have a nice selection of desserts for your after meal delight. First time here, but will be my new favorite.  The salads are unbelievable!"}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible - never coming here again- not only can you not ADD ANYTHING to any of the food, BUT you cannot pay to get that item that they refuse to add to your food on the side either!!! How eternally frustrating!! Oh but you can take something out? And you can add tomato and bacon!!!  All I want is some sprouts - WHAT THE F***??! Thanks Ashlyn(alleged manager)  and whatever your GM's name is for loosing a customer - eternally frustrated with your crappy company - Steven B"}
{"text":"This place is very unorganized and no one seems to know what they should be doing.. beside my salad was so small the topping fell to the bottom due to lack of lettuce and the red leaf was brown and rotten on the tips.. very disappointing. The Summerlin location was not this cheap on the servings and always fresh. Never going back."}
{"text":"Love them! I had never been but decided to check it out one day and I am glad I did. Love the chocolate dipped strawberry with every meal!"}
{"text":"This was my first trip to Zupas.  I wasn't sure what to expect because I'd just about sworn off some of the places that specialize in salads.  This one is different and also very confusing when you first go in.

As you move along the line the salad selections are first.  That's also where you order the sandwiches.  I discovered that way down the line.  There salads looked amazing.  However, I really like romaine lettuce or at least lettuce that's a little crunchy.  Their website indicates they offer a chopped lettuce crunchy like romaine but all they really offered were two types of leafy, limp lettuce.  I'm definitely not a fan. 

I ordered the crab/avocado sandwich and it was very good.  The soups looked good as did the desserts.  Maybe another time I'll try something else.  I doubt it'll be one of their salads unless they bring in a crunchy lettuce."}
{"text":"Ive had the food here a couple times. I either take it to go and eat it at home or have it for lunch at my work. The sandwiches and soups are great! And i love how you get a chocolate covered strawberry with your meal. The staff is always friendly and food is always great everytime."}
{"text":"I normally don't like chain restaurants that serve glamorized fast food (Panera, etc), and I nearly dismissed Cafe Zupas as the same. That would have been a mistake. 

Everything here screams \"FRESH!\" The clam chowder had fresh chunks of potato and veggies. The clam was real clam, not processed cubes of clam product. The salad was mixed fresh by hand right in front of me, the baguette slice was a nice touch and the chocolate-covered strawberry was a classy treat.

Also, I was skeptical about cinnamon anything on my berry salad. Try it. Delicious."}
{"text":"Always great quality food whenever I visit. My recent visit was great because of the exceptional customer service by Jonny and Pia. It's refreshing when employees are energetic and passionate about their workplace."}
{"text":"Love their menu and combinations!  Watch out, the dessert display just before the register is a killer!  I thought it just a hair expensive, 1/2 salad w/ a cold drink was just under $10   No receipt so couldn't look closer.  Discovered a giant chocolate dipped strawberry on my tray, a nice surprise at the end of my meal!  It would be nice to have a side option other than bread though. 

Overall I was happy w/ my meal & will definitely return!"}
{"text":"When I first walked in was promptly greeted. Placed the order for a Bacon and Ham panini, Cali Turkey, Tortilla Soup, ect... to eat inside. I said 2 bottle waters,  the lady must not have heard me. Get the food,  realize no water. Had to stand back in line to order water. Sandwiches were fair, soup was very salty. Not happy. Dessert was ok. Looked pretty though. Now the highlight was, as I was throwing my food away, the gentleman that was clearing areas let me know your able to get samples and even offered to switch out the soup. He is the reason I didn't give 2 stars. His customer service was very on point."}
{"text":"I lalalalove this place! :D I always get the try 2 combo: Turkey Spinach Artichoke Sandwich with Roasted Red Pepper Lobster soup. (My new obsession combo). The food is good, great environment, and the staff are so friendly.  & just when you think it can't get any better, the try 2 combo is less than $10! That's a full size sandwich & a pretty good size soup. Plus, it comes with bread for your soup and my favorite part.. CHOCOLATE DIPPED STRAWBERRY! Oh! & try their specialty drink. My ultimate favorite is the orange berry drink from their drunk fountain"}
{"text":"Literally the worst service ever! Staff was rude my salad drenched in dressing, soup cold and not worth price. I left starving."}
{"text":"Cafe Zupas is one of my failsafe food choices that has consistently been good over two years now. I'll let the other reviewers like Shirley B go in depth on the joys of the Asian Citrus Chicken Salad, or the Roasted Red Pepper and Lobster soup which I am addicted to. I have explored about 75% of their menu and haven't found anything that I didn't like here. 

I call this a failsafe choice because when my family gets sick and nothing else sounds good, Cafe Zupas soups are what we fall back on. Their Wisconsin Cheddar is our all time favorite, but my son will eat the Tomato Soup with Orzo when he won't eat anything else. 

You would be amiss if you walked out of here without a piece of cheesecake, but the strawberries dipped in Belgian Chocolate that come with every meal are a treat all to themselves. I've walked in here at 9:45 pm with a large order more than once and have always received service with smiles...and I love that. In short, you can't go wrong giving Cafe Zupas a try."}
{"text":"The combo is A LOT of food (any two of a whole sandwich, half salad, or half soup + baguette + chocolate-dipped strawberry)! Come here if you want something like Panera but larger portions."}
{"text":"Cafe Zupas has become a family favorite. The food is fresh, the staff is friendly, it is also a nice value with the $7.99 combos. Their soups are made fresh on the premises and lobster bisque has become my favorite.

One of the cool things that my daughter really likes is the italian syrups that you can add to the drinks. 

They also keep the place spotless and they bus your table.

I think the chocolate covered strawberry that comes with everyones meal is a nice touch.

They can get busy, but the staff is very friendly and they make your order fast.

Two thumbs up from me...or in the Yelp world 5 Stars."}
{"text":"I love this place! The choose 2 option is only $7.99 and you get a ton of food! Large selection of salads or you can create your own by choosing from the greens and add-ins. All of the sandwiches I've tried so far are good and they've got a lot to choose from. I've only tried a couple soups so far but they'll offer you samples of any you want to try. They include a piece of bread and a chocolate covered strawberry. Good selection of fountain drinks as well and syrups to make Italian sodas."}
{"text":"We ordered small bowls of chicken enchilada soup for lunch. The photo on the website shows tortilla chips, but those are a 69 cent up charge. Do you care for some sour cream sir?  69 cent up charge.  In fact, everything except the bowl, soup and spoons seemed to be a 69 cent up charge though they did toss in, on the side, a chocolate covered strawberry and a couple of crackers.  The soup was good, but it would take Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson to find any chicken in my soup."}
{"text":"I've been going here for years, good spot for quick tasty salads and sandwiches.  Only complaint is their approach to ordering.  You give your order then walk 15 feet and have to repeat it to the cashier.  They need a computerized approach so you don't have to repeat yourself."}
{"text":"Zupas offers a range of sandwiches, salads and soups and definitely puts Paradise Bakery to shame and is a welcome addition in the fast/casual category.  It is located 
\"kitty-corner\".... do people still use that phrase? ...  across the parking lot from Chipotle the food was quick, fresh and tasty.  I had a combo of lobster bisque soup and Cobb salad ($8.95) with a piece of bread and a chocolate dipped strawberry..  Of course one could ask, who serves lobster bisque in the middle of the desert, but they had quite a range of fresh soup.  I would say the knock on the bisque is that it was too salty and if I came back I would try the wild mushroom soup instead."}
{"text":"Order FC#2013


An order was called in for a take out. I was expecting family over for dinner. The order was called in by my wife who ordered 4 Try 2 Combo's and 2 California Turkey Sandwiches. 

Instead, I received 4 Try 2 Combo's and 1 Sandwich. This left one person without food for dinner when I arrived home.


I called over and verified my order was called into \"Jordan.\" Christian, who stated he was a manager, offered for me to come in to pick up a free sandwich. Your advertisement is that you can deliver. I expected it would be the least that could be done considering I'm expecting guests any minute. Christian stated he couldn't do that--all the drivers \"had gone home for the day.\" 


What was supposed to be a pleasant evening with family left us wanting. This was a very disappointing experience."}
{"text":"This was my second visit to a Cafe Zupas location and it was prompted by their Grand Opening mailer for 50% off your order. I brought Ruben, my mom, and my brother to take advantage of this fantastic deal, plus, they had never been to Zupas.

There's still construction going on in this new plaza and it was insanely busy, so it was a little tricky maneuvering around the lot. Parking was also sparse, which made it even more chaotic. I'm sure they'll be rather busy as long as these mailers are running!

The lowdown on CZ: 

ORDERING: Go straight to the line. The menu is available above the food stations, but also available as convenient to-go menus along the line. They have sandwiches, salads, soups, and desserts. That's the simple part. Making a decision may take a little more time since there are 13 sandwiches, 12 salads, and 10 soups. Sandwiches are sold whole, but soups and salads are available as large or half options. There's a very popular \"Try 2 Combo\" for $8.79 that offers a sandwich with a half salad OR half soup (it's also the best deal). When it's your turn at the counter, they'll ask you if you're having a sandwich or a salad. Then you're moved down the line and asked if you want soup. Everything is prepped as you're walking. As your meal is being wrapped up with a piece of bread and chocolate-dipped strawberry, they verify your items before you pay at the register (This is also when you choose your beverage options).

BEVERAGES: There's a beverage station with your usual fountain sodas and freshly-made teas and lemonades (all sweetened with honey). This area is also home to utensils, napkins, butter, etc. (There are salt and black pepper grinders at the tables)

SEATING: \"Please place your order before reserving a seat\" It's a quick-service restaurant and turnover is equally fast (we were at our table for just 25 minutes). It was really busy when we arrived, but we were still able to find a table for four immediately after receiving our food, so I wouldn't worry about not having a seat/table. Though, I'm sure it could get busier and I don't know what they do in that situation.

The verdict:

Turkey Bacon Avocado Panini: Turkey, bacon, avocado, tomatoes, Muenster cheese, and housemade honey mustard. First, the sandwich was a MESS. There was avocado everywhere (especially outside the sandwich). Also, I'm certain it was an avocado spread rather than actual avocado. The bread was not crunchy or warm like you'd except from a panini (especially when it's pressed to order, unless this was prepared in advance). There was also very little or no salt; surprising when there's bacon present (speaking of bacon, it was flabby and sad). I'm assuming they purposely don't salt their foods and allow you to season it yourself? Basically, the sandwich lacked much-needed texture and seasoning. Even with the addition of salt and pepper, it was still just okay.

Honey Bacon Club Panini: Turkey, ham, bacon, tomatoes, Muenster cheese, and housemade honey mustard. Again, the bread lacked crunch. Its flavor was decent and I like that the honey really stood out without being overwhelming or too sweet. It also didn't need additional salt. I didn't love this sandwich either, but I enjoyed it much more than the other panini.

Roasted Red Pepper and Lobster Soup: This is a neat combination of two ingredients I love and lighter than its described (creamy). It had a nice lobster fragrance that you could really taste and there were several pieces of lobster (though they had an odd texture). However, it was just okay. 

Chicken Enchilada Chili: Red & green enchilada sauces, chicken, black beans, and Southwestern vegetables, topped with tortilla strips. A bit thin for a chili since it was more soup than stew, but the flavors were good. I would order this one again.

Asian Citrus Chicken: Baby field greens, housemade yuzu miso vinaigrette, chicken, sugar snap peas, edamame, baby cucumbers, tri-color peppers, mandarin oranges, cashews, wonton strips, and black sesame seeds. I was pleased that the salad wasn't overly dressed with vinaigrette (I hate drowning salads) and thought it was decent. The mandarin oranges were super mushy, but I'm not a fan of them in salads anyway.

The sandwiches are small, but the soups and salads are generous. The accompanying bread is pretty good, though it would be soo much better toasted (and butter; I forgot about butter)! I didn't eat the chocolate-covered strawberry this time, but I remember it being good (Belgian milk chocolate).

I'm not overly impressed with the food. It's wonderful that everything is housemade, but the quick-serve model is compromising the end-product (soft paninis, soggy ingredients). It is a great option for healthier food when you're on the go and I know that's their thing, but I prefer a made-to-order product that may take a little more time."}
{"text":"I'd heard a lot about Cafe Zupas and was in the area, so I decided to check it out with a friend. Luckily, it wasn't very busy when we arrived and were able to order immediately. The process is simple and even for a first-timer, it wasn't intimidating.

I opted for the Try 2 Combo ($8.79) with a sandwich and half bowl of soup.

California Turkey Sandwich: Turkey, avocado, tomato, sprouts, cucumber, mixed greens, Muenster cheese, and housemade sun-dried tomato herb spread. The ciabatta bread was nice and soft. I really like all the ingredients of this sandwich, but it lacked the salt to bring out its flavors.

Wisconsin Cauliflower Soup: Cauliflower, cheddar, and pepperjack. This is a wonderful option for a soup with a creamy feel without all the guilt! The amount of cheese isn't overwhelming and although you don't get that super smooth chowder-like feel, it still tastes great. It wouldn't be my favorite soup, but I love that it's low-carb.

With every meal, you receive a piece of bread and a chocolate-covered strawberry. It makes the price even sweeter. Both accompaniments are decent.

It's not an amazing meal and I wouldn't go out of my way to have it, but I guess if you're in a hurry and you're craving healthier sandwiches, soups, and/or salads, it's not terrible."}
{"text":"This was my first time and my experience was horrible . I ordered a salad and soup my soup came out cold . You are only allowed 5 choices of toppings on your salad which is fine but they literally only put less than a table spoon of chicken. I went up to the counter to notify them and she said yes it's not even a table spoon .  Service is horrible and so was the food will never return ."}
{"text":"Zupas restaurant located on rainbow in Las Vegas  I thought was a good place to eat.   I discovered that Jason's Deli beats them 10 to 1.  


1. More product for the money.


2. Much better customer service.
Except Mike he was he's a pretty good manager

3. No matter what nationality you are you get treated with respect.

On the evening of September 28th 2016 at approximately 6:30 p.m. I went into Zupas to buy a salad and there was a greeter standing there who greeted everyone else but me.  And just to let you know I was the only African-American in that store at the time.

I felt discriminated against and I will not return to Zupas ever again unless they change some of their store policies."}
{"text":"This is a typical soup, salad, sandwich joint.  Perfect for lunch or a quick takeout dinner.  The ingredients are all fresh but also lack some flavor.  I have been here several times and nothing I've ordered really blew me away.  The best thing I've had was the salted caramel brûlée.  I ordered it to go and the cashier dropped it, flipped it back over and sent me home with it.  The caramel was everywhere but on top of the brûlée.  Even still...it was so good.  You also get a complimentary chocolate dipped strawberry with every meal, bonus!  They also have complimentary syrups at the soda station to add to your drinks, which I love.  The rating I'm giving is more for all the extras here and not as much for the food."}
{"text":"I like the salads, sandwiches and soups here. I really like that you can mix and match. Nice sized portions. I would like to see a bit more variety for the salad mix-ins. Great desserts too."}
{"text":"I have been to this cafe zupas on several occasions since they have opened. I realize their business model of making a customer order first their salad/sandwich, then soup, the desert, the combine it all together as one order to the expoditer is not typicak. the fun quirks are what makes this place different. tonight, however, I could only sum up in two words: Cluster. Fuck. I ordered my 2 salads, then my 2 sandwiches. the sandwich guy repeated them back to the salad girl in understanding. I ordered my soup to watch the next person give it to the customers in front of us. I asked the soup guy if that was my soup: haha, yeah. I ordered a cup of fruit, but went ignored by the soup guy. the third, or is it forth? now asked what my order was.  I repeated my order, she turned and asked where one of my sandwiches were. sandwich guy responds with \"where is it?\" the tray girl then asked what my order was again, and I had to order my fruit cup. again. then the cashier, looking at two trays of food, asked what my order was, and she only rang me up for 2/3 of it. the cashier says \"oh!that was yours too? hehe\" I must be a clown at this point, but the only one not amused is me. part of the selling point is the ease of ordering, the 1-2-3 steps. was it because there was no manager on tonight? was it because each of these kids behind the counter couldn't care less? I have no idea. but sitting at my table, ready to eat, I was still missing the damned sandwich that sandwich guy himself couldn't find."}
{"text":"A little upset at this location. It seemed as if the staff was rushed when the restaurant was hardly busy. They weren't super helpful to my friend who has never been there and they weren't as nice as the staff at the eastern location. Not to mention the half cup I was poured instead of an actual cup which I paid for. Maybe next time? Or I'll just drive out of the way..."}
{"text":"I go here way too often! It's kind of like a Panera or corner bakery and its so good! I always do the pick two and get a half \"strawberry harvest salad\" and a Turkey Spinach Artichoke sandwich. So goood! Their infused water drinks are delicious as well. 

I've also tried the Clam Chowder but I wasn't a big fan of it. I expected it to be creamier but it was more watery. What a disappointment so I stick to sandwiches and salads! 

Oh yeah! and your food always comes with a chocolate dipped strawberry and a roll! an extra treat :)"}

{"text":"Deliciousness - 4.5/5
Happiness - 3/5

Zupas has been our go-to sandwich fast-casual place since we moved to Arizona. The food is just excellent. Everything tastes fresh, and there is a wide array of food (Asian flavors, American flavors, Latin flavors, and in the winters - stews and chowders)). You can get a salad, soup, sandwich or a choose-two combo, that is actually affordable (choose-two is a hair under $10.00). The salads are fine, but a little bland. So I usually go with a sandwich and soup. And the soup is absolutely the star, they always have layers of flavor and a very generous amount of stuff in the soup. Every order also comes with a delicious fresh roll and a chocolate-dipped strawberry.

The best thing is that my kids love it, and it's healthier by far than the typical fast food fair (i.e., nuggets). They go crazy for the chocolate-dipped strawberry - which I gladly prefer they eat to french fries. And you get a big bank for your buck (i.e., a choice of two of either soup, sandwich, grilled chicken strips, or mac and cheese - plus the free strawberry).

They have a fun soda bar with plenty of Italian syrups you can put in at no extra charge (as well as fresh cut lemons or limes). 

The only reason Zupas misses five stars is the service. It has consistently diminished as I've been here. It is now taking me about 10-15 minutes to get through the line, which is ridiculously long for fast-casual dining. The last few times I have been, I have had to ask them to re-stock something (i.e., napkins, utensils, butter for the rolls). And they definitely are not as friendly as they used to be."}
{"text":"As a soup person 
I had to repeatedly ask for samples and trade outs 
I was so excited for this 
I have had stomach surgery 
Soup is at the top of my List maybe I came on the wrong day 
But I was dissapointed 
But the staff was totally okay with me. 
It was busy
I wanted to love this place 
It fell short. 
Maybe it was me, but I have better luck with Panera"}
{"text":"Met friends here for lunch. This was a pretty enjoyable experience. All I have to say is order the Tomato Basil soup with the Cuban sandwich. Fantastic! The soup had a great tomato taste. The sandwich is hot and has big hunks of pork, sliced ham, mustard, cheese, and pickles. Just how a Cuban sandwich should be. My only complaint, that the sandwich is not bigger (should be an option to super size). Included is a slice of Italian bread and a chocolate dipped strawberry. Ordered a drink from the all you can drink beverage bar."}
{"text":"Usually a good place for healthy food, the quality has gone downhill over time. We were almost done eating before the ultimate grilled cheese was made (they were going to bring it to the table but we chased it down). Quinoa and roasted veggie soup was bland and lacking in veggies and quinoa. The seasonal turkey brioche was flavorless. Definitely not with the cost."}
{"text":"Cafe Zupas... come hungry, leave hungry....

I am a huge fan of the food, especially the salads. The ingredients are all fresh, every time. No brown or wilted produce. Everything is made when you order. I have tried many different salads, and I have not been disappointed. 

The down sides to Cafe Zupas are portion size and price. At around $10 a meal, the portion size seems less than adequate. In fact, I have seriously left still feeling hungry. 

Meals come with a roll (depending on what you order). I don't get the roll. It's served cold, every time. Cold and hard. 

Quality = Five Stars
Price and Value = Three Stars
Portion (Especially soups and salads) = Two Stars"}
{"text":"When I think of Café Zupas, three things immediately come to mind. 

1.  For what it is, soup, salad, and sandwiches, it's a bit pricey. 

2. The portions are small in my opinion. 

3. Pricey + Small Portions = Leave Hungry. 

I've visited Cafe Zupas a number of times. I think the service is always on point and the food I have tried is very tasty. The location is always clean no matter how busy they are. 

For me, the downside is definitely the small portions. I have observed the careful attention to detail that goes into making a meal. You will notice that the small portions are consistent. Each item that is added to the salad is carefully measured and portioned. 

While I really enjoy the service and food, I simply can't square it with the price and portions."}
{"text":"Love this place. Just turned my wife onto it tonight! All soups are so tasty and fresh. Corn chowder the best! I could eat it all day. I could order 1 of each, grab a bunch of spoons and have a soup fest! Wife says veggie and quinoa soup way tastier than she expected! Loved our salads too! Chipoltle chicken salad really good! Prices good. In one word, \"Primo\"!"}
{"text":"The first time to Zupas. I put it off for about a year but glad I finally checked it out. A great place for soup, salad, and sandwiches. I had a crab and avocado panini-like sandwich and a small bowl of your traditional (Friday) clam chowder. It was  a great combo. I also had a chocolate hazelnut pudding for desert and was great too. For all I had, it was about your typical price of $12. I went back a few weeks later and had an excellent bowl  of tomato soup and grilled cheese sandwich."}
{"text":"I've been remiss in writing this review, as I went here almost 8 months ago. The food was good and the prices were even better. I don't remember exactly what I had, but that's ok because my food was good, as was my wife's and my mom's. So, I feel confident in going back at any time and getting a good meal."}
{"text":"One of my favorite lunch spots!  So many healthy options and all are delicious.  I love sampling their soups, especially when they have seasonal soups.  I could eat here every single day and not get tired of it.  My favorite combo to get is the garden chicken chop and lobster bisque!  I also love the roasted red pepper and lobster soup as well as the garden chowder, but you really can't go wrong with any of the soups.  Even though they are usually pretty busy during lunch hour, the line moves pretty quickly and all the workers are very efficient.  Portion sizes are good and I love that they include a piece of bread and chocolate dipped strawberry with every order.  We order from here for our monthly office meetings and everyone loves it.  Make sure you call large orders in before 11 AM to have it ready for pickup at lunch time."}
{"text":"I officially give up on this location. I gave it too many chances.
Ask for no tomatoes? Oh, you'll get tomatoes.
Want a cup of soup? They will only fill that halfway. Want a bowl of soup? They will also only feel that halfway, so I hope you actually wanted a cup!!!"}
{"text":"We had Cafe Zupas catered for a business meeting last week and it did not disappoint. Whenever food is catered, it's typically Paradise. Wooo (insert sarcasm here)! Paradise isn't bad, but there's just nothing special about it. 

There were several different kinds of sandwiches to choose from. I got the chicken salad and it was delicious. Everyone else really liked their sandwiches too. The salad was also really good. Not your typical garden or Cesar salad. I'm not quite sure what it was but it had chicken, tomatoes, and feta.. yummy. Now we must also discuss the huge dessert platter that was in front of us. It was filled with chocolate covered strawberries, brownies, cookies dipped in chocolate, and more! I've never seen a dessert try like that before for a work lunch. Of course, I had to try a few of the items and they were all so good!

I would definitely make my way to their physical location in the future so that I can try out some other items. And if you're looking to cater for a large group of people, definitely check this place out. Your guests will not be disappointed and it'll make a great impression on them earning you some major brownie points."}
{"text":"Very tasty. I had the Chicken Enchiladas Chili and the Honey Bacon Club. Very good. Place is very clean. The staff is very nice. Gave good recommendations."}
{"text":"The food was yummy butt my mango berry salad only had 4 blueberries and about 12 mangos I asked for more and was treated very rude and was told I would be charged - it was 90% lettuce until I paid extra for more ingredients"}
{"text":"So ok. This place definitely has 5 star potential. But there is one MAJOR concern here...PRICE.

Im sorry, but salad is not GOURMET.  Its salad. Sure, you can dress it up with roasted corn and herb dressing....its still salad. Same can be said about soup. Even a soup with incredible flavors happening, doesnt really cost that much to produce, especially in large quantities.
A half serving of soup here is just under 5.00.  WAY too high.

Enough complaining. I ordered the Try 2 Combo..
-Cuban sandwich and a half Chicken Chop Salad
-I also got a half soup. I ordered the Chicken Tortilla   ( Total for order..a little over 16.00)

The Cuban was very tasty. The pork was layered thick, and was very tender. 
The salad was very good as well. I like green leaf lettuce as a salad base, not iceburg, which is primarily water. I enjoyed the herb dressing, and i like how they tossed all the lettuce in the dressing, before adding the rest of the ingredients. the chicken topping tasted like fresh chicken.
The tortilla soup was good, as well. I like creamier tortilla soups, as this one was broth based, but it was still really good. If you like a more creamier type tortilla soup, try their Chicken enchilada soup. I got a small sample, and it was very good.
The wedge of bread that came with dinner helped with the removal of broth from my bowl. :)

And of course, the complimentary chocolate dipped strawberry was juicy, and not over ripe.

Overall, not bad.  I will most likely come back...but not as often as im sure id like to...but maybe thats not so bad. :)  My waistline will thank me."}
{"text":"Food is always good here just one thing I never understood was why they didn't warm up the dinner roll so I asked the lady that was preparing my food if she can warm my bread up and looked at me and turn and said NO !! I was like ha and moved on"}
{"text":"The ONLY reason I didn't give one of the only 5 star reviews I've ever given is I only went once.  I have kids with food allergies and food safety is a requirement for me to give 5 stars. 

Sadly, after my meal last night I wanted to come back today only to find out they aren't open in Sunday. I am SO happy I decided to try this place while the kids went to Smash Burger. I had the carnitas sandwich combo with a salad. The herb vinaigrette was really good and very flavorful. A little goes a long way. The staff was so helpful and friendly that I happily pulled out some cash to tip but they wouldn't accept!  I ended up sampling a couple of soups and  couldn't decide so got both Irish Stew and the best cream of mushroom I've ever tasted. THe make you own soda syrups made me break my own rule and drink soda.   The chocolate covered strawberries and salted caramel creme brûlée were the perfect ending to great meal.  I'm coming back to Las Vegas next week and am already planning to bring the family."}
{"text":"Fast, fresh and incredibly cheap. I have had the turkey cranberry sandwich and the turkey bacon Panini and both were well under 5 bucks and pretty good. This place reminds me a lot of Wildflower. 

The only disappointment was the mushroom bisque soup, it had so much salt in it I couldn't eat it. I had ordered it to go and was already at home or I would have returned it.

The chocolate covered strawberries are a nice touch, and the service is friendly. I think this is a great spot to grab a quick lunch, but not much more."}
{"text":"Well hello Cafe Zupas, I'm glad to meet you! Welcome to the neighborhood, I hope you will stick around.  The bbq chicken salad you created was delicious, and I especially loved the fun drink bar, which let me make my own Italian soda.  My husband liked his summer chicken salad and turkey bacon panini. And that free chocolate covered strawberry at the end? Awesome! I was very satisfied after eating at Cafe Zupas. Not too full but just right. I appreciate new restaurants that are quick, healthy and not too expensive!"}
{"text":"Walked in and was greeted at the door by q young lady who offered to make recommendations (which was good considering it was my first time here). She recommended for me to try the 2 choice combo. I ordered what she said what the most popular sandwich (pulled pork BBQ) and it was great, along side the nuts about berries salad an that was great as well. 
Service was great and everyone was giddy and smiley. One thing they should work on is the organization of the line in which you order because the further you go down the line, the staff losses order of who ordered what food. They give you a chocolate covered strawberry with your order and that's a great complimentary dessert. Environment is awesome and they play fun music. Very clean and they have a \"rechargeable bar\" for electronic devices. Overall GREAT JOB CAFE ZUPAS!! WILL BE BACK!"}
{"text":"Amazing sandwiches and soups, although I'm giving 2 stars considering the portions they give are ridiculous. They fill their fruit bowls & soups not even half way up the cup. The service is not that great either from the few times I've visited this location."}
{"text":"Good idea to have a salad and sandwich place. Execute poorly. I asked for bell peppers on my salad and LITERALLY was given 2 small slices of peppers. When I asked for more the employee looked to his manager to see if that was ok. The salad was almost $9 and was 99% spinach. When I told the cashier that I barely received toppings she said I could get more if I paid more. Smh. I will never return"}
{"text":"This place is fairly good but nothing special. It is overpriced for half a sandwich and a little bowl of soup. It was delicious enough to want to return. There is no harm in trying it once for yourself. The food wasn't bad but not worth the price. I would not go out of my way to come here. I most likely will not return."}
{"text":"I love Zupas! Their food is always so fresh :) servers are always upbeat and happy to serve you. I just wish they weren't stingy with the meat! I ordered a chicken salad and got a baby scoop of chicken. Probably like 7 little shredded pieces of it. Lol"}
{"text":"This place has a fantastic selection of fresh salads and soups made in house!! Their selection of beverages is awesome and the wait at lunchtime is definitely manageable. I will absolutely be coming back--Worth stopping by!"}
{"text":"Good food, but I asked for a crab avocado melt and they gave me a completely different sandwich that was nothing like the one I ordered, and was really gross. I told them what sandwich I wanted five times during the process of their confusing assembly line setup that works out of order. It is obviously far too confusing for the dimwits that work there. The food is good, but the employees are not good at their job. I've met dogs who follow directions better than these clowns. This place is completely overpriced for how poor the service is. I used to be a frequent customer at this location, but I will no longer get ripped off by these guys."}
{"text":"Cafe Zupa is amazing! Again, a  co-worker had to introduce me to this place for lunch!

At first, I thought Cafe Zupa was a Mexican place or just a regular sandwich restaurant, which it is but, upon entering into the place I was immensely surprised by all the hip as I walked in, seeing how overcrowded it could get for lunch hour. LoL

I was also taken away by the choices they have for their salad bar and how fresh/colorful it all looked and their variety of sandwiches and also, their soup selection. Every bite was salivating worth it, plus to add the touches of their dinner roll bread and dipped strawberry and I just love love their selection of fountain drinks with their freshly made healthy drinks. WOW, so delicious and their customer service are always FRIENDLY and COURTEOUS.

I think since my co-worker has brought me here a little over two months ago - I have probably brought my family more than 4 times, lunch here is like at least once a week, and i've also used them for catering for our company meetings and EVERYONE just loves the salads, sandwiches, and all the added bonuses that came with their box lunches."}
{"text":"Very good. Very fast. Alittle cold inside but understandable cause it's warm outside. Bathrooms clean. Will visit and recommend again."}
{"text":"Experienced Zupa first time the other day. Much of the staff did not know the answers to some of my ??? about some of their ingredients. They do not know which products have soy in them & not all products are made in house and not everything is organic nothing is non-gmo unless they just did not know. I was disappointed with the small portion size. The pulled pork was very small more bread than anything else. Less than a tablespoon of meat on the sandwich. The Kale salad was suppose to be mixed with Quinoa which I am sure it may have been except I nor anyone on my table could find any. Not a place to go if you are very hungry as the portions are not real big. The food was okay, nothing to write home about.  I might try a different location to see if they are all the same."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Try their honey mustard ham and turkey panini with the clam chowder. Get a large size of their clam chowder."}
{"text":"Normally totally love this place and get my lunch here on my break to go. But this time the girl put my to go box into the bag completely sideways? I thought it'd be fine since I flattened it out almost immediately  but my soup popped open a little and got all over my salad and the box was a mess to open up. Normally not an issue since everyone normally takes their time to place the box in flat."}
{"text":"I really really like this place. For just over 9 dollars you can get a soup/sandwich/salad combo with a baguette and chocolate covered strawberry. Not only do you get a lot of food for your money, but you get quality food for your money too and it's fast. Always my stop before work or after school! I also feel less guilty eating it, although I do wish there was just a tad bit less salt but other than that I really really enjoy my eating experience here every time!"}
{"text":"This is a chick place that has really good food even for us dudes. Wife loves the place and gave in as opposed to sports bar, burgers, etc. but really hearty sandwiches with good combinations. I do the sandwich/soup combo with chicken tortilla soup. Really good, large portion and quick service. It's usually full of milf's and sweet looking college women trying to eat decent. It's fresh, clean and worth surrendering to the wife as long as this is the result."}
{"text":"4.9 Stars

Location Overview:
This location is in a great strip mall on Eastern. It definitely has a the new business feeling to it. As soon as you walk in you can tell that everything is brand new and clean. Most definitely give them 5.0 Star for the over all view of this location. However, the concept is a little confusing. You pick either a soup and sandwich, soup and salad, or a sandwich and salad. When you are in line you kind of have to jump ahead of people depending on what meal you choose or you have to go to the end of the line again. 

Customer Service:
Customer service at this location is decent. After looking at the menu, you get in line and the first person asks if they can make you a salad or a sandwich. Once you have chosen your salad and/or sandwich you choose your soup if that is your other entree. They give you testers for the soup (great choices for meat eaters, vegetarians, and vegans). Once you have gotten your entree you get a big piece of bread and a chocolate covered strawberry (which is DELICIOUS) and an extra charger for your drink if you choose to get one. 

**********As my first time here I was excited to try this place because my parents have gone to this location several times and have experienced great service. I am not sure if the young man was confused but my boyfriend and I ordered the same thing and we actually wind up missing a sandwich. So we waited about 5 minutes and no one said anything. After we told a manager at the cash register about the other sandwich that we were missing she took care of it right away. 

Quantity/Quality:
The Honey Bacon Club sandwich is a good choice. It has a sweet taste from honey mustard. The bacon is crispy The turkey and ham slices are tender. I got the New England Clam Chowder. I added bacon bites to my soup and it most definitely is a great choice of soup. The quality of the food is definitely fresh and great. I would have to say that the quality of the food here is just as good as a 5 Star High End restaurant. The quantity of the food is more than enough. you get two entrees a big piece of bread and a chocolate covered strawberry as well as your drink. My father is around 185lbs and he gets full on this. 

Side Notes:
Great for a lunch/dinner date. Kids menu has a good quantity of food. Expect to leave full and satisfied."}
{"text":"Was excited to hear about this place as we love soup. I ordered the bean soup and if there were 6 beans in it, that was a lot. Returned it to the counter. Ordered something else and paid extra for pasta. They charged 50 cents for about a tablespoon of orzo. What a ripoff! Loud \"music\" and ugly decor and plastic spoons that are thin and small. The employees were chirpy but brain dead and were more interested in talking to each other than in providing info about the soups or helping us figure out how to order. Which won't be a problem for us as we would NEVER go back. The strawberry was small and  withered and since it was free it was worth the cost but not more."}
{"text":"THIS IS MY NEW GO TO FOR LUNCH OR DINNER!

My friend recommended me this restaurant for dinner and I got to say healthy never tasted better. They have a soup/salad/sandwich bar in which you get to either make your own salad or sandwich - or you get to have one of their recipe specialties. 
I absolutely love the Asian Chicken Salad and the Lobster Bisque soup. It is a little pricey, however you're paying for great tasting quality food. I usually spend about $12 for a combo which also includes a drink and chocolate covered strawberry - not bad at all. 

If you're ever unsure of which soup you want as there are a lot of great selections, you can try a sample for free! I definitely recommend the lobster bisque soup you get chunks of lobster - so delicious!"}
{"text":"Amazing spot , fast staff ever experienced and very generous , portions are big and extremely affordable"}
{"text":"Always crowded because your food is prepared quickly. Perfect spot to go to for healthy eats and even not so healthy eats because they have a few different desserts. Every meal you order comes with a chocolate strawberry. Their bisque soups are my favorite. You can taste the freshness in their meals. Their fusion drinks are awesome too."}
{"text":"Question, who doesn't want to chow down on yummy Seattle Salmon Chowder? Answer, This girl! Of course being from Seattle, I have high expectations as to what a Salmon Chowder should be, and although this chowder didn't quite meet my standards, it could have been a lot worse! 
My salad was great though, and I got both the soup and salad in a combo for just $7.99 and it included bread and a chocolate covered strawberry! You can't beat that price! 
The Cherry Coke wasn't working but they made up for it with a syrup bar where you can flavor your soda with whatever flavor you want, so that made up for not having Cherry Coke. 
The resturant was also very clean and the staff very friendly!"}
{"text":"First timer at Cafe Zupas. Service was excellent! Very quick and easy ordering process with lots of smiles. Food, not so much. First the asiago crostini I added for .59 to my soup was so stale I could barely chew it. I ordered the turkey avocado sandwich as well. It would of been decent if the turkey wasn't the cheap honey kind that tastes like ham. Blegh. I did enjoy the lobster bisque soup. Glad one thing was edible. I'm giving 2 stars, 1 for soup and 1 for service."}
{"text":"Apparently after my company spending about $10K in catering from this place over the past 2 years. In addition to random lunch meetings held there with clients.
This establishment said they are too busy to take a phone order. When asked why then a person is opening a door? They responded \"she is not trained for phone orders\"??!!! Really how long did it take to train her to \"push and not pull the door open\"??
I would suggest other companies seek alternative catering needs. If this place can not recognize who brings in their profits. They really need to be relocated and bring in Jason's Deli, or Paradise Bakery who does accommodate the bulk of their business. 
I am now going to be too busy to give my hard earned money for undertrained staff!!"}
{"text":"Great fresh variety of salads, soups, sandwiches.   If you are undecided you can get a combo.   They are quick to serve and staffed well"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! The soups and salads are so yummy. Definitely a great place for something light! Don't mind the chocolate covered strawberry either ;)"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a great siuo and sandwich place, this is it. 

I cannot stop eating the Wild Mushroom soup! It's magic. I recommend the Vegetarian sandwich. Very clean place and the staff is so nice. Their desserts are rad!"}
{"text":"Fits an awesome niche that I'd like to see more of: quick food that's super healthy and flavorful.  I got the combo pick 2 between ( Whole sandwich, soup, salad).  + you get a free chocolate dipped strawberry and bread roll. The strawberry just such a nice touch.

I got the tomato basil which was tasty, but a little sweet for my preferences. I like more of a strong acidic tomato flavor, but if you like more gentle tomato soup go for it.

Got the Chinese chicken salad which was very tasty and fresh. I liked that they didn't slather the thing in dressing, which is one killer when it comes to calorie control. A salad can still be 1000 calories if you use gobs of creamy dressing, bacon, cheese, tons of nuts, etc. but this salad you could see that it was pretty lean and tasty.

Turkey avocado sandwich was delicious. That's all I can say since if you've had one before, you probably now what this tastes like.

This reminds me of the healthy, marathon running healthier sister to Panera bread or corner bakery (which I do love but easy to overdo on calories). Cafe Zupas had a great concept and executed it well."}
{"text":"I got Protein cobb and this is what I get in my salad.
Very fresh zupas Very fresh brown salad.."}
{"text":"Cafe Zupas is always a good \"go to\" but it can be a bit pricy. If you stick to the \"Try 2\" combo, you can save a couple bucks. I always get the full sandwich & half soup for $10 
All their ingredients seem fresh and they have a great variety of Soup, Salad & Sandwiches. A lot of items are Zupas originals, so they are one of a kind. My favorite sandwich is Honey Bacon Club with Red Lobster Bisque soup. 
It's always a full house during the lunch hour, so plan on a crowd and sometimes a wait. 
I would recommend this place, but go during an \"off\" hour. 
I'm only giving 3 starts due to the lack of seating during the busy hours. You are holding a tray full of food & hot soup trying to make your way through a maze of tables, if you can even find an empty table."}
{"text":"Wonderful lite fare to eat on a hot summer day!  Salad was fresh and the sandwich was simply delicious!"}
{"text":"Not sure about all the hate mail because I was a regular when I lived in PHX and now it's my destination place when I come back for work or visiting friends.

I have never had a bad experience here. You have to know if you come during lunch - they will get busy and if a mistake is made - just tell them. I have never had a mistake - I usually get the Chipotle Chicken salad and whatever soup I am fancying for the day.

This to me is similar to Paradise Bakery. I am not a fan of Panera. I have sent messages to Cafe Zupas to come to CA because all I have is Panera - ugggh! You don't know how lucky you are to have Cafe Zupas you Phoenicians!"}
{"text":"Wow this was a surprise. I got the pulled pork sandwich with red cabbage and amazing sauce. I also got a bowl of the lobster bisque. Both were amazing fresh bread make that day and the bisque was buttery and delicious. I will definitely be coming back when I get a craving for super sandwiches. They also have an extensive salad menu."}
{"text":"I went there for a quick lunch and was very pleasantly surprised. 
The place was so busy and they know how to handle the demand. 

They have ordering down to a science and the employees are very friendly. 

I ordered the Cuban sandwich with the Wild Mushroom Bisque. The food came out in a very timely manner. The bill came to around $12 which is very reasonable.

They have self serve drinks where you can get the napkins and utensils. 

I decided to sit at the counter. There is a little screen where you can watch videos and be entertained. There are also plugs available to charge your phone which is great planning. 

The Cuban sandwich, Wow! one of the best I have ever had. The crust was nice and crunchy and inside was nice and soft. The pork was so tender. They add roasted peppers to it which I love. It was so savory and delicious. 

The Mushroom Bisque, It was so amazing, they added crispy onions on top which was another element that perfectly complimented the soup. There were nice big pieces of mushroom in it which gave a nice texture to the soup. They also give you a piece of baguette which I promptly cleaned the soup bowl with. 

One really nice thing they do is give you a chocolate dipped strawberry with your meal. Talk about a sweet ending. You cant help but smile after devouring it.

I will definitely go there again..."}
{"text":"Tried this place out for the first time tonight and, in a word, it was good. We went early, so they were virtually deserted, which gave us some time to ogle the surroundings and take in a what a nice looking place they have here. Very clean, lots of smooth glass and clean lines, very modern and inviting, but thankfully not over the top or too pretentious. A hard balance to achieve, so I give them bonus points for that one. 

Service at the counter was very pleasant, although I will say it seemed like the gals were having a bit too much fun since a couple of them couldn't stop giggling about how silly they looked doing their job. I know it's just a restaurant job that's a small step up from working at a fast food joint, but even if your job is a joke, you could at least pretend that it isn't for the customer's sake, right? Maybe I misread the whole thing, but it was a slight annoyance for the both of us and made ordering more awkward that it needed to be for new customers.

We both tried the pulled pork sandwiches, the wife went the salad route and I went soup, opting for the tomato basil. We also got one of the mini-brulee's for dessert to share. In terms of taste, the food we ordered was a solid 5 stars. Everything was good, fresh and delicious, especially the tomato soup. I will definitely be having that again. 

Unfortunately, as I see at least one other reviewer has also mentioned, the amount of soup you get when order a full bowl is negligibly more than the smaller size. I literally looked at the bowl and thought, \"That's it? Really?\" It stung even more when I realized how delicious it was, because then I really wanted for more. Couldn't bring myself to pay for more though, given the price vs. portion size. I thought maybe I was under served, but seeing it now in other reviews, I'm convinced it's standard practice to charge for a bowl of soup and give the customer half a bowl. Not sure if I can order a \"double shot\" next time to get a full bowl or what, but it's disappointing that you can't get more than half empty bowl for the money. 

As for the sandwich itself, it was extremely delicious. The honey mustard was just right (i.e. didn't taste 100% honey or 100% mustard, which too often passes for 'honey mustard') and the pork was just right. Portion size was dead on, just enough meat to feel hearty, but not falling out of the sandwich or leaving me with more bread than meat. No complaints here at all. 

The dessert was fantastic. Rich, creamy, chilled just enough and the perfect consistency. I'm glad it was so small, because if they'd given me a 5-gallon bucket of that brulee, I would have eaten the whole thing in one sitting. Definitely having that one again as well. 

So there you have it. The food is 5-star for a soup and sandwich joint, without question, and this is definitely the coolest, most modern looking sandwich place I've ever been to, but I'm left a bit disappointed by the maturity of some of the staff and, more importantly, the underwhelming portions for the full sized soups. Had I gotten a bowl of soup that was anywhere near as full as they advertise in their photos, I'd have been happy to give a 4-star review, but to get a half empty bowl at full price, that's just not cool. I'll definitely be back to try them again, and would certainly hope to be able to revise this review upward if I can get the amount of soup they advertise in their pictures, and if the staff tries to take their jobs a bit more seriously."}
{"text":"Puts Panera to absolute shame. More flavor, variety, and unique soups. 

After eating here, I'm fairly certain that Panera serves diarrhea."}
{"text":"They don't have any vegan options, they have one soup and i'm sure you could eat a salad. I would really like it if they could provide some more options, the employees don't seem to know what is and isn't vegan on their menu either."}
{"text":"I guess if I had to compare this place to something, it would be Paradise Bakery, but with some differences.  For one, I like that their combo includes a full sandwich, not a half. And personally, I enjoy their soup and salad selection more.  The sandwiches are always good too, but for me, the salads are what make this place so great.  Instead of a cookie with your meal, you get a chocolate-dipped strawberry - yum!  I recommend that you try it at least once."}
{"text":"My new favorite sandwich and soup place. Had visited 4x in the past 2 weeks, i just love their mushroom bisque soup and the turkey avocado artichoke sandwich. Not to mention the bread that goes with the soup!!!! Lobster bisque is my 2nd love :)"}
{"text":"I was out in the area on Monday of this week and had seen that this place had finally opened. I decided to drop in and see what it was like. It was definitely busy as it was lunchtime for the area. I work from home so I don't usually get to lunch out much. Anywho, there are lots of salads and soups and desserts on the menu. They have a combo where you can try half of one selection and combine it with another half of something so I chose to have half the garden chicken chop salad and a cup of the lobster bisque. I did not end up eating the bisque so I don't know how that tasted. The homemade blue cheese dressing was excellent though. And every meal comes with a chocolate covered strawberry made in the back of the restaurant (which you can see them doing as you are cruising through the line getting your fixins). Also, as an added bonus, these folks are skilled at handling the rush of lunch and get you in and out super fast. 
So if you like salads and soups and the combination of those as well..... definitely stop in and give them a try."}
{"text":"I really like Zuppas for a fast takeout lunch.  The German Sausage soup is the most amazing (probably high calorie) soup ever.  They have it in the fall and it's worth a trip there just for that soup.  All the soups are yummy and you can sample them before you commit.  You get a free chocolate dipped strawberry with your sandwich."}
{"text":"It was my first time here & I was excited to try their soups & salads, because I'd heard a lot of good things about this place but my experience will not have me coming back. I didn't think a line could move slower at this type of restaurant than Panera Bread but they have them topped. The workers here were nice but nothing exceptional. The two girls at the register were talking about their personal lives loud enough for everyone in line to hear, which seemed unprofessional. 

The big issue I had was with the food. I got an Asian salad & a lobster soup. The salad barely had any meat & the soup tasted a little off. Hours later I started feeling sick & then the next morning I spent a good 24 hours puking & having other bodily fluid issues. I will not be suggesting this business to others & would advise anyone that is going to try it out for themselves to not get any of the soups with lobster, unless you want to leave with food poisoning."}
{"text":"This place is great if you are in a hurry to grab lunch like I was today. The staff is super friendly and they were quick to move people threw the line.

My small complaint is that I ordered a half chopped chicken salad and they didn't put the egg or bacon on it. :(. I also ordered the honey bacon club. That was made right and was super delicious!

It was combo and reasonably priced for the amount of food you get. I got the sandwich, a half salad (which is pretty big) and then they add in bread and a chocolate covered strawberry all for under $9!!!

I will be going back and would recommend it to others"}
{"text":"I really like this place. I have been here multiple times. The food is tasty and fresh. They have different flavor teas, juices and waters that are an interesting and yummy. They have different soups, salads, sandwiches and protein bowls. Each dish comes with a chocolate covered strawberry which is a nice touch. The only reason that it does not get five stars is that the last time I was there it was very very busy and they kept getting people's orders wrong. I hope that this was just a glitch."}
{"text":"We are big fans of Paradise Bakery..we eat there at least 2-3 times a week (it's down the street from us..can you blame us)?!
Much like Paradise Bakery, there is a soup and salad/sandwich combo offering.
You get a whole sandwich, AND a lovely chocolate dipped strawberry (disappointing for my husband-he really loves the cookie thing at Paradise Bakery).

I had a pulled pork sandwich (great) and the Yucatan Chicken soup (sooo good) you can even sample the soup! How fun is that?!

My only complaint, is that it feels a tad claustrophobic at this location. The tables are all jumbled together and there is this \"recharge your device\" thing in the center that is really very wasted space. If the tables were spaced out more, I would definitely give this 4 stars. 

Someone else mentioned the awkward feel of the ordering area. I'm going to agree on that, though I felt that way with Paradise bakery. It can feel a little chaotic when it's crowded and you're not quite sure what to do."}
{"text":"Since my last review I have become gluten intolerant. Oh how I wish it were a fad like so many people think, but it's real. The only thing I get from Zupas is the kale and quinoa salad. Yesterday I asked if the dressing is gluten free. I've had the salad several times and never had a reaction but last week I got cross contaminated glutened so I'm hyper aware. I was told that their kitchen is not a gluten free kitchen, but wheat is not added to the dressing. Eight hours after eating my delicious salad I started experiencing abdominal pain. It has now been 17 hours later and I still have abdominal pain.

I am not mad at Zupas. I am mad at myself because the salad was good but not that good. Anyone with gluten issues should not dine here."}
{"text":"Work one block from here normally eat here often as do many of my employees very dissatisfied with the customer service as the cashier snarled and rolled her eyes at me if this customer service continues we won't be returning! Thanks"}
{"text":"WILL NOT BE COMING HERE EVER AGAIN!!!!!
I have a major peanut allergy and after I had the pina colada salad I had symptoms of my allergies. Looking back, I tasted something \"peanutty\", but thought it might just all be in my head and had hope that they would be extremely cautious with the peanuts and not mistakenly use the same scooper, or wouldn't mistake the peanuts for the toasted coconut shreds, but right after eating a few bites I immediately started having sharp stomach pains, and my mouth was feeling tingly like I had just eaten a peanut!!!!!! 
Lost all respect for Zupas! They need to be more careful especially since peanut allergies are very common."}
{"text":"First time here and I got the BBQ Chicken salad. Wish I would of paid more attention to the menu because it came with black olives and I hate olives. However, I just picked them out & it was fine. Wasn't the best salad I've ever had, they could put more chicken (more bang for your buck). I felt that this place was very pricey and mediocre, Your typical health food spot."}
{"text":"I usually visit the Cafe Zupas in Chandler but decided to give the one in Mesa a try today. The employees were very unfriendly and unprofessional. The manager does not do a good job managing the employees and it wouldn't hurt her or any of the other employees to smile every once in a while. The same plates and leftover food that was sitting on the outside tables when we arrived was being eaten by birds when we left because no one bothered cleaning up the plates.  The food wasn't as fresh and I was not impressed. Three stars is probably being generous."}
{"text":"Fresh salads! Great dressing ! & great service ! :) what more can a first time customer ask for !? I will definitely go back a thousand times more lol"}
{"text":"This is a great place to go when you're in a hurry. The set-up is similar to a buffet, except, they make the meals for you when you go down the line. It's confusing at first, but after coming in once, you get used to it. They also have this cool \"soda bar\" near their soda machines, and you are able to mix in flavors into lemonades and sodas to create your own drink! It's pretty neat. 
Another plus is that they give you a slice of bread and a chocolate covered strawberry with every single meal! I absolutely love the fact that we always get a small treat after. 
The only downfall is that you have to repeat your order again before you pay for your meal to confirm which food you got, which gets repetitive after coming more than twice. 
Overall, it's a healthier fast food option, and the food is always tasty."}
{"text":"Revised update - went there today only to find it closed on Sundays. How does a restaurant open a location next to a major mall and have it closed on one of the two busiest traffic/shopping days of the week? If you are a mom and pop type establishment and don't want to work Sundays then open in a mom and pop location where people don't go out on Sunday. i'll support restaurants that want everyone's business and doesn't discriminate on Sundays."}
{"text":"Would get four stars if they would not have the AC so cold.  Bring a sweater. Overall I like their menu.  Soups are either really good or not so much.  Try the lobster bisque or Yucatan chicken.  Wish they had real silverware.  Overall a better choice than Panerai or paradise bakery if you can stand the frigid temp and loud music... Two things restaurants to do ensure quick table turnover."}
{"text":"Soup, salad, sandwich .. fresh food made to order.. I enjoy the choose 2 combo.. soup & salad, salad& sandwich, soup & sandwich .. $9.39

Lots of great salad options.. mangoberry, CA protein Cobb, strawberry harvest, BBQ chicken and lots more.. including seasonal options..

The chicken tortilla soup is low calorie (110 cal /half bowl) and big flavor .. just slightly spicy.. the pumpkin chorizo was the seasonal soup.. it was delish (they let you sample if you're not sure what to have) but I wasn't sure it wasn't made with dairy it was that creamy..

The strawberry harvest salad (390 cal/ half bowl) loaded with chicken, apple, dried cranberries, strawberries & candies pecans.. was crunchy, fresh and flavorful!! 

And of course a side dinner roll with cold butter and a chocolate dipped strawberry to round out your meal."}
{"text":"All I can say is wow! Amazingly good! They put so much stuff on their salads and sandwiches. Their desserts are to die for. I really liked that they gave me a chocolate covered strawberry free with my combo. And I loved that they had different flavored syrups for your drinks. It was kind of chaotic and crowded when I went but I understand why after eating there. Better than Paradise Bakery in my opinion"}
{"text":"I'm torn between 2 and 3 stars on Cafe Zupas, as I'm not all that excited about eating here. I've been here twice now, and I'm just not a fan. Its' not that its bad-its just doesn't do anything for me, and I find myself at a loss every time I eat here.

I've been here twice now, and today was better then the first time I went.  Cafe is large, with ample seating and great decor.  Plenty of help, lots of people during lunch hour, staff is friendly, with plenty of menu options.   Most of the stuff is to odd for me, and doesn't hit the spot for what I feel like eating.

Cafe Zupas has quite a few healthy choices of food, from soups, to salads, and sandwiches.  I can do healthy food, and if the menu were more like Zoe's, I would probably be a fan.  Hot Lobster bisque when its 100 degrees outside? eh, no thanks.  A large salad with stuff I dislike on it? No thanks either.  I don't like funky salads!  I don't need 14 varieties of nuts, berries and weird stuff on it.  I can appreciate a good salad, but I don't want to feel like a squirrel!  lol

Anyways, today was fine, I stuck with the grilled cheese sandwich with a pop for a grand total of $7.30.   I was a little shocked because the sandwich was only $4.99..which means my pop was almost $2.00! I don't mean to sound cheap, but my coworker and I both wanted a cheap, light easy lunch, and we were surprised that it was so much. 

Anyways, I will probably be back since we rotate this place into our lunch places that we eat at since its right across the street from work.  I definitely wouldn't go back on my own, that's for sure.  Even though I try to seek out healthy dining options, I'm just not a fan!"}
{"text":"I Had zupas for lunch today I ordered the tomato basil with orzo soup which was phenomenal. They give you a chocolate covered strawberry which is awesome.  I also had their berry creme Brule which was also phenomenal.  The only thing I don't like is that they are closed on Sunday. I can't wait to order more soup from here!"}
{"text":"I will start off by saying I love Zupas, but will NEVER come back to this location off 215 and Rainbow again. I have a SEVERE ALLERGY to quinoa and before placing my order I let the employees know and asked for items with NO quinoa OR cross contamination. They said they would make sure that my food didn't touch any quinoa. I ordered a sandwich on whole wheat bread. After two bites I started to feel my face itch and swell, so I asked 2 employees at the register if the bread had quinoa it it, they both confidently stated no so I sat back down thinking the itching was just in my head. A few minutes later one of the employees came back saying there IS quinoa in the bread! The GM expressed ZERO concern, then proceeded to argue that she didn't know what we expected her to do about it and that next time I should make sure I tell a manager about my allergy before ordering food. Next time a customer tells any of your employees that they have an allergy, I hope you take it much more seriously. You are lucky my allergy is not fatal or even more severe than it is. They should be knowledgeable about what they are making. If they don't know, THEY should ask the manager rather than reassuring the customer that they will be taken care of WITHOUT knowing. The GM kept arguing with us, so my friend took care of the rest as I ran out to get Benadryl. The manager refunded my food, but the $10 didn't even matter to me. It was the way the manager handled the situation as I have to deal with my allergic reaction. Don't ever argue with your customers especially when you have caused harm to their wellbeing! If they apologized and made sure I was ok and that they would make sure it didn't happen again, and tried to make things right without arguing I would have understood that mistakes happen and hope they would learn from it. I definitely would have come back if this was handled appropriately, but because of the poor customer service, insensitivity, and arguing I will NEVER come to this location again and will make sure I tell everyone I know not to as well!"}
{"text":"This place is always amazing!! They do very week when we call in our staff meeting order of 12-14 people. Very helpful and quick to make the food. 

Last time I called they wouldn't put our names on our orders for us so was a bit upset... he said we had to have 15 and order boxes which didn't have the chocolate cover strawberries. 

So took a bit of everyone saying which is mine etc... 

I ordered the lobster bisque soup and the crab sandwich both amazing together!!!!"}
{"text":"First of all the girl who made my salad had the worst customer service. I believe her name was Sarah. Didn't say one word to me. Had the worst stank face ever, and literally ignored my existence even though I'm a paying customer. My salad was mediocre, and that's trying to be a little nice. Eh. Not worth even trying it."}
{"text":"Improve your employees training. I had at least 4 times of incorrect or missing items in my take away orders. Today the bread that comes with the soup was missing. One time they put bacon in the salad when I had informed no bacon. One it was missing ranch. When I called today to inform about the missing bread, I was told that they are busy with dinner orders and can't talk now. Was asked to come in and get complimentary bread! The lady whom I spoke with was rude. I like the food, but customer service is equally important. Looks like Zupas does not have a system to address customer complaints. Better get it fixed and give more training to your employees. It's not about a small piece of bread, but the inconvenience it causes."}
{"text":"I choked on a one inch piece of hard plastic (like a bread tab) in my soup and will not purchase soup there again. the manager did refund my order and was very nice but insisted that the plastic was not familiar or used in anything the restaurant made daily... so where did the plastic come from? I don't know but I won't trust eating there again."}
{"text":"Decided yesterday during lunch that my boyfriend and I would check this place out! He had the Pulled Pork Sandwich and I had the California turkey, both paired with the clam chowder. The food was pretty delicious and I love that they make everything in front of you :) I have to agree with other reviews and say that it was pretty nippy inside especially towards the back of the building. Felt like an icebox lol Also, who doesn't love chocolate covered strawberries and a slice of bread? Complementary with your meal! Good stuff and will be back again!"}
{"text":"Looking for a healthy, quick, and reasonably priced place for lunch? Look no further. I've eaten here a handful of times. 

Today however solidified this is gonna be a regular place for me. 1st, You'll always be greeted by a friendly employee. What really made me feel this is my place, was when two separate employees welcomed me back! This was just my second time at this location in the last two months! 

Kudos for understanding the importance of customer service and going above and beyond. 

That simply statement of \"Welcome back\" really told me...Zupas appreciates my business!

Please stop by and check them out!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to this restaurant. It was a little overwhelming at first because there are so many options. I chose the build your own salad. It was good but my friends went on and on about how good their salads were. So next time I'll probably order one of their specialty salads. Now the really cool part, we all got a piece of French bread. The bread was soft and delicious but that's not all...we each got a chocolate dipped strawberry, a free bonus that I didn't expect! I like little surprises like that!!!"}
{"text":"Cheap, quick, easy, and delicious. You get a chocolate covered strawberry with every purchase. Haven't had a soup, salad or sandwich that has disappointed me yet (and I go about 1-2 times a month). Try their basil white tea."}
{"text":"God forbid you should have any allergies and ask the manager if he wouldn't mind checking an item on his menu for an ingredient that causes people severe migraines. He not only refused but skirted my question with some BS about their ingredients possibly being from different vendors and they have no control over what's in it...Blah, Blah, Blah. Horrible processed food full of sodium nitrites and MSG. definitely won't go back. im sure many people will like this place but there is nothing fresh or healthy about it. UGH!"}
{"text":"Best healthy and quick lunch with an affordable price!
I am on a restricted diet due to health issues, but don't have food alergies. 
This gets 5 stars in my book. 

I love the fruit salads paired with a veggie sandwich, that's my 'Go to' combo.
The soups are really good too!
The menu is simple, but has enough diversity to keep coming back.

They always add a chocolate covered strawberry to every order which is nice touch.

Great for business or family."}
{"text":"I hate to rate this place 3 stars because I think the idea/execution is pretty spot on. 
Good fresh food at very reasonable prices. 

I have to ding this place because of the staff though...
Every time I come here they just don't feel welcoming and I seem to get that 'please get me out of here' attitude.
With so many options and ways to customize your food the staff needs to be patient, kind, and helpful during the ordering process. Instead every time I get to the counter they just stare at me blankly and awkwardly while I start to feel the pressure and end up just picking the first thing that sounds good. I know it can't be easy dealing with indecisive people all day but just give me a \"No rush!\" Or \"Let me know if you need any help!\" or something instead the glaring monotonous hatred I feel every time I'm here. (Okay maybe that was overboard)

My girlfriend was building a salad and asked for some of the shredded mozzarella and the lady blankly replied \"That's not mozzarella\"... That's it. 
No \"It's actually jack\" or \"we have mozzarella over here!\" 
All of the interactions just seemed slightly forced and awkward and I just got the feeling that they really disliked the guests.

All in all I'll probably be back because I still like the food, concept and the price. Just remember that when you don't like your job it shows more than you think."}
{"text":"Yum!! Such a delicious lunch spot!

The Cuban pork sandwich and chicken enchilada chili is seriously delicious. They even give you a chocolate dipped strawberry with your meal."}
{"text":"I love this place! I am mostly a steak and potatoes kind of guy but I do try to eat more health when I can. I don't know if I would classify this place as healthy necessarily but the salads are great, the sandwiches are great, deserts are great! I recently got the Cuban Sandwich which was awesome and a strawberry harvest chicken salad and I normally get half a sandwich and salad and leave full and happy. I would definitely return to this place. Even  if you are not crazy about salads it is awesome! My kids like it too."}
{"text":"My first time eating here I really enjoyed it. Very fast service and the food was fresh. Very healthy and great for after a work out after the gym"}
{"text":"The food was very good and the portions were huge! I thought for sure my eyes were bigger than my stomach, but I managed to clean my plate. For a soup/salad/sandwich place, I was a little annoyed there weren't more vegetarian options, but I did try the Vermont Maple Blueberry salad. It was pretty sweet and felt a little like I was eating dessert. :) I got the salad/sandwich combo and tried the Vegetarian sandwich. It was very tasty with lots of veggies.

We went during the lunch rush, and the line was very long and didn't seem to move very fast. The dining area was pretty loud - much louder than I expected. There is a small outdoor seating area, but nothing large enough for our group of 7."}
{"text":"The BBQ chicken salad, the chocolate dipped strawberries, with the roll on the side, AMAZING! Their paninis are awesome as well. The French onion soup of the month was yummy! Very affordable! Love this place."}
{"text":"Had the Chicken Pesto Sandwich, Mushroom Soup, Thai Mango Salad, Chicken Barbecue Salad and everything was really GOOD!!! The Mushroom Soup is probably one of the BEST soups I've had in my soup eating career. 

Service was great too and we appreciate the chocolate covered strawberry and the variety in flavored drinks. New favorite spot for a healthier fast food option!!! :)"}
{"text":"Everything tastes awesome. 

But...the veggie soup is almost nothing but broth, I only got LITERALLY 4 pieces of tofu in my bowl and it's extremely over priced for how much food you're getting. Don't bother."}
{"text":"Great portions, great fresh food. I'm from out of town incase hope this will be coming my way soon!"}
{"text":"My new favorite restaurant. Especially when you want a very light meal, more like a snack meal. Good service started a the door, with an employee explaining the system from step one.

#1* The choices, Create your own salad, all fresh and in front of you to pick from. Excellent quantity and quality choices. Good options for vegetarians and vegans. 12 signature salads.  We had the summer chicken salad. Very balanced ingredients. Half salad quite large.

#2* The soups, 10 choices, 4 of them vegetarian. All looked and smelled wonderful. The sample of Tuscan bean was excellent. A very nice touch offering a sample. 

#3* The sandwiches,  12 choices 5 cold, 7 grilled panini, 1 vegetarian. 

#4* Everything else, great drink choices, make your own Italian soda station. Great option for low sugar choices and good quality syrups. Some of the lowest prices on drinks I've seen. Bread also included with soup and salad. No extra charge here.

Combo's. Great choices. Sandwiches and salad combo plenty for two people looking for large snack or light meal.

Desert, a chocolate covered strawberry with each meal. YUM! YUM!

Excellent about answering allergy questions. They have a prepared binder of common allergens. Very helpful, and keep me away from potential problem items.

Only one minor negative, add another vegetarian sandwich."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time yesterday. As soon as we walked in we were greeted and asked if we had any questions. The recommendations were great as my wife and I tried the BBQ chicken salad, pulled pork sandwich and the honey bacon panini. All were great and we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"There was an inch long cockroach in my mother's salad and when we showed the cashier she didn't offer to refund me or that they'll check their salad inventory she just said \"we'll get a new one made for you\""}
{"text":"I absolutely love Zupas.  There are only a couple issues; it's a little pricey, and the sandwiches are just ok.  Their salad is awesome, and their soups are unreal.  The combos are $7.99 and are plenty to fill you up. The complementary chocolate covered strawberry is just a bonus.  This place is awesome.  I recommend it to everyone.  Don't expect a cozy atmosphere, however.  It is always crowded, and very loud here. Here's a few tips; the nuts and berry salad is delicious and comes with ample GIANT fresh berries, and the mushroom bisque soup is ridiculously tasty, and I don't personally care for mushrooms."}
{"text":"1st time for a quick lunch take-out. Soup & Salad Combo for ~$8.50 seemed right. Asian Chicken Salad and New England Clam Chowder hit the spot. The place was bubbling with energy - businessmen, Mom's with their kids, Millennials, etc. Something for everyone. An excellent menu, 'all-you-can-drink' - clean and comfy. A new lunch hang..."}
{"text":"One of my choices for a quick lunch. Extensive offer of soups, good desserts and nice ambiance. Fast service!"}
{"text":"This review is for the new store on rainbow in the southwest but because they all have the same food I will leave my review on here . I will never understand what the hype is over ..high priced , mediocre food ??!! I ordered a panni turkey , bacon , avo and cheese . it looked like a 500 lb person sat on it when it was served to me ! I understand its grilled I get that but smashed is not what it should be ...anyhow , thank God for the 50 ? of mailer because my mediocre , smashed sandwich and soup would have been $ 10.86 instead of the five dollars I paid for it ! So that was a relief . The hundreds of screaming brats running around was such an added pleasure ! NOT ! I'll stick with paying for real deli sandwiches ! Zuppa cafe not worth the money in my book !"}
{"text":"I got the lobster bisque which was amazing! Great rich flavor. Not too lobster-y. The bread was okay. My chocolate covered strawberry was small. The biggest disappointment was the Ultimate Grilled Cheese. I had ordered this before, and it was really good... This time, all I tasted was bland bread and bland cheese. It was missing the pesto spread and tasted completely different. I couldn't even finish it. The fruit infused water, though, is delicious!"}
{"text":"Thumbs up. Quick service even during the weekday lunch rush. Large array of healthy salads and the lobster bisque and Tomato basil soups are great. Excellent touch with the complimentary side of bread and chocolate strawberry. Great for takeout or eat in and reasonably priced. Cant go wrong if you are a soup and salad fan"}
{"text":"Soups and sandwiches are some of my favorite foods. I've been here once during the lunch day rush. I ordered the tomato basil soup and the pesto grilled cheese (tomato soup and grilled cheese is one of my all-time favorites). I liked it; it was a more grown up twist on my childhood favorite meal. The rocky road brownie is quite delicious. The chocolate covered strawberries are a nice touch."}
{"text":"Great food. Great service. Great portions. A good choice if you are trying to eat healthier."}
{"text":"So I used to really love this place but every time I have gone in it has just gotten worse and worse as you can see I ordered a turkey bacon avocado only to get no avocado and very little bacon and tomato. I'm pretty disappointed as I love this sandwich and it's a shame I won't be going back everyone knows avocado is expensive but this is another level of cheap. The saving grace was the free strawberry but even those have gotten smaller and smaller each time I come. I guess it's time to go to panara bread instead.:/"}
{"text":"I want to love this place, I really do but I don't think I'll return for a few reasons:  
1) Why do I have to tell them what I ordered three times?  each employee asks what I ordered, then when I get to the cash register I have to tell them again what I ordered, when I come in with five meal orders I can't remember everything, why do they not have a better system for this?
2) When I ask for bacon to be cooked extra crispy they used to do it for me now they tell me they are not allowed to. Seriously? chewy uncooked bacon is not cool.  Even McDonalds can oblige this request.
3) The portions.  I should be full after spending 10 dollars on a salad but when they only put a couple pieces of chicken and charge nearly $2 for more or can't fill the soup bowl up it comes across as pretty stingy.  
4) Upcharges on everything.  At the prices they charge for everything they should be able to add extra cheese or croutons free of charge.

The food is very tasty and I'd love to return but the above reasons are enough to find another place."}
{"text":"MY FAVORITE CAFE EVER. Best food ever!!! My favorite is the garden bisque and mango berry salad. I usually do the pick 2 deal! Sooo good. I recently became allergic to mushrooms but before I was I LOVED their mushroom bisque. Incredible flavor!!! The customer service at this location is wonderful too!!"}
{"text":"This zuppas location is fairly new. I walked into a packed place but I was able to get my food in about 5 minutes from order to paying. The food is really delicious, healthy choices and a very clean place."}
{"text":"Get the lobster bisque soup--it's amazing. I've been here a couple times and always opt for the pick two combo- a half salad or soup and full sandwich. I've gotten the turkey and the chicken pesto which were both really fresh and appetizing. I love that they give you bread and a chocolate covered strawberry to complete the meal. Overall, solid choice for lunch. Located right in Dana Park, lots of parking and seating, good customer service, and fair prices."}
{"text":"I love the pick two combo. I had the cauliflower soup with a power salad. The food was all fresh and they prepare it for you as you order. I loved the chocolate dipped strawberry that comes with your meal!!  The desserts looked amazing. If I wasn't beyond full I could've had a hard time choosing between them. They were nicely displayed. The staff was also great. The store is new so I figured there may be some kinks but everyone worked together and they were all so friendly. 

Highly recommend going here!!! It's nice to have a place like this in Chandler!"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised the first time I went to cafe Zupas. The sandwiches that I was interested in were very good and the clam chowder was nice and thick. I would have definitely given it 4 stars. 

Not all good things last though. I recently went for the 3rd time and was very disappointed. First off they had decided to discontinue the sale of some of their very good sandwiches including the Thai peanut sandwich and Asian Pork sandwich. I particularly liked these sandwiches because they tasted great and they were unique. I had another sandwich which was just ok. In addition, the clam chowder was now very watery. I probably will not be back.

I do have to point out though that the customer service is always very good and they have other food choices but after their decisions about what they are excluding it just left a bad taste in my mouth (figuratively)."}
{"text":"What I got was yummy. I got the 2 combo; half Berry Mango salad and Crab Avocado BLT sans bacon. I must say it was very filling. My colleagues got different 2 combos and everyone was happy with their food. They've different kinds of beverages and I got the Tumeric drink. Oh, the 2 combos come with 1 strawberry dipped in chocolate desert and bread. I didn't eat the bread but the desert was delicious. Pricing was reasonable about $13.50. I highly recommend this place. Unfortunately, they do charge for crotons if you order soup."}
{"text":"This was a solid, but not spectacular lunch.  We arrived shortly after opening at 11 on a weekday.  There were a couple of people already ahead of us in line.  It's a bit overwhelming, lots of soup, salads, and sandwiches to choose from.  You can sample the soups, which was cool.  My favorites were the gumbo and clam chowder, I'll order one of those next time we eat here.  For lunch, I had the bacon turkey and honey mustard sandwich with the BBQ chicken salad.  The sandwich was pretty average, I could have easily made it at home.  White bread with a bit of turkey and decent honey mustard smashed with a Panini press.  I was not impressed and won't order this again, don't know why I talked myself out of the pulled pork.

The salad was a good portion for the price, the chicken had no flavor, but the BBQ sauce was good.  I could have used more, also more onions.  No heat on this salad, I'll try to see if they have jalapenos or something next time.  Salads come with bread, which was no good, and a chocolate covered strawberry, which was fantastic.  It was a very good quality strawberry, juicy and deep red  color.  

The wife had the Wisconsin cauliflower soup with the red pepper Caesar salad.  I liked the salad, but it needed a little more dressing.  It was dry, but too much dressing would have drowned it.  The soup was very surprising, I am not a cauliflower person so I was not expecting to like it.  But, it's basically a cheese soup.  Yet another example that soups and stews are great places to hide veggies.  It was thick and hearty, a definite repeat.

Service was great, everyone was friendly, and even with all the options, the line moves along very quickly.  I think this location has found a place that will be here for several years."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place!! This was my first time going and I will go again. This is not a sit down restaurant like some people think. You have to wait in line for your food and seat yourself. This didn't bother me at all, for me it works because I have small children. It's noisy so if my kids scream, like they always do.. no one will mind.

We ordered the crab and avocado  sandwich and it was so good! Lots of crab and avocado, while I'm not crazy about warm avocado it was fine. Mango berry salad was the thing I was most excited about trying and it was just okay. I thought I ordered a large but I guess they gave me a half and forgot to put any almonds on it. Hardly no dressing but from what I could taste the dressing was good. Next time I'm skipping this. The best thing we had was the Lobster Bisque. It was a huge portion for $6! It had actual lobster pieces in it and other vegetables and a great flavor. 

I would come back to try other things. It's very cheap and for the quality of the food it's great!"}
{"text":"I'm upset at myself for not trying this place out sooner then I should have because this place is just soooo good. Sorry Panera bread, but you've been replaced. Upon ordering, the gentlemen who assisted me and my friend was very welcoming and well mannered. It was my first time so he allowed me to sample the soup. I chose the crab bisque but the tomato basil soup was super good as well. Also I chose the crab avocado sandwich. I had a seafood craving that day, haha. I love how the portions are double of what bread gives for about the same price! I couldn't even finish all my food but can't forget about dessert so I also purchased the cheesecake and got a free strawberry dipped chocolate. Also, the place is very clean and the kind worker took away our dirty plates away from us :) I will return to try out other items!"}
{"text":"COMPLETELY OFF THE CHARTS, DELICIOUS!!!!! You can actually taste the natural flavors! Their amazing environment and awesome food make the best combination! You can watch them make the food from scratch! Also, they give you a free chocolate strawberry and a free piece of bread for every meal you buy! I LOVE THIS PLACE! You can also make your own soda!"}
{"text":"Best workday lunch spot. Fast, easy and healthy. Can get crowded for the lunch rush but worth it."}
{"text":"This place is so amazing!!!!!! Always great service and the food is so healthy and amazing. .. I would recommend Zupas to everybody."}
{"text":"Its soooo good. Lobster grilled cheese and lobster bisque combo was wonderful.  Hubs has the pulled pork sandwich which was very good as well. We like the infused water too."}
{"text":"The cashier just gave the young lady who ordered 1 soup a sample cup to try the new drinks.

When he rang up my salad, soup, & dessert, no sample cup was offered. Then I heard him offer the lady behind me a sample cup as well.

The customer service is getting worse & now bias! Get it together ownership!"}
{"text":"Excellent food! Overpriced salads thought, they are so stingy with the toppings! Since the dressing is amazing I keep going back."}
{"text":"I love this place! There chipotle chicken salad is to die for! Always clean and bread customer service. Being closed on Sunday's is there O"}
{"text":"I am not a fan of the food at all. The salad was drenched in dressing. Not healthy and not delicious. There was no attention to how the salad was made. It was just thrown together. Go to soup plantation or sweet tomato if that's what you want. You will spend a lot less and have a better salad. For what you get, the food wasn't cheap. 

Also they will ask If you want something but they won't tell you it's an extra fee. I caught them doing that to everyone in my room and when I pointed out the fees before we paid no one caught on. So beware!

Overall I would not go back. I was unimpressed by the salad because the flavors were off and nothing seemed fresh. Most of the food seems prepackaged or filled with preservatives. 

I can't presume that the food here is unhealthy but in no way would I consider it a place where I would go if I were being health conscious. It really seems full of preservatives and not very fresh.  Salad places should be full of raw food options that are fresh and unique in flavor. 

My opinion... Go to presto instead. Make the drive to rainbow and tropicana! P.S. I'm not affiliated with Presto I was just super impressed by the food! 

Sadly very disappointed in this place."}
{"text":"I loveeeee Cafe Zupas!  I like how they serve healthy foods at a fantastic price.  I feel good eating it and my wallet feels good going there.

Zupas is right down the street from my work, so I go there frequently.  I've tried many of the sandwiches and salads and they are all excellent.  I also like how they give out a free chocolate dipped strawberry with every meal.  I usually don't have sweets, but I would make an exception here.

If you haven't been here - I highly recommend checking it out!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is by far my absolute favorite place to go and eat! The service is quick and convenient. The staff is always friendly and nice. The food is fresh and made with great, quality ingredients. The soups are home made daily. All of the soups taste amazing! You can not go wrong with whichever one that you choose. The sandwiches and salads are all good portions. And the best part of the meal is of course the chocolate dipped strawberry that is given with every order. Yummy!"}
{"text":"I have visited this location quite a few times and have been disappointed the last two times I've gone. The first time they were out of rolls...they were still frozen. I asked the cashier if they could substitute something in the place of the roll and she said no. She told me the rolls are complimentary so I actually wasn't missing anything from the meal I was paying for. Last night we went and they were out of tomatoes. However, I could see lots of tomatoes in the back kitchen. I asked about them and was told that they were for tomorrow's soup. The customer service is terrible and these young kids don't have any answers to make the customer feel valued. Re-training might be in order...and also, don't run out of food."}
{"text":"I've never been super fond of Zupas, but this location is particularly disappointing. I recently had a soup and sandwich, both were colder than they should have been. If I wanted a cold tomato soup I would have found a place that serves gazpacho. Also, it wasn't particularly busy but there were trays and dishes everywhere near the trashcan. Unacceptable."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now and service is always friendly the establishment always clean and the food constantly delicious. My only complaint... the ratio of protein (chicken/pork) to the ratio of salad isn't very good. I always have to ask for \"extra\" at an \"up charge\" six crumbles of chicken in a large salad is sad. Other than that the place is great."}
{"text":"I really want this place to work because the concept is great, but . . .

I usually get take out.  They have changed their containers and now they are compartmentalized.  You get the same size container no matter what size salad you get.  Interestingly, a small salad looks the same size as a large salad in this container.  It is really hard to eat the salad in these containers.  

I also like the idea of getting a chocolate covered strawberry with every meal, but if they are going to give chocolate covered strawberries, then they need to cover most of the strawberry and not just the bottom tip of it.

I give this criticism in hopes that Zupas takes it and improves on it.  I want this place to work out."}
{"text":"Great lunch spot. A bit on the pricey side, but worth it for me. They have salads, panini, sandwiches and soups. They offer all of those in a combo. They also have kids menu. With the soup you will get a nice piece of bread and every meal you get a chocolate covered strawberry. The cauliflower soup and BBQ chicken salad are my go-to lunch items here. Really good. 

If you walk in and there is a line, don't fret cause it goes by really fast. They have a great selection of teas and lemonade as well. The desserts are all really good too when I feel like pigging out. 

I wish they had more coupons or a punch card or something. It would give me more incentive to go more."}
{"text":"Zupas used to be our Saturday lunch spot. I really loved the lobster bisque. The last 2 times there, the bisque really went downhill! It is now watery and lacking taste!
Sorry, Zupas, we found a new lunch spot!"}
{"text":"I was in AZ for work and so happy I came here! Seriously - I wish we had them in DC! I thought the selection was good but both times I went, I got the same thing. I didn't feel like I was eating unhealthy when I had the mangoberry salad and tomato soup. The portion size was great and I love that it came with a piece of bread and a chocolate covered strawberry. What a sweet touch. If I could easily visit a Cafe Zupas, I would definitely return to try the paninis and I would create my own salad. I love having that option.

Additionally, the staff seemed nice and the dining room and bathrooms were clean. 

Care to expand to the DC area??"}
{"text":"Good for soup and salad  combo. I had been to one  of these in Utah and had the  Cuban Pork sandwich and the Chicken Enchilada soup.The soup was very salty as others have said and for some reason the sandwich was just okay.  I wonder if different soups have different sodium levels, they offer samples so it is probably a good idea if you are worried about the sodium levels. Went to this location on a weekday at lunch and with 10 people n front of us still got through the line pretty quickly.  Good selection of both soups and salads, I got the Chipotle Pork and liked it a lot.  The mushroom soup was delicious, rich, and flavorful without being salty..  Definitely reminded me of Paradise Bakery  but slightly higher price and I'd rather have a cookie then a chocolate dipped strawberry."}
{"text":"Great looking menu. Salad was weak on the dressing, not much flavor due to that. Soup was great. They forgot our rolls that go with our soup, & they forgot our chocolate dipped strawberries."}
{"text":"5 stars isn't nearly enough! Food was the best I've had in awhile! Service 100% on point and the prices are  VERY REASONABLE. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Not only was the person helping me with my soup rude, as packing starving I come home to see my LARGE is more along the lines of extra medium."}
{"text":"Cafe Zupas is pretty much the whole package. 
A wide variety of delicious soups, sandwiches, salads, and desserts. Everything is really good and very reasonably priced. You can tell that they used high quality ingredients since the food tastes gourmet for being a fast casual place."}
{"text":"I loved how clean and fresh everything looked! The staff was super friendly and answered all of my boyfriend's questions. I was a little disappointed to hear that adding additional veggies to my salad was an extra cost but was glad to hear that upfront. The lobster bisque was very flavorful and had great texture. I would've, however preferred for there to have been a tiny bit more lobster in it. The fresh lemonade was delicious! Not too sweet, not too tarter, just as it should be. Overall, I really loved this place, and will definitely be back to try the rest of the menu out."}
{"text":"I have been here in the past while visiting the area. Was quite disappointed this time. My Citrus Berry Chicken salad had very little chicken, a couple of each kind of berry, and a small amount of cheese. Tasty but small. I had the cauliflower soup as well, which was slightly warm (not hot) with a small sprinkle of cheddar cheese on top (an upcharge of $.69). Wow! Nearly $30 for lunch and not satisfied. Was always one of my favorite places to stop but may be looking elsewhere now."}
{"text":"Great Job! Daizsa as well as the rest of the team has been awesome; started ordering lunch to go for the office and everything has been ready on time, correct and delicious! Very helpful and friendly staff, new favorite lunch spot for our office!"}
{"text":"Good food, ALL SUPER FRESH.. I enjoyed it. Place is very busy.. so the noise is not so good in their. Service is friendly.  Go with Gumbo Soup, Alvacado Crab Sandwich.. Yummmmmmmy and dont forget the Brownies :) smiles"}
{"text":"Simply Delicious! Quality food and ingredients at a reasonable price! So many fav dishes, I just can't pick. Come and try for yourself!"}
{"text":"Omg why have I not been here sooner?! The girls were helpful because I'm always very indecisive. I got Cobb salad and lobster bisque. So good. 

Ps they gave me a chocolate covered strawberry. This place is better than panera. I really wish there was a cafe zuppas next to my
House"}
{"text":"This place was great!  I ordered for the first time for a pick up for our office meeting and it was on-time, fresh, hot, and the gal showed me each order before placing it in the bag - with each person's name on it!  Now that's customer service. 

Clam Chowder can be a little thicker, but ALL our food was GREAT!  
The Crab / Avocado Sandwich was delicious.  

For ordering for 5 people and doing a combo with 1/2 doz cookies, it was about $51 - great price!  

We are fans and would go back :)"}
{"text":"Food is incredible. I loved their Nuts About Berries salad. I have a sweet tooth and it definitely hit the spot. Their veggie sandwich was delicious and their bread was soft and perfect. It was my first time but I will surely be going back."}
{"text":"I love their sandwiches and soup! The desserts are great to. Staff is nice and knowledgeable. If your unsure of something they let you sample it."}
{"text":"Cafe Zupas is a great place if you're in need of healthy meal.  The salads are fresh and wonderful. The soups are made daily and very good but the creamy soups seem to be watered down."}
{"text":"I'm so tired of coming to this restaurant and getting terrible service. One, the ordering process is ridiculous. Five different people asking me the same exact thing. Then, because I have a large order, I get asked to repeat it five more times. This is normal and I have been dealing with it, having a large family.
What angers me is that this is the 4th time I've had absolutely horrendous service. We were at the Lake Mead location in Vegas and Kacee and Shawnee, who are supposed to represent some type of poor excuse for management, have absolutely no customer service skills when things are messed up on their part. In addition, they ran out of their famous chocolate covered strawberries and I asked if they could be replaced with a small amount of the fruit they did have (grapes and canned mandarin oranges, which are significantly cheaper than strawberries anyway and I would've been happy even with anything) for my children. I was told no and there was nothing they can do. I asked them if there was anything else they could replace the bread with (as my kids can't eat it) and they just kept saying no, that's their store policy. After a frustrating and very pointless conversation with them, my husband asked for a refund for his food. They gave us his $8 refund and threw his salad in the trash. So... to sum up this experience, the employees at this establishment would rather throw away money than make their customers happy. I will NEVER go back to this restaurant again because I'm so tired of getting treated like crap while they take my money. Never again. Go to Panera!"}
{"text":"I went after the lunch rush around 3 pm and had absolutely terrible service. There seemed to be no managers on the line, only the servers and two other girls who seemed to be in charge of the others (they color code shirts for ranks). I had to repeatedly state my order and a girl named Riley took it in the beginning of the line. She wasn't very friendly and I wanted to change something in my sandwich but she moved on to the next customer without even a thank you, just a hurried, monotone \"and what can I get started for you today?\" To the girl behind me, the only other customer in line. 
I got the lobster bisque soup which tasted absolutely amazing and I highly recommend it. Most places don't make their soups by scratch but you can tell from cafe zupas they put a lot of care into getting their recipes just right. the person at soups was a lot friendlier than Riley or the other \"manager\" on the line who asked what I ordered. She was somewhat aggressive and asked me what I got. You'd think they would have a ticket system like most restaurants so you don't have to repeat your order all the time. 

Service in general isn't that great here. There seems to be no manager when I'm there, and when I came during the lunch rush i only saw one once and he was very friendly and attentive to my order. Food is good but I wish the servers would treat customers better instead of as an annoyance to their routine. However I'm highly disappointed in the lack of respect I received during my visits, especially from so called \"managers\"."}
{"text":"Found my favorite combo- mangoberry salad and chicken chili enchilada soup. Good portions and very nice employees"}
{"text":"Everything is fresh ... Wasn't a fan of their cold ciabatta sandwich bread . Maybe next time I'll try a panini."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I like the flavor of the Zupas salads.  However I visited the South Rainbow location yesterday with my wife for the second time in recent weeks.
Normally I eat something before I eat at Zupas because the salads are a bit on the small side and I don't like to leave hungry.  I didn't have time so I just went and ordered the normal salad that I get.   
I asked the \"shift leader\" if I could have a little extra lettuce with my salad.  Not any of the items that they put on it, just lettuce so that it would be a little more filling.
The shift leader said to me, \"No we can't do that because we have no way to charge you for it.\"  WHAT?
I even said back to her that I wasn't asking for extra Protien or fruit or anything that actually would increase the cost of it, simply a little more lettuce.  
To which she replied, \"sorry, there's just no way to do it.\"

I've NEVER been to any other restaurant that would not give you a little more lettuce!  OR, at a minimum, figure out how to charge more for each and every item on your menu.  Is is very clear that this establishment is NOT interested in customer service or retention."}
{"text":"So far so good had the california cobb and chicken chili omg omg i lovedddd ot both full sizes for about 12 bucks! YOU CANT BEAT THAT,  ESPECIALLY IN VEGAS WHERE EVERYTHING IS JUST WAYYY OVERPRICED. To TOP IT OFF I also got 2 breads and 2 chocolate covered strawberries for free. So sweet!"}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant ever! All of their soups are amazing, but I can't ever get over the Wisconsin cauliflower- every time, it blows me away! My new fav sandwich? Surprisingly, the fancy grilled cheese! (They have some fancy name for it, and it is seriously delish!) you can't go wrong with any of their salads either. And the best part- a complimentary chocolate covered strawberry with every meal! Seriously, how do you beat that? Oh, and it's like the only place that I will pay for a fountain drink because of all the yummy syrup add-in flavors to create your own delicious drinks!!!"}
{"text":"I love cafe Zupas! Everything I've tried has been great, good prices, filling food, good size menu."}
{"text":"My Grandie & I decided to try this place out. A co-worker recommended it. 
We were not disappointed. Although it seems like nobody knew what they were doing. It was a bit chaotic. 
The food was amazing. She had a avocado crab melt & lobster bisque soup. I had roasted red pepper lobster soup & a spinach artichoke panini. 
Yum!"}
{"text":"Super fresh and super clean. I ordered the berry salad with nuts.  This place is fabulous for lunch. The staff is very attentive and the food is really wonderful!   A great desert menu which I cannot indulge in today. Booooooooooooooooooo!"}
{"text":"I would have eventually tried this place because I was curious and since it's in my close to my house . I recieved a coupon in in the mail for 50% off that expired in 3 days so I figured I would check it out on my way to work it looked so busy I thought I wouldn't have time to order and finish my meal. 

Upon entering a employee was holding the door open for me with excitement and welcomed me inside and as soon as I stepped in line I was approached by another employee and I told her I had never been to a Cafe Zupas before so she gave me a menu and some recommendations of their popular menu items and informed me that the try 2 comes with a full sandwich because she said they were small. They definitely were not. I was surprised because at Panera u only get a half sandwich and a bowl of soup on a You pick 2. 

The line is setup with employees at each of the salad , soup and sandwich stations so u go through the line pretty fast. I couldn't decide what soup I wanted and they were more than happy to offer me samples. They have a big selection to choose from as far as salads soups and sandwiches so you are bound to find something you like & every menu item comes with a chocolate covered strawberry that even my chocolate hating self enjoyed. 

I got my Try 2 for $4.80 since I had a 50% off mailer coupon. I would have been just as happy if I had paid full price because it was totally worth it. I got a full sandwich and a huge bowl of soup. I got the Turkey Bacon and Avacado sandwich which was grilled to perfection and I got the tomato and basil soup which was creamy and delicous. At panera u get a half sandwich and a small bowl of soup. So they are definitely giving Panera some competition. Granted Panera offers bakery items and such. I can't wait to bring my Mom here soon honestly everything looks tasty and the customer service was outstanding."}
{"text":"Lets start with the negatives. The guy assembling the salads needs to focus on getting the ingredients right. I ordered a California Cobb salad and he forgot to include the hard boiled egg. I caught it because i was watching. Same mistake was made with my wife's salad. She was very annoyed. Not 100% true to the menu. Secondly, there are several tables that needed to be cleared of dirty dishes left behind as we searched for a clean place to dine.

Positives ... everything is house made and fresh. The menu is basically salad, soup and sandwiches. The menu is right up my alley and most everything is quality ingredients. The employees here need training and it shows. The employees are standing around talking and there are at least 5 tables with dirty dishes sitting there since we walked through the door. Nobody wants to dine in a restaurant that has no urgency to keep things clean. 

Fail."}
{"text":"Great salad. Really need to add gorgonzola cheese as an option and to charge .69 to add a little cheese to soup is silly."}
{"text":"Used to love coming here but wow have they gotten cheap. I don't even think I had an ounce of chicken on my salad. Water tastes like a band aid, no soap in bathroom. I understand measuring out portions, but make sure the customer is getting a full measure. I mentioned it to three different people and all they did was shrug. Poe management. Has the potential to be good if there were toppings on salad. Meantime Wildflower is next door!"}
{"text":"I recommend this place. My favorite casual restaurant. I love eating soup here. This seems to be a family owned place.
The staff is nice and friendly. The servers know what they are selling and are pretty honest about the food they are serving. I value their honesty. I do enjoy the mushroom soup.
They have tables inside and out. Many people take food with them, I think because it's really hard to eat, portions are very large.
They also are good about making sure you understand how \"hot\" the spicy levels of their dishes are. 
Everything is fresh, full of flavor and made in front of your eyes. 
Prices are encouraging, not big, and portions are large."}
{"text":"So the Asian Persuasion  Family of yelp decided to have a family dinner here. I thought to myself, this is awesome, I have heard so much about this place and finally I get to try it out!

This place is located near Silverado Ranch and Eastern, more towards on Richmar and Eastern to be exact, right next to Republic Kitchen. Easy to find you can't miss it.

The place is very clean, your greeted by a friendly staff at the door. The menu is very plain and simple, easy to read, and most important, they have pretty reasonable prices, I highly recommend the Combo which gives you a full size sandwich with a choice of 1/2 soup or 1/2 salad all for $7.99, where can you go wrong there right?

I ordered the Thai Mango Chicken salad with the California Turkey Sandwich.
The Thai Mango salad was very delicious and loved everything in the salad. The Thai Mango Chicken Salad had, chicken , lettuce, fried wonton noodles of some sort, mango and some type of vinigerette Thai sauce, that I can't explain.

As for my California Turkey sandwich , that included, the turkey with light mayo and cheese, avocado, cucumbers served on cibatta  bread ( sorry for the typo too lazy to look it up hehe).
 The combo also included French bread and chocolate covered strawberries to complete the meal.

Overall I reall enjoyed my dining experience at Cafe Zupas, I would love to go back and try all their other sandwiches and try a soup. And most important the food is great and its freaking cheap!"}
{"text":"The Wild Mushroom Bisque is stunning in its savory lusciousness. This is one of the best soup and sandwich shops in a very competitive market."}
{"text":"I have been there twice and soup and salads were wonderful. Very fresh and homemade ingredients. I haven't tried a sandwich yet. Place is super clean. It is like chipotle where you order at counter and watch them make your salad or sandwich. Soup is like a baskin Robbins. You can have a little taste if hard to choose. Soup and salad combo also includes a nice roll and a chocolate covered strawberry."}
{"text":"I am absolutely OBSESSED with this place since the day it opened. This location is closer to me but I'm visited the eastern location plenty of time. Both locations offer superb customer service and great tasting, fresh food. It's like a Panera bread but better due to their better quality food, better tasting flavor, bigger portion sizes, and affordable pricing. Every staff member you come across is so friendly and their restaurant is always clean. My 8 yr. old loves eating here as well, especially because of their complimentary chocolate-covered strawberry with every meal and yummy tasting desserts. Plus they have internet access and charging stations! Give this place a try! You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Great food friendly staff. Eating area a little cramped. Still was worth the money and experience
Kudos ."}
{"text":"I love a good fresh salad and I always get that at this restaurant.  However, the service on Saturday evening left a lot to be desired.  Rude, rude, rude!  Two of the attendants were having a personal conversation while I waited on them to take my order.  Once I gave my order the young lady could not remember order because she was too engrossed with what number 2 had to say.  I got to register, waiting for my salad, and the cashier had to walk down to opposite end of counter to retrieve my salad.  Very poor customer service."}
{"text":"Love this place! Tons of variety and each meal is served with a chocolate covered strawberry! Great value for the fresh quality of food."}
{"text":"It was a hit and miss. I like the set up of the place and how everything is offered, the assembly line style is really convenient and gets people through quickly.

I had the nuts and berries salad and the veggie sandwich when I went here. The salad was on point but the sandwich was cold, flavorless, and lacking. They should consider looking into improving their vegetarian sandwiches.

I don't really get why we can't tip the servers? Especially if they're responsible to clean up the slop people leave behind? I felt bad and put my own dishes away. Why make someone do waiter/waitress tasks and not pay them correctly for it."}
{"text":"When I first went to Zupas, it was at a different location and I wasn't too impressed with it. I decided to give it another try because my friend ranted and raved about how good it was, so I knew I was missing out on something. 

Being a vegetarian, sometimes it's hard to find good vegetarian food at restaurants and most of the time they don't have a vast selection, so most of the time if a food item isn't good, I just won't go back, because there will be nothing else to try. 
The veggie sandwich that they have set up on the menu is pretty gross to me, but my friend orders it with avocado + grilled on panini instead and it tasted like 200% better!(Seriously get it that way if you go there) 
I like the set up of this restaurant to where they can change up the way items are made fairly easy to accommodate everyone's tastes.
I also tried the mushroom soup they have and it was delicious as well. I think Zupas may have grown on me again.
The service is still great and fast, but it's still crap that we can't tip them."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of the chicken enchilada chile and the kale Salad. Both are awesome and always consistent. The chocolate covered strawberry is a perfect treat."}
{"text":"The wild mushroom bisque soup tastes heavenly and my favorite at zupus . I love the salads and the chicken pesto sandwich ! This place is good for weight watchers  . Must try the soup."}
{"text":"Egh... I tried so hard to like this place for the second time around and it failed me once again. I got a turkey bacon avocado sandwich and I paid over $8.00 for the smallest most bland sandwich like, ever. My bacon wasn't even crispy nor cooked all the way, I just ended up peeling it off and tossing it because who wants to eat floppy under cooked bacon? So after I work my way through that disappointment because that's all I have had for food all day, I get to my wet, squishy and wilted chocolate dipped strawberry. Yummm... not. Threw it right in the garbage. What a waste of money, i'll take my business to Panera next time instead."}
{"text":"Love this place we eat here once a week.  Food is excellent the only issue is if you make any changes (i.e. No onions)you need to double check your order as they frequently mess up on those changes."}
{"text":"I work close by and have to stop by here all the time.  Alot of times people are waiting outside the door for them to open at 11am.  I have never had anything I didnt like.  My wife tells everyone about this place and that they have to try it.  You can do soup salad or sandwich.  You can even get 2 and mix it up!  Delish."}
{"text":"Great place to eat. Healthy, affordable, and kid friendly. Best cauliflower soup I've ever had."}
{"text":"This was my first time here. We were greeted at the door and were told how their ordering works which I thought was really nice. I ordered a ultimate grilled cheese sandwich and a bowl of Wisconsin cauliflower soup. The sandwich was cold and lacked flavor. The soup could have been a bit warmer but was still delicious. As for the free strawberry, it didn't have much chocolate and had a mushy spot in it. I give 3 stars for the service, the cleanliness of the restaurant and the soup. I was also disappointed in the parking lot having so many spots that were 30 minutes or less. I may give it a second chance. I'm not sure"}
{"text":"This place is not vegetarian friendly at all! I tried to order the turkey spinach artichoke sandwich with no turkey  but with some extra tomatoes. The girl helping me at the front desk told me that it was against policy to order that! They could take out the turkey with no problem but they would not be able to add ONE or TWO slices of tomato. I understand if I was just asking to add tomatoes, but I simply wanted to replace to turkey with a slice of tomato. I usually love Zupas, I go to the one in Avondale all of the time and I am so satisfied! I will never come back to this Zupas ever again!"}
{"text":"So efficient and delicious! Easy to get in and out at lunch if you visit at 11. My only complaint is that since we came right at opening we got cold (fridge cold) breads. But staff was friendly!"}
{"text":"This place is always so good if you're looking for salad soup or sandwiches. Everything looks super fresh and salad is prepared right in front of you. Soups you can taste test before ordering.  I dig the lobster bisque and typically get the crab avocado melt which is an interesting taste but I like it. The other sandwiches are good too. The kale and quinoa salad tasted a bit bland and bitter, but I've had other salads too that were yummy. They have a nice selection of lemonades. I'm not a fan of lemonade but if you are, you'd probably like this. Place is clean. Staff is nice. And strawberry dipped in chocolate is a nice treat for the meal."}
{"text":"Definitely a grown up perfect cafe!
Everything was amazing...
They should open a Los Angeles location please"}
{"text":"Is my first time here, I like the setup of the restaurant. I ordered the chicken pesto sandwich the California Cobb salad, and the German chicken soup. The food was great very fresh and hot. I think on my next visit I will do just a soup and salad because that was filling enough. This is definitely a must try. I gave it 4 stars because I have felt rushed when I was ordering, other than that everything was great."}
{"text":"This place is always clean and friendly. Portion size its perfect and I love that your meal comes with a fresh chocolate dipped strawberry!!!  If you haven't tried this place, you're missing out!!"}
{"text":"First time here and the menu blew my mind. So many options and they all look fresh and delicious. My turkey spinach artichoke and lobster bisque were amazing"}
{"text":"Meh.  I'm not sure why this places gets good reviews at all.  I ordered the Turkey Avocado Panini and my boyfriend ordered the Crab Avocado Panini.  We both got soups (Wisconsin Cauliflower and Crab Bisque) too.  The Panini bread was chalky and gross.  The Cauliflower soup lacked flavor and my boyfriend said the crab bisque was just \"ok - I've had much better\".  The chocolate dipped strawberries were only barely dipped in chocolate and the strawberries were WAY too over ripe.  We spent almost $30 for lunch and it wasn't even worth half that amount.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"You can never go wrong with the food here at Zupas, but unfortunately the service is different compared to the one on Stephanie and sunset. I was not greeted and not a single smile came from any of the associates."}
{"text":"It's my first time here. Food is good...although the employees are so rude they all huddle into a circle and talk  openly about the customers ( as if we are all deaf ) 
HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE 

The only time they are nice/acknowledge you and give you a smile is when you are leaving."}
{"text":"Great! 100% better than Panera! I had the herbed chicken salad sandwich, flavor explosion! I also had the mushroom bisque soup, excellent! Panera used to be my go to place but lately their sandwiches have been skimpy and flavorless and just not worth the price. Cafe Zupa is my new go to!!"}
{"text":"I've heard so many great things about this restaurant but never had one on my side of town until recently. A whole sandwich, soup or salad, a roll and a chocolate covered strawberry for $8.99? Yes please! There are so many options and then options on top of those options. Not to mention multiple handmade drinks like orange berry fruit infusion or basil cucumber green tea with raw honey. Yummo! Great for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Great fresh food.  Staff was friendly and helpful.  We tried the turkey bacon and crab/ avocado sandwich with the lobster bisque.  Both were great and well worth the price."}
{"text":"So I've been here twice and here's what struck me...the prices are good but I would rather pay a little more and have a heartier sandwich. Although tasty my Boston Crab was all bread and little filler."}
{"text":"One of my favorite chains.  How do I get them to come to Texas?  I love the format, the sandwiches a salads are great.  For me the real stars are soups.  Got to get me more red pepper lobster bisque."}
{"text":"Stopped in because we were hungry and in the area. The food was amazing! We both got half soup half sandwiches and didn't leave any food on our plates! The cauliflower soup was amazing! We wish we lived closer. This place blows Panera out of the water! I would definitely suggest to anyone looking for a fast but healthy meal!"}
{"text":"My husband and I tried Zuppas for the first time a couple weeks ago. The first thing that I noticed was that the establishment was really clean. We had 2 salads, lobster bisque soup, and chicken tortilla soup. My husband wanted a BBQ pulled pork sandwich and I guess there was some sort of miscommunication between him and the person he ordered from, but the staff was very friendly when they realized the misunderstanding.
Sean was really nice and cheerful which made the visit more welcoming. :)
We tried to clean up our but the staff insisted they will take care of it. I just wish they could accept tips."}
{"text":"Wow, I tried the soup here  not really expecting much. It's excelleant! Lobster bisque, tomato,
and more. Probably the best soup I've ever had in Peoria. They have sandwiches  and they are good as well but it's the soup that brings us back. The restaurant is busy but the order line moves along pretty quick. The tables are quickly cleaned and always available despite the crowds. I recommend this restaurant, stop in and try their soup!"}
{"text":"Disappointed. Walked in and was busy, looked like it had a lot of promise. Ordering was fast and easy. Food prepared quickly and packed up to go for me. 

I got a Pesto Chicken Panini. Was good, didn't like the sprouts on it though as they kind of just lumped together in the middle of my sandwich. Couldn't really bite through them and just ended up pulling them off. Overall the sandwich was good, nothing amazing wouldn't go back for it.
I also had some clam chowder. Salty and thin. When I think of clam chowder I think thick, creamy and nice pieces of clams. Barely any clams could be found and flavor was overly salty. Do not recommend it at all. 
Very disappointing.
Meal came with a piece of bread and chocolate strawberry. Only the front half of the strawberry was actually covered in chocolate but I mean of course it was good.
Decided to also try chocolate cake because it looks good. It looks good but wasn't good. The cake parts were ok but the \"mousse\" was hard. Didn't taste good at all, was kind of crumbly when I tried to get a bite on my fork.
Overall will not return for another try. Disappointed that 2 out of the 3 components of my meal were not good. Similar to Panera Bread except Panera Bread is actually good. So I'll be going there instead."}
{"text":"This location is fairly new and is the first zupa I've ever been to.  The people are efficient and smiling and the food is great.  My favorite is the strawberry salad and lobster bisque.  If ur lucky, you'll get the bottom of the pot with all the chunks, yum!!  The great thing is that each meal comes with a chocolate covered strawberry.  My only issue is that they don't have a 3 combo meal... but that's just me."}
{"text":"The restaurants idea is great- lots of options, seemingly good quality ingredients and upbeat staff. BUT 
They are extremely stingy on portions, I ask for cucumbers and the guy carefully counts 5. I asked for more chicken (and accepted the higher fee) and she slowly added two more pieces. If I'm paying almost $12 for a salad, don't be stingy.. I am paying for added ingredients! 
-**Also, I found  a fruit fly walking through my salad. I won't be returning. Picture attached."}
{"text":"Good food and great service. Free chocolate covered starve berries with your meal!?! Yes please!  Many of their soups are chowders or bisque type. The chocolate hazelnut creme brûlée is delicious. Generally busy around noon."}
{"text":"Ok this place needs some tweaking but its alright by me. First off if you do not know this place look online or grab a menu before you get in line. They are practically pushy to keep that line moving and under pressure you'll quite possibly forget something or order something nasty to try out...
 I think the way to is the soup and salad combo. For 7.99 you are full or you can share if you had breakfast or want dinner later... depending on your plans.
 We got lobster bisque and tomato risotto, a few turkey sandwiches etc. Both were good, not excellent. I noticed most of the soups are creamy, milky and heavy. There needs to be a tortellini broth or something healthier as a choice too. The sandwiches have cheap deli meat. Everyone liked their food but no one loved it enough to rave about it. A step above Jimmy Johns but I'd still rather go to Panera.
 The cons are the atmosphere is awful , and the parking is tough in that corner. It is very loud like a school lunchroom.  :( And they have these signs all over the place stating \"please don't hold your table\" ... as if! Give me a break if you are paying 25.00 for lunch I say sit your tushie down and relax. You are already getting your own food and drinks...
 So for me this is an _ If I am in the area and want soup and it's a slow hour I might go in and get some soup to go kind of place. But that's about it. No one wanted to go back in that line or that noise again. Not worth travelling for unless its really your bag."}
{"text":"Their garden bisque is to die for!!!! Also the rocky road brownie!!! Fast service, clean dining area. I didn't care for their baguette much, but all in all, that's a minor thing! My kids love that they get a chocolate covered strawberry every time we go in!!! Their staff was friendly and very helpful."}
{"text":"Always a really pleasant staff and they work really fast and accurate. I'm a fan of coming here!"}
{"text":"Nice greeting and suggestions at the door especially for the first time visit.  Her recommendation of nuts berries salad was great along with my choice of sandwiches which was ham bacon cheese sandwich. 

Place is nice and clean and we had outdoor table on a very nice weather relaxing day.

The only thing I would suggest is that if it they can hire enough people to clean up the tables or pick up food trays people left behind especially outdoor."}
{"text":"Great place to stop for quick lunch! They have a variety of tasty salads, sandwiches and soups. I also love any place that incorporates fruit on their salads. Each meal comes with a chocolate covered strawberry- so how can you go wrong? Loud, bustling place so expect to see that! Prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"So me and my three other coworkers coming here to eat. Not only did the employees here stare at us for maybe 10 minutes while talking to themselves they were texting behind the counter forgot to make some of our food and then forgot to ring up some of our food so I'm not coming back to this location again and it I don't know how they have a food handlers card when they're texting behind the counter in front of the food..."}
{"text":"I rate the food at Cafe Zupas a 3 but am downgrading to 2 stars because of the long, slow-moving line, blaringly loud annoying music, and many high-calorie items on the menu in spite of all the marketing and even the design of the kitchen implying it is a healthy place to eat. If you like the food in spite of the calories, I suppose that's fine. But I don't like the marketing + high calorie content. 

A lot of my coworkers were raving about Cafe Zupas, and when I checked out their website, I thought it looked promising. Lots of talk about making things from scratch, using fresh ingredients, etc. Great. These are Very Good Things. 

One of my Zupas-enthusiast coworkers showed me the menu and was like, \"look they even have quinoa protein bowls for you, Mr. Health Nut!\" When I pointed out that the only one of these below 800 calories was the one with tofu, I got a lot of side-eye. 

Maybe a week later, that same coworker asked if I wanted to join them for lunch at Cafe Zupas, and I agreed. When we got there, the line was almost to the door, and it was super loud inside. I blame the polished concrete floors, exposed ceiling, and extra-loud annoying pop music. 

The design of the place is an over the top performance of \"LOOK AT THE REAL INGREDIENTS AND SCRATCH COOKING HAPPENING HERE.\" There are fancy produce bins prominently displayed behind the salad line, and a platform on which a kitchen employee stands and uses a giant immersion blender to mix things like salad dressings. Because if you make salad dressing with a giant immersion blender in front of everyone it's gotta be good. 

But I figured, hey, this is basically an attempt at a hipper, chef-ier Panera, even if it's a little silly with the kitchen design, at least I'll be able to find something to eat that fills me up, tastes halfway decent, and doesn't blow my calories for the day out of the water. 

Thanks to the slow-moving food line, I had more than enough time to peruse the menu while waiting to get up to place my order. Unlike Panera where you place your order and go sit down with a pager, Cafe Zupas you place your order and slllllooooowwwwwwly move your way down toward the cash register while they make your food in front of you. 

I got frustrated because the sandwich + salad combos all involve a whole sandwich (which really isn't all that big) and half salad, and it's very difficult to make a sandwich + salad combo below ***800 CALORIES***. 

All but two of the 10 HALF salads on the menu are 380+ calories. You save some calories on the sandwiches by going with whole grain bread, but with the exception of the vegetarian sandwich, all the sandwiches are 580+ calories. There are 5 sandwiches in the 580-610 calorie range. These are not big sandwiches. They're not even the size of a 6\" Subway sub. 

So let's say you choose one of those 5 sandwiches, and the 240 calorie half Mangoberry salad, you're at 820 to 850 calories before you account for the roll and chocolate-dipped strawberry they give you. If you go for the 310 calorie half Nuts About Berries salad, you're at 890 to 920 calories. 

I settled on the 580 calorie California Turkey sandwich and 240 calorie half Mangoberry salad, for 820 calories, before the roll (60 calories? I forget and it's not on their website) and chocolate dipped strawberry (45 calories) Cafe Zupas graciously includes with every meal. 

Oh, maybe you want some soup? There are 10 soups on the regular menu. Except all but 3 of those, the little half soup bowls which are something like 4-6 oz, are 250+ calories. This is because 8 of the 10 soups are dairy. Seriously.  

When you get past the sandwich, soup, and salad stations, here comes the dessert station calling out with cheesecake, brownies, and \"creme brulees\" that aren't actually bruleed on the top and are actually creme caramels if we want to be accurate with our dessert naming here. I laughed out loud at this station, because it's like, \"you've gotten this far with the supposedly-but-not-actually healthy food, go ahead, treat yourself!\" This was embodied by a lady a few spots ahead of me in line with a tray that consisted of a bowl of chicken tortilla soup, and a very large slice of cheesecake. Such a nutritionally complete meal you have there. 

So I ate my sandwich and salad, and they were fine, if more calories than I really wanted. I gave my coworker my chocolate strawberry since I was kinda tearing the place she likes to shreds, and that way I could avoid the extra calories. 

Maybe I'm being too harsh on Cafe Zupas, but the \"FRESH, REAL FOOD, MADE IN HOUSE\" messaging, that implies the food is healthy, doesn't sit well with me when it's attached to a vaguely chef-y (but not really) soup/salad/sandwich chain where it's exceedingly difficult to create a meal that is both filling and not a big pile of calories."}
{"text":"I enjoyed this new restaurant. Fast service, clean, service with a smile! I had the chicken tortilla soup and turkey bacon avocado sandwich. The soup was very good although not a fan of putting a glob of avocado in the broth (creates an unappealing texture). Sandwich was OK, not a fan of Muenster cheese but overall a good sandwich. Love the chocolate covered strawberry given with each order!"}
{"text":"First time and I was very impressed. Great flavor, fresh and reasonably priced. I definitely recommend."}
{"text":"This place is my favorite spot for a nice, healthy meal at a very reasonable price. The staff is so friendly and the food was made quick and right in front of you. While in line, they had me sample a few of their soups, which were all fresh and delicious! They top off your salad with bread and a chocolate covered strawberry. You had me at hello! I would have given 5 stars, except the quality of the lettuce hasn't been exceptional either time I've been there. Otherwise outstanding!"}
{"text":"I love the lobster bisque and the red pepper lobster bisque as well, two favs! The staff are always nice and eager to help you out, salads are made fresh in front of you so you can add toppings or remove them if you like. They are closed on Sundays and that seems to be when I crave it the most lol. Definitely a favorite since moving to Arizona a while back, and the Chocolate covered strawberry gives the meal an added bonus to sweeten your palette after enjoying this rich and creamy soup."}
{"text":"Ok. I came in because I was told the have a lot of veggie options. They do and that is great. Nice set up with the \"recharger bar\" for electronics. My salad was good however the soup was warm(closer to cold) and tasty. The meals come with sour dough. I ask for wheat and I was informed they have no wheat bread in the place. That surprised me since they have so many choices. As for dessert, no dairy free choices. I'll be back for salad and soup when in the area.  Would have been 5 Stars but no wheat, cold soup and no non-dairy desserts. 

Stop in and give them a try if you haven't already done so. 

Peace"}
{"text":"The food is good here however the service needs work and the tables are wobbly and the chairs are dirty and need to be wiped down and the drink station needs to be stocked no drink lids and when I asked for a lid she rudely said for what ? Obviously there's only lids for drinks there and they weren't stocked over all the place is good for food that's about it"}
{"text":"First time here and will be the last time.  When you get to the line to order several employees are yelling at you for your order. I had the sandwich and soup combo. Sandwich was the Italian. Sandwich was bkand and have never had muenster chhese on an Italian coldcut sandwich in my life. The soup was clam chowder. The clam chowder wad extremely spicy to the point I couldn't eat it. The kid serving the soup asked if I wanted croutons, they out 3 to 4 croutons and when I got ti the register tried to charge me .69 for them. When I questioned the cashier about a charge for them his comment was \"dude read the sign\". I refused to pay for them they did replace the chowder.  Another member of our party had the tomato basil.  The soup was watery and also very spicy. The 3rd person had a salad. For a large salad it was nothing more than a side side salad. When they asked for more dressing they were told there be charge for it. The total was $31.00 for food I wouldn't pay half that. When we asked to speak to a manager it took her almost 20 minutes to come over.  After much discussion anfmd raised voices we were refunded for the meaks,as we didn't eat much. I would not recommend this place. The employees are just kids and all are rude. Will never go back."}
{"text":"Not a bad place for lunch 

Went in for a quick lunch, when attending a seminar in phx 

I ordered the Cuban and a salad. Service was quick and food was good. I was impressed with the half salad as most places seem to skimp on one item or the other when getting a sandwich with salad.

Only reason for 4 verse 5..the servers seemed to take a while for my sandwich, could have been an off day"}
{"text":"First time visit. My wife is a fan and has been begging me to come with her.  I was not impressed with the seating. Had to cut through all the tables just to get to the line to order. I ordered the Cuban and a small tomato soup. The sandwich was ok tasting but poorly assembled. My soup was Luke warm but tasty. Can't say that I'll be back but if the wife pouts I MIGHT give them another try."}
{"text":"Good place for lunch, not great. It's fast and ideal for soups and sandwiches or salads or some combination of those. I've had good clam chowder and lobster bisque here and good turkey sandwiches. The staff is nice and your meal will arrive quickly."}
{"text":"The sandwiches here are decent the salads are better in my opinion. I felt the sandwich I ordered came out mushy and it could be from the sauces and tomato that they added. I got the chicken pesto and was not that impressed. The chipotle salad on the other hand was pretty delicious and refreshing. The lobster bisque was not that great either. It tasted more like a tomato soup. 
The pricing here was kinda pricey in my opinion for what you get as well."}
{"text":"Great place for a healthy / light lunch.   Food is always fresh and good... and the staff seems friendly."}
{"text":"Topping amount on salad is super chinsy. Not employees faulty but company policy. They literally count 5 pieces (cucumber, mangos, olives, etc) and that is for small OR a large size. So in other words a large is just extra greens. Better to get two half salads. Soups have no bulk and ate all juice. I would give the food 4 stars. Except the chicken which has absolutely no flavor."}
{"text":"Let me tell you something you witty hooligan, this cafe is beyond amazing! The service is exemplary and my meal is always made fresh!! I adore the decor and how they pair your food with a bread roll and a chocolate dipped strawberry. Touche! I usually order a sandwich and pick a new soup. There's a variety of soups although I've come to favor the Red Pepper Lobster Bisque quite fondly! Seating is simple to find, as well is parking. There isn't wifi, although you wont't need it! Talk to the person you're dining with if you can find time to utter words in between devouring your delicious panini! There's lots to choose from when it comes to drinks! I love the infused water drinks. It's nice to have a healthier on the go option when I get tired of my meal prep! Awesome poosum! You guys rocks! Keep up the great work!!! and THANK YOU!"}
{"text":"I love Zupas! I really love their customer service. They always patiently wait while I try every soup because I am so indecisive. It's all good and that's the problem. Salads are fresh  and the dressings are all great! Nice location and super great service!"}
{"text":"Had an amazing sandwich and salad here. Everything tastes super fresh and had great flavors. The salad was so good, I would come back just for that!"}
{"text":"I went for a noon lunch with my friends and it is definitely the busy hour. They greeted me at the door and I was a little overwhelmed when upon entering, it was incredibly noisy and chaotic!
But as you're in line, there's posters and menus for you to know how and what to order.
I had the MangoBerry salad and an Italian Sub combo. I am always a skeptic with fruit in my salad but my taste buds were taken for an incredible ride! I don't think I'll have my salads any other way from now on!
And the chocolate covered strawberry with every meal is such a tender touch and I thought of it as a secret gift your crush gives you to make your meal a little sweeter! Is that crazy?
Well, you gotta hit this place up! It's sublime!"}
{"text":"Just had lunch at the chandler zupas..it did not disappoint. I love the freshness of their salads. Mangoberry is my favorite, I refuse to try anything else. The sandwiches are great and the really stay on top of keeping the place clean."}
{"text":"Great food however highly disappointed they do not provide nutritional information for their menu in the restaurant or online...additionally the staff do not have any knowledge about the nutritional information for the items they serve... When my group asked about low calorie dressing options for salad the staff told us \"we dont know\"...For a place that is all about fresh salads, sandwiches, and soups, it would make a lot of sense to make sure this information is available to patrons who are health conscience!"}
{"text":"Came here on Sunday only to find them closed. What a fail.  After reading the bad reviews on pricing and portions I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"I like this chain.  I go often, but the young people working there act like they are on drugs.
I can't believe the incompetence.  I'm sorry, I think kids are getting dumber by the day.  When I was 17, I was pretty sharp.  But then, I kept myself engaged, no internet, social media to dumb me down."}
{"text":"I love this place. It is light but I am always full by the end. The enchilada chili is AMAZING. I also tried one of the mixed berry creme brulees and that did not disappoint! I love the new location as well, right by my work. You'll be seeing quite a lot of me!"}
{"text":"I love this place!!!! Food is great they always have a new soup which are always awesone!!  The restaurant is always clean and the staff is always friendly this is a must try!!"}
{"text":"Great food great price.. I love the soups and sandwiches here. I have never had anything here I did not like. The staff is friendly and the restaurant is always clean.. I think the best part is the complementary chocolate covered strawberry that comes with your meal...."}
{"text":"I am in love with Cafe Zupas!! Slightly pricey but 100% worth it!! The food is amazing!! You get a roll and a chocolate covered strawberry with every purchase!! I am going to come here for lunch as often as I can!! The environment is great and always clean!! Staff is welcoming and warm!! Again, I love this restaurant!!"}
{"text":"VERY VERY DISGUSTED WITH THE SERVICE I was given when A peanut allergy wasn't displayed in the Bangkok coconut chicken soup and my partner has a peanut allergy flamed up had to leave my food that I just paid for all because it wasn't displayed, when my partner made it up to the counter after he felt itchy \"she said well there aren't any peanuts but there's a peanut sauce ?\" So a peanut sauce has nuts in it ?? Correct then I called manager and spoke with \"Michelle\" all she had to say was she was sorry and hopefully he feels better??? Like are you serious he could've just died and that was all you had to say? I will no longer be going to cafe Zupas again considering they don't display all 7 FDA allergies that's are in each and every food product. So disgusted"}
{"text":"I just moved here from northern CA, where our only option for this type of place is Togo's or Panera Bread. This place blows those two out of the water, that's for sure. What I love about Zupa's is that you can tell everything's homemade, and you don't get that overwhelming salt taste from premade soup. Yes the sandwiches are a bit small, but when you get a soup or salad with them they fill you up really good. I LOVED the vegetable chowder and grilled cheese I ordered. I think this just might be my new favorite place to eat."}
{"text":"Randomly stumbled into this place while driving along eastern looking for something to eat.  So i read the as \"zapatos\" at first which made me think it was a really odd name for a restaurant since \"shoes\" isn't something you'd associate with food... anyway moving on.   So the name got my attention at first, jumped on yelp and solid reviews.  F it... let's give it a shot.. wow... menu appears a tad overwhelming at first even though it's not overly complicated.  The combos are definitely worth your money, with 1/2 soup/salad with a sandwich for $7.99 or so.    Had the HBC and the asian peanut salad thing (forget what it's called, too lazy to look at their menu).. both were stellar and worth repeating.  They let you sample all the soup you want and so far I haven't been disappointed.  The lobster bisque and the tortilla soup were both excellent.  The girlfriend liked the few diff salads she's tried and the veg sandwich.  

The place is super quick with your food and travels pretty damn well for the to-go orders.  They always give a chocolate covered strawberry with your order which... eh.. isn't always the freshest... it's \"free\" with your order so not going to knock anything down for that.  Anyway... in short... good food... it's fast... def place worth repeating."}
{"text":"I love the new location of Cafe Zupas! It's the same set up as any other location but they have added whole ancient grain wheat bread to their menu! So if any of you foodies are looking for another option besides white bread they do have a substitution of wheat. They have their try 2 combo for $8.99, my personal dynamic duo is the strawberry harvest with chicken and the pesto chicken sandwich, or the Yucatan tortilla chicken soup and the glaze pork salad! It comes with a complementary bread and strawberry and towards the end of the line they have delicious creme brûlées. You are greeted at the front by their greeter where he/ she explains the entire menu and ordering process, from there you would tell the person at the front of the sale station your salad or sandwich order (if you are also or only getting soup then you would proceed down the line at their soup station!), next another person will ask you what was in your order at the dessert case to put it together on a tray - CAFE STYLE, last you'd pay. That's it! The employees are upbeat and always friendly, this is overall an amazing place to bring your family and friends for lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"This new location is big! I love their try for 2 combo where you chose 2/3 of salad, soup, and sandwich. I ordered a Strawberry Harvest w/ chicken and a Pesto Chicken sandwich. Those two have become my dynamic duo fave!!! The staff is very friendly and the dinning area is always kept clean. 

The employee's are really nice and efficient. Although there is a lot of them on the line, every employee from my experience has never failed to smile and make me feel welcomed. There are a lot of issues on repeating orders down the line but I am more patient and understanding when I have to repeat my order a couple of times, no biggie. 

Their food is very fresh and you could tell by the quality of it that most of their ingredients isn't pre-packaged. Their salad and soup portions could work on being bigger but the quality of the food is amazing. They also have chocolate dipped strawberries that comes with your purchase. Their Creme Brûlée cheesecake and rocky road brownie is very delicious!"}
{"text":"Omg. My new favorite place to eat! The food is out of this world good. I had their crab and avocado sandwich and their nuts about berries salad. It was so freaking good! They have real italian sodas and they give you bread and chocolate covered strawberry on the side. Good lord it was a lot of food for the price. $22 bucks for my husband and I to eat. Seriously, check this place out!"}
{"text":"I LOVE zupas!! Everytime I have been there i have enjoyed what I get. You get so much more food than paradise and for a better price. The staff is always friendly and are already helpful when I'm deciding what to order. love love love!"}
{"text":"Interesting concept, My wife really likes this place. It is quick and inexpensive. I find the ambiance good for the type of restaurant but the soup and sandwich were just marginal"}
{"text":"I'm not quite sure why I torture myself coming in here because I always leave irritated! From the second you walk in they start yelling at you to take your order, when you do start ordering they are so busy paying attention to everything else but what you are saying that you have to repeat your order twice. By the time you get up to the register you have to repeat your order to at least four different people. It is too chaotic and it never fails, something is always forgotten on my order. There are also very rude signs on each table basically stating that you are not allowed to save a table. I find that very rude and unwelcoming to customers. If you are looking for a nice relaxing place to eat lunch or dinner this is not it!"}
{"text":"I love their food!..... but service has been bad last couple times I've been there.  Wish the order system was different and more efficient.  Would rather they would take my order and money and let me sit while you all figure it out back there.  It's frustrating watching 5+ people run around confused behind the counter and ask you the same thing multiple times and then wonder if they got the guy next to in lines food in your bag."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch and good healthy fresh foods with a lot of options for vegetarians.  A little pricey which is why the 4 stars but definitely worth it.   Clean and the staff was polite and came around to take trays.   Would defiantly go to this one again if I worked in the area."}
{"text":"This spot catered an event at my work, so I can't imagine how much better it would be at the restaurant. 

I had the turkey, avocado, bacon tomato, on chabatta bread, with honey mustard spread. It's a basic sandwich but tasted amazing. My side salad was red, blue, and strawberries with Carmelized nuts and a sweet sauce. To top it off, one white chocolate chip cookie half dipped in chocolate- I'm not a huge fan of chocolate and yet this cookie was deliciously satisfying. 

I can't wait to try them again!!!"}
{"text":"Cafe Zupas is a great spot to eat when you want fresh ingredients and a decent sandwich. The price for portion, above all else, is what keeps me coming back. I have yet to try their feature soups, I typically stay with my regulars: Grilled Cheese, Enchilada Soup and Summer Chicken Salad. Once upon a time they had a great Asian BBQ sandwich that was raved about and helps encourage those that do not like typical sandwich shops to join. Unfortunately, that was taken off the menu and its hard to find a nice substitute for my boyfriend.

The restaurant is clean and the workers are friendly. Service is fast too, even if you are behind a person that is ordering for five different people.

Cafe Zupas is worth a try. I think you'll be a regular after your first visit."}
{"text":"The food is presented exactly the way it is in the photos.  I was very very impressed and will definitely return.  The service was awesome!"}
{"text":"Got the 'Pick 2' combo and was happy that it came with a good amount of food.  Chicken Chop salad and Chicken Pesto panini were both good.  Daughter got a grilled cheese with tomato basil soup which she loved.   They included a chocolate dipped strawberry for each so that was nice."}
{"text":"If I am getting a child's meal to go then I will pay for a child's meal because it is for a child , if it is for myself then I will pay for an adult size but do not try charge for an adult portion , it goes to waste . You just lost my business . If you want proof it's for a child then by all means let customers know what you want us to provide especially if it's to go ..."}
{"text":"I'm surprised there are so few five star reviews. I absolutely loved it. It was inexpensive, there was a large selection of salads, sandwiches and paninis. My friend and I each got a small salad (I got the BBQ ranch chicken and she got something with berries, both were delicious) and a turkey pesto sandwich that we split. 
Everything was delicious! Very flavorful, fresh, good portions.
I will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Sort of meh. Party of four - two of our soups were salty to the point of burning the mouth, and one was lukewarm (tortilla soup and veggie quinoa). Children's meals seem a little silly for any kid over 5, with regard to portions.  Sandwiches seem the best option - turkey artichoke panini was delicious. Overall, was sad to have spent the money here that I could've spent at Wildflower Bread Co., which is nearby."}
{"text":"I really like this place.  It's a nice way to break up the old Paradise Bakery menu with plenty of fresh offerings in the soup/salad/sandwich menu.  The combos are a way better deal than paradise...soup/sammie you get a full sammie, not a half.  I tried the spinach artichoke turkey sandwich.. really good with a yummy creamy dip like sauce on it.  The paninis are a little flat after being pressed and although it seems like you get enough meat on your sandwich, I do kind of wish the meat was placed more dainty (folded or something) and not stacked like bologna.  A few other cool things...you get a free chocolate dipped strawberry with your meal, large dessert offerings (million dollar cookie bar was WAY too sugary), and there are italian soda syrups for you to add to your coke products with suggested recipes like \"rootbeer float\".  

The main thing I would change about this place is the staff.  They're all really nice, but there is always something weird.  While I like it when people open the door and greet me, I don't like it when they immediately try to sell me on the \"soup of the month\" or whatever.  Like I haven't even been in the store for ten seconds and I'm being hard-sold on my lunch.  I have also had like 3 different people try to serve me when I wasn't ready.  It's nice that they're eager, but after I worked in retail, that is one of the first things they teach you...know who has been greeted.  Also, I know this is really mean sounding, but there used to be a girl with an intensely screechy voice who greeted me at the counter and would then screechishly scream out my sandwich order to her minions.  I actually feared walking in to her taking my order the next few times (which last time was different, thankfully).  A few kinks to work out and this place would be a 5-star of a lunch getup."}
{"text":"The crew is really really humble and nice! Even though they're so busy with the lunch rush ! They still manage to serve with smile :)    Will always go back here for lunch"}
{"text":"We went to Zupas on the recommendation of some friends. I was excited to try it since I am a huge sucker for sandwiches and salads. It's a very bright place with a ton of people behind the counter to help. The menu is pretty large and you can build your own salads if you want. 

I have been here a couple times and I would say the sandwiches are not bad. They are pretty basic and not something you would drive out of your way for. The salads were more memorable for me. Great selections of salads and very fresh. The soups are very salty. 

I will go back to Cafe Zupas, but I wished it was a little more than it is."}
{"text":"I always get the strawberry salad, it's pretty good and can be quite filling, the sandwiches are nice but can be loaded down with toppings that you have to take the toppings off in order to enjoy the meat. The soups can be good, sometimes too much cheese to where it can be a bit clumpy. I have been here a couple times before and the food tasted better than the batch I had today"}
{"text":"No ingredient or nutritional information available,  staff refuses to disclose ANY allergen information to patrons with food allergies. 

Customers should assume menu items are cross contaminated with reckless abandon."}
{"text":"I've been waiting for Cafe Zupas to open on Rainbow since I first saw the sign. I'd never even heard of it before and I miss the soup/salad/sandwich place I frequented in Florida. Bonus incentive to try it was the 50% off the ENTIRE MEAL coupon I received in the mail. We finally went to try it out tonight. My daughters and I are vegetarians and my son is not. I very much appreciated the number of vegetarian items on the menu. We ordered three Ultimate Grilled Cheese, one Cuban, two cauliflower soups, one mushroom soup and one chicken tortilla soup. For dessert my girls got the chocolate mousse cake and chocolate hazelnut creme brûlée. Of course we all got the chocolate covered strawberries. Everything we got was exceptional. I am very picky about soups. The cauliflower soup was perfectly seasoned and the mushroom soup was so good my daughter wanted to lick the bowl. The Ultimate Grilled cheese sandwiches reminded me of a caprese salad in flavor. It was wonderful dipped in the cauliflower soup by the way. I really liked the small pieces of bread provided with the meals, they were perfect for sopping up the soup in the bottom of the bowls. The desserts were divine! It was a tad confusing when we first walked in, having never been in a Cafe Zupas before, but the staff was very nice and quick to help us figure out what we wanted and they got us through the line quickly. I liked seeing the menu outside before we walked in as well. That was extremely helpful in our decision making process because we had some idea what was on the menu before we even walked in. I would suggest maybe moving a few tables/booths around so new customers know where to go when they first walk in, but otherwise, I am definitely impressed. My family will be returning here often. I might even have to sneak in for a bowl of soup while my kids are at school every once in a while. :)
The only downfall... Expensive."}
{"text":"My favorite soup and sandwich place. I have been a Zupas fan since I found the location in Scottsdale, but every now and then I visit this location. 

Zupas in general has always been on point everytime I go and I have never had a complaint of this place.  If I had to come up with something, the only complaint I could think of is maybe my salad had too much dressing, but I think that happened once out of the many times I have been here.

They have a great selection of soup, salads, and sandwiched, and are all delicious. I love the rotation soup world tour they have and usually always get the featured soup cause they are always delicious. 

This is, and has been for a long time, my go to place. I could eat here every day for lunch and dinner, in fact, I did that the first week I realized I lived by and worked by a Zupas."}
{"text":"Addicted!!

This place is as good as it gets for a soup, salad, and sandwich shop.  I have been to Zupas so many times since I first experienced it last year, some weeks I am pretty sure I went everyday for lunch and/or dinner. During my many trips I have tried most things on the menu,  but nowadays I always get the BBQ Chicken Salad and whatever soup I am in the mood for, usually whatever is the \"World Tour\" soup.

I have never experienced any of the issues that I have seen in some of the reviews, and I have been here at least 100 times. The only downside to this place is they don't have some kind of points or rewards program, cause I would really be able to cash in on that.

Definitely a place to taste and take the family. Mine loves it!!"}
{"text":"Yum..I'm so made at myself for not coming here sooner. I've passed here many times going to the movies. Why I have a aversion to \"healthy\" food options is beyond me. My best friend got me to go here. So it was again a suggestion. The menu selection if you've never been here is kinda overwhelming at first. I finally decided on the salad and soup combo which is pricey but I went with it. I ordered the Asian citrus chicken salad and the mushroom bisque soup.  They will modify your salad if need be so I had them hold the peppers and black sesame seeds.  This is by far the tastiest salad I have ever had. It's delicious. The soup was equally as good and both healthy options. So the lesson I learned was healthy can taste good too. I'm now a repeat customer."}
{"text":"Cafe Zupas, is a nice little casual lunch or dinner spot. I've only eaten here once, because I wasn't a huge fan.  I didn't like the limited selection of salad fix-ins or the pre-determined salad choices they created.  However, if you can't make up your mind between a salad, soup or sandwich - there's a combo option for only $9, which the portions are good and fulfilling for the price.  However, I strong suggest Sweet Tomatoes/ Soup Plantation as the best option.  But, if you don't have either of these locations as on option then Cafe Zupas is it.   

Now, Cafe Zupas does let you sample the soups, which is a nice option as well."}
{"text":"Very expressive, the food is good but the services is spotty depends on the employee working. Service should be consistent."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! Great spot to come to after a hard gym session!  I had the mango berry salad and vegetarian panini with a complimentary chocolate covered strawberry! Sooo delicious and on top of that the service was great as well the lady that worked there kindly took my tray and threw my trash away I expected to clean my own mess but she insisted! I love it. I will definitely be coming here from now on! They just gained a customer!"}
{"text":"Great soups (especially the Wisconsin Cauliflower w/ bacon), salads, and sandwiches with prices that are within reason.  Always excellent service with a smile, and a free chocolate covered strawberry with every meal, definitely can't complain about that!"}
{"text":"Tried this place out for lunch. I ordered the turkey avocado sandwich, chocolate covered strawberry and rocky caramel brownie. Sandwich and brownie were delicious. Chocolate strawberry was ok. Decent service."}
{"text":"I've been coming here many times over the past year or so and every time I do, I'm even more disappointed than the last. Their salads seem to only be getting smaller yet the price stays the same. They'll charge you and arm and a leg if you want anything extra plus a dirty look or two for the inconvenience of scooping another teaspoonful of their dry, bland, processed chicken or any other topping. Prepare to spend at least ten bucks on a half salad with only sprinkles of any kind of topping.  Only thing to look forward to is the chocolate covered strawberry and the dry French bread."}
{"text":"great food. super fast service . loved the soup and salad that i got."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the food here... but the employees were a HOT MESS when I last went there.  They burnt my sandwich because they forgot about it, they billed me wrong and had to bill me again, and couldn't get the order right after I repeated it several times.  

The only reason I'll go back is because the food is so yummy.  They need better employees or management at this location"}
{"text":"When you want a good salad, Cafe Zupas is the place to get your fix! Everything I've ordered so far has been delectable. Some of the things I've ordered off the top of my head are the Pesto Chicken panini, Strawberry Harvest salad, Tortilla soup, and the California Cobb salad. They have infusion drinks available and the Orange Berry Infusion is my favorite! My sister and I love this drink so much because it's almost like the healthier version of the Orange Bang back home in Hawaii. This place is always so clean and the staff are always quick to help and serve. I love that you get a side of bread and chocolate covered strawberry with your meal."}
{"text":"Can't wait to go back ! 

I had been wanting to try this place out after driving by and seeing the word soups I am a huge soup fan & this place does not disappoint !!

Their mushroom bisque is literally the best creamy mushroom soup I have ever had and I highly recommend it  . . &  their tomato basil although different than most place's is unique and pretty good  . .  they also will let you sample all the soups before you choose one if you choose to do so !!

They also have a vast range of salads and sandwiches that you can watch being made in front of you 

I got the crab and avocado hot panini with munster cheese and it was delicious i dunked it into that awesome mushroom soup haha  . . 

And my order came with fresh bread & gianttt fresh and delicious chocolate covered strawberries for free !  . . 

I didn't try their salads but they all looked really good   . . I also had a passion fruit mango iced tea which was great 

The lay out is modern and clean and you can watch the chefs through a glass wall cooking the soups !! They are made fresh daily and have a huge selection 

they also had a bunch of desserts like fresh berry custards and cheesecakes etc. for display that all looked awesome"}
{"text":"The salads and soup are fabulous. Fresh always and very tasty. Zupas Cafe in Chandler has very friendly staff and super Salads/Soups. We have been there a number of times and never disappointed. A great healthy and tasty meal. Highly recommend to picky eaters who are health conscious. Very reasonably-priced as well."}
{"text":"I love Zupas but this location has an issue  listening to your order. Two days in a row they completely messed up my order. I finally called and got a free meal that again... I had to have corrected. I love that we have a Zupas in the area but staff needs to be more attentive and communicate orders better. Also, on to go orders they need to include utensils and napkins in your bag."}
{"text":"We just wanted a light dinner bowl of soup.  We ordered chicken tortilla soup (no tortilla...said tortilla strips were extra) and my mushroom soup with three kind of mushrooms was nothing more than a puree from a can.      Our soups were not hot.  Warm at best and little flavor. Soup was supposed to come with a French baguette but we got a dinner roll and it was stone cold.   Plastic spoons.   Costs with nothing to drink was 9.96.    I gave the cashier a penny she gave me 4 cents instead of a nickel.   I won't be back."}
{"text":"My wife and I weren't planning on eating here but she is health conscious and once she saw the menu in the window, the decision was made. Fresh salads mixed to order, sandwiches freshly made, and the lobster bisque soup--excellent. Everyone was nice and everything was prepared quick. The chocolate dipped strawberries are a nice touch and everything was a good value.

By the way, had Jason's Deli a week later and they  were almost as good. But maybe I wasn't butt-hurt and looking for a reason to make them better."}
{"text":"Awesome Salads, worth my money, and awesome hangout spot 

-1 star: USB port never work, lack of cleanliness, and dressings are not always available"}
{"text":"I love saying great things about restaurants but I have to say to Zupas, when you order a BBQ chicken salad you should actually get chicken on it.. as I towed through the line I had some chicken crumbles on my salad maybe less than 1 oz I asked for more and I got 1 oz more and they actually charged me extra for that . How lame. First of all if you put a reasonable normal portion of chicken on my salad I would not have to ask for extra !  With all the surrounding options at lunch time I defiantly will not be going back for
A 2nd visit .."}
{"text":"Ordered a Gilled Italian with \"NO Tomatoes\" to go as a suggestion from one of 8 people behind the counter. Didn't realize till I got home it was something totally different.  Food is just so-so.  I prefer paradise I think."}
{"text":"Move over Panera!

Decided to come here as a change from usually going to Panera. 
Located in Avondale off W McDowell, and not difficult to miss as it's right between Potbelly Sandwich & Habit Burger.  Lots of parking though parking is shared with other surrounding businesses.
Staff are friendly and welcoming upon entering.  Menu isn't too overwhelming, and was quite easy to read and understand.
Food tasted great, there seemed to be more variety in offered sandwiches, soups, and salads.  Pricing structure was good too particularly for their pick-2 versus competitors.  Particularly liked their homemade infusions drink station - lots of variety and, of the two that I tried, was really pleased!  They offered desserts, though not as extensive as competitors, but certainly different, e.g. cheesecake. 
They only lost a star from a really untidy napkin/cutlery area that was perpetually out of cup lids (-1).  Overall the restaurant was clean, tidy, well lit, with minimal noise level. 
Will be definitely returning to try some of their other variety of soups, salads, and sandwiches."}
{"text":"Food and environment of restaurant is pretty good, but its entirely too expensive.  7 bucks for a bowl of soup?  Fortunately I have had a gift card to use for a few lunches.  My one and only food complaint is that the last two times I took food to go, my clam chowder has been nothing much else but broth.  2 little chunks of potato and barely any clam to speak of.  That is disappointing."}
{"text":"Was in the mood for some good soup so I checked this place out. After reading the reviews by others, I opted for the lobster bisque and kale salad. Lobster bisque was not that...it was a corn chowder and meh.  Could have been warmer and had a little more flavor. 
Salad was awesome!  Will get that again. Loaded with flavor, quinoa, berries and cheese - delish and very filling. 
The little slice of bread was a good idea and the chocolate covered strawberry was a great treat at the end.  
Service was friendly and quick. 
Sandwich options looked great. Will try one next time."}
{"text":"What happened to you're pick to for $8.79 that you advertise on you're menus? Because I was charged $14 and mined you I got a water cup. I don't know mabye they are charging for water know. But you can't expect me to belive that the tax was $5.51. For my pick two I got a sandwich and soup. The sandwich was the crab avacado melt. It was absolutely horrible I do not recommend this to anyone. The crab lacked any and all flavor. The bread was warm but bye the time I sat down the whole sandwich was mushy it was so repulsive I could only take a few bites. Know for the soup I orderd the lobster bisque which claims to have real lobster carrots tomatoes celery onions and fennel LIES LIES LIES. all it was and tasted like a tick pasty broth like the  consistency of gravy. In all honestly the flavor of the soup was okeay but was very upsetting that None of the Ingredients you say are in their are actually in their. And to top it off they changed their bread slices witch were awsome to this cheep dryer out bland flavorless roll. They also have employs handling money then touching your with out changing gloves come on know that's just discussing I don't want other people germs on my food. My office always has zupas cater I'm going to make sure out next office party we take our business elsewhere along with my family and friends. Such a shame I really used to enjoy going there."}
{"text":"First of all:  It's a cafeteria.  If you want ambiance, quiet and a gourmet cuisine, you need to find another place to eat.  

I've been here twice: once when it was not busy and one time around lunch.  They do handle crowds pretty well and they keep the line moving.  Communication with the serving staff is a little tough when it's crowded because of the noise.  

The soups are very good; I especially like the lobster bisque.  I've also had the New England clam chowder and it was acceptable but not exceptional.  My wife liked the Yucatan chicken tortilla soup but I thought it had too much cumin in it.  She also had a Thai chicken mango salad which she said was on the spicy side... It's Thai... I think it's supposed to be a little spicy.

The sandwiches are also decent... not exceptional.  The salads were reasonably sized and fresh however they did seem to skimp a bit on the \"protein\" parts (chicken, egg etc.).

Overall it's a good place for a quick meal and the food is decent and a good alternative to a burger.  The prices are a bit high for a cafeteria type setting but it's not outrageous.  I'll probably stop here again when I'm in the vicinity and in the mood for soup and sandwich or a salad.  Expect it to be crowded around meal times and expect it to be on the noisy side; other than that, I would give it a thumbs up."}
{"text":"Attended the pre-grand opening of the Desert Ridge Marketplace location today.  Very busy, order at the counter and move through the line setup. $7.99 for choice of two items is pretty reasonable for lunch these days.

Soups are fabulous, salads a bit dull, dessert was better than expected.  Tasting samples are offered so I tried five soups before deciding:  Chicken Enchilada, Chicken Tortilla, Chicken and Sausage Gumbo, Thai Lobster Curry and Lobster Bisque.   My Thai Chicken salad was built on only iceberg lettuce, had a meager portion of meat and even skimped on the bell peppers, onions and wonton chips.  Paradise Bakery does a better job  on this type of salad.  Companion had a panini and seemed to enjoy it, but it was not a generous portion.  Finally, a mixed berry creme brulee', which was pretty good even without a caramelized sugar top.    Excellent selection of fountain drinks, crystal light and Italian sodas.  Bread included with soup was only ok, but the complimentary chocolate dipped strawberry was a very nice touch.

I will have to go back and try the other soups!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I'd say sort of a mix between Panera and Subway (price point somewhere in between). They make everything in front of you so it's easy to make changes to what you'd like. I've tried a few of their salads (all very good) and have had the chicken enchilada soup which I love! Bread and a chocolate covered strawberry comes with any salad so it's really a decent amount of food. They have a combo option (half salad, half soup, half sandwich choices). Desserts are good too. Definitely a new favorite in my area."}
{"text":"OK! I'm changing my initial review from 4 stars to 1 star. I'm not sure if a manager or chef has changed at this location recently, but it's been disgusting the last 4 times. My kids chicken fingers were cold and had a strange odor, the lettuce in my strawberry harvest salad was huge chunks (normally shredded), the chicken in the salad tasted like it went bad so I ended up throwing it away. Also they barely put any toppings on the salad, it's ridiculous.

The last time I got the winter wellness bowl it was also large chunks of kale instead of shredded and whomever made the salad dressing that day put an enormous amount of maple syrup and it ruined the whole bowl. Initially I was so impressed with the cleanliness of this place, but now the workers don't pay attention. I had the guy at the cash register checking me out with his gloves on handing me my change and then he went switched places with someone and went over to make my salad grabbing everything with his gloves he used to touch coins/cash. Another guy wipes his nose on his gloves every time I come in. I understand people have itches and have runny noses during flu season but I don't want to get sick, step 1: say excuse me & and have someone fill in, step 2: go blow your nose in the bathroom 3: wash hands, 4: put on new gloves. Please fix these problems because I really used to enjoy this place, but I won't be back for a long time."}
{"text":"Customer service here is sub par. Not sure why when ordering a Turkey Bacon Avocado sandwhich they would not allow me to put the avacado on the side. Got order wrong twice. Clam chowder soup was only liquid. Watered down mess. Sandwhiches were fine when the were fixed. They do not cater to substitutions even if you are willing to pay for it. Will not make a BLT even though they have the ingredients for it. 

Overall just meh with this place."}
{"text":"Love it! Not crazy about the staff at Germain and Gilbert but the Baseline and Val vista had a homely feel with the best CREME BRÛLÉE"}
{"text":"Cafe Zupas is a staple in our household. We eat at Zupas once a week!

I love the variety of sandwiches, paninis, soups and salads. My ultimate favorites are the tomato basil soup with a chicken pesto panini. 

While the ordering process can be a bit hectic, the staff is always super happy and helpful. 

If you haven't tried their fresh salads or soups, you're missing out!!"}
{"text":"I've always received excellent customer service from here and almost everything I've had here has been amazing! I highly recommend the glazed chicken chipotle salad and/or the pesto chicken sandwich."}
{"text":"Management must be very focused on food cost and not giving you what you paid for. Ordered 2 large soups, both very watered down and only filled 2/3 to the top."}
{"text":"So, I basically just left Cafe Zupas and I've never been more excited to write a review of a place as I am now. I wasn't planning on going anywhere since my original plan for lunch fell through the cracks. I got kidnapped and got taken here and I'm glad I gave this place a try finally since my cousin has been raving about this place.  I could compare this experience with when I first discovered Forever 21 during my Ralph Lauren Big Pony and True Religion phase. Wait wait wati! You mean something good doesn't have to be expensive?!

We were walking in and we were greeted by Rae with her friendly smile. She asked us if it was our first time and she told us about the food and the ordering process which was very helpful. She said their best-sellers for soup are tomato basil, lobster bisque and chicken enchilada chili. Everyone at the counter taking our order, making our food and working the register were wonderful and friendly. 

Asian BBQ Pork Sandwich:
Roasted Pork with cucumbers, carrots, cilantro, chili-lime spread and Korean BBQ sauce. I honestly wanted to try this but was expecting to get disappointed. Well, I'm disappointed about not being disappointed! The pork and the sweet BBQ sauce reminds me of the sweet filling of a Chinese BBQ pork bun. The cucumber, carrots, cilantro and chili-lime spread gave this sandwich a Vietnamese hint. 5/5

Crab Avocado Melt:
Crab salad, bacon, avocado, red onions, tomatoes, celery and muenster cheese. It sounds like there's too much going on with the crab, avocado and bacon and I hate celery but it's actually pretty good. 5/5

Losbter Bisque:
We had to fight over who's going to order this. But we decided on sharing. This is not the best lobster bisque I've ever had but considering the price of the meal and where I'm getting it from, it's absolutely good. 5/5

Wild Mushroom Bisque:
Crimini, button and shiitake mushrooms. I LOVE mushrooms and mushroom soup is one of my favorite comfort foods. Great flavor, texture and consistency. Not too watery and not too thick...just right. 5/5

Chocolate-Dipped Strawberry:
The strawberry I got was tart...and I seriously love tart fruits. Must be my lucky  day! This was free and anything good tastes even better when free. 5/5

Salted Caramel Creme Brulee:
As the name implies: creme brulee with salted caramel (on top). The caramel is extremely sweet and thick. We tried finishing this but just couldn't. 2/5

Chocolate Hazelnut Creme Brulee:
Don't expect this to taste like Nutella. This creamy dessert tastes like chocolate with a very mild hint of hazelnut and has candied hazelnut bits on top. It's only $3 though. 3/5

I may have found my perfect spot for quick lunches.  $5 for a sandwich or half a salad, $3-10 for dessert, $8 for a combo (includes your choice of half a soup/ half a salad/ sandwich). You get a free chocolate-dipped strawberry if you order a salad/ sandwich. It's way better than fast-food burgers and whatever which I don't eat. Their desserts may not be the best but they're doing me a favor so I don't get fat!"}
{"text":"Legit deliciousness, y'all. 

Several Cafe Zupas have popped up around town. After a night of Vegas debauchery, I decided to get something chock full of nutrients. 

Walking in the place was super clean, but really didn't have ambience or a theme. There was plenty of seating with multiple 4 person tables and a few booths.

Getting in line, I saw there was a pick 2 combo. There were selections of sandwiches, salads, and soups. I ordered the crab avocado panini and since it is getting cold out opted for some soup. There were so many soups to choose from, before I had to settle and pick one, I was given as many samples as I wanted. I fell in love, over and over, and decided on the chicken enchilada chili which was nothing like a traditional chili at all. It was divine and I need to get more of it in my life. The cauliflower soup was amazing as was the lobster bisque. 

I didn't order any, but they have a slew of fresh baked treats, a million dollar bar, s'mores brownies, cakes, and all sorts of treats that probably would have knocked my socks off. 

I paid for much lunch, then took the goods to go. Once I got hole, I saw that my order came with fresh baked bread and 2 chocolate covered strawberries. Nice AND delicious touch.


Zupas was a pleasant surprise. Fast, casual, friendly service and axon fly fresh, wholesome food. The atmosphere on the actually restaurant isn't anything special, it is similar to Panera Bread, but not quite. I can't see myself ever dining in. I will however be taking my order to go. See you soon, Zupas!"}
{"text":"The California Cobb Salad is my jam, this place is a little pricey but the soup and salads are great. 4 stars because I haven't had a sandwich yet that ive liked and because of the prices, but overall good eats."}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients with both thee salads and the sandwiches. I recommend getting a hot sandwich as the bread for the cold ones leave something to be desired. I appreciate the fact that every meal comes with a chocolate covered strawberry."}
{"text":"Located in the busy eastern shopping center... think we finally have a winner in this corner spot.  This corner location has been converted so many times and zupas has hit the spot.

It's a soup salad sandwich shop and u stand in line to order one of the 3.  Or a combo.  We ordered the chicken enchilada Soup, chicken tortilla soup and some sandwiches.  They give u complimentary bread wi th your soup as well as chocolate covered strawberries with your order.  Yum!

Everything was tasty and fresh but next time we will do soup and salad since they give u bread with the soup..  the sandwich felt too heavy for us. 

Reasonably priced and they even have a recharging station for your electronics...iphone etc.  But make sure you bring your cord."}
{"text":"Similar to Paradise Bakery. I like being able to create my own salad. I am a big salad eater, and it always seems like people think I am being high maintenance by either omitting or requesting to add ingredients to my salads. You basically get to pick 5 ingredients, your salad mix, and then a protein. In my opinion it's the perfect portion. 
The thing I don't like about the sandwiches is that they only offer ciabatta bread. They should create some sort of whole grain healthy alternative. 
They also offer a \"recharge bar\" where you can plug in your phone/iPad. The only downside is you have to have your own Power cord. Who walks around with one of those? Cool concept though.

The gross part: the moldy rotten chocolate dipped strawberry I received for free. Lol. Gross!"}
{"text":"Might not really be a full 4 stars. We met a small group of people here. It is a line up and order type of place. It was busy for a Saturday. Many choices of soup, sandwiches, salads and deserts. Yes all made fresh in front of you. 

Prices are reasonable. That is a good thing. I ordered and combo: sand watch and salad. I order their Cuban which was simmered shredded pork and ham along with a salad that featured mango salad dressing with crumbled of cinnamon almonds, corn etc. (check out the menu...many many selections). The pork was a little watery however very tasty. The extra moisture did create a soggy sandwich. The salad was amazing. Not too much dressing (yay). The crispy aspect of the almonds and the total fresh flavor along with some of the blueberries and strawberry slices just made the salad fresh and vibrant. 

 I did enjoy the food, well as much as I can for a line up type establishment. The place was clean. Getting the forks, napkins and drinks was confusing and not set up real well."}
{"text":"Descent food with healthy options like a Panera Bread cross with Subway style of ordering and preparation. Good value with good amount of options. Recommends for those looking for a quick bite and time constraint people need to get in and head out. The service is really consistent and friendly. Don't forget to order a fountain drink which allows you to be a mixologist opposed to their ready to grab bottle drinks at the front counter."}
{"text":"Amazing! Love this place! Great soups, salads, and sandwiches. Soup Nazi-esque soup. Get the pick two combo and try two things at once. Love the clam chowder and enchilada chili. I just wish they would build one at Mesa Riverview or downtown Mesa..."}
{"text":"Invariably good here!! Fresh food, prepared as you watch, fast service . I am still in love with the lobster bisque ! Mango berry salad is amazing ! Fast, fresh , good prices!"}
{"text":"I finally decided to go check out Zupas and  I was pleasantly surprised. At the advise of a lady in line behind me I tried the Roasted Red Pepper & Lobster soup.  I can truly say its one of the best soups I ever tasted. I'm from long beach and they don't have Zupas there soooo maybe I will pick up some and take it home with me..."}
{"text":"If you know me, you know I love soups & sandwiches! My manager brought me here for lunch today and the food was amazing. I tried one of their  home made teas / juices . The orange juice one with honey & strawberry was so addicting! I ordered a turkey bacon avocado panini with a lobster bisque soup. The chocolate covered strawberries Included was so nice too and super good. I ended up ordering a couple more to take home for my family to try. I'm a huge cheesecake lover and the cheesecake here was by far the best I've ever tried. Can't wait to come back and bring my family! Super delicious food & customer service :)"}
{"text":"I went for the first time tonight with my family and we all loved it!  Delicious food at a decent price.  The restaurant was clean and the staff was very friendly.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite \"go to lunch from work\" cafe!! It is similar to the idea of Panera bread for those who have never been.

For those who have never been it is like a factory assembly line. You order salad or sandwich from the first person on the left and then move onto the soup station.

One tip is that if you get the combo you get a free chocolate covered strawberry included in your meal! It's not a small one either.

My favorite soup has to be the garden chowder! I pair that with the berry salad and that is usually my go to meal when I am here but I have tried nearly everything on that menu and no matter what your choice is... you can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"I was like a giddy freakin' schoolgirl when I learned that we were getting a Cafe Zupas closer than the Eastern location! I finally got to enjoy a meal there today and it was terrific.  

I love the choose 2 option (choose any 2 from 1/2 salad, 1/2 soup, whole sandwich).  I especially love the chicken pesto sandwich. My favorite salad is Nuts About Berries - the lettuce is so crisp and fresh and the berries are ripe and flavorful. I switch out the poppyseed dressing with red raspberry vinaigrette and it's total sweet perfection. You get a baguette with your salad and you can top off your meal with an included sweet treat - a chocolate covered strawberry. They have some more desserts available for purchase but I haven't tried them yet. 

The service here is way above and beyond. These people are so friendly and helpful. There's always someone waiting to greet you and offer suggestions or answer questions at the front door. They are extremely flexible if you want to make changes to the menu options. The food is ready so quickly after ordering. And all of this fantastic service is just because... they don't accept tips. The restaurant is bright and spacious with plenty of tables and large booths, and a charging station. 

My only wish for this place is a whole wheat bread option for sandwiches and baguettes. This is one of my favorite food spots in the area and can't wait to try all of the options on the menu! Still completely giddy over you, CZ! Welcome to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Holy Heaven I just had the BEST freakin lunch and amazing salad here!!!!  Fresh FRESH FRESH...Did I mention FRESH???  Seriously this place has something for EVERYONE even the pickiest of eaters and the staff was ready to create our dream lunch!  I don't know what else to say except #NOM GET IN MY BELLY!!!!!"}
{"text":"I had been meaning to try out Cafe Zupas but never had the chance to but last night, I was lucky enough to come here with my family for dinner. 

They have a menu filled with sandwiches, salads, and soups. The best part about them? $7.99 combos. You get your choice of two items -- full sandwich, half salad, half soup. So we all went for a combo. 

I personally got the Honey Bacon Club panini, which had turkey, ham, smoked bacon, tomatoes, muenster cheese, and house-made honey mustard spread. Now, I've never been a huge salad person but they had so many different types of fruity salads. I just had to go for half of their Summer Chicken salad, which had chicken, fresh strawberries, cashews, dried cranberries, & grapes on a bed of mixed greens with house-made fresh strawberry vinaigrette dressing. Along with your full orders, you get bread and a chocolate covered strawberry. 

Their sandwich? Not really all that memorable. It was quite thin. Don't get me wrong ... it was good but it wasn't great. I could've honestly just passed it up because their salad just out shined it by a few thousand miles.

I love strawberries so at the first bite of this summer chicken salad, I was in heaven. Why? Their strawberry vinaigrette dressing is to DIE FOR. It's amazing ..and the cashews add a nice touch of flavor into it as well. My goodness. I don't think I've had such an amazing salad elsewhere before. 

I think I just found my favorite place. This place would be PERFECT for summer. I'm just craving their salads right now and will be coming back soon! VERY SOON! I can't wait to try all of their fruity salads!!"}
{"text":"Very good. Friendly workers, fresh tasty food. My daughter loves the chocolate strawberries. The soups always taste fresh. Just make sure you don't go too close to closing, they run out of many items."}
{"text":"I was pretty stoked to try this place, as the menu looked amazing. The chicken tortilla soup was so salty I couldn't eat it. Didn't really get any apology or explanation except \"that's how it's supposed to be.\" My dates sandwich was drenched in some kind of sauce, which made it pretty gross. Overall, if I had to sum this place up in one word that would be \"meh\"."}
{"text":"first time here but it was pretty decent. 
the salad i ate was a little plain and i wouldn't but it a second time. the food here just seemed too...sweet. well, at least for my liking. this place looks like a wanna be panera. 

but, the customer service here was great & it has a friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"I read many of the negative reviews before I tried this place and had to wonder who told you salads were low in calories. Their claim is fresh, healthy food, not low in calories. The salads are high in calories because of all the fruits in them and the dressings. 

Having said that I found the food very fresh and tasteful. Someone said the soups were limited. When I was there they had 6 choices!!

Where do you find a restaurant with more than 6 soup choices?

The soup and salad combo was very plentiful and priced reasonably. Good portion of both for under $10. Don't let the negative reviews keep you away from a lunch that is filling and tastes very good.

This is a fast food restaurant that doesn't claim to be anything else."}
{"text":"The soups are actually good. The sandwiches are awful. The type of bread they use on all of them isn't good at all. The meat in my sandwich was stale. The side of bread they give you with the meal was cold and hard. Strawberry is a nice touch. I would go back for soup."}
{"text":"Went here today and ordered a full salad and my daughter ordered a half salad.  The half salad was in a smaller bowl and somewhat full and the whole salad was less than half full.  So I paid full price for a half salad.  Annoying!  Plus they have become so skimpy on the ingredients.  Only found a couple pieces of chicken and very slim amounts of other ingredients in both salads.  The chocolate covered strawberries lacked chocolate and were super tart.  Really? You have to cut back on everything?? This place was busy but I'm guessing that will change  as soon as regulars see how they have cut back.  This location used to be a favorite however, now Panera Bread or Wildflower Bread Company that are both right across the street from this location is a better choice for us in the future."}
{"text":"This location sucks!  They have an employee that opens the door for you and is so blasted annoyingly fake trying to make you feel welcome. Then I ordered the Mushroom Bisque to find just a couple of pieces of mushroom in it. Who wants mushroom soup with no mushrooms??  What is the point? The soup looked grainy so I'm not sure if they used sour milk or what?? The salad my daughter ordered wasn't dressed enough and her sandwich was stacked so that the meat and toppings were only in the middle of the tasteless sandwich.    So in other words, you only eat and taste bread until you get to the middle of the sandwich.  How hard is it to make a sandwich???  In addition, the strawberries lacked chocolate.  My daughter thought it was just her strawberry and then I gave her mine and it was the same.  We normally order the soup and salad and this was the first time to try a sandwich.  This was probably not the location to try it since it was probably tasteless due to how it was made.  Just guessing............"}
{"text":"I am so bummed to find out that this is not available anywhere near me at home. Hopefully Southern California is soon to be on the list. However until then I will make it a normal stop while in Arizona visiting. I had the soup and sandwich combo and it was amazing! Honestly though I had the ultimate grilled cheese with tomato basil soup, so simple but so delicious!"}
{"text":"The soup is hit or miss. I have had a watered down clam  chowder more than once. Both the garden chowder and the New England clam. It's so loud when ordering it's hard to get your order right and having to repeat it several times. They need some soft surfaces to help deaden sound."}
{"text":"This place was awesome! The pick two option is great for around $8.50. Come with salad sandwich or soup. I got salad and a turkey artichoke pesto panini which was AMAZING. 

Definitley would come back. Bigger portions than panera bread. Super fast service and everyone was very friendly."}
{"text":"Always great food. Fresh and made to order. Fairly friendly staff. Great selection of drinks. The last few times the cleanliness of the store has been less than desirable. Lots of dirty tables. Sticky floors. Makes the whole experience a bit less than par."}
{"text":"Ok so after 2 not so good experiences (more so the staff and their lack of c/s etc.) the food is usually on point. That being said I went back with some friends and just ordered to go and the experience was a lot better. If they would have an additional charge for adding or being able to substitute items I would give them 5 stars."}
{"text":"Delicious lobster Bisque soup, and excellent sandwiches and excellent value a family of 4 can enjoy a healthy meal in a clean friendly environment for less than $30.00 total in under 10minutes with a chocolate dipped strawberry for dessert you can't beat this place. We have been here 3 times every meal has been excellent with lots of fresh choices!

Great service and very clean."}
{"text":"I have been to Cafe Zupas a few other times. It seems to be very consistent across the board at all the locations I have tried, the food is the same and service is the same, which is a good thing, you know what your getting! Decent food, decent price, good service. 
I'm a big fan of the Honey Bacon Club. I don't care for the salads. The soups are pretty good too but I wish they were hotter when you get them to eat in, they are just warm and if you don't eat it fast enough, it can almost get cold. I rather take it home if I can and heat it up a bit. Love the Garden Chowder (its not thick and heavy like a chowder usually is). Not a fan of the Wisconsin Cheddar, it's not smooth enough. The Enchilada and Tortilla soup are pretty good. Red Pepper Lobster could use more lobster. I think the soup toppings are a rip off for the price  (.69) but sometimes I can't resist adding some cheese to my soup. You get a free side of bread with your order and a chocolate covered strawberry, yum! Cakes and dessert bars are good, the crème brulee isn't \"real\" so I will never get it again.
I will return to Café Zupas, where ever it may be!"}
{"text":"They do a great job here at lunch time. It gets quite busy but they keep the line moving and usually get the order right and if they don't, they are sure to fix it quickly. I really like their salads, they're a bit pricey for just a salad but when you get lazy packing your lunch, it's worth it! 
We are able to get our food and eat and drive back to work within our allotted lunch hour. And we don't feel like we are eating \"fast food\". They keep the place clean and are always friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Nickel and Dime!!!

Whatever you do don't try and make your own salad here. Want an extra tablespoon of bell peppers? $.70

Want a tablespoon of cheese? $.70

By the time you're done you have a barely satisfying $11 small salad mindlessly prepared by a 20yr old with an attitude.

Pass!"}
{"text":"Not impressed with this location. My typical place is the Glendale location and coming here today it's not the same.  Between the salad and the soup at this location and service wasn't at all pleased. Surprised because the Glendale location is fantastic. Guess this is a typical \"not all locations are created equal\". Flat and smaller portion of salad. Soup also not very presentable."}
{"text":"My wife and I always come here. Love their Cuban grilled pork, chili enchilada soup and their salads overall. Can't go wrong here. We come here all the time and every time is excellent food and customer service."}
{"text":"Great food, customer service and location. Prices are fair and food is fresh! We love this place and go here all the time. Always so friendly and clean."}
{"text":"Prices have gone up, quality has gone down. 
The Sandwiches seem to be smaller, and the soups were very watery/broth like, not creamy at all. My Lobster Bisque has no Lobster in it...and to top it off, they wouldn't substitute for the turkey in their sandwiches to accommodate my diet."}
{"text":"The food is always amazing. thisthe service needs to slow down !! Listen to the customers order before they just start going throwing things together. My husband went into order two meals and came out with one.  It was suppose to be a large salads lunch with double chicken, then my husbands Oder a sandwich. They gave him side salad with his sandwich. Really upsets me when he drove half hour to bring my two bites of a lunch and I watch my weight but that's not even enough salad for an anorexic person. Slow down be more clear and stop thinking everyone's ordering combos"}
{"text":"Solid four star place for me my wife and most women I know would give it 5 stars. That's probably because it's possible to have a healthy meal there and because they give you a strawberry dipped in chocolate with every meal. The staff is always super friendly which is nice. Price wise it's probably like between one and two dollar signs. Figure $12 each if you get a drink."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong, I love the food at Cafe Zupas, but the whole ordering arrangement is just stupid. I've been to different locations & it's like this at every location. 

There is a different person at each station; sandwich/salad, soup, dessert, & cashier. Today I got asked 4 separate times if my order was for here or to-go. 4 times! They ask you at every 'station'. I was asked what food I ordered at dessert area...then one step to the right the cashier asked what I ordered again so she can ring it up. So after repeating the same answers, at the end they have you say your whole specific order (annoying when you order for a whole family). It is just unnecessary to have that many people fulfill your order!! 

Like I said I love the food at Cafe Zupas, but the ordering arrangement just bugs me."}
{"text":"Betrayed my beloved Panera for a visit to Zupas the other day.   It was tough to do because I enjoy the combos of soups, sandwiches, and salads so much at Panera that it was hard for me to picture anything being better.   Well that and the fact that if I greeted her with another cafe's breadcrumbs on my face and my odor being that of Wisconsin Cauliflower soup, well she might not ever take me back.

The decor and ambiance were pretty lacking here in my opinion, and it didn't scream warm and inviting in the least, but rather cold and factory like.  A helpful employee instructed myself and a coworker on the ordering process and we went down the assembly line making our choices.   I found it a little chaotic as a first-timer but I'm sure it would improve with each visit and especially once you find that sweet spot of your favorite order.  An example of the chaos was that by the time we reached the cashier, my friend was in front and only half his order was on his tray, while mine was behind his fully completed.  The staff did a great job in getting it all straightened out and perhaps there wasnt an issue to begin with, but I prefer a seamless ordering experience and felt this one was slightly rushed and not as anal as I might like.   Patient, warm and anal is perfection for me in a cafe.   Get your mind out the gutter.   

For food I went with the Tuscan White Bean and Veggie soup and the Thai Peanut Chicken sandwich.  I wasnt into the soup at all.   It just seemed flat and lifeless, though I should have probably realized that from the description on the website:  \"A light, vegetarian soup loaded with lots of vegetables & delicious white beans.\"   Why did I even order this is a question I cannot answer at the moment.  It also wasn't as hot as I like my soup to be.   Would not recommend that.   The sandwich was good.  It had a nice balance of sweet and tangy from the Peanut and Chili sauces, and the chicken tasted fresh and had a nice flavor.  The crunch from the cucumbers and pickled carrots was also welcome and slowly helped me forget how bad the soup was.

Overall it was a decent experience and meal, especially considering the price $7.99 for the sandwich and a half soup/salad.   It's not enough to have me leave Panera permanently, which shouldn't come as a surprise, and after some thorough mouthwashing she was none  the wiser to my momentary indiscretion."}
{"text":"There is a lot of competition just from 16th street to 20th street on Camelback.  Cafe Zupas is another decent place with affordable prices.   

I think the concept is similar to Paradise Bakery Cafe.  You place your order at the different counter stations, either salad, sandwich, or soup. However, they don't have a coffee station, wish they would, but do have a dessert counter.  They all looked so sweet & delicious!  A plus is while waiting in line, they give you different soups to sample.  I tried the Thai Lobster Curry soup, it sounded better than actually tasted for me.  To be safe, I stick with the clam chowder soup.  It was rich and good flavor, but loaded with more potatoes than clam meat.  

All their soups include fresh bread and a chocolate-dipped strawberry.  You get to choose 2 combo for $7.99.  The sandwich came as whole not just half along with the soup.  Overall, an excellent spot to get a quick lunch/dinner."}
{"text":"I was lucky enough to participate in Cafe Zupas Pre-Opening event last week, and I have to say I was impressed!  The ambience was cool, and included comfy booths and a 'bar' seating area with ipod docks and a place to set your laptops.  The staff was friendly and helpful, and allowed me to sample several different types of soups before settling on one.  And the food:  Delicious!  I actually loved it so much, I went back the next day to try something else, and everything I tasted was fantastic!  The first day, I had the Yucatan Chicken Tortilla soup (with sour cream, cheddar cheese, guacomole, and tortilla strips on top!) and the California Turkey sandwich (turkey, avocado, tomatoes, sprouts, cucumbers, mixed greens, muenster cheese, and ranch dressing).  Both were absolutely amazing, and I also got a chocolate dipped strawberry on the side, which comes with any soup or salad.  For dessert, I tried the cheesecake, and managed to eat half before feeling like I was going to explode.  it was divine.  The next day, I went back for more and tried the Chicken Enchilada Chili (made with red and green enchilada sauce) and the Turkey Bacon Avocado grilled panini (with muenster cheese and honey mustard).  For dessert, I sampled the Mixed Berry Creme Brule.  Day 2 was also awesome.  In addition to everything I already listed, I sampled other soups, sandwiches and salads that all tasted equally as delicious.  For example, the Wild Mushroom Bisque is next on my list to eat, since the sample I had left my mouth watering.  The Lobster Bisque, Shrimp & Sausage Gumbo, and Thai Lobster Curry also tasted superb.  As for sandwiches, I'd like to try the BBQ Pulled Pork next....or the Turkey Spinach Artichoke grilled panini.....or the Ultimate Grilled Cheese.  So many choices!!  I also heard amazing comments on the Nuts About Berries salad, the BBQ Chicken salad, and the Pina Colada Chicken salad.

Basically, this is now my new favorite lunch place, and I can't wait to try everything they have to offer!  You should definitely check it out!!"}
{"text":"First time and this was Catered in for us, so this review is 100% about the FOOD...

I got the Honey Bacon Club with a Tortilla Soup. 1st appearance after unwrapping the sammich, was,, wheres the meat ? only a couple thin slices of Ham, and few thin strips of Bacon.. (used to Deli places where they overload you with meat portions) and since catered, it had my lovely tomatoes on there ripe to pick n throw to the side... ok, on to the Bread / Panini, exterior was VERY powdered with flour to a chalky texture at times... That being said, Time to eat anyways... The flavors all stood out and sammich very well dressed and could even taste the ham n tiny bacon. Somehow this all evened out on consumption (except the flour exterior).  This was a very good Sammich that if lined, i would definitely get again.. 

The SOUP... oh boy, this soup wasn't much of a soup, more of a stew, plenty of chicken, tomatoes(yes yum), and the tortilla essence was strong, and actually had a great flavor over all, but hardly any Soup to sip on.. 2 things I would change, Tortilla Soups that i know have some kick, this had NONE... and of course the actual Soup part of Soup, would need to be more than 4 or 5 spoon fulls. Maybe in the restaurant, they had chili, etc to add.. will try again I am sure.. 

Worth the drive to get ? within 5 miles yes... Over 5 miles, you would need to be filling a craving for one of the items.. Good Luck and let me know what you think."}
{"text":"The food was excellent.  We ordered a meal to eat there as well as two bowls of asparagus soup to take home and enjoy the following day.  The portions in our meal at the restaurant were what one would expect, but when we opened our 'to-go' order we were disappointed."}
{"text":"First time here.  Loved the salad choices, lots of fruit/berries, all house-made dressings.  We found the clam chowder a little salty but would like to try other soups at another visit."}
{"text":"Service, food, ambiance, this place really does have it all! I love eating at Cafe Zupas because everything tastes so gourmet and you relaly can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Their cauliflower soup is to die for and you can mix and match pretty much anything! I just wish it wasn't so expensive!"}
{"text":"Had the Turkey Bacon Avacodo and Tomato Basil soup, everything was good and tasted fresh,  similar quality to Panera will come back."}
{"text":"The salads are acceptable, yet the sandwiches were not good at all. Too much dressing and sauces, and the quality of the meat was not there. Did not get a chance to try the soups so cannot speak to that. The ambiance is very bright, very few booths and very crowded seating. Possibly okay for a quick work lunch but not an enjoyable leisurely dining experience."}
{"text":"Staff seemed upset to see customers and also unhelpful. I got very little salad for what I paid for. The bread I got with my salad was also very stale. Strawberry was very small and old/squishy, I know it's complimentary but they should still care about presentation. Dining area was dirty and unorganized. Don't recommend."}
{"text":"Champ salads n soups!!

Sandwiches are ok, they are panini style, not my favorite kind

But i go here OFTEN for the salads and soups! Whooo!

You can make your own salads with 6 free toppings (or 4 if you use one for meat/protein)

Or you can choose their salad creations off their men my favorite is the Thai Chicken Mango Salad...

The southwestern tortilla soup is to die for, plus many of their other soups i have sampled are so good!

Hope you enjoy visit there as much as i do!!"}
{"text":"I must say I use to love this place when they first opened. But now they raised the price a little I feel like the portion size has dwindled down to the extreme. More so on their to-go portions. I got the Kale-quinoa salad, and wow how little it is. I paid $12.10 for a soup and salad. 

As you will see in the picture I added chicken to my Kale-Quinoa salad. I paid $1.79 for extra chicken. To pay that I got a sad amount of chicken in my salad. Not even full size strips of chicken, bits and pieces for almost $2? I usually don't complain about the price. But my goodness, a little stingy on the portion for almost $2 extra for chicken. I know that restaurants try to portion out the food for food cost. I would know I use to be a Sous Chef. But for the price of the food I really think the portion sizes should be looked at a little more carefully. I personally do not think I got what I paid for. Like I stated earlier I use to love this place, it's sad to say that I have to give 2 stars. I sure hope they take these criticisms into consideration."}
{"text":"Great lunch spot. Love the deal for soup/salad/sammies pick 2.

I tried the chicken salad and lobster bisque. Having extra bread and chocolate covered strawberry made the lunch totally worth it. Parking is a little crazy during lunch but the restaurant is very large with plenty of seating. Will definitely try this for lunch again soon!"}
{"text":"Ordered the pesto chicken sandwich and yucatan chicken soup. Almost no chicken in either one. Friend ordered turkey sandwich and there was no turkey on that at all."}
{"text":"Good BUT so chaotic....
Ordering is kind of a rush and with the line of people in such close proximity can make it even worse. We got 1 kids grilled cheese that came with fruit and 2 mix n match meals: crab avocado melt and asian pork sandwich, mushroom soup and gumbo. These came with a bread and strawberry. Bread was soft and strawberry was pretty good. Was disappointed because people in front of us got last creme brule and they had none ready...boo! We got the nut bar instead and to me it was too sweet. Good variety of drinks and sugar free options as well. Our total was under $25. Overall we'd be back but next time we hope the hype dies
Down a bit. People couldn't find seating and the floors were wet from all the people dripping their drinks, etc on the floor. Soups need to be a bit hotter.....lets hope next time we can bump up a star."}
{"text":"I have eaten here several times since they opened on Rainbow. The food is fine if you like over dressed salads and over sauced sandwiches.  My problem is the PUSHY service style it is not the employees' faults it is obviously corporate mandates. I want to order my food in peace.  I want to read the menu myself.  I hate how pushy they make the employees act. I only go when it is picked by a friend. I would never inflict this style of service on anyone and hate Zupas for it."}
{"text":"If you're craving a light, fresh lunch, you've come to the right place! Cafe Zupas has lots of sandwich selection and salad made in front of your very eyes. It was pretty crowded when I came during lunch but it passes by quickly enough. 

I had the clam chowder and chicken pesto sandwich. The clam chowder was lacking in flavor unfortunately. I tried my friend's mushroom soup and I was impressed from the start with it. The chicken pesto sandwich is pretty good as well! Nothing to complain about. Lunch also comes with a cute chocolate-covered strawberry!  

I'll be back whenever I crave sandwiches and soup for sure!"}
{"text":"Since my daughter had braces put on at the end of last year, she complains of soreness pretty often wanting only to eat soup and nothing solid. As the name implies, we've been able to find a nice variety of soups that have been good to me, and more importantly, to my daughter. Pair the soup with a salad or a sandwich and you'll find yourself enjoying a nice meal.

Most of the employees are younger, but we've experienced no problems and they have been always been quite friendly quick to assist or answer any questions. Once you order you sandwich or salad, you can move on down the line to order your soup, then finally you can look over the dessert case to top of your meal with something sweet, or you can finish with the always pleasing chocolate covered strawberry.

The soups, salads, and sandwiches are fresh and made to order, not much more you ask for there. Aside from the aforementioned items, you can also opt to have a quinoa protein bowl. I haven't had any of the salads, but have sampled most of the soups and sandwiches. There's plenty of variety in their selection where you'll most discover something of you're liking. You can't go wrong with the Italian Club with salami, ham, turkey, and balsamic served on Ciabatta. As far as soups, I go for the Wisconsin Cauliflower topped with bacon and cheese.

We have no problems with pricing and we can usually get away paying for a meal for three for $10-$12 per person. Regardless, if my daughter's teeth are sore or not, we have a solid option for soup/salad/sandwich combos."}
{"text":"Best soup, salad, sandwich place! Fresh veggies and fruits with amazing ingredients. I've ordered the mixed berries and mango salad. Both of my top favorite salads with kale and spring mix. I also ordered the veggie sandwich on wheat bread, which is the best for veggie lovers. I also love that they always give you a chocolate strawberry with your meal."}
{"text":"They're food is so fresh it's like it walked out of the garden and onto your plate!! 
Combo meals are the best way to sample two things at once. The soups are fantastic and served at eating temperature. I love that. Lobster Bisque is to die for. 
The drink station  is unique as well. If you are familiar with Cafe Zupas you won't be disappointed and if you've never been to one before, get your hinny in here!

Just came for the second time. Ok having the same thing. LOL What can I say that lobster bisque was to die for!!!!"}
{"text":"Overpriced lunch. I have been here several times and every time, I remind myself not to go back.  The soups are decent and the sammies are below average. Everything is weighed out & they skimp on everything so bad, hardly any meat on the subs. Save your money and go to port of subs"}
{"text":"Great selection of salads, soups, and sandwiches. All fresh made to order. The process works like a well oil machine, even though the only been open for a few weeks. Have the kale and quinoa salad and it is quite good. the chicken tortilla soup could be a little spicier. I will be back."}
{"text":"Amazing food, hospitality, the wait is never longer than 10 min!! HIGHLY RECOMMEND: their soups are so good! We love the kids meals, and they have great options for vegetarian options. The chocolate covered strawberries are always the crowd pleaser with the kiddos."}
{"text":"First off, don't be scared if there is a long line of people trying to order. It actually goes by pretty fast. What takes so long is the customers not being ready with their order. Once the order is in, it takes no time at all to prepare.
Their SPECIAL isn't bad either, order a sandwich and a half soup or half salad for $8 and change. To be honest, the sandwiches are kind of on the small side but what they lack in size they make up for it in FLAVOR. I usually order the ultimate grilled cheese so I can dunk in my tomato soup, which is freaking AWESOME. Also, the cherry balsamic chicken salad is BOMB DOT COM! Both are a must try. They also have a nice assortment of fruit infused waters, which are delish, if your tired of the regular old fountain soda drinks. The orange infused berry one is my favorite. They also have yummy looking desserts(which I haven't tried yet, because I'm usually full) which consist of cheesecakes and brownies. But all orders come with a chocolate covered strawberry which is a nice touch."}
{"text":"As soon as you walk into the door, all of the workers greet you - which is something that should happen more often at other places. The menu there is a lot bigger than I had expected so look at it before you get in line and don't be one of those people who stare at the menu for 20 minutes going \"uhhhh\" while holding up the line!
The set up in there is cafeteria style where you just walk down, tell them what you want while they make it, and pay at the end. The place overall is very clean and pretty organized. I usually get to-go during my lunch break and never have to stay longer than 15 minutes to get my food.
They offer a pretty large variety of soups, salads, and sandwiches so it can be sort of overwhelming. Good thing is that they offer their 2 combo for $8.79 which allows you to pick 2 things of your choice. There's also a dessert area where they have cars, bars, and creme brulee - I have yet to try them so I can't offer any input on those.

I usually go for the 2 Combo and get the  Strawberry Harvest Salad and whatever sandwich I feel like that day. After eating their strawberry harvest, I don't think I'll eat any other type of salad! It contains dried cranberries, chicken breast, candied pecans, sliced apples, fontina cheese, and a little container of their strawberry champagne vinaigrette - it can be a bit sweet so be careful when pouring it onto your salad! 

The calories in the food can add up - so be cautious of that! Even though soups, salads, and sandwiches can seem healthy, there are a lot of hidden sugars and fats depending on what you order. But of course, this place is going to be a better choice than McDonalds!"}
{"text":"Asked them to get me more lemonade and the staff was so friendly and great! Will definitely come here more often! The food was super refreshing!"}
{"text":"Large portions of food for the sanwhiches and soups and salads so the price for the pick 2 is actually a really good deal! I've tried 3 of the sandwiches all very good and taste very fresh, soups are to die for and the salads are tasty as well I recommend the pick 2 if you want salad because the build your own doesn't have many options. Also you get a side of bread and a chocolate covered strawberry as well! Very filling for $9! I'll be back again!"}
{"text":"I got a chance to check this place out the other day as, as for anyone who knows me, I love a good soup and sandwich.

(No, seriously. I LOVE a good soup and sandwich.)

The place is clean, fast, efficient, and modern.  I walked in and out feeling very impressed by how everything looked and was run.  Service was super nice and felt really welcoming.

I had some red pepper/lobster soup, and a crab/avocado (real crab, not \"krab\") sandwich.  Everything tasted really fresh, and for the \"half and half\" combo, the serving made for a very pleasant meal.  They even offer soup samples to get a few for their excellent choices. Everything tasted fresh.  Even the berry salad that the Missus got was really tasty.  There are also a few nice bonuses such as Italian soda syrup for your beverages, and a chocolate covered strawberry as an added part of the meal.

My only advice to this little place is simply: Don't change anything: The service, the quality, and food left me with a happy stomach on the way out, and I will gladly frequent here.  Even the price hovers around $10 a person, so I was happy.

I will have to try the other options on the menu, but for a first time out, this was a great experience. 

Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"I love going to Zupas! It's a perfect place to meet your friends for lunch or if you just need to grab a salad or sandwich when you are on the go. My favorite salad is nuts about berry and I like to add grilled chicken to it! Very healthy place to eat! Try it"}
{"text":"This was a bustling quick business lunch break/soccer-moms-who-lunch kind of place. Good food - I enjoyed my Asian Citrus Chicken Salad, and my daughter's chicken tenders and fruit looked great. They had a nice selection of soft drinks, teas and flavored syrups to personalize the drinks. The staff was friendly, and the service was quick. So, really, for what it was - it was great! I guess it just put off a very \"corporate\" vibe to me. I'd put it in the same category as a Panera Bread. A lunch place I'd be happy to meet friends if they suggest it, but not a place I'd seek on my own."}
{"text":"Ok, so I am officially obsessed with this place. Not only are they cheap, but they give you SO much food! SO MUCH!

They have soup, salad and sandwiches as their staple meals. You can do combos of the three, or just one. Every meal comes with bread and a chocolate covered strawberry. Anyplace that hands out chocolate covered strawberries has my vote.

They have a soda bar, where you can be your own barista and pump different flavors into your soda/tea/water/whatever. They also have a nice selection of hot sauce. 

The veggie sandwich, panini style and toasted, is my favorite. I love their Wild Mushroom Bisque soup- so good! Their Berry Salad is also good, but not as good as the soup.

The Rocky Road Brownie is a bit heavy, but their layered chocolate cake is amazing and surprisingly light.

I love how they have one person for everything. It makes everything go so much faster  and each person can help personalize your plates."}
{"text":"Some of the best healthiest food great tasting food i have had in a long time. I am usually not someone who likes soups and there soups have great flavor and are amazing. And at a very affordable price"}
{"text":"Atmosphere was meh..
Food was meh..
Service was meh..
Prices were meh..

Nothing about Zupas made me happy.. and i get excited easily. I wanted to kill all the Biltmore Business people in there too. With a sword."}
{"text":"This place is insanely great. I paid roughly $9.00 for a combo meal ad was stuffed. The California Turkey sandwich was soooo fresh. The Nuts and Berry salad was fantastic. Then I get a fresh roll and a chocolate covered strawberry? How awesome is that? The sofa bar is great with the flavored syrups. This place is perfect for any meal. I've eaten at the locations in Utah and now this one in Arizona. This is a must stop for a great meal. 5 Stars for sure."}
{"text":"The green girl Haley is a mega sweetie with good eyeliner she serves soup sonic fast. Its also extremely clean in here Mr. Clean magic eraser levels of clean."}
{"text":"What a wonderful staff they have here. Great customer service. Very friendly and energetic. I'm so glad they open this place near me. :))

I always get the vegetarian sandwich. It's perfect and it's delightful. The nuts about berries salad, is phenomenal. Strawberries berries and a hint of cinnamon with nuts. Im obsessed :))"}
{"text":"I used to love this place - but then came the menu change and two of my favorites were removed, never to be eaten again! I have been trying my hardest, but just can't find a new favorite.  I also can't understand why they use a compartmented container for a salad when you get it to go. Terrible planning on that one! I used tell everyone to go to Cafe Zupas, not anymore."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here for the first time about a week ago and we wondered why we haven't tried it any sooner. The store is clean and had ample seating. We normally go to Panera if we're craving soup but we wanted to check this place out since it was nearby. I can ultimately say that this place is way better. They have a bigger variety and bigger portions. It was difficult to choose a soup because they allowed us to sample however many we wanted and they were all very delicious. I settled for the Red pepper and lobster soup and crab avocado sandwich. Both were delicious and came with bread and a chocolate covered strawberry."}
{"text":"OMGoodness! This place is delicious! Friendly staff on my first visit and you get a chocolate covered strawberry to boot!!! Will definitely go here again!!! Soup and salad combo were perfect!"}
{"text":"Love this place!   Honestly so quick, clean, yumma and affordable!!!!!   I get the Chicken Pesto panini and the lobster bisque soup or the chicken barbecue salad.  So refreshing and I don't leave feeling all stuffed and lethargic!!"}
{"text":"Love the food. Killer prices killer selection.  Like they have EVERYTHING!   It's a must try!!!! Good get the Pesto Chicken and Red Lobster soup ..."}
{"text":"Extremely clean, attentive, great selection...my first time here!  Friend wanted to go and suggested before our graveyard cocktail shift!  I'd 100% go again!!!    Great great visit!!!"}
{"text":"My husband just brought me a soup on his lunch break because I am sick... I had him get the Yucatán chicken tortilla soup for me.  He brought home the bag that included the large soup, a side of bread and a chocolate covered strawberry.  The soup did NOT include the avocado, the lime or the tortilla strips!  I called the Chandler location he visited and the employee that answered the phone just said something along the lines of \"oh sorry, its complimentary, they must have forgotten to add it to the bag, it's a busy time right now\" I said \"ok, well it's suppose to come with the soup right?\" And she basically just said \"yeah it's complimentary\" - but is it really complimentary if it's listed as ingredients of the soup and pictured on the menu????  Is it complimentary if you pay for the soup and it's suppose to come with it?  She offered that I come back to the restaurant to pick up my \"complimentary\" items, but I am sick, which is why I didn't go get it myself in the first place!  I told her I was expecting some kind of gesture more than just an \"I'm sorry\" and she said \"oh I'm sorry\"  I have never had worse customer service for a screwed up take out order.  I will be going to Panera from here out.  The most mind boggling part is how they forgot the ingredients for the soup but managed to remember a side of bread and a chocolate covered strawberry.  And \"it was busy, they forgot\" isn't exactly any excuse or gesture of remorse if you ask me!  I basically didn't get what we PAID for, items are not complimentary if they are included in the menu description and photo of the menu item!!"}
{"text":"Went for the first time today. Was pleasantly surprised with how delicious the tomato basil soup was. Also had the honey turkey panini. It was good too. Will be going back to try the salads."}
{"text":"Food tasted really good. Three stars are for a few things. Their portion size is extremely small! Their turkey bacon sandwich has three very thin slices of turkey and their bacon had a lot of the fat on it. They charge for the fix ins. Although it's posted in a couple places, being a first timer I was very occupied on how to order. The girl who served us the soup did not mention the extra charge so it was a surprise for me. I feel that if it's pictured on the menu then it should be included into the price. Their customer service was okay, does need work.  They also do not have the ingredient list for me to know if it's actually fresh as advertised. If they increase their portion sizes, I would come back. I'm a pretty slim guy and need to at least feel full when I leave. Also no kids cup for the kids. I would consider the three star generous especially because of the portion size."}
{"text":"Second time here and it's pretty good. Tried the Pesto Chicken Sandwich and Mushroom Bisque soup. 

The sandwich was pretty good. The soups was good as well, however a little watery. 

The workers are extremely friendly and nice. 

A little pricey but overall good"}
{"text":"Great customer service. Everyone was very friendly & helpful. The blueberry/maple salad was awesome. Hubby said his Italian sub was one of the best he's ever had. Loved the chocolate strawberries. I felt the price was very reasonable. Also liked the flavor bar; add some peach flavor to your iced tea or vanilla to root beer. And note: they are open weekends despite what the hours state on Yelp."}
{"text":"We've been here twice and love the concept and the options.  The strawberry chicken salad was fresh and I love the lobster bisque as well.  The sandwiches are just okay to me but then again, I'm not much of a bread person.  The free chocolate covered strawberry is a nice touch with each meal.  My only wish is that they could do half a sandwich, soup, salad combo.  Otherwise the combos consist of two items: a full sandwich, soup, or salad."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff, very cheery. Having a superfood delight salad, lobster soup and veggie sandwich. Sandwich is good, but too much bread-white bread. The bread to filling ratio is not good. Like four times as much bread as filling. 

Soup delicious, really delicious. Won't order again for a while though, too rich. Delicious though. Salad excellent, a little less dressing would be better though, maybe ask for on side next time. Got half soup, half salad. Wasn't given option of half sandwich-which would be GREAT.  AND got two pieces of bread with my order. Didn't need them. Also got two chocolate covered strawberries. Love them. 

Would love this place more if they offered wheat bread and less bread. Fountain drinks look interesting with flavor  pumps.  Dessert looks GREAT. Didn't order either though.

Good to really good.  Staff almost too cheery. Charging stations, but I didn't bring in any cords. Next time.  Probably no sandwich."}
{"text":"A second location has finally come to Henderson. That's great news! Perhaps now we will not have to worry about the packed house and monstrous lines. NOT!

Came here two weeks ago with a friend and the place was packed. Lines almost outside the door. And the sitting area was almost full. There are signs here just as they are at the Eastern location that state you will never have to hold a table, seats are always available.

Well, after we ordered our food and headed to take a seat. Guess what? No seats available. Shocker. Grant it, this has never happened at the Eastern location but I always wondered if it did occasionally happen. And yes, it does. Luckily a group of four ladies were kind enough to give us there table as they had already finished eating and were just sitting down having a chat afterwards.

The food was spot on from the Eastern location. This has to be the best gourmet sandwich shop in town now. Totally has me hooked and here more so than Panera Bread. Just be forewarned that seating here is darn near impossible and the layout is a little weird. There's a wall that houses the fountain drink area and a small squeeze through spot to a sitting area there that if you're not careful, you'll run into someone trying to make your way over to grab your soda before you sit. I wonder how many accidents have happened because of this?"}
{"text":"We were looking at the menu and a girl came and offered us menus...why would we need another menu if we are already reading it? I had to tell my order to four different people then they made it seem like I had to stand up at the front and wait for my food. The sandwich was decent, but nothing special. I just found myself thinking I should have gone to Jason's Deli instead."}
{"text":"Being from the east coast Zupas reminds me a lot of Sweetgreens but so much better! In addition to the beautiful salads, they also offer a wide variety of soups and paninis. My friend had the nuts and berry salad, full of ripe and juicy berries of all kinds. I had the pulled pork panini that was great also. Each meal comes with a chocolate covered strawberry. Service was great also. 
I was so hungry- forgot to take a pic"}
{"text":"My buddy at work was telling me about this place.  He said they had some decent sandwiches and some good soups and salads.  I looked up their menu and their Honey Cilantro Carnitas sandwich sounded awesome.  I decided to stop by to get one.  This is where it went awry.  I walked in and ordered said sandwich.  The guy told me that they were out of all pork.  Whack!   I had to change my choice on the fly and decided to go with a Turkey, Bacon, Avocado sandwich.  Total was just under $6.00.  Not bad.

The sandwich itself was alright.  They put it in a press and get it nice and toasty/melty.  The turkey and bread seemed a bit skimp.  There was a decent amount of avocado and the honey mustard spread was tasty enough.  It was an ok sandwich for being something I had no intention of ordering when I walked in.

This place could have potential.  It was late when I came in so its understandable they may be out of some stuff.  Ill be back sometime in the future to try out their soups and salads (probably when my wife gets out here because this place is right up her alley).  They give you a chocolate covered strawberry for dessert with your sandwich.  Nice little touch.  3 stars for now and a possibility for more.  Service was friendly enough.  I was just a bit bummed I couldn't get what I originally came for."}
{"text":"I'd give this place a 5 but the customer service was ehh. I came during the lunch rush and you could tell the staff was a bit overwhelmed. 
The salads are so good! I'm really thinking they are laced with crack because they are so addicting. I only wish the large salad was a large salad. The large salad in my option is small. And when you ask for extra chicken which you have to pay extra for you get an extra 3 pieces  
The place is very clean and has lots of seating.
Plus you get a chocolate covered strawberry, which is my favorite part of the meal."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! I'm so happy now they are close to my apartment on Rainbow. I used to drive before to Henderson only to have one of their soups. Love it"}
{"text":"I never knew about this place until a friend of mine mentioned it. So, I checked this place out with another friend for the first time and it turned out to be awesome! I love Cafe Zupas! 

I ordered the Honey Bacon Club + Roasted Red Pepper and Lobster soup which was d'lish! My friend ordered Turkey Spinach Artichoke + Wild Mushroom Bisque which was also pretty good. I like how soft and fresh the sandwiches are and how the food came with a strawberry coated chocolate. :) 

Of course, I came back a second time a few days later with my family and tried the Honey Cilantro Carnitas Sandwich. It was sweet and loaded with so much stuff but I loved it!"}
{"text":"The food tastes great and I used to come here all the time. But recently they started skimping on the dishes and my last visit was frustrating. I asked for no cheese on my salad, twice, and they still put cheese. The original cashier apparently charged me wrong on my order, so a different cashier charged me more. Their menu is ridiculously expensive for how hesitant they are to fill the to-go containers. This will be my last visit."}
{"text":"Tried this place today for the first time. Had a soup/salad combo. I had the Wisconsin Cauliflower soup and the Shanghai chicken salad. My son had the Milano panini. I was also able to taste the mushroom soup and I plan to get that next time. Food was good. It was a bit disorganized. The guy behind the counter asked me three or more times what I was having and was it for there or to go. They have no way of writing anything down. It's all verbal. And I didn't get my free chocolate covered strawberry :-("}
{"text":"The four stars is based on my food today.  I would give it 2.5 for ambiance.

Cafe Zupa is very close to my work, and I have been meaning to check it out.  
When you walk up to the doors you can hear the music blaring out on the patio.  Never really been a fan of loud music for lunch places, or any other for that matter.

I entered and there is a counter where you are greeted.  They have paper menus available, and I like that.  I had the vegetarian sandwich and the lobster bisque.  I really like that they let you try a little bit of soup if you would like a sample.  I tried the tomato basil and the lobster bisque.  I ended up with the bisque, but wished I chose the tomato.  The bisque was good, but I think the tomato would have agreed with me more.  

The vegetarian sandwich was excellent!  The bread was soft, loved the flavor of the pesto sauce.  Overall very nice.  

I also ordered some marshmallow chocolate bar thing for dessert.  It was good, not sure I would get again, but good.

Overall service was friendly, although when I approached the counter after my meal for a bag to put my leftovers in, the girl said, \"A bag.......??\"  Like I was asking for something so completely foreign to her, and as if I was really bothering her.  Oh teen, twenty something counter help.....sigh.  Sorry to bother you while you are standing at the register.  How dare I ask for a bag!

The downside:
It was very loud in there.  I need a place to relax on my lunch break, and the music was blaring.  The lights in there are like floodlights.  Depending where you sit, you might have a spotlight in your face.

I enjoyed the sandwich and the sample of tomato basil enough to return.  I would like to try a salad next time!  Bring earplugs! ;-)"}
{"text":"Such a good experience! I went on a late Friday night maybe 30 minutes before closing to eat there, but this did not change how they acted towards me. All the employees we SO sweet and friendly from the minute I got there to the minute I left. And though it was late, the food still tasted so fresh! Great experience for me!"}
{"text":"We were in the vicinity with a couple hours to kill. The husband was in a sandwich mood, while I was in the please do not drive any more further mood, which made Cafe Zupas our lunch spot. I've been wanting to come here for all the years we've had to pass it on a weekly basis. We entered and there was no line, hallelujuer. We took the time to stare at the menu, but didn't take too much time as we quickly knew were going to have their pick 2 combo. You choose 2 between their salads, sandwiches, and soups. We both opted for soup and a sandwich. 

I got the vegetarian sandwich when I really meant to order their chicken pesto, but I was torn and by the time i ordered...vegetarian sandwich just vomited out my mouth. Doh! I wasn't bummed or anything because the sandwich itself was as good as a sandwich with cucumbers, tomatoes, sprouts, greens, red peppers, muenster cheese, with red pepper hummus smeared inside could possibly be. No sarcasm, seriously. 

Lover man got the Cuban grilled pork panini. He took a bite and pointed at it as he chewed, nodded his head with the hell yeah that's good in silent film tone. I wouldn't know because I declined his offer to try. He couldn't finish the other half to his sandwich, so when the kids got home...they were fighting over it. Apparently it was pretty good. 

Nevermind the touchscreen charging station, or the spacious and clean dining area, rolling and working highchairs, extremely friendly and helpful staff, touchscreen coca cola drink machine thingy, the free chocolate covered strawberry you get with each meal and bread...but that cauliflower soup was my yumgasm of the day!

They ask if you want bacon and/or cheese topped onto your soup...i skip the bacon and opted for the cheese. The heat of the soup melted that cheese into a gooey compliment. Sure there were a time or two the cheese kinda got caught.up on my chin, snagged on my tonsils...but hey...nothing I couldn't handle. Lol. But, it was so good! I literally have tried recreating it at home two times since last week. If you don't find cauliflower purposeful so you don't bother consuming it...cauliflower has lots of vitamins in it so while the soup isn't the healthiest form to consume it, CONSUME IT! Dip that free bread all up in it is you want. I didnt, but if I didn't all ready have a sandwich I wouldve. The husband ordered their clam chowder. He didn't say anything. Probably because after tasting my soup it shut his clam chowder down. Lol.

I love that everything is house-made, and locally or sourced nearby. It really makes a difference. 8.99 for the pick2. You can easily spend the same.or less and get a plate lunch/dinner...so it really is up to you and your mood as to how you want to spend your 9 bucks. For the hubs and I, Cafe Zupas was just what we were in the mood for and it satisfied us. We had a great experience. Hopefully, it doesn't go downhill as we will certainly be returning.

Definitely kid and stroller friendly!

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"First time being here and it was great! Employees were helpful, food was amazing, and restaurant was very clean! Will be coming here again when I am in town!"}
{"text":"The manager sean is too dope!! He's in the red shirt and his mustache is cool my dudes."}
{"text":"I have never been a \"salad\" girl....you know the one that just LOVES salads. But in the last year, I have found myself wanting a lighter lunch with healthier options.  Lots of places claim to be healthy but they really aren't....(if your side dishes are chips and a cookie that isnt better than a side of french fries)

I have recently discovered this place and I have fallen in love. Lots of salads and soups and probably the best grilled cheese I have ever had. Today I had the strawberry chicken salad with cauliflower soup.  The salads are fresh and flavorful. The soups are the best I have ever had.  Overall, its a good option for those who need something other than the burger/fries or taco lunch!"}
{"text":"We have been dining at Zupas a good 3-4 times a week especially since it's so close now with the new location on rainbow . Quality of the food is excellent , however , the staff is not at all on the same page and could use some serious training ! The toppings for the salads which are supposed to be measured can vary quite a bit depending on who is serving you . Sometimes , you have to buy 2 extra of a topping just to get a normal amount ! Last week , I picked up to go . They were slow . 4 people working on 2 salads is probably NOT necessary ! They had me so confused . I come home to realize That my husbands salad is also drenched in vinegar like I had asked for on mine along with his side of ranch . We have 4 kids , I couldn't run back to have it redone so there goes an over $8 salad in the trash ! The next night , I let the manager know what had happened and didn't even get an apology ! Tonight , prob made me the most mad , the portions vary so much that just to get 1 serving of chicken my husband had to request 3 . A large salad has 7 toppings , so he had 1 left then paid for 2 additional . The girl decided she would  charge him for 2 additional proteins instead of regular toppings which are $1 more each one then regular . This place needs a game plan! If you want to ration out toppings maybe you need a real scooper or serving size instead of a tiny Spoon whose portions vary by the person dishing them out !"}
{"text":"This is a great value for the money.  My boyfriend and I go here probably three or four times a month.  They have great low carb choices if you stick with soups or salads (some require a little modification, though), but they are very accommodating with that.  If you're not low carbing, then you can enjoy their absolutely wonderful bread and the chocolate-covered strawberry that comes with each meal.  I also really like their unsweetened tropical iced tea (but wished they carried Sweet N' Low and not just Splenda).

I typically get one of their chicken salads or a piping hot bowl of soup.  I really enjoyed their cauliflower cheddar soup.  It was hearty and delicious.  I also like their BBQ chicken salad."}
{"text":"Sweet, sweet salads! Borderline overly sugar so read before you order. They're super tasty but be mindful of the toppings if you're trying to avoid sugar overload. I didn't realize the strawberries would be marinated in sugar syrup for instance until after I ordered.

That aside they have very tasty salad combinations and a seasonal style menu. The soups rotate as well. The line can be long but moves quickly and you can customize your dish. 

Their desserts looked incredible- holy moly those brownies would make anyone ditch a diet! So decadent. 
The bonus chocolate covered strawberry is charming and a very sweet touch to a meal. 

I'd definitely eat here again for lunch. Fast, easy, affordable- perfect for a quick work on the go lunch. And the menu changes so you won't get bored."}
{"text":"Cafe Zupas or Zupas as us Utahans call it, has been a favorite lunch spot of mine for years. I didn't even know there were any in Vegas until a few months ago. Neither of the locations here are close to my home, however I still manage to drop in whenever I'm in the area.

The set up here is easy once you get a feel for the menu. I always do a 'you pick two' combo. I like to do soup and salad, while the bf always orders soup and sandwiches. The ordering process is quick, with plenty of staff to move your order down the line. The staff here is friendly and always has a smile.

My favorite soups are the Tomato Basil, Wild Mushroom Bisque and the Yucatan Chicken Tortilla. I can never decide which one so I always ask for tastings (as if I didn't know what they tasted like...). For Salads I almost always get the Nuts About Berries which I think is called their Chicken Summer Salad at times as well. But I occasionally venture out of the norm and I have to say I've never had a salad here I didn't like.

As for the sandwiches, I often think they are lacking a bit of filling. I love paninis but theirs seem to be a little lacking on the meat. The Honey Bacon Club is probably my favorite.

Each order of soup comes with slice of french bread, and every order comes with a chocolate strawberry. YAY! I've yet to try any of their desserts, but I have to say they always look amazing, so I'm tempted every single time. It's the dang chocolate covered strawberry that plays to my sense of reason and talks me out of it.

The atmosphere at this and all the locations I've visited is just so so. It can often be loud during lunch hour. I like to take my food to go and they actually don't skimp you on the portion sizes when you do. This is a place I'll continue to crave and would frequent if it were close to home."}
{"text":"I've been here numerous times since they first opened and I've started noticing a recent trend. The quantity of ingredients they put in their salads is even less than usual. I understand that places like this usually skimp on \"premium\" ingredients, but this last time was particularly egregious. I ordered a Maui tropical chicken salad and I ended up receiving a lot of lettuce, a couple pieces of chicken, and a few other items that were lost in the greenery. 

I asked the employee who was preparing my salad why she dumped all the chicken that she had scooped up back into the container and if I could have a little more rather than the few measly pieces I was given. Her reply was that we level out each scoop and it would be an extra charge. It was clearly below level and all the other ingredients that were put in the salad were below level as well. For example, four tiny pieces of pineapple were put in my salad to give it that \"tropical\" flavor. I mentioned that to the employee and she told me that there was nothing she could do about it. It was just unbelievably petty on their part. 

I wish I would've taken a picture, but I was in a rush. Under normal circumstances, I would've politely declined the salad and quietly left. My hunger, however, got the best of me. 

The service is still quick, but you get what you pay (over-pay?) for.  This was probably the last time I eat at Cafe Zupas. I can just make my own salads. I can't recommend this place either."}
{"text":"I came upon Cafe Zupas when I was searching for a healthy place to eat. I can't believe I didn't know about this place earlier. They offer a great variety of salads, soups and sandwiches. Order in large or half orders OR try their 2 combo for only $8.79 and pick any two of your choice. The meal also comes with a side of bread and a chocolate covered strawberry. The portion is just enough to fill you up. Don't be shy to ask for extra or other ingredients (for a little extra cost of course). The process is like a cafeteria style where you order what you like and as you go down the line, you can add soup and there's also a sweets/dessert case with assorted creme brulee, cakes and bars. There are a plenty of staff so you get super quick service and wait time is never a problem. I always get to-go during lunch time and I'm never there longer than 5 minutes. Everyone is super friendly and patient to help you with any questions. All their ingredients are fresh and everything is made from scratch each day. Their cleanliness is also a plus. 

I'm addicted to their Strawberry Harvest Salad! I've never been a salad girl but after trying this, I'm HOOKED. It's more of a sweet salad though which I don't mind. It has sliced chicken breast, strawberries, dried cranberries, sliced apples, pecans, and fontina cheese along with their unique Strawberry Champagne Vinaigrette. Everything complements each other so well it's amazing how great a salad can taste. I like to add oranges to it as well. I have to eat this at least once a week on my lunch break. I always tell myself to try something new on the menu but I can't seem to drift away from my Strawberry Harvest!"}
{"text":"Food is generally pretty good but this location have gone down.   We came for the kale salad and was told they are out of kale.  Messed up our order and we had to wait for a missing combo and made sure that they rang up a separate order. Protein bowl was very good."}
{"text":"Restaurant looked like it had been hit by a football team.   Out of tea.  Out of the pomegranate tea.  It of lemonade.    Ran out of quinoa while I was in line and they shorted me.    Confusing ordering along the line.   A lot of people touch your food before it gets to the cash register.    I will say however that it tasted good.  Bummer no tea!"}
{"text":"Ight my g, where do I start. You ever woke up Christmas morning expecting that new bike you asked for, and usually you get what you ask for, but instead you get the fisher price ? Cuz that's how tf I felt when I visited this zupas. I used to LOVE zupas. Cause zupas was smart, zupas was kind, zupas was important. 
The zupas on eastern !!!! Boy now that's food and service, the eastern zupas makes me feel like a king on a thrown getting fed grapes while being fanned with leaves by the kardashians. 

BUT THIS ZUPAS HERE THIS ZUPAS RIGHT HERE ON SUNSET. Makes me feel like I just lost everything, got foreclosed on, and am eating scraps out a bin."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I decided to give this place a try. We were a little skeptical at first; however, this place was amazing. I highly recommend the BBQ Pulled Pork sandwich...yummy!"}
{"text":"The food was OK tasting, too much dairy and too sweet. The biggest caveat was that everyone felt bloated after eating it. Will never go there again, better opening a can of soup and having a homemade salad.
I did like the Italian soda shots to customize your drink."}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  Finally, I have found a place in veg as that serves some delicious soup and salad with fresh fish.  This is a muat go-to place once per week for lunch."}
{"text":"Great great great sandwiches, soups and salads! I can eat yummy food without mega calories because even their vegetarian sandwich with the veggie soup is wonderful. They also give a slice of Italian bread and a chocolate covered strawberry with each meal. Me and my mother in law had soup and salad and drinks and it was about $25. I love the food here."}
{"text":"Fresh Fresh Fresh Food!!! This stuff is AWESOME! The concept is original and clean! Food is delicious- because it's so fresh!! Great menu - the Pick Two option is the way to go!!"}
{"text":"I have been to Cafe Zupas for lunch twice and have enjoyed both experiences - one was take out and one was dine-in.  For me, the soup and the salads are the highlights.  I have had the lobster bisque and the red pepper lobster soup, I would happily recommend either.  I also ordered the Cobb salad which was very fresh and tasty.  Lastly, I have had the crab and avocado sandwich and it wasn't my favorite but it was fine (I would not order it again though). 

Highlights:  Soup, super fresh ingredients, everything is home-made, excellent teas/lemonade (near the fountain drinks), bright & clean, fast, flavorful, friendly service AND they give you a chocolate covered strawberry with your order (YUM!). 

All in all, I would absolutely recommend Safe Zupas and I will be back!"}
{"text":"Found this great sandwich place 
Tried the cauliflower soup and vegetarian sandwich was all fresh and delicious, they even gave us strawberry dipped chocolate as a treat 
Service was quick and friendly"}
{"text":"I highly recommend this place for the salads and sandwiches.  However our group ordered three different soups and each one was inedible due to the sodium content."}
{"text":"The sandwiches here are kinda small, but for the price you can't really complain. We tried four sandwiches and the Cuban was the best. Had the most meat and the pork was really tender. If you stick with the sandwiches you can have a small cheap lunch. But if you get the soups and salads, it can add up with all the add ons that they charge 65 cents each.

I liked the Cuban so much I went and ordered more sandwiches to go for later. They screwed up my order, and gave away one of my sandwiches. They gave me a dessert for the trouble. A Million Pound bar or something like that. If you eat the whole thing in one sitting you will gain a million pounds. It's very rich. Gf liked it but it took her almost a week to finish it. Coconut, chocolate chips, peanut butter on some kind of brownie or graham cracker base. The free chocolate covered strawberry was enough for me."}
{"text":"We stumbled across this place when we walked out of Mimi's cafe because we weren't willing to pay $9.29 for a HALF of a sandwich.  Luckily Zuppas came to the rescue!!! Instead we paid $8.99 for a whole sandwich, generously sized \"half\" cup of soup that filed my bowl,  a roll and a chocolate covered strawberry!! And it was delicious!!! We will be regulars here!"}
{"text":"This wss my first visit to this place and didn't know what to expect.  

The pressure was on trying to figure out what I wanted as I'm standing in the fast moving line.  The menu offered several options for sandwiches, salads and soups.  The sandwiches, to me, had many ingredients that did not appeal to me, so I edited the grill cheese sandwich.  I thought I'd also try the clam chowder...big mistake....who puts green bell peppers in NE clam chowder?  Zupas...thats who.  I spent a lot of time trying fish that crap out.  My wife ordered the make your own salad where apparently you can choose 5 or 7 toppings (wasn't sure because I was confused).  Also, bacon counts as two toppings, which they didn't advise until after it was on the salad...made it difficult if you wanted to change your mind.

Overall, the staff was friendly and mostly helpful.  Besides the clam chowder, the food was ok...nothing great.  It seemed to me that there were too many tables which made moving around more difficult.  I likely will not return if I had a choice."}
{"text":"C and I stopped in here because his school was doing a charity fundraiser. We had never been to a Cafe Zuppas before so we were both newbies. I have to point out that this location is not in the best spot if you're trying to find parking. It can be hard to find a spot depending on time of day/night. If you're gutsy, you can always park across the \"ring\" at the end of the parking rows for the mall. Good luck darting across the 4 lanes of mall traffic but... C & I were lucky enough to find some parking. Probably because it was raining which kept the crowds down.
After we entered C went to find a table. Aside from the fact that it was a fundraiser night there were quite a few tables that needed to be cleaned. I personally saw plenty of employees available but it was more like a meeting of high schoolers, standing around giggling, pointing at each other, etc... strange behavior at a restaurant. Regardless, C grabbed the only clean table he could find. At least he found one.
I stepped up to the young lady taking orders and told her I had never been here before. I got this look like, \"so\", what do you want me to do. I think she was related to the girl who worked at Kneaders who gave me the same deer in headlights stare. Now, while I was waiting to get up to the counter, I had a chance to check out the menu. There were a lot of things that sounded quite yummy. A great selection of sandwiches, salads and soups. It was still a bit warm outside for soup so that didn't interest me. What did interest me was the Honey Cilantro Carnitas sandwich. Anytime I see pork on a menu, I immediately gravitate towards it. And Carnitas is one of my favorite foods. Yum. But before I ordered I noticed they have a great deal. For $8.79 you can have a whole sandwich and half soup or salad. The half salad alone costs $5.59 so you're getting a full sandwich for a little over 3 bones. Wow. I'm immediately suspicious when a deal seems to good to be true but there was a salad that sounded super good as well so I decided to go for the Combo. I stepped up and ordered the \"Try Two Combo\" with the Honey Cilantro Carnitas sandwich and the Cherry Balsamic Chicken salad. \"We're out of Pork\". That's what the girl tells me. They can't do anything on the menu that has pork in it because they don't have any pork. Aaaaaaargghhhhhhhh. Seriously? No pulled pork, no Cuban? What else is there? Some dumb chicken sandwich. (I'm kidding here, I love Chicken but I was bummmmed) I ordered the Combo with the Vegetarian sandwich (just to spite them, kidding) and the Cherry Balsamic Chicken salad for me. The sandwich was a bit wimpy. Just another place that kind of jips you on a vegetarian sandwich. It should be loaded with sprouts, cucumbers, tomatoes & lettuce. And then add in the roasted red peppers and Muenster cheese. But instead it's a sad portion of veggies on bread that was overall a bit disappointing. I reminded myself, however, that the sandwich only cost a bit over 3 bucks. So ok, for that price, it's an ok sandwich. Now, the salad was AMAZING. Next time I will just order a full size of this salad. Field Greens, chunked Chicken, Grapes, Goat Cheese, Anjou Pears, Almonds, & Dried Bing Cherries with Cherry Balsamic Vinaigrette on the side. Oh my gosh was it a good salad. Loved it. The greens were fresh, everything added to it was fresh and the dressing was very tasty. Not too sweet which I was glad to discover. Winner winner Cherry Balsamic Chicken salad dinner.
I ordered C the Kids meal combo ($3.99). He got to choose two of four items. He picked the Grilled Cheese sandwich and fruit cup. This is THE DEAL when it comes to kid's meal. For a penny shy of 4 bucks he got a great sandwich, a nice cup of mandarin orange slices, a drink and a chocolate dipped strawberry. Lets just say C was a happy camper.
Messy Dining room, Out of Pork (sin), average at best vegetarian sandwich, Amazing salad, fair prices, sketchy staff, lousy parking. 2.5 Stars."}
{"text":"I have to say Café Zupas probably has one of my favorite meals (a turkey, bacon, avocado sandwich and chicken enchilada chili), but their assembly line sucks. I request no bacon on my sandwich and add pesto and literally every time I go to this location they mess up the sandwich. I really love the food, but it gets old having a messed up sandwich every time. Not to mention when you reach the cash register to pay and every customers food is all piled together and you have to decipher whose is whose."}
{"text":"So it isn't my first time here but it is my first time checking in. I have decided that I'm going to try all the sandwiches on the menu and write a review so today I ordered the crab avocado club and the lobster bisque. I'm not gonna lie the lobster bisque I have everytime it is so good and creamy It's my favorite. I have sampled others but I will drive there just to get the lobster bisque. So on to the sammich it's a house made New England crab salad , avocado, bacon , celery , red onion, tomatoes and muenster cheese. And it is delicious ! The tomato gives it a fresh taste Must try if you love seafood like me :)"}
{"text":"First time here the turkey bacon panini was delicious so was the lobster bisque. I would like to come back and try the creme brûlée cheesecake and salads. Place looks pretty neat inside and it has a phone charging area."}
{"text":"I was here for the first time for lunch. The atmosphere is nice and I could see myself eating soup and getting some work done as well. The staff is so friendly and welcoming. I had the combo and ordered the Cauliflower soup and the Kale and Quinoa salad. Everything was fresh and the service was quick. I really like that you can sample the soup before you order.
Although I did not try their desserts, they looked amazing and next time I will definitely try one! With the lunch combo, you get a piece of fresh bread and a chocolate covered strawberry."}
{"text":"I love this place!  I have been there several times already.  The first time I came in there was a long line and I thought it would take awhile but they get you through in record speed.  The food is delicious.  My favorite items are the Wild Mushroom bisque soup and the Nuts About Berries salad.   The one thing that makes the experience over the top for me is how friendly the service is.  The workers have so much enthusiasm about the food and always have a huge smile on their face.  I get friendly service many other places but this is exceptionally friendly.

Can't say enough good things about the place."}
{"text":"Soup, salad and sandwiches sounded like a nice healthy meal option...their chicken breast is processed, ordered a build your own salad, was nothing special. Also ordered the chicken tortilla soup, it was terrible. you could only taste salt. My husband ordered a sandwich with no mayo and they put sort of mayo sauce on it. As a soup and salad lover, I was really hoping to like this place but we won't be returning."}
{"text":"Having moved from Utah, where we first found this place, I was very sad to think we'd never be back to it. We were thrilled when one opened up so close to us. And we were not disappointed with the quality. 

I usually get a combo with soup and sandwich, though I've recently switched to getting just a regular soup. I never finish the whole sandwich and it feels like a waste to leave half of it there. 
My husband's favorite sandwich is gone now, replaced by a similar-but-not-the-same option.  Not bad though. 
My favorite soup by far is the chicken enchilada chili, but I've liked every other one I've tried as well. My parents also love the place. 
The chocolate covered strawberries are a wonderful touch. I've gotten two desserts so far and they were pretty good. Love the beverage options with the syrups - sprite with cherry and blackberry is my favorite. 
I do wish the bread given with the soups seemed a little more fresh though."}
{"text":"I love Zupas and have been a loyal customer for almost 2 years. I was so excited when this location opened because it's so close to my house but the service here is always mediocre. Employees there haven't been trained properly when it comes to things like how much dressing to put on a salad, or even just knowing the menu. They will literally argue with you about something even though there's a huge menu above their head that proves them wrong. Then they say you can't add pesto, just substitute pesto....hmmm?? Well what if I want avocado spread and presto? Well the manager told me that he would sub my Avacado spread for pesto then add avocado spread for 1.99.
People, I'm not even joking  I literally laughed out loud and just told him do whatever you want as long as I have Ava spread and pesto lol. I love Zupas and always will but I wish this 1 was better. 
Food gets 5 stars
Customer service gets 2 stars"}
{"text":"The fact that any one would give Zupas less than 5 stars is ridiculous . The food here is just delightful. I always get the strawberry harvest salad along with the honey Carnitas sandwich on wheat bread. The salad is refreshing zesty the house my dressing is phenomenal fresh cut strawberries seasoned candy pecans. The sandwich tender the banks juicy pack for flavors it is a must-have sandwich."}
{"text":"Bomb.com we got the you pick two chowder and panini combo while I got the strawberry salad and it was delicious and under twenty bucks!! We will be back!!!!"}
{"text":"Omg....lots of high quality food...good price,  clean facility...half soup and half salad comes with bread, chocolate dipped strawberry...unlimited lemon and lime and butter at the self serve drink dispenser.   The bread wasn't fresh and they couldn't microzap it for Mr, but when I dipped it in my lobster red pepper soup, it was delicious....2choices of lobster soup...7 soups in all and they encourage taking tastes.....this is a chain but it is excellent, all around.....yummy."}
{"text":"love the strawberry and chicken salad with the roasted red pepper soup! the roll and chocolate covered strawberry was a delight! no complaints, much much love so far. can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"I don't usually write reviews but this one I needed to share. Excellent Fresh salads, sandwiches and soups, I could eat there everyday! They are friendly and super quick. You also get a chocolate dipped strawberry with your meal...a nice treat!"}
{"text":"Food and service used to be great! Food changed and just isn't the same quality. Service I mean it's essentially a buffet line but if I ask for no tomatoes and would like extra cheese, even asking how much the cheese was, knowing it would be an extra charge. $.69 for not even a quarter of a small ramekin of cheese kinda ridiculous. The lobster bisque is a good example of high expectation low quality. I will stick to Panera from now on at least it's consistently good not just mediocre sometimes."}
{"text":"Love Cafe Zupas! My sister got me hooked, their salads are so yummy! I always recommend we go there for our lunches with our office."}
{"text":"Good food. My problem with this place is that you have to repeat your order at least three times as you go down the line. Very frustrating!  Management needs to address this and have their team members communicate more effectively with each other. The flow just doesn't seem to be working effectively.

Also, a bit pricey. Not much bang for your buck!"}
{"text":"Just discovered this place the other day and I LOVED IT. I was craving a salad and this place delivered a yummy one. I got half a salad and half a soup and it came with a yummy strawberry in chocolate. Everything was fresh and plenty of options to choose from. I will be back soon :)"}
{"text":"roasted red peper & lobster soup very rich an creamy it is Delicious, perfect for today's weather. friendly staff as well"}
{"text":"Soups and sandwiches are a simple, satisfying combo. When I spotted this place in the Camelback Colonnade, I had no idea what type of restaurant it was. Since I was starving and wanted something healthier than the pizza my boyfriend kept suggesting (NYPD is always tempting).  I figured anything with the word \"Cafe\" in the title might have something nutritious? 

Upon walking in this brightly lit restaurant, I could tell it was a chain..but I don't mean that in a bad way. Like the other reviewers, it reminded me of Paradise Bakery. They have a standard list of sandwiches and many soups to choose from and everything comes with a chocolate dipped strawberry. 

The staff is super friendly and helpful, no complaints there. 

I ordered the Vegetarian Sandwich and attempted to order the Cauliflower soup. Sadly, they were just about out of the soup I wanted, so I opted for mushroom instead. What I liked is the numerous amount of soups that are vegetarian friendly. (Comparatively speaking, Paradise's super delicious tomato soup isn't? Imagine my disappointment finding out that.) Anywho!  Boyfriend ordered the Asian BBQ pork and tomato basil soup. Both of our meals came out quickly and were super delicious. The vegetarian sandwich is a pretty easy peasy sandwich, tough to screw up unless you're using gross veggies. 
Side note? The soda fountain is pretty cool. While I rarely drink soda, I definitely enjoy a coke here & there. They have the option of adding Italian syrups to your soda! Instant \"Italian soda\", if you want to call it that..they did. I don't know if I really agree. 

 The only \"meh\" part of the meal was the chocolate dipped strawberry. I didn't find it all that impressive-the chocolate had a weird flavor. It was free there, so I can't knock them too much."}
{"text":"Another fabulous lunch! Count on zupas for the freshest meal with superb customer service!"}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite places to go when my family and I crave soups and sandwiches. The variety of soups and salads, sandwiches is great. They just have to not continue to raise their prices."}
{"text":"YO, this is not your typical sneeze guard assembly line sandwich shop.  They use fresh locally sourced produce and dairy to make their sandwiches, salads, and soups.  No soup from a frozen block here or lettuce from a bag and you can tell the difference.  I appreciate when a chain sources locally, that's hard to come by.   

This is one of my favorite fast-casual spots, they are based out of my hometown in Utah so I got my first taste of it there.   I stopped in for a quick and \"light\" lunch today but ended up with more food that I bargained for, and for a bargain at $11 for a half portion of their California Cobb and a half portion of the Wild Mushroom soup, and a drink.  They give you a small chunk of french bread and chocolate covered strawberry as well.  My light lunch was a not so light because I ate it all and left full.   They were hopping and the service was quick, efficient, and pleasant and I had my food and was out the door in under 30, so at least I got the quick part of the lunch right.    

Another unique feature is their assortment of hot sauces and drink flavoring.  I skipped the hot sauce today but totally got my sugar fix on a big cherry flavored ginger-ale, and topped it off before I left.  Their desserts also looked de-li-cious, but I passed today..   Give it a try, happy Yelping!"}
{"text":"Iv had alot of great experiences here in the past but recently they updated their menu and made some other changes which made my last two visits here less than pleasurable. They got rid of my favorite sandwich the Italian and also removed the amazing garden chowder. Why? I have no clue but ok. I can deal with a menu change but also the service changed. Maybe due to so many new people there. My last two visits here took about 20min compared to the usual 4-5min because the new sandwich makers just forgot to make one of my sandwiches. Both times. 
  I hope they aren't going to run like this forever because I usually really enjoy everything here but have been recently disappointed due to management making too many changes at once with poor integration."}
{"text":"I can't figure out what this place is trying to be. The name makes me think Greek, but the menu is all over the place. 

The setup is much like a Panera or Paradise Bakery. You can do salad and soup, soup and a sandwich.... yada yada yada. The upside is that because you can see everything, you can order exactly what you want. I might start doing that from now on. I've had several salads here and have been disappointed every time. 

I like that you can hang out in here. They have wifi and plugins and all that good stuff. It's so bright though! Like so bright! All the menus on the wall are illuminated and they have this obnoxious blue lighting all over the place. You could probably see this place from space. Because of all the lighting, it's not very inviting or comfortable. 

I'll go back in once in a while, but wouldn't go out of my way to go here."}
{"text":"Just finished eating here. Everything was delicious up until we got to dessert. We ended up finding HAIR inside the chocolate mousse cake. How disgusting. Lost our appetite instantly."}
{"text":"My sister and I were traveling during a day of grocery shopping and she told me she wanted to stop at this place for a bite to eat. I had never heard of this place and I admit to being a more of a burger and fries gal than a soup and salad chick. She was very insistent and we stopped. She didn't tell me much except that they had good food so imagine my surprise to see the menu with very delicious looking soups, salads, and sandwiches. They have an excellent and unique variety of all three of those items. What looked good to me was the Chicken Enchilada Chili. Sounded great. I got it and was really off put by the color but wow it tastes so GOOD! It was hot, creamy and full of flavor. You get a small piece of bread and a chocolate dipped strawberry. Yum. I was very satisfied with the prices and the quality. I will definitely return again."}
{"text":"I wanted to give this place a shot because a location is opening up right near me at Buffalo and Lake Mead.  The Eastern Avenue Zupas is down the street from one of my gyms so it was easy to plan a post-workout dinner there with a few good friends.  We arrived on Tuesday night at 7:00pm and the place was busy but not packed as I've heard it can be at lunch time, i.e., there were tables available.  This place gets so crowded at times that there are signs on the table advising you not to save seats--that's a new one for me.  There is an extensive menu of sandwiches, salads, and soups, as well as some great-looking desserts.  Customers get in line and order before sitting down at booths or tables.  I already knew I wanted to try the lobster bisque, so I got the Try 2 Combo, which is only $7.99.  I paired the soup with the turkey cranberry sandwich.  You get a dinner roll and a chocolate covered strawberry with your meal, too--not bad for the price at all.  I really liked the bisque--not too salty, and my sandwich was also tasty.  I probably enjoyed the strawberry the most, and I got to eat two, benefiting from the b/f's allergy to fruit--more for me, sweetie.  I will definitely be back --now I'm really looking forward to the one in my 'hood to open."}
{"text":"Good food and nice atmosphere. I went with some old friends from out of town for dinner. They love it for everyone had something to pick from the menu including their youngest daughter who usually is very picky about what she eats and she found something she liked which is a plus . The husband and I will go again to this place. Oh--I love the chocolate covered strawberry that came with your meal and the Italian soda syrups you can mixed with your fountain drink!!!"}
{"text":"This place replaced my beloved Greek eating establishment. ( I had one favorite menu item that I will truly miss) I would have never visited had it not been for my sons school receiving a donation of the sales tonight. I like when local businesses do that and we like to participate. So the charity to Aprende middle school got us to enter the building and the food will get us to enter again. Very fresh, healthy, and we both somehow ate for $6. ( with desert...) I had salad and my son had a sandwich and we had a brownie and another fancy desert ( fancy, so I am unsure exactly what it was. Salted brûlée something.. Yum!) I want to go back and try their soup. They had a lot of soup choices and they all looked good. The building looks new and was clean. We took our food to go and actually ate in the hobby lobby parking lot... But hobby lobby is another 5 star review. I love that place too!"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff,yummy unique soups and salads. The paninis are okay a little skimpy on veggies and meat.similar to a panera bread but a little less expensive"}
{"text":"Awesome experience! Great food,great prices and an amazing staff! So super friendly and eager to help you. Anfernie especially was very helpful with helping bring food to the table since I have a little one and also continued to go above and beyond, taking our trash and refilling drinks.I'm blown away with how great this place is and would recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge soup, salad, sandwich lover. Normally, I find these lunch places way over priced. In the case of Zupas, however, I feel that the price matches the quality and quantity of the food you get. I had the Wisconsin cauliflower soup and a Turkey spinach artichoke sandwich. Both were wonderful."}
{"text":"LLLOOOOVVVEEEEE IT!!!!!!! It's comparable a fresher version of paradise bakery. Tons of vegetarian options, I love the soups!!!! They don't overload you with bread, and always give you a chocolate strawberry with your meal. Parking can be tricky to get out of. Seating is seat yourself. This location can be very busy but they go through the line quickly. Meals will run you easily a good 10-15 a person."}
{"text":"I am extremely stingey with my 5 star ratings. It takes a wow factor to get one. This place scores. Drawback== Cafeteria style serving gets kinda chaotic. You go thru a line and place your order. If you are not totally prepared for all the questions/options it gets kinda crazy. The food is fantastic. Soups very good. Sands/salads excellent. It can be very crowded but the tables turn over fast. The staff was friendly and helpful. They add to the chaos by working fast and hard to keep the line moving fast.
Great job. Great food. Keep up the great work."}
{"text":"Horrible. Rude confused workers.  Tiny spoonful of topping on salads. No one seems to know what they are doing.
I don't how you screw up a turkey sandwich but they did.
Won't be back."}
{"text":"This was my first experience here and I will be returning frequently! It was delicious! I had the salad and soup combo with salmon chowder and cherry balsamic chicken salad.  Both soup and salad were awesome! The flavor a in the salad were fresh fruits, cheese, and nuts. The dressing was great too! The soup was fresh and tasted homemade and yummy! The final touch was adding a chocolate covered strawberry for dessert! Both my husband and I had the combos and the price was $19, pretty comparable to panera bread. I will def be going back again and again and again! Staff is extremely friendly too!"}
{"text":"Cafe Zupas is always clean, friendly, fresh and delicious!!! 
This location is one of my favorites.  Everyone is always so nice here.  
I always love the chocolate covered strawberries to end my meal with!!!"}
{"text":"The place is busy chaotic on a Saturday at noon. I couldn't barely hear the first girl taking orders.  
Finally get orders and get seated and still chaotic getting drinks. The drink fountain is in back in a small congested area. Hardly any Room to wait for a drink. 

There's a back door to exit out of and people were entering making the drink process even more difficult 

Food was great, I am never let down when we come to zupa's when it comes to the delicious food."}
{"text":"I love Zupas! My man told me all about it (he's from Utah), and I told him that they've just opened one here. He told me to go give it a try because their food is delish, and I did! I always get their salad and sandwich combo with a chocolate-covered strawberry (Thai Mango salad with Asian BBQ Pork sandwich). Their price is VERY affordable! It's a big serving of food all under $10! And it all tastes very fresh. I'm just glad that they have a little taste of Utah here in Vegas since I looooove the restaurants over there (the ones that Vegas doesn't have)! DEFINITELY coming back!"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by cafe zupas! 

The pick two option is an amazing deal. I am  used to Panera serving size so I was delighted to see that the pick two came with a whole sandwich and a generous portion of soup. 

I got the pesto chicken sandwich and the only negative thing I have to say is how I really wanted more pesto. The bread was crunchy & soft and the chicken was smothered in cheese and topped with sprouts. Very good! 

I choose the cauliflower soup and oh my goodness, I know cauliflower doesn't sound great, it was fantastic! Creamy, cheesy, and seasoned well! 

My husband opted to have cheddar and bacon topped on the soup which made it that much better! 

The pick two also came with a slice of baguette bread (too soft, I like a crusty bread) and a chocolate dipped strawberry. 

We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I really REALLY like this place. Although it's more of a \"quick service\" type of eatery, the sandwiches are good (I recommend the honey bacon club), the soups are piping hot (lobster bisque and wild mushroom are amazing!), and the salads are fresh and tasty (the strawberry fields salad is wonderful).

The staff here are friendly and helpful, and you can even request samples of the soup before committing (who does that anymore!?!). They have small desserts and the creme brûlée is pretty tasty, too."}
{"text":"Good thing zupa is in the name because the soup was delicious. In my group we had the chicken tortilla, the veggie chowder, and the cauliflower Wisconsin soups and they were all delicious. The cauliflower soup in particular was so soft and creamy, I'd go back just for that. The salads were also very fresh and the sandwiches were tasty too. The only issue I saw was that the people behind the counter were very confused and frazzled, maybe because it was busy on a Friday night? That's the only reason it's getting knocked down to four stars."}
{"text":"They soup was cold and clotted.  The sandwiches looked they were pressed into little hockey pucks.  The only redeeming quality was the salad.  Not impressed at all.  We tried coming one time before and all the containers of food along the cook line had been sitting out so we left and tried again.  Wish we would have stayed away.  $40 for 2 small salads. 2 sandwiches and 2 bowls of soup.  Really?"}
{"text":"Cafe Zupas finally opened up on the southwest side of Vegas! What a time to be alive. Both the exterior and interior are very modern and industrial, with high ceilings and a mix of wood and metal accents. The organization is a bit strange, seeing as you enter through a single (instead of double) door and have to awkwardly snake your way through dining tables in order to get to the line. They should have followed in Chipotle's footsteps and had a separated section against the wall for a line. 

There is plenty of seating and even though the line was long, it moved very quickly. Employees were not the MOST efficient but there were so many of them, their inefficiency was negligible. There is so much signage and menu options it seems a little confusing and daunting at first. Basically you order your salad and sandwich first and order soup and dessert later if you want some. 

My parents and I opted to share two preset combos, although you can order everything separately and salads can be custom made. 

Conclusion? Price is stellar for what you get and the food is much healthier than most fast casual restaurants out there. There's a great variety of choices but I find all the flavors to be to strong (too salty, too sweet, too much sauce). I could barely finish the kale and quinoa salad because it was so drenched in sweet dressing it made me sick. I'll just ask for dressing on the side next time. The sandwiches are kind of small and dinky looking though. The little chocolate strawberry is a nice touch.

Great place to stop by for a quick lunch.

{"text":"Cafe Zupas is such a fun little place to eat! There are lots of salad and soup and sandwiches to choose from and make combos from! And each combo that you get comes with a chocolate covered strawberry.  They also have a bunch of beautiful desserts. I tried the Nutella one, and it was fabulous! Come to Cafe Zupas and I'm sure you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"My favorite place to find a great sandwich, salad, or soup. Blows Paradise Bakery/Panera Bread out of the water. I wish they had one in the west valley, but I will keep driving to Phoenix for this one until then!"}
{"text":"The manager here is not accommodating at all and very un organized.his customer service skills are shot.His employee messed up on my order and he did absolutely nothing to fix it.all he said was he would \"coach\" him.forget coaching fix my damn order!  They nickel and dime you in this place so he did not want to refund or correct the order! Also just like Malia's review.This Charleston location is not that clean either.Sean the manager should be ashamed of himself"}
{"text":"Every time I come to this place I quickly remember why I don't eat here often. While proceeding through the line for my salad creation I notice how all the employees are very disciplined to serve an miserly portion of food. They will scoop a portion with a spoon and shake half the topping out by the time it reaches the bowl. A topping like cut up grilled chicken ends up as small crumbs of chicken. Requiring one to pay extra to get close to a 4 oz serving. 
I have discussed this with previous managers and employees. The employees do not realize they are doing this."}
{"text":"Harvest salad is Amazing, the lines moves quickly and even when it seems super busy there are tables."}
{"text":"This place is the sort of trendy, locally sourced, free range crunchy paradise that just begs you, dares you to hate it. You look at the ridiculously bubbly show off at the counter effortlessly tossing the most delicious looking salad you've ever seen (seriously, I'm not even a salad guy) while taking your order and apparently running the whole show, and you consider punching him... except that he stands between you and sandwich paradise, so you play his game like he's the upbeat cousin of the Soup Nazi.

Then you get to the soup, and are tempted to eat it straight from the serving pot. But you can't. Not allowed. Rules are stupid. 

So you sit, with your soup and sandwich, and you black out over the next several minutes, and then you look down and your food is gone and you are ludicrously satisfied, forgetting how much you hate these people. And this makes you wonder...

Could all the world's issues be solved by a Soup and Sandwich? Would we all love each other more if we were bound together by the bonds of Chicken Enchilada Chili?

Perhaps, my friends. Perhaps."}
{"text":"This is a nice little restaurant that is in an all out effort to put itself out of business. My wife and I don't eat here often but sometimes a sandwich, soup or salad is just what we need. Came in tonight and ordered my usual Cuban panini sandwich, they make a good one here. I ordered it as usual with extra pickles and was told... \"it's against our corporate policy to add extra pickles to your sandwich\" I of course asked why and the young man behind the counter told me \"it's a very confusing rule and hard to explain, however sir, the Cuban sandwich has 6 pickle slices on it and trust me, it's enough\". I offered to pay extra for the pickles and was told \"sorry, we can't do it or we'll get fired\".

Needless to say this corporate policy was developed by someone w/ absolutely no sense or concern for customer service. We won't be back and it's too bad because the food is not half bad."}

{"text":"First...when is this place coming to the DMV...ya, you know DC, MD, VA. I ate here 5 out of the 7 days I was in Arizona! Fresh, healthy and tasty! The salads are amazing, the sandwiches are filling, and the soups are sublime for a causal dining place. And they give you a chocolate coated strawberry with each meal. Their infused drinks with honey are the bomb. Oh, one day I decided to try their brûlée -- yep, they just stopped the hazelnut one. Boo for me, and I didn't want their seasonal pumpkin one so I had their fruit one. OMG..yes!  I swear I had their strawberry harvest salad everyday with the exception of trying the berries and nuts one day, and their Wisconsin Cauliflower soup everyday. I want the recipe for the strawberry champagne vingerette--Zupa Gods...do you hear me? I had their carnita sandwich -- boy was it huge and filling? I don't get why you get a full sandwich on the combo but the other choice is just a half salad or half soup. I think one ought to get a full salad with a half sandwich and half soup. Anyhoo--as you're opening in the Midwest...know that the DMV needs you here. We need more than Panera! Come on!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan!

i recently stopped in for a quick lunch with my Mom while we were out running errands on a Saturday afternoon.

The new location is open at Stephanie/Sunset and is easily accessible.  There are 2 entrances (front and back) and plenty of parking.  We parked in the front and entered the restaurant.  

They offer paper menus and have a large menu board.  Small signs explain how to order.  You start with salads, then sandwiches and end with soups. They offer a special which includes a sandwich and either a half salad or half bowl of soup for $8.99. Seems like a great deal.

My Mom and I hadn't eaten and decided to share a little of everything.  We got the chipotle chicken salad (full size), turkey artichoke and spinach sandwich and a half bowl of lobster bisque.  With 2 drinks, our bill was about $20 and this was A LOT of food.  In hindsight, we should have just ordered the half salad, because we didn't even come close to eating everything!

Meals are served with a slice of yummy bread and a chocolate covered strawberry.  Both were delicious!j

The staff was super friendly and helpful.  The service was really quick as well. I like that everything is made in house and is very fresh.

This is a great addition to the area and I look forward to going back!"}
{"text":"I usually visit this place regularly after working out and love the freshness of the ingredients in their soups and salads. However the other day I went in a few minutes before they closed. All the ingredients for the salad were still out as well as the soup. The woman behind the counter was very curt and told us they were closed (even though it was 5 mins before closing). After pointing out that the food was still out she agreed to give us soup but that was all. After ringing us out she then proceeded to close down the salad bar. There were still about 10 people in the restaurant eating but we felt like we needed to leave immediately. It was rude and poor customer service. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Two years later tried this place again and it's still awful. Soup is cold, what is up with this. Too many questions at once from different people. They should have the tray at the beginning and as you are pushed through the line they mark the tray what you get. Not having to repeat everything again at the end. Also waste of labor with the door greeter dessert influencer and everyone else. 8 people behind the line and you still can't produce a great lunch. Chip selection is very limited as well. Bread you get with the soup is cold like it came from a fridge"}
{"text":"Possibly my favorite casual restaurant in Las Vegas. Cafe Zupas is *the* place to go for delicious food, quickly. 

The restaurant is pleasant. Diners walk up to a long buffet-style bar and order their food. Sandwiches are made fresh. Salads are put together in front of you and soups are kept warm in large soup warmers so service is quick and one is soon sitting down in the comfortable dining area and eating.

I have had their Lobster Bisque soup (which is divine). Their Ultimate Grilled Cheese sandwich really is the ultimate in decadence. I adore it. 

Zupas offers a complimentary bread serving and a chocolate covered strawberry with each meal. It is a nice touch that I appreciate. (And both are wonderful treats, as well.)

I always get their Salted Caramel crème brûlée. Whilst not a traditional brûlée (a crunchy top you tap with a spoon) it is a marvelous concoction of creamy vanilla pudding topped with a luscious (soft) caramel topping and finished with whipped cream and a thin chocolate slice.

Every meal at Zupas has been great. This is what casual dining should be, everywhere. 

Great food, pleasant atmosphere, well-valued pricing and a terrific location. It doesn't get better than this."}
{"text":"This was my first time at restaurant and I have to say I was very pleased. It had really good food and nice clean restaurant.  It was a bit pricy but over all, it was a good experience."}
{"text":"This was my first time going to this restaurant very clean and nice!! I had turkey avocado bacon sandwichI will be back soon"}
{"text":"This restaurant is the best bargain on a soup and salad (or sandwich) in town.  The sandwiches are whole ones like paninis and other hot and cold sandwiches.  You can make your own salad or pick and substitute ingredients in one of their menu salads.  This is fast food at its best.  I like the grilled cheese panini, barbeque chicken salad and most soups except the creamy ones.  Service is like a school lunch line up and you may need to check to see that you got what you ordered.  They also have good desserts, beverages and take out."}
{"text":"We were driving around aimlessly, looking for a healthier fast food alternative, and decided to give this place a try.  Both of our picky eaters finished their whole meals and my husband and I enjoyed our sandwich & soup combos, as well.  I am a mushroom lover and the Mushroom Bisque satisfied my craving.  It was a bit much for my husband's taste though.  Love that their meals come with chocolate dipped strawberries too!"}
{"text":"5 stars hands down. walked in for my first visit today and blown away with it! Service was friendly, the restaurant is beautiful and the food - YUM! Wow the spring green salad is delicious. They make kale taste GOOD! I'm still working on the salad and I bought a mixed berry creme brulee (made in house) and looking forward to that. 
I love that they include a chocolate covered strawberry. 
Everything is so fresh and the lobster bisque is the best I've ever had. 
I want to come here for my birthday dinner -- it's THAT good!!!!"}
{"text":"I love that you get a chocolate dipped strawberry with your order here. It's the perfect dessert to complement an average lunchtime sandwich/salad meal. I thought the soups I tried were pretty oily but the quinoa bowl / salad was pretty good and I appreciated that they put the dressing on the side. Overall, Cafe Zupas is a decent option to add to your lunchtime rotations, but it's not as good or as fast as grabbing salads from the Whole Foods close by."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Imagine Panera but kicked up a notch with fresher ingredients (in my opinion). I had the salad with chicken and strawberries. It was great and the red pepper lobster soup. I was told to get the red pepper lobster mixed with lobster bisque and add cheese and croutons by a staff member next time. I will definitely keep this in mind. It is pretty busy and families were there with their kids. So if you are looking for a quiet dinner, you won't get it here."}
{"text":"This place was just what I was looking for. The food was fresh, clean, and healthy. The portion sizes are not as plentiful, but it's a healthy eating place after all. The staff are friendly and patient with customers."}
{"text":"This is a bit intimidating at first as you feel like you are 'supposed to know how to order'.  There are signs, but still it doesn't have a natural flow.  That being said, the food was great.  We each ordered a combo- all of it was great.  Samples of soups aren't advertised as another reviewer said.  I may go with this next time.  The mushroom bisque was SUPER.  Now that we have the ordering down (similar to Paradise baker- not sure where to order what) we will be back.  TASTY!"}
{"text":"Cali-protein Cobb salad and the lobster bisque along with the delicious cookie dipped in chocolate are devine!! If I was on death row and had one meal to choose from it would be this."}
{"text":"I think the food here is pretty good.  There's a Panera nearby and lots of other places and I think this is nice, I especially like the soup but Panera has a lot more menu options and the quality is better there as well.  But Zupas is a good price and nice for what it is - soup and salad.  Yes they have sandwiches and I find those hit or miss as sometimes they seem to hardly have any ingredients.  

Now for my big beef.  This place OFTEN has more people working than eating.  Still, I find I have to repeat my order two times FOR SURE, often more.  It is really awkward the way they are set up behind the counter.  So please I beg you Zupas if you are listening, do something - anything - so that I do not have to repeatedly explain what I ordered or didn't order to several people every time.  It is annoying and I eat here less because of it.  With so many employees you could readily have someone shadow the customer and convey the order.  Or write it down, like every other restaurant."}
{"text":"as a first timer eating in Cafe Zupas, the food experience was AMAZING! its like all my fave meals in one place from salads to desserts.. 

I ordered their MANGOBERRY salad which has the best tasting mango yogurt dressing. Along side with my salad, i also tried their CLAM CHOWDER which was really tasty. Then i had CHICKEN PESTO sandwich to go which was also flavorful.. Their dessert which i tried was the MIXED BERRY so scrumptuous too!.. it seems like everything i ordered was just perfect to my taste. 

i recommend this cafe to everyone!.."}
{"text":"Strawberry Harvest chicken salad an Italian cold sandwich combo half and half excellent to die for"}
{"text":"Went to Zupas for lunch.  I had a Cuban Pork Sandwich with a Lobster Bisque.  I had a combo of two things.  It was good.  This is a place that I would recommend to my mother the next time she comes and visits me in Arizona."}
{"text":"They have lost a frequent customer. The manager was unhelpful when there was no one in line at 11am they refused to take an order of mine. I was directed over to the catering manager and she told me I had to wait an hour for my 7 box lunches. I explained to them they had 45 mins to work on this. This is not the first time they've fallen through as I placed an order the night before and was told at 9am the next day that the order was taken by a new person and they couldn't accommodate my order leaving me with no other options. I'm done zupas. Get your act together, you've lost a customer for life!"}
{"text":"We went there yesterday for the first time and we were so disappointed. The sandwich couldn't have been smaller and the soup was so watery I was embarrassed FOR them. The staff was not great either. Nice, but didn't seem to even know who was doing what. Silverware wasn't stocked, lids were empty. I just didn't enjoy a bit of my late lunch at all."}
{"text":"I wish I could give more stars, because I love there soup (cauliflower and chicken tortilla) and I love there salad. But the fact that I can't get more greens really angers me!! Even if I want to pay for more greens, they tell me no. You should never tell a customer no! I used to go there a lot spending over $20 on 2 large salads and a soup. I like to take one home to eat later. But after eating one large salad and soup, I am still hungry. I really wish one day they will have an option to purchase more greens. Until then, they only get 3 stars. :-/"}
{"text":"This is a cool way to order soups, salads and sandwiches. They make your salad right in front of you and you can choose any add ins as far as extra toppings or additions to your soup. They have suggestions about what extras go good with what. Their enchilada soup was amazing. And you get a chocolate covered strawberry with every meal !"}
{"text":"When I need catering for our meetings, you better believe Cafe Zupas is my first choice. The staff knows us by heart and offers us amazing options.The are friendly, fast and just on top of their game. The food is amazing. The freshness, selection and taste is amazing. Those cookies are Kryptonite. 

When my staff asks me where to go or what sounds good,,,this is the place!"}
{"text":"I love Cafe Zupa. We regularly frequent the other two locations in Gilbert & Chandler. The food is great, prices are good, and the customer service is always friendly. 

Tonight we went to this location, and we knew it was 30 minutes to closing, but we had a late night and just wanted something healthy and quick to eat. 

As we walked in, a staff member (who we later found out was named Maya) stated, loudly, \"I knew it!\" And rolled her eyes. Then LOUDLY yelled across the back area and told a girl named Stephanie she better not clock out and leave her. This \"joking\" went on between everyone behind the counter for a good minute before we were asked what we wanted to order. 

Two girls walked in as we were ordering, and Maya looked at a coworker and rolled her eyes, staring \"Are you kidding me?\" When those girls got their turn, they talked to Maya as if they were regulars, but that didn't prevent the attitude as they walked in. 

Horrible service. Another girl tried to round up the others \"Okay everyone, get to work\" but this continued anyway. We ordered our sandwiches and waited a whole minute before anyone even realized we were standing by the soups waiting to order that. 

Horribly unprofessional. We will not be returning to this location."}
{"text":"OMG how have I gone my whole life without this place?? 

Went on Saturday 12-19-15 about 6PM. This restaurant is on the southeast corner of Stephanie and Warm Springs.  Follow the entrances for sunset station for the easiest entry.  

You order right at the counter and they make your food right in front of you.  Order your sammiches and salads first and then scoot on down to the soup area to order yummy soups.  I love their modern trendy decor and the place is so bright and clean! The staff were so cheery and helpful. I like that they do not accept tips AS IT SHOULD BE for counter service.  

$27.28 got us two of their \"try two\" combos, two fountain drinks, and a berry creme brulee.  I got the bbq chicken salad and the california turkey sandwich.  Hubs got the tomato soup and the ultimate grilled cheese.  Both meals came with a slice of baguette and a chocolate-covered strawberry. 

BBQ chicken salad comes with House-Chopped Mixed Greens, House-Made Ranch Dressing, Chicken*, BBQ Sauce, Red Onions, Grape Tomatoes, Fire Roasted Corn, Black Olives, Black Beans, & Tortilla Strips.  I love that the salad came already dressed and the lettuce to toppings ratio was perfect. 

The california turkey sandwich comes with Turkey, Avocado, Tomatoes, Sprouts, Cucumbers, Mixed Greens, Muenster Cheese, & House-Made Sun-Dried Tomato Herb Spread.  I asked for honey mustard instead of the tomato herb spread and they were happy to oblige.  I love that they have sprouts because I haven't seen many places that have them. 

The creme brulee did not have a rich and decadent taste at all...it was more like a vanilla pudding.  I think next time I'll try the chocolate one.  

Their drink fountains have a ton of choices and they have about 6 syrups in different flavors to spice up your drink.  There were some cute recipes printed right on the cups.  

I want to try everything on the menu!!!!"}
{"text":"Horrible service especially down the assembly line. Portion sizes suck but the food quality is decent enough."}
{"text":"This place is ok... Salads soups sandwiches .. Average to me ... The dressings are bland in my opinion and not a very memorable place... Will not be returning :("}
{"text":"like the healthy choices and the grandkids love it!  only thing-I would love to have eaten my chocolate dipped strawberry but I'm allergic to dairy!  It would be great if they either had some in dark chocolate or just a plain one."}
{"text":"Tried Zupas for the first time and am very happy we did. Food is fresh and has the \"home made\" taste they boast. Great flavor in the soups (sampled several) and the sandwich was light but filling. All meals come with a free chocolate covered strawberry! What's not to love there? Also, had the Salted Caramel Creme Brûlée which was great for only $2.99."}
{"text":"Generic soup, salad, sandwich place with lots of options. I picked a soup and half sandwich combo, with the turkey avocado Panini and chicken tortilla soup. The sandwich looked so unappealing and didn't taste much better than that. The soup was decent. I liked the chocolate covered strawberry...wasn't expecting that. I think this is a good addition to the plaza, but I would rather go to the Biltmore for Paradise Bakery."}
{"text":"How is it possible that I've yet to review Cafe Zupas? This is one of my favorite places for lunch, and not just specifically this location - they are all excellent. So much variety of fresh salads, soups and sandwiches. It's the salad bar of your dreams. Ive even used their catering a few times for work, and their service is outstanding."}
{"text":"DEFINITELY a fan. I'm kind of bummed they're closed on Sundays, though :/.

I love getting their Try 2 Combo. I usually opt for half salad, half soup. I love clam chowder but not a fan of theirs -- most likely cause of the celery. Prefer Panera Bread's clam chowder. 

I'm cycling through all their salads slowly, but so far California Protein Cobb is a winner. I've got a long way until I'm done trying more of their menu so expect an update in the future, but for now, highly recommend, especially if you just want to feel healthy when you go out to eat ;)."}
{"text":"My friend is obsessed with this place, so it was quickly nominated for girls lunch. My first impression was that it was spacious and everyone was super friendly, I mean they open the door for you and are ready with recommendations. I immediately decided on the pick 2 combo, for the price it seemed like a bargain. The Asian BBQ sandwich sounded amazing and I heard the roasted cauliflower soup was fantastic, so I ordered it up. I love that you can see all of the ingredients, everything is so fresh and colorful, it really adds to the experience. We were pushed expeditiously through the line and found a table despite it being packed. I really enjoyed the Asian BBQ sandwich, it definitely had a kick to it but it had a good fresh flavor too. I instantly fell in love with the cauliflower soup, it was so creamy and rich, mmmmmm perfection! I like that they give you a piece of bread to dip in the soup, but it was overkill with my sandwich. I loved ending my meal with a chocolate covered strawberry, such a simple touch but a great way to end any meal. 

I was so impressed that I decided to go back that weekend with my husband. This time I tried the pulled pork sandwich and of course the cauliflower soup again. The pulled pork had honey mustard and cabbage on it. I don't normally enjoy honey mustard, but I thought all of the flavors worked well together. My husband had the clam chowder and the Italian sandwich. The clam chowder had a lot of black pepper in it, which wasn't my favorite, but he enjoyed it. The Italian sandwich, on the other hand, was great and I really enjoyed their homemade balsamic dressing.

Overall, I think this is a really great lunch option. Everything is fresh and made to order. The customer service is fantastic, in fact when my husband and I were there they were giving away their daily customer service award to one of their team members - how cool! I can't wait to try some more soups and maybe even a salad next time. This is definitely a welcome addition to the Henderson scene."}
{"text":"I love, love, love Cafe Zupas! It is the best soup, salad, sandwich lunch shop around in my opinion. The inside is bright and vibrant and there is a definite flow to ordering, but it is super easy once you figure it out. I love the pick 2 option because it allows me to try multiple things. So far I am absolutely in love with their Wisconsin Cauliflower soup, it is so rich and creamy. All soups come with a side of bread for dipping, which I love. I am also nuts about the Nuts About Berries salad, the cinnamon almonds are genius! I've also tried their pulled pork, Asian BBQ pork, and Turkey Bacon Avocado sandwiches. The sandwiches are not gourmet or the best sandwiches in the area, but they are pretty good, especially when they are coupled with soup and/or salad. To top everything off, everyone gets a chocolate covered strawberry with their meal! What?! How can this tiny gesture make me so happy? I don't know, but it does! I've heard great things about their other desserts, but haven't tried any yet. This is a fantastic lunch option any day of the week, except Sundays, because they are closed on Sundays."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I actually do like this place, it very hard to find vegetarian choices . Anyway, my husband and I have been here to this new location near us already 4 x. Today I go in after work , driving over 1 hr to get there , and they have yet ANOTHER NEW PERSON as a cashier . I am in a great mood. \" RILEY \" forgets to charge me for my hubz order even when the young man who was working the line clearly told her I had 2 orders , 2 desserts, 1 drink to go. How it it my fault she does not pay attention. I asked for the manager and some lady named \" SARA \" came over . Her so called apology was VERY SAD and VERY UNAPOLOGETIC towards me and actually threw her worker \" RILEY \" under the bus. Who does that ?????  People make sure they get your order right and dont make your use your card AGAIN.. Sara needs to learn the CUSTOMER IS ALWAYS RIGHT and be more kind to your workers and STOP THROWING THE, UNDER THE BUS. Shame on you Sara. I actually felt bad for how I responded to poor \" Riley \" ,,, we will not be back for a while. Thank God PotBelly's and that Pizza place is opening right next to you ,,,,,,,,,,,,,"}
{"text":"A panini is by definition toasted. I've eaten Café Zupas six or seven times and every time the panini came out cold and awful."}
{"text":"The food was okay but my soup was only half filled....totally unacceptable! I'm highly annoyed."}
{"text":"Really disappointed!
Had eaten food from a previous catering event at my job and I loved it. 
So I decided to buy them for my team at work as 6 individual lunch meals..
The food was unsatisfactory. I called to ask why the bread was so hard and I was told 'next time don't get it toasted'..
I would've only given a half star but the person taking the order and the customer service I received when picking the food up was good.
I WILL NOT order from them again!!"}
{"text":"I am in love with this place and addicted to their grilled cheese sandwhiches. It isn't like mom's grilled cheese, but some other, delicious, cheesy concoction. I usually get it with the tomato soup, to which I add orzo. Yum! The lobster bisque is also delicious. If you like salads, you can't go wrong with the one with mango. The mango salad dressing is awesome to boot.

The only negative I have is that they put the hunk of bread and the chocolate covered strawberry in the same bag. The bread ends up kinda strawberry flavored/scented. Really, not a deal breaker, but wish they were kept separate."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch with my employees. The food was tasty and fresh. I had the Cuban and Wisconsin Cauliflower soup. They were both great. I loved the addition of a chocolate covered strawberry as dessert. I will definitely be back with my family. Wish they would put one in Buckeye."}
{"text":"Always solid no matter the location. People are very friendly. Take your time! Customize what you want - so many choices and the desserts are hard to say no to! Feed family of four for under $30.
The tea water drinks are so yummy."}
{"text":"How have I not been here before??! Much more interesting soup and salad place than other chains, in terms of variety. Very clean. Wonderful service. YUMMY food. I had the BBQ Carnitas sandwich and Quinoa Veggie soup, which comes with a piece of baguette and chocolate covered strawberry. I must return!"}
{"text":"Oh my! I can't say enough good things about this place. Panera... I am never going to you again. The food was so fresh. The staff was so friendly. My husband and I paid $24 for two salads, a full sandwich, soup, two rolls, two chocolate strawberries, and two drinks. It was a lot of food for a great price. Now, we moved here from Boston, so perhaps our idea of \"good price\" is different. But I felt like it was a great value. And the quality of the ingredients was just top notch! It was INCREDIBLE. I cannot wait to go back. I would give this place 10 stars if I could!"}
{"text":"cafe Zupas is a great concept a lot of verity's fro salads soups and sandwiches there kids meals are great to on the healthy side which is good and he'd to find healthy choices no days for kids. I had the pesto chicken sandwich and soup was French onion which was a little salty but ok. The sandwich was amazing next time I'm going to do the sandwich salad combo. But other then the soup being salty it was a great experience thanks Cafe Zupas"}
{"text":"Good food - sandwiches, soups, and salads. My favorite combo lately is the Nuts about Berries salad and the Tortilla soup. 

The Nuts About Berries salad is full of strawberries, blackberries, raspberries, and blueberries. They top it off with some crunchy cinnamon almonds. I like the darker greens they use  better than at some other places. 

The Yucatán Chicken Tortilla has been my go to soup. It's not a creamy soup and has corn, tomatoes, and chicken. I highly recommend asking for the tortilla strips on the side. They normally already have some places in little cups ahead of time. My first time getting this soup they put them in right away and by the time I got to the table they were soggy. 

I've never been to Cafe Zupa before, so I didn't know that they give you a chocolate covered strawberry. It was a nice little surprise. 

Service is always very friendly. It's nice to come to a place where the employees are not grumpy. I hear and read a lot of comments about the disconnected ordering style. It hasn't bothered me so much, but I heard one of the employees saying he was heading to a convention to talk about just that. Hopefully they can come up with something better. The only thing I don't particularly appreciate is them trying to push a drink on me. They get the cups ready and assume you will want one. 

I recommend coming here though if you get there around noon, be prepared to wait in line. It usually goes pretty quickly though."}
{"text":"Fresh and delicious. Loved my salad and soup. Didn't realize until I was home that it included delicious rolls and a chocolate dipped strawberry. Sold."}
{"text":"This place is amazing love how everything is so fresh bro! I get hella baked and come here to eat after for munchies it rocks :)"}
{"text":"The service is nice. And the chocolate covered strawberry is good. BUT, we ordered half salad and half sandwich as a combo, then half a soup (didn't want it in the combo) but they rang it up as half soup and salad for the combo, then the sandwich (they gave us whole instead of the half one) which made it more expensive. Plus, the soup wasn't even good. I ordered the clam chowder. I didn't see a single clam in it, just watery, but still too salty. We had bbq salad, which is ok. And the avocado crab sandwich which needs more crab for the price (esp since they only used imitation crab)"}
{"text":"I honestly don't see the appeal of this place. People rave about it so I tried it. I wasn't impressed. People raved about it again so I went and ate there again and again I was thinking what's the hype. Sweet tomatoes is better and that's not a compliment. So I'm really glad other people enjoy it but unless Zac Efron wants me to go with there I won't be going back."}
{"text":"I just ate here for the first time but it certainly won't be the last! The customer service was very good especially for how busy the place was."}
{"text":"I love the selection of salads, protein packed bowls, soups (you can select all sorts of add-ins), and super yummy sandwiches. All very filling and tasty. Every dish I've tried has been good quality and delicious. My favorite is the Salinas chicken bowl. You can get the dressing on the side or just have them mix it in! It's all topped off with a chocolate covered strawberry! I recommend starting at the top and trying everything on the menu! I'm about half way through."}
{"text":"The best! In my opinion way better then panera bread and other competitors. Staff is super friendly and helpful and its just an overall pleasant experience every time we come."}
{"text":"Usually a great place to go for decent food, today was not a usual day. I ordered 2 kids meals, the fruit for one was old, like it had been sitting a while, the other one was with clam chowder, it had way too much black pepper. I ordered a choose 2 deal, the sandwich was good. I got lobster bisque to go with it, which was luke warm and weirdly think which wasn't normal. I went in around 5 and a lot of the tables were dirty, and it wasn't even that busy. I will go back but I hope it won't be a repeat of tonight."}
{"text":"I love this place! The staff is very friendly and they work at an efficient fast pace especially during lunch hour. I have had several different meals and have never been disapppinted. I like the chocolate dipped strawberry rather than a cookie"}
{"text":"Honestly best soup, salad, and sandwich place I've ever had! And the to go packaging is so convenient the food is delicious I literally inhaled everything. If I could I'd eat here everyday"}
{"text":"Been here several times. I won't be going back.  The prices are too high and they nickel and dime you on every single item.  The people who work there lack any sort of enthusiasm for their jobs and are extremely insensitive to dietary needs.  Basically they know nothing about anything there. Hurry up and order and move along, that's what they are taught."}
{"text":"Love the food, but the portions and the service is horrible! I asked if I could have a few more pieces of lettuce (because 8 leave does not cut it when it comes to salad) not only was I told no but there wasn't even an option to buy more??? I don't know, I love the food but it just seems everything thing else seems to be going downhill fast. Sad to say this is our last visit, but if you want an amazing side salad for $6 have at it! On a good note the mushroom bisque is out of this world, and the protein cobb salad can't be beat!"}
{"text":"I love the ambiance of the restaurant and the high volume of staff to keep things moving.  It was busy, but the service remained fast and friendly regardless of the high volume of people there.

What I didn't love was the salad and the lack of discussion about what I was ordering.  They prepared me a small salad, I wanted a large but couldn't tell what they were doing.  Once I realized it was a small it was too late.  Also, the added items (chicken, egg, tomato, etc) was WAY too small of a serving for a lunch.  I was less than two bites of chicken - maybe 1-2ounces total..  and about 1/4 of a hard-boiled egg.  I'm not a big eater - but I was pretty hungry when I left the restaurant.  Also - WAY too much dressing - it was drowning in dressing.

They were so focused on keeping the line moving (and I understand they need to get people through at lunchtime), but they didn't take enough time to let me make decisions about my order.  Large salad, not small.  Extra chicken please.  LESS dressing, etc.  

It could  be great if they improved the service at the counter and actually gave people a moment to order what they want... and if they consider actually adding a decent serving of ingredients to the salads."}
{"text":"Was hungry and finally decided to try this place out. It's a little confusing when you walk in and look at the board because they don't have prices next to half the items, so you search until you get to the bottom that says \"two combo deal $8.99\". Which means you can have a sandwich plus soup, or plus salad, or soup and salad. Just weird in my opinion. Also drink prices are not listed, in fact after I got and paid for an apple juice I didn't even know they had a soda machine hidden behind the techy wall. Of course I have no idea what a small, medium or large would have cost me. Strange layout, almost need to have come before to understand it.

I opted for the ham bacon club, and a bowl of lobster bisque. Both were actually pretty tasty. I didn't taste much bacon on the club, but the honey mayo mustard sauce was good. The lobster bisque wasn't bad either considering, its not top quality restaurant good but decent enough. Overall, a tasty meal for $11.31.

Staff was friendly and bubbly, not sure if it was lunch or a shift change of many of the employees were eating at the same time I was. Rest of the place was pretty quiet at 2pm."}
{"text":"First time visit, but not the last.  The food was so fresh and good.  We were pleasantly surprised at the quality.  Sorry that we did not discover Cafe Zupas sooner."}
{"text":"Decent soup and salad options, and you are free to have more variety in what is included in your salad. The food itself was pretty good- I enjoyed my lunch. I will definitely be back because I want to try more of their soups! Also, can't say no to a chocolate-covered strawberry (which comes with your meal)!"}
{"text":"Never have I ever had a bad meal here.  Healthy made delicious.    The chopped chipotle salad had so many incredible flavors from citrus to cilantro.. I could have licked the bowl clean!  Service is excellent !"}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place since not many restaurants are dedicated to healthy eating. I had the strawberry harvest chicken salad and it was good. I give only 3 stars because the salads are just good and not great. 

I wished they would use more greens and spinach versus just iceberg lettuce, which provide really low nutritional value.

Cool atmosphere also."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times, and I'm not sure why I keep going back.  The Thai chicken salad sandwich is delicious, but these people don't know how to properly make a sandwich - they pile everything in the center of the bread, leaving the edges bare.  I have to spread all the stuff out before I eat it.  I have tried about half of their soups, and none of them are great.  Something off about each one.  If I do go back I'll just stick with a sandwich."}
{"text":"This is good alternative to the Panera bread/Paradise Bakery that closed down in the desert ridge marketplace.
The employees are helpful and friendly and the dining area is kept clean.
The ingredients are fresh and the line moves quickly. 
Their large salad isn't really large so I can't imagine why anyone would order a small salad except to complement another entree. 
My kale salad didn't have much flavor and they could've done a better job cleaning the kale. My girlfriend's Maui chicken salad wasn't any better either. The salads came with spongy bread; not very good. The best part was the chocolate covered strawberry. It was really tasty."}
{"text":"I love this place! They have super healthy options. The line moves quickly. The prices are a little less than a you-pick-two from Panera. Everyone gets a free chocolate covered strawberry with their meal, whether you want it or not.

So why the missing star? 
THEY'RE CLOSED ON SUNDAYS!!! 
Boooooooo...
What is this, Chick-fil-a?"}
{"text":"Tried this place for lunch, although busy and a little noisy but the food makes up for it. I would recommend their salads and the soups. The sandwiches are alright, I do love a good place with good salads! They are not too high priced, I would recommend the Chicken Chop Salad with their Herb Vinaigrette dressing! Also they give you strawberries with a small amount of chocolate. I think for what you pay for it a good quality and quantity of food!"}
{"text":"Good sandwiches and soups -- not mind-blowingly amazing -- but really good.  I'd say this place is second to Wildflower, on par with Paradise, better than Kneader's, and WAY better than Blue Lemon.

Not a huge fan of their salads and have only tried their Ultimate Grilled Cheese panini sandwich, as I'm vegetarian and there aren't many veggie sandwich options.  It's a pretty good grilled cheese; I like that it comes with tomatoes, several different cheeses, and pesto spread.  There are usually a good range of vegetarian soups to choose from.  I really like the Wild Mushroom Bisque (really flavorful!) and the Tomato Basil (they add orzo pasta on top if you ask for it).  The only one I've tried that I really disliked was the Tuscan White Bean and Vegetable -- salty and very un-flavorful.  :/

If you get a meal, it also comes with a roll (not the best bread I've ever had -- I usually feed mine to my hubby or the birds outside) and chocolate-dipped strawberry (yum!).  You can get a drink for a little extra -- they have a station with Italian soda flavorings to spice up your soda selection (no cream though).  They also provide two kinds of crackers for your soup.  Dessert-wise, I've tried a few of their creme brûlées and while alright, I'd say they're nothing to write home about.

Pretty good overall though!"}
{"text":"Love the wild mushroom soup here. One complaint I have is it is not HOT enough. To me it should be hot no matter what because of health regulation. 
free chocolate dipped strawberries."}
{"text":"A sandwich, a crappy 1/2 salad, and 2 drinks= $20! The presentation of the sandwich was just that...a sandwich. No lil sprig of parsley or lettuce or anything to make the plate look inviting at all. I was told to add a bit of sugar snap peas would cost extra. Wth? Really?!? No thanks! el pollo loco is down the street and I think I'll patron them before I do Zupas."}
{"text":"It was a nice quick option after some shopping. The bright colors of the place seemed to yell out that this was a healthier choice. It was a good reminder that I was heading home and to get back on track and not be so indulgent. I went with the sandwich and soup combo. I had debated over and ended up getting the lobster bisque which was quite delicious. I got this with the crab salad sandwich and it was a good combination and just the right portion. The prices were reasonable and the staff was very friendly. I loved being able to sit outdoors as well."}
{"text":"I've been to zupa's a few times now and generally receive great food and great service. They have this awesome station where you can make your own Italian soda (minus the cream). I generally get the chicken pesto sandwich (no tomato) and it is FABULOUS. However the soups can leave something to be desired... They are okay, they just tend to either be dull in flavor or too much (like the gumbo... waaaaay too fishy). I normally go for the white bean soup. 
It's a pretty cool place... However, there is often barely any seating. I'm not sure if that's really worth losing a star, and hey, good for them for being a booming business, but still it would be nice to have a place to sit (especially if you have a big group). 
All seating and soup issues aside, zupa's is a great place to go for a moderately priced, quality meal."}
{"text":"For today's visit, 4/14/17, around 1:10pm, I give the service the lowest rating possible. So, this blonde girl in a red uniform shirt, greets you after the soup area, \"hi guys...\" asks you your order and completely mixes up the order with either the one before us or after us. See, the problem is that she is focused on two customers at the same time, therefore, providing poor service. It was a busy time, I get it... but doing what she was doing doesn't make it right. So, long story short, after I say what was my order, three f*kng times, she ended up giving us the wrong sandwich. We sat down, wondered what sandwich it was and immediately stood up to return it after realizing that it was not what we ordered. Instead of this girl, apologizing for her mistake, she grabbed the plate with the wrong sandwich, got another plate, handed it to me, in a rush, with no sense of being sorry for what she did. So, I spoke up and told her, \"hey, you can apologize instead of looking away\" ---- did that happen? No it didn't. And to make it worst, she handed me the WRONG sandwich (again). At that point, I took a deep breath, sat down, and ate my soup instead. 
Not one manager or supervisor came....  This for sure would be the last time I am dining at this restaurant."}
{"text":"I've only been to this one location on Camelback and I really like the layout.They put a lot of work into making a sandwich shop look modern and cool. The signs are bright and easy to read the staff is peppy but not the the point of annoying and tacky. The ingredients seem to have a premium taste. There are probably about 10 diffrent sandwiches and 10 different salads and just as many soups. Ive had a few different salads and soups.....that all came with a surprise. I was not expecting a chocolate covered strawberry in my to go box but it was there! Nice touch Cafe Zupas."}
{"text":"The food is still a five but the service has gown down horrendously! The last four times I have gotten the garden chicken chop salad with NO. Bacon and they but bacon every time. If I ate red meat whatever I'll deal but I haven't my whole life. What if someone was allergic? Food allergies is a serous thing but people here just don't seem to care. I told a manager when it happened the second time and she even actually at the register assured me there was not bacon. She even remembered me asking her and all she had to say was oh sorry. So yeah I love the food but I probably won't waste my time coming back."}
{"text":"The place has great salads, soups, and sandwiches. I am usually on the go so I don't get to sit down and actually enjoy it in the restaurant but what I can tell you is there is a lot of room to sit down in or outside. Food is made fresh in front of you and good per portions. Staff is friendly and the restaurant is nice and clean."}
{"text":"I love cafésZupas cafeteria style food. The newest location in Boca Park is very convenient and the staff is wonderful. They have a very nice juice bar that you can get with your meal. My favorite is the basil cucumber water. Zupas mediately priced an all a cart menu allows you to eat according to your hunger needs awful lot just will the tide you over well good luck on your visit to the new Zupas and Boca Park just a across from on the Wendy's."}
{"text":"The $7.99 deal is the best part about this place. Gives me a reason to try everything on their menu. Service is quick and food is comparable to Panera. My favorite sammie so far is the Asian BBQ Pork Sandwich with their Shanghai Chicken Salad. Can't wait to try the rest of their guilt free menu."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a sandwich there are better options even in the same complex. The salad was good and the chocolate strawberry at the end was a nice touch, but it couldn't overcome the prepackaged wet lunch meat sandwich. Had heard a ton of good things about it, but one visit was enough for me."}
{"text":"Me encanta comer el Lobster bisque soup y el sandwich de cangrejo con tocino y aguacate...deliciosa combinación y de excelente calidad, no más de 15 dólares, incluyendo bebida, pan y una fresa con chocolate de postre...!increíble!!!"}
{"text":"This place is a chain. I thought why not give it a shot. I got the half soup and half salad. I have to say it was reasonably priced. The food was really good. I'll definately be back."}
{"text":"Love this place. I always order the half salad and sandwich. The manager here is particularly friendly and always greets me with a warm smile. The only issue I have is that it can take 15 minutes of waiting just to order. But as they say, good things are worth waiting for."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great salads and soups. I like that you can create your own salad. Good variety of choices."}
{"text":"Panera's weird cousin. So came to this place with high hopes. The selection of soups was great. I had the roasted red pepper lobster. It had great flavor. My husband had the chipotle chicken salad - he didn't like the amount of dressing but that could easily be fixed by asking the staff to go light on the dressing. I also had the veggie sandwich which was disappointing. My husband also had the chicken pesto panini which lacked all flavor. The pesto was remiss in that it seemed non existent. The sandwich was also a tad messy in that it seemed to be heavy on the sauce. 

The thing that seemed to be a little ridiculous was that they charged .69 for croutons. This was a condiment cup size of croutons. It just seemed a little unnecessary. They did provide a dinner roll for both meals purchased. But I would have rather had croutons than a free dinner roll. Also the chocolate covered strawberries were a nice touch and delicious. We decided to try the mixed berry creme brule - which was more like a pudding than a custard. Also a little dull in flavor.  

Finally, the store only offers traditional sugar and Splenda. If you aren't partial to those options then too bad. Overall the price of the food for what was given wasn't impressive. I think we will stick with Panera bread for now."}
{"text":"Soup, salads and sandwiches...very basic and not a ton of flavor.  Quick and easy if you are looking for that.  The restaurant was clean and the beverage choices are plentiful."}
{"text":"1 star b/c they wouldn't add extra turkey to my sandwich which I was willing to pay for and wouldn't give me a reason why they couldn't do it. Also the employee were really rude and the manager would not come out to talk to me and just stayed in the back."}
{"text":"Another soup/salad/sandwich place with a few twists.  It's as if OLD NAVY has styled this place with the lighting & colors, so it certainly stands out from the competition in overall vibe.  Line format moves rather fast, even with patrons who are unfamiliar with the menu.  The cheddar cauliflower soup was a bit chalky for my taste, but the tomato basil was thick & flavorful.  Ultimate grilled cheese was a letdown as it seemed to be a thinly pressed panini without much inside.  The combo seemed small in portion size and feeling hungry after a meal isn't a good thing.

The chocolate dipped strawberries are a nice touch with the meals, as was the fancy soda syrups that are complimentary with soda purchase.

Staff was very polite and tables were bussed fast.  Just wasn't thrilled about the food.  Also obnoxious sewer smell right outside the door to the south that would waff in when people exited that door."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the soups. Hubby got the clam chowder and enjoyed it. I got the lobster bisque but I don't know if I would refer to it as a bisque but more of a chowder kinda of soup because of the carrots, celery, onion and fennel. We also got a side sandwich to go with the soup. It was the try 2 combo for $7.99.  You can choose between, soup, sandwich, or salad. Anyway I got the turkey bacon avocado and hubby got the honey bacon club.  Both were good but I felt the they were skimpy sandwiches. Overall  we will be returning."}
{"text":"The good is amazing but they advertise chocolate covered strawberries and they're hardly ever fully covered. It's more like drizzled if that. Not to mention the sizes range from big to the size of a quarter."}
{"text":"First off, this is not a sit down and be served type of place. It is reminiscent of a cafeteria. But it is a healthier and fresh option done fast. Therefore, if you want a place to sit and order this may not be for you. 

As for the food... this is a great place to get a salad and sandwich, and or soup combo. Great selection of fresh vegetables and fruit for their salads and sandwiches. My personal favorite is their mango berry salad and the carnita sandwich combination. The mango berry salad has candies almonds and the touch of cinnamon that will have you broken hearted when the last bites gone. 

Each combo is served with a roll and a chocolate covered strawberry. They also have several dessert options. They offer different syrup options to make a soda into a Italian soda. Also there are lemonade and teas options that are only sweetened by honey.

All in all, great fast food with a healthier and fresh taste."}
{"text":"If you want Cafe Zupas then take the drive over to the Eastern location. Every time I have come to the Sunset location they have messed up my order. It is so frustrating! One time I ordered soup and salad and they didn't make my salad. Each employee told me that a different employee would make it. I was right there watching and politely letting them know that no one had started it. They sent me down the line any way. I got to the cash register and there was no sign of my salad. The cash register employee got frustrated with me and told me that I should have told someone earlier! All I could do was laugh. The food is good but it's just not worth the employees. They need a bit more training."}
{"text":"We love coming to this one. This location doesn't seem to be as busy as the henderson location no matter what time we eat. Food is always fresh and service is always pretty good. The only thing I don't like (this is for the parents) is that the high chairs do not lock and they are on wheels. I always have the clean the high chair we choose. The restaurant is always clean but they should spend a little more time cleaning the high chairs. Kids spill things in odd places. Other then that. Pretty great place ."}
{"text":"So happy that Zupas is now in Chandler. I went there today for lunch with my family. It was a cold day so a hot sandwich and soup would hit the spot perfect. The sandwiches were great. The soup was barely lukewarm so that was a little disappointing. I wish they had kids drinks such as milk for my niece. There were a lot of tables that had dirty dishes on them. 

Overall great experience and I will be back. Hopefully the soup is hot next time."}
{"text":"I went to order a \"make your own salad\" and they mixed the salad with the dressing, I then asked them to add some spinach and they said they had to take out some of the lettuce if I wanted spinach.  So they were literally going to throw out lettuce, rather than keep the extra lettuce in the bowl and give it to me.   I even offered to PAY extra for the spinach and she said she could not do that.  I asked to talk to the manager and the lady who was making the salad said she was the manager and there was nothing she could do. I was so upset that my boyfriend and I left and went across the street to another restaurant.  I can see limiting the amount of chicken or toppings, but lettuce is so inexpensive that this makes no sense.  This is really a shame because my boyfriend and I have been going there for a long time and now we are too upset to eat there again."}
{"text":"Everytime we have been here the staff are friendly and curtious. We enjoy the food. Lobster bisque is always on my menu when I go here. You get a free chocolate covered strawberry with your order. They have a good sized menu and a fresh drink station. It is usually busy hen we get here so the staff have a little trouble keeping up with table cleaning but nearly bad enough to keep me away. They do a good job but it does get busy. I enjoy the Cuban and the Crab melt."}
{"text":"I had my first Cafe Zupas experience today and it may be my last. It is a very efficiently run, very economically priced restaurant and the food was decent. 

The food wasn't the problem though. When I got to the counter to pay, the young man assisting with the orders placed our two sandwiches, the bowl of soup, and a salad onto the tray. When I told him that we hadn't ordered a salad he said that we had and informed me that my wife ordered it. I looked at the salad and told him there's no way my wife would have ever ordered a salad like that. He didn't believe me and left to go find her and ask her directly. 

When the young man got back from finding my wife, who informed him that she in fact did not order a salad, there was no apology and no explanation. My order was rung up, I was given my food, and he just walked away. This ranks among the most bizarre experiences I have ever had in a restaurant of any size. If this is what passes for customer service, it's not impressive."}
{"text":"The bus/server spilt clam chowder soup on my sister and me, and got all over our hair and clothes and did not bother to call the manager. Accident occurs but it ruined our evening."}
{"text":"This place should be 5 stars across the board. Extremely affordable and healthy. I had a whole sandwich and half a salad (still a nice amount) for right under $9. I will eat there at least 2 times each week at a minimum."}
{"text":"Café Zupas is located in the plaza on eastern and serene.

This is a wonderful place to get brunch. They offer soup, salads, sandwiches, and more.
There are plenty different types of soups to choose from  such as New England Clam Chowder, Tortilla Soup, and Chicken Noodle soup. They also make various kinds of hot and cold sandwiches such as a California Turkey sandwich and more. To top if off, they offer an extensive quantity of choices when it comes to desert. They have cheesecakes, brownies, cookies, and more. 

The service is also great. When I was there, the staff was very attentive and friendly. It was my first time dining at Café Zupas and I was a little confused on how the process works. The staff was kind enough to explain how their \"cafeteria-line\" style works, so don't be overwhelmed by the amounts of dishes you have to choose from!

When it's near closing time, their desserts are half off.

Great job Café Zupas!"}
{"text":"Love this place!!  Could eat here every day. All the soups are so delicious and their salads are so yummy!"}
{"text":"Only have been once, but will definetly be back.   the service was good - maybe too over the top / bubbly, but a nice change from grumpy service people.

I did the try two combo for $7.99  - got the Ultimate grilled cheese which had cheddar & Muenster cheese with tomatos and peston.   It was greasy and delish just how a grilled cheese should be.  For my second Item I got the Vermont Maple Salad which included:
Blueberries, Apples, Cinnamon Almonds, Blue Cheese, Romaine Lettuce, and Maple Vinaigrette Dressing.    I'll be honest I licked the dressing container clean - wow that was good!

the meal came with a hunk of bread (unimpressive) and a chocolate covered strawberry.

definetly fresh, definetly tasty, definetly will be back for mor maple vinagrette dressing!

side note:  they need to change their to go boxes - the panini was so hot and they placed it in a styrofoam box which melted."}
{"text":"I order their thai mango salad and enchilada soup every time I go and it's amazing every time I eat it. the ingredients are fresh and crisp and the soup is flavorful and creamy. it's the perfect lunch! and I love that they give you a chocolate covered strawberry with your meal as a dessert. my fave!!"}
{"text":"It's always nice being able to out and eat something fresh at the same time. Zupas had some very tasty food. I had the Honey Bacon Club and the Chicken Tortilla soup and it was delicious. Plus they give you a chocolate strawberry at the end. Can't go wrong with that!

The facility was very well kept as well. Everything was clean and the staff was very friendly. I'd definitely recommend for a quick and easy lunch."}
{"text":"The only reason this place got two stars is because it looked cool and retro inside. But honestly it's well presented cheap ass cafeteria food. Don't recommend it"}
{"text":"As much as I love the food here, I can't stand that no one washes their hands. Yes, everyone wears gloves, but they clean, and take money with the gloves on and then go touch your food with the same gloves. Cleanliness is NOT top priority in this place and it is unfortunate, cuz the food is bomb."}
{"text":"Lets just say they know my order by heart aha. Food always fresh, customer service great and quick."}
{"text":"Typical fast-casual eatery.  Noisy, hectic, unpleasant.  Metal chairs make a cringy scraping noise on the polymer floor.  Horrific stun tunes blare over what sounds like a cheap boombox. This is what the dining public seems to crave, so the typical Yelper will give Zupas five stars for atmosphere.

As you walk in you are confronted by a bevy of order takers, soup getters and salad fixers doing their best to cope with the stressful conditions.  They are lined up cheek by jowl, invading each other's personal space.  Everyone's shouting, so you can't hear what's being said.  I said \"huh?\" to one and he snappishly repeated himself.  Luckily printed menus are available.  No way could I read the complicated agate type posted on the wall.  

The sparse sandwich ingredients are squeezed within crusty Ciabatta. You need a good set of choppers to blast through the slabs.  Mine was a turkey-spinach-artichoke (TSA).  There was no identifiable taste of artichoke.  Not much taste of anything for that matter.   I had a Try 2 Combo, which leaves about a cup of soup.  My New England clam chowder (with bacon) was tasty.  An extra star.

A chocolate-dipped strawberry was included with our meals.  Is this just a grand opening treat?  Will they charge for it later?

For gadget addicts, Zupas has a \"charge bar\" where you can plug in.  

Anti-mayo:  Lucinda wanted mayonnaise.  Zupas is anti-mayo.  There was none to be found anywhere on the premises.  And you shouldn't ask for mayo in an eatery that features a line of \"signature\" sandwich spreads."}
{"text":"The restaurant is very clean, bright and open, which is always a plus. They have a wide variety of soups, salads and sandwiches. The sandwiches are made to order, and they fix the salads right in front of you, there is also a variety of soups to choose from. 


I decided to get the \"pick 2 combo\" with the roasted red pepper and lobster soup and the vegetarian sandwich, they give you a huge hunk of bread for dipping, and a chocolate covered strawberry for dessert! 

The food was great- I will definitely be back to try some more good stuff!"}
{"text":"With a trendy mix of soups, salads, and sandwiches, it's hard to imagine what can go wrong. The soups are consistently good but I wouldn't describe the sandwiches or salads any better than average. There is the plus of a chocolate covered cherry that comes with every meal and if you like extra flavor in your beverages there are flavored syrups next to the sodas. 
I really wanted this place to be better, but during the day there is such a high ratio of young children to employees who can clean up after them - that it's best to wait until later to go. If you are the family looking to blend in with some excited children, then you have found the jackpot."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my visit to cafe zupas!

5/5 Customer Service

It was pretty busy when I came in but the line went by pretty fast. Their concept is pretty cool. Like a chipotle for a salad bar and you can choose sandwiches or soups. I like the pick two combo, but it's so hard to decide. The girl at the front of the line was really helpful! She had suggestions and answered all of my questions.

The food is pretty good. Healthy food, good food. They also have natural drinks which is cool! I like that they give you a piece of bread and one chocolate covered strawberry. Yumminess. Overall, good quality salad and sandwiches. My only issue was that my soup wasn't so hot when I got to eating it. But other than that, I'd definitely suggest cafe zupas!"}
{"text":"Tried Zupas today for the first time and I am hooked! Our neighbor said the place was great and we were looking for a nice salad for lunch. 

We arrived just after 11:00 am and there was no line. Wow, what a selection of  sandwiches and salads (they also had soups but it was too hot for me to eat soup).

I chose the pick two which was a whole sandwich and 1/2 salad for around $8. I had the  California turkey sandwich on ciabatta and the mango berry salad. I noticed some wonderful desserts going down the line and had to try the \"million dollar bar\".

The salad was fantastic. Lots of fresh strawberries, blueberries and mango on mixed greens with walnuts  and a mango dressing. Mmmmmm, delicious and perfect in the hot weather. The sandwich was also for very good. The bread was super fresh and soft. 

Now for that dessert. OMG. It was an oatmeal brownie loaded with coconut and chocolate chips. So moist and flavorful I could have had two. I should mention that everything is house made and you can definitely tell. All of the staff were very friendly and quickly cleared out table when we were finished. 

They also have a free selection of Italian soda syrups at the drink bar. It was fun to try a couple different combinations as well as fresh lemon and lime wedges on ice. 

I have found a new lunch spot and will be back soon. So many different items to try, I can't wait."}
{"text":"A week ago I got a Togo order and my soup bowl was half empty . I was maybe it was because it was to go . Well I am here eating and they gave me empty bowl of lettuce . I asked the girl if she could add a little more and she told me no I am putting in how much I am told . I am just letting you all know they are cutting back on how much they use to give .  If you are hungry don't go here"}
{"text":"Thai Peanut Chicken Sandwich is great. Very fresh flavors and well balanced. Very reasonably priced. Restaurant is very clean and well kept. I recommend this spot for great sandwiches, soups and salads."}
{"text":"This is a great lunch place and a quick option for fresh food.  As other reviewers have said, it is very similar to Paradise Bakery but with more choices and without that soft delicious chocolate chip cookie at the end of the meal.  They offer about 8-10 soups which is a very nice selection of soups although they don't seem to change them up much.  Their salads are creative and very fresh. I have not had a sandwich, but again the selections are too numerous to mention.  The staff is friendly and they always have people walking around clearing off the tables. They  offer desserts- creme brûlée and dessert bars.  Three of us ate for about $26 which for the portion sizes is not bad at all.  And they do include a chocolate covered strawberry with meals."}
{"text":"Soups, salads & sandwiches! You can't go wrong with these for a quick lunch or dinner. When you walk in you run into the queue area. They have a menu board for you to look at but they also have paper menus available that include a bit more item details.  I usually get a 2 item combo of soup & sandwich, sandwich & salad or soup & salad. For the soup I recently tried the tomato basil with orzo pasta. The soup was just the right temperature & tasted great! The crab avocado sandwich deserves a mention! Nice chunks of crab with avocado and a smokey cheese. Man was that good, I'm still drooling over it. The final yumminess from here is the chocolate covered strawberry! What a great way to finish a meal! 
Service is always fast! They tend to get busy over lunch hour but the table turnover is quick so you don't need to have someone save you a table. 
Fresh food, friendly service and a nice atmosphere ensures that I will be back again!"}
{"text":"This place is definitely a solid 4 star joint. I've visited this place several times and the good about it is that the place is always clean. The staff is hardworking in that they're constantly making sure everything is presentable and they are extremely nice. They definitely value customer service. They also have recharge seats, so you can charge your device while eating, which a phone-aholic like me enjoys. 
The place has never been too loud, which I definitely appreciate. 
The food is fresh. They boast about it and I believe it, however fresh doesn't always mean good. The sandwiches are average with the exception of their turkey bacon avocado which was awful. Maybe it was just that day but it was poorly made and the avocado was slimy. The only soup that stands out is the lobster bisque, I'm also not a giant soup fan, so that can be taken with a grain of salt. Their salads however will get praise from me all day. I love their salads especially with their strawberry vinegarette. 
The combination of great environment and decent food = solid 4 stars"}
{"text":"This is kind of like my go-to place when meeting the \"girls\" for lunch or a congenial business meeting.  I really love the salads and like that there is an option for a smaller size.  The chocolate covered strawberries they give out are fab and I really like all the beverage options.  The restaurant is kept very clean and the staff are quite friendly.  It is a nice place for some healthy food."}
{"text":"This is a nice place that serves some mighty tasty and healthy foods fast.  The Very Berry Salad I had was fantastic.  The hubby had the soup and sandwich combo and loved it.  Larger portions than most places like it.  Very pleasant staff."}
{"text":"Overpriced and small portions. On this particular trip, the employees all seemed miserable. Ordered a large soup and the container was filled only just past the halfway point. There are much better options around to get your soup/salad/sandwich fix."}
{"text":"Yikes a business trip with a 3 day class and two exams.  NO FUN!  We should be out checking out the city but NO we were stuck inside.  So for my first lunch on my business trip and I wanted something different.  My co-workers was game for anything so I picked this place after I put the bug in there ear that we should eat somewhere NOT in SoCal.

We were lucky and there was a HUGE shopping center across from the resort so we drove over because across the street in AZ is not all that close and it was 90 plus degrees out with 100% humidity.  Not good walking conditions.  

When we walked in the place had a nice size lunch crowd. There were only a couple people in front of us so that gave of a little time to peruse the menu.  We came at the right time because about 5 mins later the line grew long.  Apparently this is a hot place to go for lunch.

We all decided to do a soup and sand or soup and salad.  Each mean came with a chocolate covered strawberry which I gave away because I don't do chocolate.  I wish they had other options instead of the chocolate covered strawberry.  Not everyone like or eats chocolate.  A couple of my co-eaters got the dessert of chocolate cake or cheese cake which they loved.

So when you so the 2-fer meal deal you save money and you get a drink.  I got the half salad half sand.  It was quite filling and they don't skimp on the food. You cane choose any salad you want and they prepare it right in front of you.  This is the point where you can add extra this or that or have they take off something.  

We all paid and found a seat.  There is plenty both inside and out.  We choose inside to avoid the heat.  The service was really quite god as well as the food.  FRESH and FLAVORFUL for a fast foodie type place.  It sort of reminded me of a Corner bakery or Panera but you can see them preparing your food and get it before you go take a seat.  They have lots of options for all eating types which is a plus when you're a group of people that have different eat habits.  It was a good place to come for lunch but the food is pretty standard.

I would definitely come here again when in town."}
{"text":"Being the soup lover that I am, I totally love this place! If you going during the typical business lunch hour, don't be alarmed by the long line, they work through it at an impressive rate and the staff is always friendly. There are at least two staff members walking around on the floor cleaning up to make sure there are always clean dining tables for guests. 

My favorite soup they have is the roasted red pepper with lobster, followed up by the mushroom or Wisconsin cheese soup. The best part is you get a chocolate covered strawberry with every meal. Love it!"}
{"text":"We hadn't been to cafe zupas for quite a while and I couldn't figure out why till today. Both my boyfriend and I asked for a large salad which I received but he did not. They rushed us to the front to pay and now I wish we would've stayed to watch them make the salads. Our salads lacked ingredients and flavor and I can't believe we payed $14 for them. The one star is half for customer service (the employees were actually kind) and the other half for the chocolate covered strawberries that came with our salads. Now I remember why we stopped going and will never go again."}
{"text":"Stumpled upon Cafe Zupas through a recommendation of a coworker.  I was so pleasantly surprised by so many things about this place.  First, I had the strawberry harvest salad and it was delicious!  I sort of did a -make your own -version of it because I didn't like all the ingredients that came in it and so - no problem- I had them add a few others instead.  The dressing they used was a sort of strawberry vinaigrette and it was really terrific.  

They have a huge selection of salads, soups and sandwiches.  Today I stuck with the soup and salad but would definitely try a sandwich at my next visit.  The soup I had was the cauliflower and it too was good. 

One thing that I really appreciated at this location was the charging stations set up so you can eat while charging any phone/tablet device.  I thought this was very clever!

Service was great and the restaurant was brightly and cheerfully decorated.  I can't wait to go back and will add this to my arsenal of favorite lunch places."}
{"text":"Amazing food for reasonable price!!  I had the soup and Sammie combo.  Crab avocado melt panini with wild mushroom bisque soup.  They let you try any of their soups....the lobster bisque and clam chowder were really good too.  I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We were greeted at the door and he gave us suggestions on the menu and his favorites. The employees were really happy and cheery and I loved the free sample on soup so I didn't have to hope I got a good one. The deal they have for 8.95 was wonderful. I got the mango berry salad=awesome! And the red pepper lobster soup. Everything tasted great and was really cheap. Go there!"}
{"text":"Such an easy place to go for a quick healthy meal. Unfortunately myself and my mom felt like our soups were watered down and didn't have much in them. She ordered the new Salmon chowder and didn't get any salmon chunks and I ordered the mushroom bisque and only had 3-4 mushrooms, whereas at the Eastern location this bisque was bursting with mushrooms and the broth was much thicker and flavorful. I would recommend the mango berry salad. It's my go to and it's hard to mess up a salad!"}
{"text":"We love this place. It is like a much better version of Panera Bread Co. There you leave hungry, here you leave full.  Love the combos. My favorite is the pulled pork and today I got the chicken enchilada chili soup.  It was really good.

What makes it even better is the staff.  I have been there 5 times and each and every time the people working there were great.  And it wasn't as if it seemed forced.  All the people seem to genuinely enjoy working there.  From the people taking orders, to the people cleaning up, to the lady cleaning tables.  Even the girl at the front door explaining things to new customers 1000 times seemed liked she was having a blast.  For the overall experience, I think it is the best quick bite place in Vegas"}
{"text":"The perfect place, if you're looking to eat like a rabbit!
I came here for the first time today for lunch to meet up with a coworker. The quality of the food was good, the workers were friendly, and the place was clean. BUT the amount of chicken on my salad was maybe 2ozs at most! I went back to the office still hungry and ate a pack of tuna for some protein."}
{"text":"Not impressed - perfect for a soup and salad place but they are missing service, content of a protein bowl shouldn't consist of mostly kale and bowl of soup to go should come filled to the top"}
{"text":"I've been  to this location many times but today I wasn't happy with my experience..I ordered Togo and when I got home there was no meat on my Italian..I call and talk to the manager she tells me to come back and it would be remade. I drive all the the back and when I walk up to the register the cashier looks at me and says are you the Italian ...the girl yells out I need another Italian on the fly and  I ask her to remake my salad as well since it's been 30 already driving back and forth and now it's old..so I get the new order and they have forgotten the bread and the chocolate strawberry...they also forgot to apologize. Looks like they dropped the ball again ..both my sandwiches I ordered today were missing ingredients..obviously the workers don't know the menu..the food is too expensive to not get the order right ..strawberries didn't look good today either ..I picked them off my salad because they looked gross .."}
{"text":"Love Zupas! Hate this location! 
  Terrible service from multiple employees in one night. We were giving lukewarm soup and denied our request for a new much warmer soup. This location has employees with such attitude issues. Strongly recommend not going to this locations as well as bring it to their attention as this continues."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed, and I can't even say it's because of the food. On a recent trip when ordering a sandwich, I had asked for them to leave some of the items off (which mind you they weren't going to charge me less for) and asked to add bacon. They young lady working then told me that they can't add anything to their sandwiches, that \"it's a new corporate policy.\" Mind you this is the sandwich that I'm paying for. So I asked for a side of bacon instead, to which she said she wouldn't provide that either, that if anything she could maybe charge me for some of the bacon bits used for the salad. I asked to speak to a manager, which she said she was, with an attitude. I decided to leave since I dont like paying for food that I won't enjoy, and as I left some other employee walked over to the girl helping us, presumably to ask why we were leaving, to which they both giggled. Someone should remind their corporate that they don't pay me to eat their food, and thanks to their employee and 'manager' I won't be back."}
{"text":"Best sandwiches, soup, and salad around. I crave their turkey spinach artichoke sandwich daily and for soup the Wisconsin cauliflower is one of a kind. The service is excellent and all ingredients are made from scratch they say and you can taste it. Definitely a keeper."}
{"text":"I moved from Utah here where we have known for a long while of the greatness of cafe Zupas. I have never had anything here I have not been crazy about. My favs are Wisconsin cauliflower soup, lobster bisque for soups for salads Cherry Balsamic and protein Cobb, and for sandwich the turkey spinach artichoke. I am drooling right now thinking about all options. Such a healthy awesome alternate to others in the area. Fast but you feel great after eating there. Plus you get your chocolate strawberry that comes free with meal. So glad they opened up in this area and definitely worth going... And going again"}
{"text":"Came here to just pick up a lunch for our son who wanted their clam chowder.  The place was clean but not busy at all.  We were greeted very nicely.  We ordered the kids meal which came with a cup of soup, a cup of fruit (grapes & mandarin oranges) and we were able to pick between a chocolate covered strawberry or a slice of bread to go with the soup.  Of course the little man chose the strawberry.  It also came with a small drink, too.  Their clam chowder, I tasted, was pretty good - nice amount of clams in there.  I'd definitely come back to try out their 'adult\" meals of sandwiches and salads.  The only odd thing was that they must have been overstaffed - as there were about 6 employees sitting in a booth and table right by the soda machine eating and hanging out."}
{"text":"I really like Cafe Zupas. Great soups, among other things. Their Veggie sandwich is very good."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to a Cafe Zupas and I have to say it is decent for what it is.

I wasn't in love with my panini and neither was my mom so I will probably steer clear of those in the future and just stick to regular sandwiches, soups and salads.

My mushroom bisque was delightful. Creamy and rich with the right amount of mushrooms. I would come back just for soup when I'm in the mood again.

The only thing I didn't care for was the restaurant layout. All the chairs ere huddled so closely together it made it pretty difficult for people to navigate around the restaurant since there was no clear path to the ordering line, trash or drink station. Everyone kept bumping into one another and it became quite irksome. Since they just recently opened I'm sure these are small tweaks that can be made to improve as they learn. 

The staff is all very new as well and it was slightly more difficult to order than it should've been given the fact that I had to repeat my order three separate times as I moved down the line. Might be a little easier if I could just say it once and someone could write it down. Not too hard for ordering one item but when I was trying to remember what everyone in my party wanted every time I had to repeat the entire order it became harder to recall with each subsequent interaction. 

Otherwise a decent quick eat spot for bites on the go."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Hated always going to a lot of the other similar places! I never get tired of their soups and salads! Love that they give a chocolate covered strawberry with every meal! The only down fall would be that there isn't enough food with the kids meal, almost have to order 2. Or at least have the option to add on more or upgrade the kids meal."}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place! I CANNOT wait for the location in Summelin to open up! Everytime I visit i've tried something new. I always get the sandwich/salad combo! The salads are nice portions and they give you a whole sandwich, slice of bread and a choc covered strawberry. Service is quick and friendly. Salads always taste fresh and sanwiches are delicious! And for 7.99 the combo is sooo worth it! You can also mix in syrup flavors into your soda.  I can't get enough of this place!"}
{"text":"What is there not to like about this place? Healthy, fresh, reasonably priced food, workers are so upbeat and the establishment is always kept clean. I mean how could you not want to return. And may I just add the chocolate covered strawberry is just an icing to the cake. I've gone with numerous friends and even got my boyfriend turned on to them and I've never had anyone complain. If you are every in the area and in need of a healthy meal cause this place is surrounded by fast food joints, stop by and try their soup, salads and sandwiches. They even have a combo option which will leave your wallet full as well as your stomach."}
{"text":"One of my favorite quick places to eat that I've found in Vegas! I'm obsessed with the cauliflower soup and unique, homemade salad dressings-and the fact you get a free chocolate covered strawberry with your meal. Plus the portions are so big I usually get 2 meals out of it. My only complaint is the price for the build your own salad is a little too high for how they skimp on the ingredients. They charge you for every little thing, I guess to compensate for the free chocolate covered strawberry ha"}
{"text":"Seen this place many times but never tried it until my daughter suggested it.

Very similar to a Paradise Bakery which they serve Sandwich, Soup, Salads and Dessert.

Tried the 2 Combo which was a sandwich and soup. Food was pretty good. 

Nice and clean place, nothing really knocked my socks off."}
{"text":"Over priced place ! You will get a better deal at sweet tomatoes. Charge me for everything separately when menu says combo prices skip this place."}
{"text":"After a late night we stopped by Cafe Zupas on our way home. The restaurant was incredibly clean and the staff was delightful. However we received our food right after ordering and both hot sandwhiches  and soup were lukewarm at best. The only thing that came out hot were my son's chicken strips. 

While prices were reasonable the temperature of the food made it almost inedible."}
{"text":"Everything I've tried at Cafe Zupas has been great, but the Ultimate Grilled Cheese is a stand out. The pesto sauce they use on a few of their sandwiches is the best. As for soups: Cauliflower, White Bean, Mushroom, and Lobster Bisque are all amazing! Their product is always fresh. It's nice to have a go-to healthy option in the neighborhood, only downfall is it's closed on Sunday. The chocolate covered strawberry that they give to everyone is the perfect dessert."}
{"text":"I got take out from here today and based on the service and given how excited I was about the food, I was ready to give a solid 4-star review. It was a little chaotic and loud in there, but employees were efficient and friendly. 

And then I got home and opened my sandwich and was like whaaaat? It was SO small. Maybe it wasn't really all that small but it was in a really big box which maybe made it look smaller. Even if the bread wasn't small, the sandwiches are verrrrry thin with not a whole lot of filling. 

I had the crab avocado melt and was so disappointed to find they use imitation crab. I suppose I should have expected that since places that serve real crab tend to advertise as such, but the description says \"House-Made New England Crab Salad, Avocado, Bacon, Celery, Red Onions, Tomatoes, & Muenster Cheese\" - nowhere does it say they use imitation crab. It was about half as thick as the image on the website. 

I had the clam chowder soup, which had good thick chunks of potato, but was more watery than I like. The container was not full. 

When my boyfriend opened his box with his turkey bacon avocado sandwich, he literally said \"what? it's so small!\" He finished it in just a few bites. 

I am happy to pay a little extra for fresh, real ingredients, even with small serving sizes, which is why I'm not saying anything like \"Boy, 5 bucks sure goes a lot farther at Subway!\" However, if I'm going to pay that little extra, they should at least warn you about the imitation crab!"}
{"text":"Three stars, because the food is good. I like that it's fresh and made to order. Otherwise, this location runs out of ingredients often, which means I always have to substitute. They offer an entire fountain of diet soda, as if it's healthier; (it's not) and their \"Don't Save Your Seat\" signs are off-putting. I want to like this place more, but I think it would be better if I just got my food to go, since that's the only thing I like about it."}
{"text":"Usually a great place to eat... tonight my Veggie and Quinoa soup literally has no quinoa in it, none, and it's so watered down and has no flavor like normally.  Sodas were flat as well I also suggest you update the cost of your restaurant it was $50 for a family of 4 nothing crazy or extra(no dessert) just salads and soup we could have gone to Claim Jumper. Boo!"}
{"text":"There have been few fast food experiences that I have ever sitting there savoring every bite as the meal I just had here.  Top notch.  Ordered pulled pork sandwich and had their chicken enchilada chili soup.   Amazing.   All ingredients were as fresh as I have ever had.  Came with chocolate covered strawberry and a side piece of bread.  Whole meal was under 20 dollars for two soups and two drinks and a sandwich.   If you have not been you are missing out.  AMAZINGLY DELICIOUS.  I have found a new favorite.  In fact we are ordering more to go it was so good and getting dessert.   Love it."}
{"text":"If you want a sub par meal and customer experience then you should come here. I used to love Zupas but the last few times I have gone the food has not been up to standard as well as their workers. The workers used to be very lively, happy. Now you feel like you're getting food in prison. Also the restaurant was not that busy yet practically every table was filthy. Disappointed in Zupas. Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"I was seriously overwhelmed when I walked into this place. For some reason, I thought it was a sit down restaurant. Nope. It's like Panera meets Chipotle for soups, salads, and sandwiches.

A friend and I both got the combo thingy, full sandwich and 1/2 soup or salad. There were tons of options, so it's easy to find something everyone likes. I ended up with the HBC (honey bacon club) sandwich and summer chicken salad. The HBC was smaller than I thought but actually filling. It was a panini and came out super fast, warm, and was melty & cheesy. The salad was also yummy, refreshing, and a larger portion than I thought. It was hard finishing both items, but I got them down without feeling like I hated my life. 

I did notice there were tons of people behind the counter. Like, TONS. There was a person to hand my food to the other person to hand the food to the cashier. I have no idea if it's because the place is so new and everyone is in training, but I thought it was a bit overwhelming. There was a also a \"touch screen & recharge\" station in the restaurant for you to charge your electronic devices and such. Not sure if that fit in with the whole image of the restaurant, but I can see how it's functional for busy business people who want a quick lunch.

All in all, it was overwhelming but I'd go back. There were tons of choices, tons of people working, but tons of seating and the tables turned around quickly. Notably thought, there are only 2 bathroom stalls in the women's restroom. But $10 for a decent sized and tasty lunch isn't bad. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Loved this place. I had a delicious made to order salad with home made dressing and a delicious soup. Every employee I interacted with was super friendly. They clearly love coming to work, which is not something you see often."}
{"text":"I live so close to Cafe Zupas and pass it all the time and finally decided to stop in and give it a try- I'm glad I did! It's definitely affordable. I got a huge piña colada salad and turkey cranberry sandwich with a bit of italian bread and a chocolate dipped strawberry for around $8.
I would recommend the turkey cranberry sandwich- it's fresh and crunchy with the cucumbers and sprouts. They went a little heavy on the cranberry spread, but it wasn't overly sweet or anything so it was fine.
I wouldn't really recommend the piña colada salad though- it had components I enjoy but it wasn't the greatest together. I generally like my salad dressings to have a little kick or tang to them, but the dressing was faintly sweet, not that flavorful and had this really unappealing creamy-but-clear consistency.
I sampled the Wisconsin cauliflower soup- tasted really great but if you're a textural person and prefer smoother soups, be warned, it's a little gritty almost.
The chocolate covered strawberries are amazing- you can't really go wrong with that. I definitely will try the desserts next time (creme brulee everything!) and I'll be back- for the price, you can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"I've visited Zupas a couple of times and this quick and easy place is hard to beat for a quick lunch or easy dinner! With a fantastic selection of sandwiches, soups and salads..all at super reasonable prices ($7.99 for half soup and salad, but are big portions) it's hard to go wrong. The service has always been great, usually above and beyond what you get in any fast, casual restaurant. They greet you at the door and usually someone thanks you for your business as you leave and they make sure your meal was up to your satisfaction. Also, with every meal you get a free chocolate covered strawberry and their soda bar is great! Lots of flavors to create your own custom blend drink and I'm a sucker for a vanilla, diet coke!  The only think I've learned is to request easy dressing on my salad or get it on the side. They can really add too much and kill your diet if you're not careful."}
{"text":"Delicious salad and sandwiches. Had the avocado and crab sandwich and berry salad. It was just the right amount to split with my friend. Nice atmosphere with bright colors and lots of big windows and cozy booth seating. My new favorite lunch spot when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Cafe Zupas is one of my personal favorite places for lunch. Every item on the menu is made fresh every day and in house. The service is impeccable. Each and every employee greats with you a smile and is great at what they do.
The soups make me weak in the knees. And when  I am looking for a great place to sit from the overwhelming flavor I always choose a spot on the outdoor patio."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff, great selection, very reasonable prices. The ambience is very hip, modern and clean. I love the pick 2. There isn't any up charge for specific sandwiches, soups, or salad which is the best part. I will definitely return when I'm in the area. Definitely left a good first impression on me. Nice job Cafe Zupas!"}
