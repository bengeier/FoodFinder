{"text":"I had the luxury of having The Nosh Box Food Truck parked at my work during my lunch break a couple weeks ago and i just have to say that their food is AMAZING! Their food all seems to be based on American classics with a chef's flair- which is perfect for me since i'm not a fan of spicey or overly seasoned foods.   I had the Twisted Turkey Sandwich (w/out the onions since i don't care for them) and it was to die for!  The fresh carved turkey was perfectly tender and juicy and the cranberry aioli gave just the right amount of added flavor while still letting the taste of the turkey take center stage.  And don't even get me started on the Rosemary Tots... I think i may need to seek professional help for my addiction to those yummy little fried potatoes all coated in delicious, fresh, flavorful rosemary.  YUMMMMM!!!!     And the service was top notch. The workers were all super nice, polite (even during my radical request to change their perfect-just-the-way-it-is food), and they legimately seemed like they were enjoying themselves which i think makes for a great atmosphere :)  The only thing I'd like to see different is the option to have your tots unsalted.  I'm not a fan of salt (or the bloating that comes with it) so even though the tots were only lightly salted and it didn't affect the flavor negatively, i'd still like to see the option to get them without.     Overall,  I've tried a few other trucks now (that i will be reviewing one by one in my spare time) and i have to say that The Nosh Box is definitely my favorite Cleveland area food truck!"}
{"text":"I recently had the chicken flatbread and the chicken was so dry it was actually hard on the edges.  I also had the seafood tacos and they were good but not worth the price.   Very expensive for truck food.  $8 each for the chicken taco and flatbread and $12 for seafood taco.   Not sure if they jacked up the prices for this event but it is IMHO too expensive for the quality.  Sorry guys."}
{"text":"Like Jason, I picked up some NoshBox today... Flatbread Chicken and a side of the Rosemary Tots...  The FB Chicken was divine... char-grilled chicken chunks with charred red peppers and onions on a semi-sweet flatbread.  Topped with melted cheese and a sweet-yet-tangy ranch-ish sauce.  WINNER!  I had my Tots to-go, so they were also a bit mushy when opened at the office... such is the fate that befalls many a fried item.  My only request is that NB offer a half-side of Tots for $2.00 (or even $3.00),.. the $4.00 tots were a bit much in quantity and price when ordered with a sandwich.  PS:  Next time NoshBox offers their fish hoagie... get it!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and it is in the top echelon of food trucks in Cleveland. Not necessarily healthy or terribly inexpensive, but sinfully delicious. I can recommend both the Doublewide (mac and cheese with bacon sandwich) and the Birdie burger. Well done on both counts."}
{"text":"I was late to the party for my first Walnut St Wednesday - I had a taste for tacos and order the shrimp tacos. The shrimp was cooked well and had that perfectly grilled flavor. I would suggest a little less cumin. It was a little pricy at $10."}
{"text":"Had the Nosh Box come and serve food for our wedding. We selected 3 entrees- chicken flatbread, pierogi hoagie, and double wide mac and cheese sandwiches. (Tater tots and baked beans as sides)   I tried a little bit of every sandwich, and they were all phenomenal! ALL my guests were raving about the food, most had never seen a food truck before. Homemade pierogis were amazing (coming from a polack), chicken flatbread was seasoned just right, and the mac and cheese sandwich was the best grilled cheese you'll ever have.  Without a doubt I will seek out this food truck again around Cleveland. I would hire them again all over without hesitation."}
{"text":"Visited The Nosh Box at the 2012 opening of Walnut Wednesdays.  The Ribeye Sandwich (marinated Angus ribeye with caramelized onions and horseradish aioli on a roll) was excellent--definitely one of the better things I've had from any food truck (albeit also one of the most pricey at $10).   The Rosemary Tater Tots were a disappointment:  There was plenty of rosemary, but the tots had become rather mushy and not worth $4 for the side.  All in all, I still look forward to future visits to The Nosh Box for that tasty ribeye sandwich."}
{"text":"Loved this food truck!  Actually I don't get food from food trucks too often... not a fan of the lines, somewhat higher prices and hanging around outside if it's hot.  But I figured I would give this one a try; and I must say it has kinda changed my mind about all the reasons I didn't go to food trucks previously.  I purchased the vegetable wrap and some fries.  Usually a veggie wrap isn't enough to fill me up, hence the fries.  So when my order was complete and I was handed both, I was quite surprised at just how MUCH food I was given.  Could I eat all this?  I sat down and worked on that issue.  Calling this thing a wrap perhaps do it justice.  It's actuall a huge, thick and grilled flatbread topped with yummy hummus, massive grilled vegetable chunks, and perhaps another sauce I can't quite remember.  I just remember the delicious journey involved as I ate this (relatively) healthy beast of a wrap.    The only problem I encountered with my meal was not knowing what I liked better; the fries or the wrap.  I finished both fries and wrap, and loved whatever seasoning/oil the fries were cooked in.  All in all, the best veggie wrap I've ever had in addition to some darn good fries.  Overall kinda pricey... overall for a lunch, $7 for the wrap and $3 for the fries.  So not something I'd get every day... plus, I doubt it's all around great health food.  But hope this food truck comes to my job more often, and I'll perhaps be inspired to not pack lunch as much."}
{"text":"Finally got to eat at Nosh today.  I have heard this was one of the better food trucks...Now I agree.  Portion Meets Price point.  I do say the speed of pass leaves more to be desired.  This however has been common to all food trucks I've dined with so far.  The food is American fare with an artistic chefy twist.  I would definitely come back.  Today I had chicken fajita taco...great seasoninings, good porition.  That's all I had, the fried bologna was calling me but my healthy food choice won out for today.  Wish it was Greek yogurt opposed to sour cream on the taco...but that's another blog   p.s. its cash only, kind of a drawback"}
{"text":"Had a chance to check out the Nosh Box when they stopped in Mayfield Village today. Had a very fresh and flavorful hummus vegan wrap with fresh veggies and caramelized onions. It was fantastic! And I was also happy to learn that they grill their veggies separately so there's no meaty contamination. Hooray!   Carnivores - there's plenty of grub for you. I overheard people talking about the seafood tacos and the other grub, and everyone seemed more than pleased. I also saw people digging into what appeared to be a macaroni and cheese sandwich - a la Melt's Mighty Macaroni Melt. (one of my favorite sandwiches on the planet)   Look forward to trying more of their food in the future and wish them success on the mean streets of CLE."}
{"text":"I am happy that the Nosh Box still makes its rounds during the wintertime.  Their chicken flatbread was not really a flatbread - more of a wrap - it had too much sauce for my taste and they should have warmed up their veggies.   I've also tried their apple empanada, which tasted to me kind of like a toaster strudel.  That being said, I've had a very tasty burger (the Namor burger) from this food truck once as well as some pretty decent tater tots."}
{"text":"Delicious and great prices too!  Don't miss the shrimp tacos, chicken panini or grilled cheese mac and cheese.  Love this truck!"}
{"text":"Food trucks have been in the fight of their life with cleveland. They need good spots to sell. I am student downtown at tri-c's hospitality campus. After class walked over to the beat and end. Though I had never heard of their truck just Umami and Hodge Podge I decided to go with them. Their menu was more street fair. Sandwhiches and finger foods. Easier to carry and eat. Boy was it good. I think food trucks are what cleveland needs. Sometimes in our busy life it can be hard to make time to go visit that new restaurant three cities over but with food trucks they bring the food to you. See you around town nosh box."}
