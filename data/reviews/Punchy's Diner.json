{"text":"Food is good diner food. It all has to do with your expectations. We have had breakfast and now lunch here, and were very pleased both times. Fried chicken is great! Service good, pretty clean. Decor is all old style diner with vintage cars and dated decor. Fifties music playing."}
{"text":"Never had a meal here, I come for the ice cream!  They get their ice cream from a Gastonia place called Tony's and it is homemade!  You can't beat the chocolate shake!  You'll be hooked!  The servers at the counter and register attendants are always delightful and helpful. I'm usually asked by no less than 2-3 servers if I have been helped while waiting for them to prepare my milkshake. These ladies are as great as the ice cream!"}
{"text":"What an adorable diner. Unlike most diners it is clean, bright and nicely decorated. It follows a fifties theme with lots of classic cars painted on the wall and a few models on display. It's a great place for families. They have several arcade games and a nice ice cream display case.   This was my first time visiting Punchey's. I heard that the service was good, so maybe my expectations were too high. Our waitress was polite, but she wasn't very engaged. We had to pull recommendations out of her.   We decided to split the chicken box (one of their staples): 8 pieces of fried chicken, two pints of fixins (sides) and dinner rolls for $13.99. We ordered white meat, fried squash and fried okra. It was a nice portion for the price. The chicken was prepared PERFECTLY! It was crispy, golden brown and very flavorful. I love the way it was seasoned. The sides were just okay (but in all fairness I'm not a big fan of okra). The rolls were also underwhelming. They were the same heat and serve rolls that you can get from the grocery store.   Overall, we were pleased with the experience, mostly because of how  good the chicken was. Stop by if you're in the area and definitely try the fried chicken!"}
{"text":"Love this place!! Breakfast is fantastic. Our kids love it as well. Prices are great, service good, large portions and most of all, supporting a local business owner. Stop in, you will not regret it!"}
{"text":"My wife and I had lunch yesterday at Punchy's and we both agreed our food was great and exceeded our expectations. The service was very good and the waitress was friendly. We highly recommend Punchy's for good food and service. The banna pudding is awsome."}
{"text":"Great place. Great wait staff. Terrible food. We've been coming here since they opened. Today our family had dry chicken tenders. Great onion rings. Soggy fries. 6 oz burger special that was not a handmade burger. Looked n tasted like a pre-made burger. Great okra. Watery fish that tasted like frozen then cooked.     Please go back to fresh food!!!  Yuck on the no taste frozen."}
{"text":"Not sure where the \"rave\" reviews came from. Typical diner fare, typical diner atmosphere. Our food wasn't  great - it was ok. Large portions like most reported. But large portions are negligible when the food is just meh. S.O liked the cool, retro cars. Our server was warm and friendly."}
{"text":"This was a great find, we had family and friends with us.  The waitress was funny and spot one with our orders, plates were close to being cleaned but portions were very large.  Anytime you can stop in an enjoy a perfect breakfast out with the family is great but this place added a great memory for us."}
{"text":"The food was great and at a very reasonable price. I had the breakfast burrito and my husband had the hash brown scramble. Both were huge portions and very tasty. Friendly people and a nice local spot."}
{"text":"So we walked in at 8:45pm &  then realized that they close at 9. I asked the girl if it was too close to closing to order dinner.  The girl said with a big smile, \"No way! We don't close until 9!  Come on in here, and I'll take good care of you!\" ...and that she did! We had ice cold sweet tea in seconds and nice juicy cheese burgers with hot crisp fries in front of us shortly thereafter. She kept our tea glasses full and kept a watchful eye on our needs as she whizzed around doing her closing duties. We never felt rushed or in the way like other places when it gets close to locking up. We will definitely hit Punchy's up again!"}
{"text":"Came for breakfast and it was below par. Waffle House is cheaper and food is better. I ordered scrambled eggs with cheese and it seemed like the cheese was an after thought because is was a slice of cheese just folded in the middle of my eggs and not melted. The bacon tasted as if they had cooked a lot of it earlier that morning and left it sitting under a heat lamp.   The service was ok. They were really busy (it was a Saturday morning) and seemed understaffed. Won't be back for a second visit."}
{"text":"The food was good but Luke warm of 4 breakfasts 3 were not very warm.   Too bad as the place was really neat and busy.  Huge pancakes but the butter wouldn't melt."}
{"text":"I eat breakfast there once a week and it's awesome. Love the food and the atmosphere. Need to visit if you haven't been."}
{"text":"Excellent food & service!  Portions are HUGE!  This was our first time here and we would definitely come back when coming through town. A nice find and alternative to the chain breakfast places."}
{"text":"Our first time here, came for breakfast. Pancakes were very good and large serving, bacon cooked to perfection and egg omelet was delic. The prices were right and service was great. Atmosphere was ok..but def would come back for good food/great price."}
{"text":"Great pickle chips. Mashed potatoes tasted like they came from a box. Grilled chicken was good. Burgers were good. Mozzarella sticks delicious. Club sandwich was ok. Fries were not good. Great staff!! Waitress was very sweet!!"}
{"text":"I am rating this 3 stars for one reason, the food.  The service is awesome and the decor was amazing.  The food was restaurant quality.  I got bacon, eggs, potatoes, and toast and my man got chicken fried steak with grits and eggs and a biscuit.  Not bad, but nothing exciting, although to be fair we went for breakfast and as far as I am concerned, breakfast is pretty straight forward.  I would recommend this place, but not insist.  There seemed to be a lot of locals there which is always a good sign."}
{"text":"I've been going to Punchys for several years now.  Every time I've eaten there it's been great.  The burgers totally satisfy your craving and the Chicken Fried Chicken is very tasty.   The serving sizes are more than plentiful. I can't attest to the breakfast menu here but I know several others that can.    It's also decorated with enough kitsch to make you feel like 1955 vomited in there, for those of you that like that sort of thing."}
{"text":"The folks do the best breakfast in town the pancakes out of this world I added blueberry to mine the staff is kind an love waiting on you . It's worth waiting if they are busy. They move you in pretty quick ."}
{"text":"We were in the area staying at Great Wolf Loge for a night and found Punchy's when searching for a good lunch spot.    I would say this is a local joint, for sure.  We traveled down from Maine and the kids were keeping track of all the states they saw on license plates along the way.  At a hotel in Virginia, we saw Illinois and California for instance.  However no such luck at Punchy's.  About 80 cars with North Carolina plates and 1 with a Maine plate, ours.  We saw no other states in the parking lot.   The place was packed when we arrived.  It was Sunday so I think we ran into the Church crowd.  Even though they were mobbed, we had a very short wait and got our food quickly.    The food was great and the price even better.  4 solid meals for $30.  My son got scrambled eggs and sausage and we had to tell him about 8 times to slow down on the eggs.  He LOVED them.  Everyone was very happy but the rest of us ate at a more moderate pace :).   We are planning to go back for breakfast in the morning.    It doesn't seem like Punchy's needs the help but if you are in the area, stop in and see them."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best places in Concord. Huge serving sizes. Best fried pickles. Onion rings are incredible. If you like ranch dressing I could drink it. The staff is super friendly and awesome. I will be back."}
{"text":"Punchy's Diner actually fries eggs perfectly to order.  \"What's the big deal?\", you ask?  Fast food done right is a dying art, and every time I've visited, they nailed it.    Prices are great as is the food (4 a diner).  Nothing upscale here:  just old school, honest, gut-busting, good food with smiling staff and clean facilities.  Hard to do much better in Concord than Punchy's!"}
{"text":"Good food and friendly service!  I've eaten lunch with a friend before here and found it to be a good place.  I had breakfast this morning - good pancakes!"}
{"text":"Amazing place! Great food, prices and service. We eat here all the time. Breakfast served until 2pm. I don't even like pancakes but theirs are so good and moist."}
{"text":"Really pleasant visit. The staff was friendly. The waitress was very attentive. And they have a good menu of breakfast staples. We weren't made to feel rushed even on a busy Sunday morning. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"I love coming here for breakfast! They have good food for a reasonable price. I enjoy the traditional American atmosphere, and the staff are always friendly.   And their pancakes are HUGE!!"}
{"text":"Our first time there today. Hubby had the most amazing pancake! Out of this world! It was a bacon pancake. We're all going back next weekend and we're all ordering one each. Wow!"}
{"text":"I love Punchy's. I have been 4 or 5 times for lunch with co-workers, but this visit was on a Sunday with my Wife and Daughter. The females in my house can eat breakfast anytime of day or night. Me? Nope. Breakfast for me ends around 8 AM, then the countdown to lunch begins. Now don't get me wrong, I can do lunch at 10 or 11. Or 2 or 3. I just can't do breakfast past breakfast time.   So what did I order at Punchy's? A double bacon cheeseburger and fries, because it was lunch time. My Wife ordered the Hungry Man plate, which is strange because the last time I checked she wasn't a man. Although it's been awhile, maybe I need to check again. My Daughter ordered a double stack of pancakes with blueberries and chocolate chips.   When the waitress delivered our meal, I knew what to expect, because I had dined at Punchy's before. My girls were amazed at the serving size, especially how large the pancakes were. My burger was great, the fries crunchy, the slaw tangy. Oh and the Diet Coke was tremendous. The Hungry Man plate was made up of eggs, bacon, sausage, 2 pancakes and a large bowl of grits. Wow, she had to be a hungry man to finish all of that. Now I'm beginning to worry. Alex loved her pancakes and grits. She really loved them. Will we go back? Oh yeah, we will go back. And btw, cool cars, toys and knick knacks from the 50's and 60's too."}
{"text":"The star of this place for me was service.  However, the sweetest service ever couldn't distract me from my disappointment with the food.  Everything tastes like it came out of a can.  It's got a very \"over-processed\" theme.  I had chicken fried steak, green beans and potato wedges.  The meat was very greasy, the green beans had no flavor at all, and the potatoes were dry and overcooked.  So, for country style food I'd stick to Cracker Barrel.    We didn't complain to our sweet waitress, we just ate what we could and headed out.  I don't think this a \"bad\" place, it's just not to our taste."}
{"text":"Excellent service. Chocolate milkshakes were excellent, too. That's why they get 2 stars. We ate there for my birthday dinner as I have always enjoyed that place. However, meat in hamburger was thin, previously frozen, not thick at all or even fresh. I asked for no cheese but got a slice of American (fake) cheesefood, whether I wanted it or not, melted on so I couldn't get rid of it. The fish my husband got was in his words \"scraggly\", thin and unappealing. All in all, a very disappointing meal. We won't go there again. What a disappointment. This place used to be so good."}
{"text":"This restaurant is super CLEAN. You can look right back into the kitchen from the counter and see how spotless it is. Waitress said it is power washed every week so no built up grease. That says a lot that the owners, they care about food safety. Now, the food. You can't find better chicken anywhere , it is outstanding. We get takeout orders of their chicken box all the time and the price cant be beat. Daily specials are generally pretty good too. We eat here about once a week .. reasonably priced. When they start making soups in the fall, they are the best. especially the broccoli cheese. Other diner fares like hamburgers are pretty good too and a nice selection of salads. Sundays are packed with a line, so that tells you the food is good. Located across the street from Kmart."}
{"text":"If you are a Nostalgia buff, or one that just joys the atmosphere of a time going by then a trip through Punchy's Diner is up your alley. I have been riding by this place for quite some time in my trips up and down Route 29 in Concord, observing this unique-looking Diner with what look like two automobile is in the front window. Upon a family members visit to town, and seeking something different than some of the regular restaurants or chain locations, I suggested punchy's Diner as I knew he was a fan of diners also. Upon entering is the immediate throwback to the Happy Days television show style era. Fun seating and looking at the menu I decided on a couple of Pancakes and some fried liver mush.. my Pop decided on the breakfast special, consisting of an omelet, bacon, hash browns and some coffee. My two pancakes arrived and they were the size of the plate literally, yet light and fluffy. The liver mush, while I don't have this often, was superb, lightly crunchy, a delight to the occasional pork lovers palette... I struggled to finish the plate sized pancakes, but maned-up and finished them as they were too delicious to leave but not enough for a to go box.  A stroll through the far end of the diner revealed 2 vintage autos on display with in a glass case. While I tried to get management to allow me to gain access for a closer look I understood their policy about not allowing people to touch the vehicles as they appear to be in mint condition.. A fabulous stroll down a Time Gone by, service was spectacular and the food truly worthy of a return visit, but this time I need to be a little bit more hungry before tackling those pancakes."}
{"text":"Good solid diner.  Good food, nice portions, and fast service with very reasonable prices.  Great 50s decor."}
{"text":"Found Punchy's on Yelp and I have to stay our family was very disappointed--we walked out trying to figure out how the reviews on yelp equal the place we just visited. I don't see how it could be one in the same. First off, they weren't that busy when we arrived and had plenty of staff, yet we had to wait 15 minutes+ for a waitress to even come to our table to take our drink order. We had asked for kids menus up front and received none (nor an explanation as to why there were none). Way later the waitress arrived with some paper and crayons and said they were out of kids menus. Really? A diner? Out of kids menus? Who runs this place? So we had to order blindly for the three kids. One of our daughters ordered hashbrowns with her meal and she said they didn't taste like real potatoes. She didn't like the biscuit either--said it didn't taste like it was homemade. She didn't receive any butter, and neither did I with my waffle (which was just passable--nothing special and not real hot). For the person who said it was clean, I guess we hit an off day. The coolest part is the car collection. Service was so spotty and definitely not friendly. We won't be back. There is so so so so so much better out there. Surprised they are still open."}
{"text":"Great first experience. Enjoyed everything I ordered.   Service was friendly and punctual."}
{"text":"What a nice surprise.  Clean, great prices and good quality food, at least for breakfast.  My pancakes were overcooked but I enjoyed them anyways. The hash browns are not homemade. Our service was excellent. This was a much better dining experience than at the chains. We look forward to returning and trying other items."}
{"text":"Stopped in Sunday around 1 pm. Church crowds had the place full, but we didnt have to wait long at all. Friendly and attentive staff  Food was excellent!"}
{"text":"Very good food. Quick friendly service. Clean atmosphere. I ordered the grilled chicken entree that was everything I expected. Wasn't gourmet but it was good as others had gotten breakfast in the early am."}
{"text":"I have eaten here several times before and never been disappointed with the service or the level of food. I will rate my most recent visit.  It was one of those times where everybody was hungry, but we were all hungry for different things. My sister wanted Taco Bell (*gag*), my husband wanted Mexican or a burger, and I wanted some kind of something with buffalo wing sauce. Where did we end up? Punchy's!  We get there 20 minutes to close and we were all very tired and hungry at that point. My husband ran in to make sure even though we were close to the close of business we could still grab a quick bite to eat. The manager had no problem so we went right on in.  Our waitress was very nice given the fact we were a late table. She played with the baby and smiled the whole time we were there. She also was able to help my husband decide on something to eat since he couldn't make up his mind. Not 1 time did we feel like we were being rushed out of there, even though we stayed there well past closing.  My sister ordered a cheeseburger with bacon and fries. She is still raving about how great the burger was and wants to go back for more. My husband ordered a club sandwich on wheat with fried okra and fries. He loves his okra and had no complaints about his meal at all. I ordered a buffalo chicken sandwich, sautéed mushrooms, and fries and shared them with my daughter. My sandwich was exactly what I was looking for and our waitress even ordered the same thing for the end of her shift since she thought the idea of putting mushrooms on her sandwich was a really good idea. She loved it.  The only reason why this wasn't a 5 star rating is because we were seated right at the kitchen door and it smelled like cleaner the whole time we were sitting there and our waitress forgot our cheese sticks but she didn't make us pay for it.   If you're looking for something that everybody can enjoy, this is the place no matter what time of day. Their menu is very eclectic and they have some awesome desserts!"}
{"text":"Big portions and good price. Diner is decorated very cute. I didn't like the way the pancake tasted, not fluffy."}
{"text":"Love Punchy's! Simple delicious food and at great prices.  Friendly, fun environment and they have a showroom of vintage cars and peddle cars in the back!  50's themed and family friendly.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"On the one hand, Punchy's is old school.  As you pull up, there are often people in the lot getting ready for some sort of gathering or another.  We saw several cars that looked as if they would be at home in just about any car show, and there were a bunch of folks pulling up lawn chairs to gather around and watch them.  This is to say nothing of the gallery of what can only be described as restored toys, which would have prices that only adults can afford if they were actually to be sold.  That alone makes it worth a stop.  But on the other hand, the place itself is much newer than your old diner - the building is new, the floors are new, even the equipment looks new.  This is not an old place that has been there for years.  Or perhaps it is, and it has been retrofitted time and time again to keep up with the times.  The menu generally fits more with the old, as you will not see anything fancy on it - instead, you get some sandwiches and a few plates, nothing surprising.  Mostly the prices stay in line as well.  Service goes with the theme, too, which is nice.  About the only thing that was a little disappointing was that when we asked if their Cherry Lemon Sun Drop was made in house or if it was from the fountain, they said they made it.  Truth be told, they do - but they make it by adding a cherry drink to Sun Drop, and plopping a lemon into it, which while true, is a bit different than you might get if you go to other locations in the area.  Just something to know in advance!"}
{"text":"Don't come here expecting anything other than what it is. A small diner. Very good food. Been here twice since we moved to the area and have had wonderful service each time.  Had their fried chicken special. More than enough to fill me up and on special it was $5.   What's not to like, good food, great price and attentive service."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time today with an aunt that was visiting. Staff was very friendly, diner is very clean and well kept. We were seated as soon as we walked in and our waitress was quick to tend to us. We each got a double cheeseburger with fries and a milkshake. The burger was delicious, when I crave a good cheeseburger this is definitely a place I would go. Meat tastes very fresh and charbroiled. Fries were also good. As for the milkshake, it was a little more runny than expected with a large scoop of solid ice cream in it. But food was very good and I will definitely return again soon!"}
{"text":"Its OK the hash browns are undercooked and tasteless Philly cheese steak omelet is good coffee nasty people are nice"}
{"text":"This is the quintessential small town, Southern diner, though it may be a bit brighter, a bit cleaner, and a little less worn looking than most. Throw in that it has a cool retro 50's & 60's automobile theme, great Southern food, and was a favorite of the late, great Dale Earnhardt Sr, and you just know this is a place you need to visit.  We survived the the trek off of the road construction mess that is I-85 South in this area, through the road construction and traffic that is that part of Concord to arrive safely, if a bit fraseled, for a lunch visit here. We were nicely greeted, quickly seated, and drink and food orders followed shortly after that.  Alice selected the Chicken Fried Steak with White Gravy, Fried Okra, and Mashed Potatoes with even more white Gravy. My order was Fried Chicken, Pintos, and Fried Squash. We also picked a piece of Cornbread and a Dinner Roll to go with our meals.  The food was out in good order, and EVERYTHING was exceptional, EVERYTHING! The Chicken Fried Steak was prepared from a nice quality beef, nicely bread and cooked to a perfect outside crust, and then smothered in a delicious white, pepper gravy - perhaps the best version we've had outside the Southwest. The Mashed Potatoes were perhaps not freshly made (more of a puree than a mash) but with more of the white gravy on top, it became a moo point (as Joey would say). The Fried Okra was very well done, as well, also with a nice exterior crust.  The Fried Chicken could have come from by grandmother's kitchen - a thin crust, perfectly seasoned, perfectly cooked. The Pinto's were as well seasoned as any you'll find, and the Fried Squash gave no quarter. The bread choices were nice, but not at the same level of quality as the other dishes.  The food was exactly what you want from a diner, the service was very nice, and the pricing was more than reasonable. Can't wait to return, they have a huge seafood platter I've gotta try. Might even try Dale's favorite - a sliced tomato sandwich with Miracle Whip, salt & pepper, on regular sliced, white bread."}
{"text":"This was our first time going to Punchys. The atmosphere is neat. Old diner style and they really carried out the theme well. My husband ordered a bacon cheeseburger, which he said was \"okay.\" I ordered the \"fish and chips,\" or what I thought was supposed to be fish and chips. When it was brought to our table, I immediately asked our waitress if this was the fish and chips or flounder. She said that it was the same thing. I have never been anywhere that used flounder as the fish for fish and chips. And I find it hard to believe that flounder is actually the fish here for fish and chips since right below the fish and chips on the menu is a flounder basket that is the exact same thing. Either way, it was flounder and it was not good. The chips were homemade chips and were decent, but kind of overcooked/brown. The hush puppies were good though. I don't like to return food at restaurants, so I just didn't eat the flounder and tolerated the chips. If we come back, I'll probably go to for something simple like a hot dog. Our waitress was very nice though and she did give good service, which we appreciated and still tipped 20%. I used to wait tables and the food not being very good was not the waitresses fault."}
{"text":"My wife, daughter, and Ilanded at Charlotte Airport, was headed north to China Grove to visit family, we were craving breakfast.  Saw Punchy's on Yelp and the reviews were great!  Stopped in, we had a wonderful waitress and the food was great!  The decor is so 50's Diner Cool!"}
{"text":"I'm so in love with the decor of this place and also the service. It's a little low key joint in Concord that has a great breakfast for your buck. Seating is somewhat minimal but it didn't take us--a party of four--long at all to sit. In fact, we were seated immediately so that's definitely a plus.   You won't be breaking the bank at all, however, the food is just what it is, a good breakfast for the price. It's certainly not the best breakfast place out there, but it's great for an off the whim breakfast craving."}
{"text":"It's a 50s styled restaurant with racing car models and a statue of Elvis. When I came the staff seem to be all seniors. Actually the customers seated were seniors as well. It seem to be a walk down memory lane for many. ( myself not included) I'm a 60s child."}
{"text":"Cute little 50's themed diner. I love their breakfasts, the Portions are huge. And the food is good. When I say huge, I mean it. You could even share.   I've also had lunch here. Food was good and prices were right. I do have to say that for a diner the menu selection is minimal. Who's ever been to a diner where you can't get a Tuna Melt.   The staff is nice enough, but can be forgetful. On two different occasions I had to chase the staff down for the check, and it took about 10 minutes to do that.   All in all, not a bad little family restaurant. I don't think they should call it a diner though. Not enough selection on menu to be classified as a diner."}
{"text":"Servers are awesome!  Great 50's atmosphere and definitely where the locals go.  VERY reasonable prices and the pancakes are like hubcaps!  Large servings and you definitely get your money's worth.  The service is fast and efficient.  Family owned and operated. I go here regularly for a great breakfast."}
{"text":"I was getting work done on my car and found this place and braved the 1/2 mile walk and made it to Punchy's around 10:30 on Saturday 5.18 and the place was packed! But they were humming, getting food out of the kitchen non-stop.  I was a single and sat at the counter and read the paper. Service was good.  Fried bologna and home fries were both very good and the servings were generous.    Will definitely be back to try more of the menu!  Recommended"}
{"text":"My wife and I went yesterday morning for breakfast.  I have been here numerous times however.   The service and staff were extremely helpful and friendly.     Definitely will be going back"}
{"text":"Another serendipitous find. Faux '50's diner with reasonably priced, tasty food. All on all, a good lunch."}
