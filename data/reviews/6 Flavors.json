{"text":"Excellent place. We recently had food catered from this place. Many of our non- Indian guests, some of whom, don't care for spicy food, simply loved the items and many went for more. The owner partners are very accommodating and truly care. This is the place I choose whenever someone asks me to suggest an Indian restaurant and I enjoy taking friends who show an interest. 6 Flavors has excellent buffets most days. Indian food of South India. Well prepared and tasty."}
{"text":"I just finished my first meal here, and it was a great one. I had a chicken dhum biryani, and it was spicy, properly moist and delicious. The chicken 65 app was not overly breaded and fried, the way it should be. The standout though was the naan. It was the sweeter one filled with nuts, and it's the best rendition of this I've had.

There are a lot if other exciting looking things on the menu. I'll be trying out a lot of them."}
{"text":"Awesome food... hospitality was great ... 

Fantastic lunch buffet and reasonable price 

finally .... We found the best Indian veg restaurant in Cleveland

Gobi manchurian is too good"}
{"text":"Great service.  Great price.  Great Food.  The buffet at lunch was constantly being replenished, which is what I want to see when eating at a buffet.  Of course it helps that the restaurant was busy!  There were many food options, 4 types of chicken, 6 vegetarian, and two types of rice.  The staff was very attentive.  I will return."}
{"text":"Excellent service and food, highly recommend the lunch buffet (great value) and the chicken tikkamasala."}
{"text":"We ordered take out from this place, they literally took 45 minutes to prepare it and this restaurant is only good for buffet but not for take outs and dine in... service is not at all good...you won't get authentic taste of Indian food and biryani..."}
{"text":"Tried 6 Flavors for the first time this evening and had great food! Very fresh, perfect spice level - great service also! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"After a long time I felt like a proper Indian restaurant for tasting authentic Indian breakfast menu."}
{"text":"The lunch buffet menu was wide and each and every dish was done with utmost care...Enjoyed dining here"}
{"text":"It is one of the best Indian restaurants in Cleveland. Their prices are great for the portions they serve. Their buffet usually has very few vegetarian dishes, while their non vegetarian spread is decent. Very friendly staff and management"}
{"text":"The food was fantastic! Bathrooms were not clean, which is why it gets 4 stars. 

We arrived at about 6:30 on a Monday. Place was empty. No buffet set up. (Call ahead if that's what you are looking for.) We were disappointed since the buffet and the rave reviews were why we chose 6flavors. Once our appetizers arrived, no disappointment remained! 

Family's favorite dish was Lamb Rosen Josh. 

Good value for the price. Good portion sizes. Fairly kid friendly. Great option if your in Parma and want something besides pizza or Chinese."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, delicious food, and for a pretty good price.  Get one of the tandoor dishes - they're amazing and come out sizzling!"}
{"text":"Love the food and especially the cost! 

Very close to an Indian restaurant taste! Kudos to that! 

Definitely a must visit on the weekends for the lunch buffet! Awesome variety of dishes!"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in on Sunday for lunch. The buffet was excellent. Everything was delicious and the spice was on point. The employees are very friendly.

There is a discount if you pay in cash! Definitely will be taking advantage of that the next time we go."}
{"text":"You cannot go wrong with anything on the menu. That being said, butter chicken+naan=life."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best Indian eateries around Cleveland. Visited 6flavours for a Saturday buffet. Soft idlis, crispy medu vadas and amazing main course!

They could work on the desserts though."}
{"text":"I have been here twice for weekend lunch buffet with friends. Unanimously this is the best Indian buffet in Cleveland at the moment. Their food are fresh and the trays are refilled in regular intervals. They are pretty consistent in terms of food quality. They serve dosa on your table if you ask for it. Apart from numerous veg options, they have quite a few chicken dishes, fish fry, chicken biriyani and goat curry. I find the chicken biriyani kind of hot and spicy as per my tolerance level,  but it has very well adjusted with my friends' taste buds. The goat curry is really good. I always make it a point to pair the goat curry with the puris. 
The chicken tandoori was really tasty last time. 
They had Mysore paak too on the buffet for desserts. That is the best I had in years. Mysore paak had all ran out when we had gone back for second serving. I don't think Mysore paak is a very regular desserts option in their buffet. 
Overall the food is good. Worth giving it a shot when you are really hungry on a weekend lunch!!

Tip: try to be there early so that you don't repent on missing out your second serving of Mysore paak like me!"}
{"text":"Indian food is kind of new to me but i decided to try this restaurant for a change of pace. I found many items very tasty especially the butter chicken. I will definitely be returning soon."}
{"text":"The best Indian buffet in town. The food is high quality and there's always something new to try. I absolutely love their food."}
{"text":"Six Flavors is one of the best Indian restaurants in the Northeast Ohio. Their lunch buffets are really good and the one during long weekends are best in the town. The quality and service are consistently very good. Their takeout menu is good as well. I would definitely recommend this place especially breakfast items on the menu to anyone who likes to eat good South Indian food."}
{"text":"Great food esp. dosas/sambhar. Spacious, decent ambience and very nice service! Must try!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came to this restaurant during evening hours and were impressed by the menu options. So many good dishes to choose from. We ended up with the Chicken Tikka Masala and Lamb Rogan Josh. Both were perfectly cooked, spicy, and delicious! And you can never go wrong with a side of Naan. 

We went on a snowy night so there were only a handful of people but It made for very fast and friendly service! We'll definitely be visiting again."}
{"text":"Fantastic! Good service and the food is GREAT!!! The ingredients are fresh and the chicken is very tender! We ordered the Butter Chicken, Chicken Tiki Masala and Baingan Bhartha (eggplant and peas.)  only thing, the rice wasn't seasoned. A  new favorite"}
{"text":"First one ever dining at this place. Started with chicken corn soup. Never seen a soup
Made so bad. Instead of shredded chicken and broken corn (which enhances he flavor ) there are big chunks of chicken and corn straight from a can which totally spoiled the soup. When asked for Soya sauce and chili vinegar which are the requirements for this soup , I was told that this is not indian Chinese.
Then we ordered idly Sambhar which was ok, the idly were not fluffy and there
Fire did not soak the sambhar to enhance the taste. The size of he idly was wiered also
We requested for extra sambhar and we waited till we finally decided to get our check but sambhar is still on its way:) ( this was when we were he only customer at 5:10 pm ) the sambhar was pretty bland and there was a difference in taste between sambhar with idly and sambhar with Ravi dosa which we also ordered.
OverAll. Not recommending or coming back to this place
They should change the name of the restaurant to just one flavor"}
{"text":"We tried the weekend lunch buffet here, nd the variety (veg/nv) tht ws displayed ws wonder to watch nd taste. Recommended fr its taste, ambience, variety.. a gud place 2 b amazed if u r a fuddie, nd hvn't been here b4.."}
{"text":"Happiness is finding an Indian lunch buffet that's open on Monday, my day off.  They keep the selection fresh by changing out items each time of my visits.  I will definitely be a regular."}
{"text":"Solid Indian buffet with good spiciness level! They had a veg section and meat section. Two different paneers. One of my favorites was the curd rice and  a fluffy white bread that took in the spices easily. 

The spiciest dish was probably the lamb curry - that had me reaching for my water but everything else was flavorful but not too spicy. 

It seems to be a popular lunch buffet option for the Indian community during the work week. Since it's close to my west side work location, I'll be back!

Edit: I came back two days later on Sunday for buffet. Still excellent and tried so many new dishes that I had never even heard of before! I can't stop!! Not bad for 2 out of 3 days!

Also note that the L and O on the sign are a red chili pepper and a tomato. Amazing."}
{"text":"Being my favorite kind of food, going out for Indian is something that I really cherish doing! I recently moved back to Cleveland after living in Chicago for over 10 years. There are some pretty decent Indian places in Chicago so I have been relatively lucky to have had some good Indian over the course of the last few years. This place is in a pretty non-descript plaza in Parma but the value you get and the service is really good. I saw a large number of to go orders coming out the whole time we were dining so I would imagine that they have a pretty strong following as well. I'm really happy to be living down the street from this place!!"}
{"text":"Great lunch buffet. Place had no ventilation whatsoever but will definitely be back for the food."}
{"text":"This place doesn't deserve even 1 star. The customer service here was completely horrible. Our waitress forgot entree and the food was cold. They looked at us funny when we asked about our food being cold and the waitress said she forgot. Then she walked away like we didn't matter."}
{"text":"I've had a lot of Indian food in my lifetime, and I was excited to try this place out for a lunch buffet. Service is good and friendly but the buffet was lacking in my opinion. There was only two popular dishes and the rest were dishes no one really orders or cares for. I had the butter chicken which was really tasty, but would have liked for there to be more options.

According to another reviewer, it seems like their weekend buffet has more options so maybe I will be back to try that out instead of the weekday buffet.

Otherwise, a spacious and clean space with friendly employees."}
{"text":"Really pleased with this restaurant.  The service staff was very helpful in explaining items I was unfamiliar with. They were great about spiciness . I had a delicious cauliflower appetizer that was so good I ordered another to take with me. I will be returning soon and do recommend  it."}
{"text":"Cleveland, Ohio. Excellent Medu Vadas, served with very good coconut and tomato chutneys, and sambar. The Vadas were cooked to order, not previously made or frozen. Served complimentary papadums with very good mint and tamarind chutneys. 
Rasmalai was good, but could have been softer and served not in milk but in a heavier creamy preparation.

Service is very slow."}
{"text":"It's been a while since I have been back to 6 Flavors for food but I was excited to have some delicious Indian food. Plus, this time, I brought my family to try 6 Flavors. 

Naan is a must with Indian food, so we ordered the Onion and Original Naan. As excepted, it was warm and so soft. It paired perfectly with the rest of our meal. 

We ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala, Butter Chicken, Vegetable Haka Noodles, and Vegetable Manchuria Gravy. We ordered all dishes to be at a mild spice level, thinking that it would be a hint of spice, but it was surprisingly spicy. Spicy enough to the level in which we had to take breaks between every other bite. I normally love Sriracha with a majority of my meals and I have been eating spicy foods since I was a kid, but for some reason, the dishes at 6 Flavors was spicier than I can handle. I couldn't imagine if I ordered a dish at medium spice level, because there was no way I would have enjoyed my food. Tip: if you can't handle spice, I would make sure to tell the server that you cannot handle heat or you would not like the food. 

Aside from the spice level, the Chicken Tikka Masala and Vegetable Haka Noodle was tasty. Since we ordered a couple poultry dishes, needed a bit of veggies and the Vegetable Haka Noodle was perfect! It's hard to find great Indian food and I can't wait to come back again!"}
{"text":"Tried several dishes with the family. They were all really delicious and seemed authentic. The only thing I would say is -- and I can handle some spice -- the \"medium\" spice is more like hot! Where's the horchata equivalent when you need it?!"}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant. If you are looking for authentic Indian food especially South Indian. Yummy!!"}
{"text":"This place is an affordable indian restaurant , They have buffet on weekend and special occasions .. Hyderabadi chicken biriyani is one of my favorite"}
{"text":"The food was fantastic. The appollo fish was out of this world, an appetizer that you should not skip. The shrimp Biryani also had so many herbs and spices it was almost fragrant.
Two small knocks, wine could have been cold, and table could have been cleaner.
Make no mistake, the food was excellent."}
{"text":"Went here recently for dinner. Thought there was an evening buffet, but still pleasantly surprised by the regular dinner menu. They have a nice mix of north and south Indian food. Highlights are the palak paneer, dosas, and raisin and nut naan.  Dosas are large, crepe-like, and savory. I prefer the ones with filling or it taste rather plain. Be sure to try to coconut chutney for a refreshing yet flavorful addition to the dosa. The palak paneer was perfection - soft creamy paneer in blended and spiced spinach. The color and texture can be a deterrent if you aren't as familiar with this (similar to how some people feel about guacamole), but trust me, it's so yummy and goes well with naan or plain rice.  We also enjoyed the aloo gobi (potato and cauliflower) which was cooked well, not too mushy not too crunchy.  Mild is still a little spicy in my opinion, but I was still able to eat everything and I really can't handle too much heat!  The big surprise of the night was the raisin and nut naan. I have enjoyed plain, onion, and garlic naan many times and would never think to order a sweeter naan to go with my savory spicy meal - but it was such a good combo!  The nuts are finely chopped, almost crushed. You could taste the raisins, but they must've been chopped too as I couldn't see them.  Be sure to give it a try along with the garlic, my usual standby.  Hope to come back here for the buffet.  Service was overall good, but I do have one complaint.  When I asked for a bigger table to give my toddler a little more space, they gave us a bit of a hard time when the restaurant was entirely empty.  Not sure why restaurants do this when they are clearly not busy, but here is my plea to all restaurateurs - please help a mama out and just give me a larger table. It'll be a better experience for all of us.   Be sure to check out this Indian restaurant, it is delish!"}
{"text":"I stopped in on a Sunday afternoon with a friend to try out their lunch buffet. (Full disclosure, I haven't been to a buffet in many years, they aren't normally my thing so disregard this review if you like decent flavored variety at a low cost and stuffing yourself until it hurts). Price is $15 if you pay in cash otherwise if you pay with a card it's a little more as they charge you tax. This place seems pretty popular with the Indian community and by the time we left at 2:30pm the restaurant was packed full of guests. 

You are shown a table and brought a pitcher of water then you go up to the buffet to grab what you want. Occasionally someone takes the dirty plates from your table. When you're done you head to the register to pay. 

The buffet is nice because you get to try out several different things with one section being vegetarian based and another section housing the meat filled options. The only dessert I saw was this carrot dessert called gajar halwa. The buffet also offers some dishes with heat if you're looking to really spice things up and burn your mouth. 

While I did try a little bit of everything and some dishes were pretty tasty (that paneer with yellow sauce, the butter chicken, and this salad thing with chickpeas, onion, and fried naan strips), I confirmed a buffet is not for me. The dishes at the buffet aren't always the same so you get what's there at the time instead of what you may prefer. Also, there was a hair in on medu vada, the donut looking things, and there's not really any service at a buffet. Besides taking away your dirty plate no one stopped to ask how we were doing, no one refilled our empty water pitcher, it was more of a take care of yourself/figure it out on your own kind of environment. Lastly, a buffet makes me feel like I need to eat everything just because it's there and do so until my stomach rips open (probably some sort of psychological disorder stemming from my childhood). 

A lot of people love this place hence the good rating, and I do suggest you give it a try especially if you're new to Indian cuisine and not sure what you like yet. For me though, I wasn't wowed. I'd rather pay more and have one high quality dish that I know I enjoy with great service then experience a buffet again. I'd rate them 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"Had the worst lunch ever. Seriously.
I am a fan of Indian food and I have been trying out different restaurants in the area. I was intrigued by the good reviews which I have no idea how this place got. We went for the Saturday Buffet. 

 The food was terrible. Low quality. The sauces were all very watery. The trays and presentation were unappetizing. Food lacked pleasant texture and the trays were either too dry or watered down slop. The food was waaay overspiced. You might say that Indian is supposed to be spicy - yes it is - but there was nothing there in the buffet to cool it down. Your mouth is burning and you lose any flavor. We were brought a pitcher of lukewarm water without ice. The raita, my go -to for cooling down my mouth - was watery and way too spicy. How do you cool down hot and spicy with something else that's just as spicy? And before you say - \"well it's authentic\" I've had authentic Indian cuisine elsewhere before. If it's well done there is supposed to be a balance of spice and flavor. This food did not have that balance at all. The Tandoori Chicken was dry. All the meat was full of bones. The poori tasted awful - I've had it where it's light and crispy. This tasted stale and crunchy - I don't know if they actually make it here but to me it felt like they bought it prepackaged and then left the packaging open for a couple of days before setting it out. My husband and I struggled to find anything edible, and we tried most of the buffet.
The price for the Saturday buffet felt like to total rip-off for the offerings. 

TLDR: The food did not look or taste like anyone cared. Mostly hot spicy watery slop in trays and overdry chicken.  There are way better Indian places around here."}
{"text":"Had heard some good things about 6Flavors so I thought I would give it a try, not bad but nothing great.  Located in a strip of shops at the intersection of Chevrolet and Snow Roads there is plenty of parking in the lot in front.  Going inside you have a big rood which feels a bit dated and worn; they could put some more time into the aesthetics.  

Since it was lunch time I gave the lunch buffet a try, for $7.95 not a bad deal.  There are quite a few vegetarian options plus a couple of chicken dishes.  Among the dishes quite a few seemed to be a bit too wet, with a lot of sauce and not that much veggies.   The food also seems to be not quite hot enough.  The flavors are ok, the spices don't seem as distinct as some other places around town; the level of heat (spiciness) seems to be a little higher then most places to cover up for the lack of flavor.  I also have to say that I was a bit disappointed with flavor of the naan; this is one of my favorite things at most Indian restaurants, but at 6flavors it was mediocre.

If you are in the area and looking for a place to eat, 6flavors is a decent choice, but not worth a special trip."}
{"text":"Best Indian buffet in CLE area. Have been there multiple times over weekends and their selection is extremely good. Love their breakfast selection in the lunch buffet. Also don't miss the mango custard in their dessert section."}
{"text":"Great Indian restaurant with the best garlic naan I've had yet and a nice spice to the buffet.  Tikka masala is chunky so I, personally, prefer the butter chicken at this restaurant."}
{"text":"St. Patrick's Day at Six Flavors. So good! Don't miss the buffet or even just the regular menu. One of the best places in town."}
{"text":"I went for dinner when they were having a buffet. The food was really good and they had a big variety of dishes."}
{"text":"I've dined at numerous Indian restaurants and this has been a delight.  From Dallas to Reno to Salt Lake City to Sacramento to Portland to Orlando and now Cleveland... This is number two on my list.  Definitely number one in the Cleveland area.

The weekend buffet @11.99 is worth the price (Visited on Saturday).  All the food was fresh and there were tons of options for both vegetarians and carnivores.  

Here are a couple of the items I tried.

Tandoori chicken - tender and flavorful.  Excellent and probably the best I've had at a buffet.

Chicken tikka masala -  an Indian food staple.  Delicious nonetheless here as well.

Chicken 65 -  flavorful with a kick

Lamb curry -  tender meat and well seasoned and spiced

Chicken curry -  tons of flavor that won't disappoint.

Rice dishes (steamed, veggie biryani, chicken biryani) - good

My wife ate the vegetable items and she was impressed as well.

Deserts -   Can't go wrong with Gulab Jamun and they make it well.

Overall - nice atmosphere, family friendly and great food.  

Recommendation -  a definite fave that I will be returning to."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and while the food is usually okay it is not always consistent. There's been a few times where I've come in and all of the food was barely warm. That being said there is not much else in the area so I still end up going back."}
{"text":"This place is good for buffet but definitely not for dinner. U end up getting leftovers fixed from the morning buffet. 
Really bad service. They just don't show-up. And bring food in a crazy order. We ordered appetizers and 2 main courses. First they brought the appetizers then brought one dish to without nan. Then nan came after 5 mins after food was cold then the second dish followed by nan. Never seen anywhere like this. And yes never order their Rogan Josh. They have no idea how to make it. Food in general was pathetic otherwise appetizers. I guarantee it was leftover from the morning buffet. Our stomach got upset after we came home."}
{"text":"I never write reviews, but have to say that after trying all of the Indian lunch buffets in the area, 6flavors is BY FAR the BEST in CLE!  I actually eat here at least once a week.  Crazy, I know."}
{"text":"Very good buffet! This location is tucked away in an unsuspecting strip mall. Plenty of seating during lunch, plenty of different options to choose from, and super inexpensive! The buffet with no drink was less than $10."}
{"text":"The food is rich and satisfying, and the service is good.  Try the stuffed baby eggplants for a wonderful taste treat! 
The only reason 4 stars instead of 5 is that the food was just a wee bit too spicy for my taste.  Other than that, it was great."}
{"text":"Delicious Naan and Indian-style ice cream. The seating area is very large, and the food was brought out pretty quickly. They have many authentic curry variations."}
{"text":"Havent been in an authentic indian buffet before, but this one is my favorite. The food is a bit spicy, but i love it. Will come back again for sure."}
{"text":"I am not giving fives stars only because of a few things. First, 2 of the 3 dishes we ordered were salty. Second, no buffet. Third, we ordered medium and asked for spice on the side in case it wasn't spicy enough but they said they can't do that. 

Hmmm in their defense: They are not obligated to have a buffet option! Maybe I didn't read the directions/reviews closely enough. It is advertised as a buffet so I just assumed it was always an option. And as for having spice on the side, I don't know how Indian food is prepared! Maybe they really can't give you some extra spice on the on the side in case what you ordered was not hot enough. I have no defense for the saltiness. The samosas were so salty that it was actually hurting our lips. The lamb vindaloo sauce was also salty. 

I mean, I will just ask them next time to go easy on the salt. Because I will be back! Despite those three minor details this place was delicious. Dosa was FANTASTIC!!

P.s It's in a seemingly abandoned strip mall. Don't be scared."}
{"text":"One of the best lunch buffet I had in US. This place is a must visit place in Parma, OH. They had Mango kulfi that was simply amazing. The nonveg section as well as the veg section had many options and tasted good. Butter chicken was again not just a tomato curry but actual one with spices. Can describe each and every thing but it would be a fun to go and explore."}
{"text":"We tried their weekend buffet after reading all the hype on Yelp. The buffet was okay... The food was mainly catered towards South Indians. We personally didn't think it was worth $13 since we've had way better buffet for less than that price."}
{"text":"This is one of the nice Indian restaurants near my place. It is pretty spacious and easy to locate. Their buffet spread is good on weekends compared to weekdays. Also, the price of buffet on weekdays is less than the price on weekends. I recently found out that if you pay in cash, you pay lesser than what you'd pay using cards.

Do try their mutton saag ( goat curry in spinach based sauce) and their mango ice cream if they have. I am also a fan of their idli and chutneys."}
{"text":"I came for lunch. It is a buffet. I thought the food was really good and a decent selection. Im rating it a 4 because of the service. This was my first time there. I wasn't sure the flow of the business and would have been helpful for someone to explain the flow since it was my first time. Nobody took a beverage order. They just served water pitchers. I did like that it seemed quiet for the amount of people that were there. I could actually hear the person across the table from me. I also was not sure where we were supposed to pay when we were done."}
{"text":"I was craving some Indian food so my friend and I came here for lunch one day after reading the Yelp reviews! The buffet was medium-sized and all of the options were perfect temperature wise (something I worry about when going to a buffet). The atmosphere in the restaurant was a little weird to me as it was dead quiet in there. The restauraunt itself is huge. The service was almost non-existent which I guess is fine for a buffet... they give you your own water pitcher and leave you be. We tried almost everything at the buffet and it was all very tasty. Some things were obviously much spicier than others but nothing was too spicy for us. Next time I'm craving Indian I will probably try somewhere else to explore my options. But this is a good, reasonably priced ($10 lunch) buffet if you want quick Indian food!"}
{"text":"I recently took my father to 6flavors and I noticed that their food is a bit spicier than the Americanized Indian restaurants I'm used to.  The default level of spice in most of the dishes is along the lines of a jalapeno. You can add some of the red chutney to increase the heat, but I don't need it and neither did my dad. The selection of chicken and vegetable dishes was very good.  I was impressed with the selection and the flavors. Too bad they don't offer a dinner buffet.

The chicken tikka masala was delicious as were the other dishes, which I do not recall the names of.  I will definitely be back.  Loved it!"}
{"text":"Delicious buffet! The carrot dessert was fantastic as were the tamarind chutney and the paneer masala."}
{"text":"I always feel like Indian food is kind of like pizza - that even when it's bad it's okay. For some reason, that's what I was expecting from a quick impromptu dinner I had here last week with my friend. 

Instead, we were both overwhelmed by how delicious all of the food we ordered was! We had garlic naan, vegetable biryani, masala dosa, mattar paneer and another vegetarian dish that I can't remember. Everything was awesome!

The service was great too! Everyone who works there was so friendly and efficient!

I definitely will be back and often."}
{"text":"Fantastic.  Samosa were some of the best I have had in a long time.  This place is a real treat."}
{"text":"I disagree with the name. There are a lot more flavors than 6. This is my favorite Indian place in the city. Weekday buffet is about $5 cheaper than the $15 weekend spread. India Garden in Lakewood has been replaced. It is also located by one of my least favorite, hillbilly named streets; Chevy Blvd!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Literally all dishes I order are amazig. Try everything. Dosa, chaat, curry, goat, lamb, everything!!!!!!

Looks like a weird place in a plaza. Has a somewhat strange name. BUT GO HERE. So gooooood!!!"}
