{"text":"The pizza was not very good.  Pretty flavorless.  The server was brusk, ignored me for a few minutes while I stood at the counter before making eye contact.  Worse, she made a rude comment about me to another customer because I paid with my debit card.  Just because I ordered in English does not mean I don't speak French.   So, my visit to Atlas sucked and I'll never go back."}
{"text":"the cheese pizza was inedible due to its half-inch thick cheese layer. when i peeled it off, it was thicker than the crust. perhaps this was meant to mask the cheap quality of the rest of the ingredients: tomato sauce was either store bought or weeks old, and the crust had an odd taste as well (although it was the only salvageable element). worst excuse for a pizza i've seen in a while, all told."}
{"text":"It's a really good pizza for the price. Have not tried delivery from this location but often do a pick up because their Mon-Wed specials are amazing."}
{"text":"Great food, good service, wifi, hockey and bring your own booze nothing left to be desired. Pesonaly the bacon cheese burger pizza is my favorite."}
{"text":"Been here 3 times... The pizza in nothing to be proud of. The crust is a sad excuse and the cheese is cheap, unlike the menu.. Only recommend if your  drunk and or too lazy to walk to the supermarket and buy a frozen pie.. Smh the journey to find decent pizza in montreal continues.."}
{"text":"good location and late night hour, but the staff and the pizza are pretty stale... the one girl makes it seem like a chore to simply reheat a slice of pizza that has probably already been sitting for hours and serve it, very awkward."}
{"text":"All four of us left Atlas Pizza very content. The Poitine Atlas was prepared perfectly and was delicious. Mom's Fiesta Salad was beautiful. She loved it. Dad's Western omelette was nearly inhaled. And, the Eggs Benedict were on par with much fancier restaurants. We will be back."}
{"text":"J'ai commandé une pizza moyenne moitié végé-philly. Malgré que les légumes étaient frais et croustillants, il y avait très peu de fromage et de sauce aux tomates. Pire encore, la croûte manquait de goût et on aurait cru qu'elle était auparavant congelée. Pour 20$, j'aurais mieux fait d'acheter 2 pizza McCain à l'épicerie au coin de ma rue. Mais je voulais encourager un resto local. Ce sera bien la dernière fois :("}
{"text":"I used to live pretty close to this place, and would order the veggie burger with fries fairly regularly.  I'd always specify that I wanted ketchup and mustard on it and no mayo.  Nearly every time I ordered it, they'd put mayonnaise on it and nothing else.  This was a pretty big problem with me because a) I'm vegan and b) I specified what I wanted every single time.  I gave them many chances because I figured they deserved it (and I'm also lazy as fuck).  There weren't too many places willing to deliver veggie burgers to my apartment at the time, so trust me when I say I know all about this place.  The fries are usually pretty shitty.  You can instantly tell when they've been sitting in the basket and re-fried for a while just by the taste.  That is usually the case.  They taste not unlike cardboard and probably have identical nutritional properties.

Sitting down to eat here isn't really recommended.  It's not very clean and the clerks usually have quite an attitude problem.  Even major fast food chains give their tables a clean every hour or so.  I would never recommend eating here at night - it's a popular hang-out spot for some shady characters and I have been harassed several times when just walking by.

At my previous apartment, my friends ordered the 2 for 1 special for a veggie pizza and I ordered the veggie burger.  The delivery guy showed up with my veggie burger but with only one pizza.  He insisted that we hadn't ordered the 2 for 1 special, but we knew we had.  He called his boss and left, furious.  He left the veggie burger and fries that I had ordered but brought the pizza back.  He came back 20 minutes later with the 2 pizzas, one now just barely lukewarm, and one fresh one.  My friends tipped the guy anyway, something he didn't deserve.  

When they opened the pizza boxes it was clear that someone had spit on them.  How nice.

Yeah, go here only if you're forced to at gunpoint or something."}
{"text":"Ordered the large cheese pizza with extra cheese. Best decision I ever made. Service was fast and friendly; delivery came before the the estimated delivery time! 

Perfect for if you live in the plateau of Montreal and want to please some guests without going outside. Definitely ordering from them again!"}
{"text":"The vintage pizza is quite rustic. However, the staff appears to have no soul despite delicious and abundant amounts of cheese on stale bread. Try the Mexican, I dare you!!!"}
{"text":"Their food is not worth the $1.50 sir charge to use the debit machine. Pizza tastes like dry crackers, French fries are almost oven baked quality. Subs are more bread than anything else. Hot dog buns are always undercooked. Easily could be made better. Open late is nice, but pointless."}
{"text":"This evening I made an order for delivery. When it arrived I was charged a debit surcharge of $1.50... which is illegal in Quebec. I told the delivery person this, he told me that he often gets this feedback from customers. He told me there was nothing that he could do.

I called Atlas back and told the manager this, he said that he understood and then hung up on me. 

For anyone who isn't aware, it is illegal to require customers to pay for your POS system by creating illegal surcharges.  Altas is aware of this, they told me. Yet they continue to do so.

They should be reported here: http://www.opc.gouv.qc.ca/en/consumer/topic/price-discount/advertised-price/carte-debit/"}
{"text":"I had my very first Montréal poutine here yesterday! It was delicious (I had the Atlas poutine-specifically because there was a $10 credit card minimum and I didn't have any cash on my), but my mind wasn't blown. I plan on trying a few more poutines while I'm here for the next few days, so I'll see how they all compare! ^__~

Otherwise, the man I met at the counter yesterday was quite nice. He was so concerned about my order being slow because he was short on staff, but my order was so quick and it was nice to be in a cozy restaurant, away from the torrential rain (I didn't have an umbrella... (°°?  )

Anywho, since I lost my real poutine virginity here, I'll definitely be back. It'll be a memory and comfort in my mind, for sure. Also, a heads up, there's supposed to be wi-fi, but the wi-fi was down. Yowza! :("}
{"text":"This was the worst pizza experience that I've ever had. pizza arrives late and its cold. it's so salty that I feel as though I am about to die of thirst. How do you mess up Hawaiian pizza? It wasnt even cheap! Never again."}
{"text":"J'ai commandé un sous marin et une Poutine. Le goût n'y était pas. Ça goûtait rien. Les frites goûtaient le réchauffé et le sous-marin sans le bon goût du bon pepperoni. Les quantités étaient bien. 
Même mon ado n'a pas apprécié..."}
{"text":"Pire expérience client, j'ai appelé pour la commande d'une poutine que je suis allée chercher, on m'a fait attendre 10 mn supplémentaires alors qu'ils n'avaient même pas commencé à préparer la commande. la sauce à été réchauffée au micro-ondes. Les frites ne sont pas cuites. Ce n'est meme pas du fromage en grain. Le tout pour 9$ et on me réclame un pourboire que je me refuse de donner pour un tel service. On me fout dehors et c'est immangeable!  Plat même pas à bon prix pour un fast food. Une arnaque"}
{"text":"Why the hell does this place not have more amazing reviews?

This place is excellent. By far best delivery pizza I've had in NDG since moving here last Summer. I've tried Pinoli's, Double Pizza, Domino's, and this place is just by far the best and most consistent.

Firstly they come fast, and they have great simple clean ingredients. Nothing flash, nothing cheap. Just good ingredients. Pizza's seem homemade. Plus their amazing deals. You can get two medium pizzas for less than one nasty pizza from Dominos.

I've also ordered other things, like pasta, which was just OK, not great, not bad either. And buffalo wings, which were the same. All enjoyed, but nothing special.

The pizza however, very consistent and really good. Order that and you'll be happy, no doubt.

I've never been there, but delivery is great."}
{"text":"Seriously this is The best pizza in town ! The crust is so good and it's always perfectly cooked. I really don't get those negatives comments."}
{"text":"Best pizza in this part of town and even rivals many other places anywhere else!  Friendly service. I have purchased from here for several years now and the quality is consistent. 

The people who gave poor reviews here must find it very difficult to be objective when writing reviews or are spoilex brats!"}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients, non-greasy base, tasty tomato sauce. A trinity of excellent factors to make great pizza. It was very reasonably priced too.

We order three XL pizzas. Two veg and a pepperoni. All three were great."}
