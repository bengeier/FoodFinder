{"text":"The pizza itself was very good delivered fast and it was hot ! But i was suprised to ear that i was going to be charged a debit fee!I have yet to try any other items on there menu."}
{"text":"The worst food on our trip to Montreal.  THE FOOD The crust is a thick mattress of dough. The veggie pizza was insipid, but the met pizzza was not too bad.  THE SERVICE Careful!!! They do not cut their pizza all the way through. She said that was intentional, since they don't want the juices the drain thru. But how do you expect us to eat the damn thing! She was a bit huffy about it too...as if isnt that what everyone does. Newsflash lady - no one does."}
{"text":"Love pizza, love Ouest Antonio's. Often order Ouest Antonio's pizza when i can when at my folks, wished their delivery area extended to the Lachine/Dorval areas"}
{"text":"THE best pizza in the GMA. The hint of garlic in the sauce is perfect! the crust is so soft, fluffy and tasty. Generous toppings....Definitely my go to for pizza from now on."}
{"text":"One of the best pizza delivery restaurants in the Saint-Laurent area."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE! We rode our bikes (in our short summertime) pass this place, going to the outdoor pool nearby, for years. Always looked at the place with my mouth watering from the delicious smells coming out of there... and with an ice cream parlour right next to it, how PERFECT is that?!  Well, we finally decided to try it last night (saturday) and we are REALLY HAPPY about that! First off, the person that answered our call (for delivery) was actually intelligent and we didn't have to repeat or argue...which OFTEN happens with other pizza place (chains). We called back to tell them we had a coupon and STILL NO PROBLEM!?! Wonderful start! Delivery was VERY QUICK! (We ordered at 9pm and received it at 9:25pm!)  2 small pizzas & a large POUTINE (mium, mium)  MY PIZZA, Tony's special 1 was so FULL of everything yet not soggy, thin crust was  ACTUALLY THE BEST I'VE EVER ATE ! (and I've eaten ALOT OF THEM ;-)  DELICIOUS!  My Gf's pizza, vegetarian, she loved it too, said it all tasted very fresh, only thing, next time no oignons...;-)  Nice little place we will visit in person (if the weather ever gets better!), especially that we can then end it all with an ice cream next door.  Thanks Antonio!"}
{"text":"Ordered 2 larges. One all dressed one plain. Received pepperoni instead of plain with giant air pockets. When called back after 10 attempts because their phone lines were busy, I was told that it was a mistake. Yes I agree sending me the wrong pizza is a mistake but the cook placing a pizza with giant air pockets in it which is also 2 inches in diameter smaller than the large ordered in the box isn't a mistake, it was intentional. I have posted the picture. Replacement pizza arrived 2 hours after my initial order with crust just as bad and ice cold. Thanks, never will we order here again."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Laval by far.  I'm a regular and the pizza always tastes great and fresh. Fast delivery!! Just amazing"}
{"text":"If you like your pizza to be extra grease (this may be an item on the menu), this is where you get traditional Quebecois-styled pizza. Lots of toppings, lots of flavor but delivered in a soggy mess that has you either eating with a fork and knife or folding it over and being extra careful not to dirty your clothes.  I didn't overly like or dislike the experience, it was good but damn do I hate soggy pizza.  The delivery was quick though... probably left a trail of grease from the pizza place...   2nd time was less greasy so bumping this up."}
{"text":"How can somebody pay 26$ for one medium (12\") pizza 1/2 just cheese and 1/2 Mexican? It's a joke...  I'll change my review if I try something else in the menu and I like it."}
{"text":"Decent pizza, good service. 2 tips 1. Order thin crust (otherwise it is very very doughy)  2.avoid the peperoni - get smoked meat instead"}
