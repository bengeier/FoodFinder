{"text":"Although I've heard from others that their party room isn't the best and that they were served stale/moldy food. My experience at Jazzberry has always been pleasant. They offer a great selection of teas and they have wi-fi! I liked the small, intimate atmosphere. I don't remember if they play music but I do remember hearing everyone's conversations, that could be problematic."}
{"text":"Nice find. Little shop that feels like it's in village. Cozy place and good tea selection. free wifi."}
{"text":"Made us fresh Tapioca even though it was close to closing time!! Hazelnut milk tea was delicious! Also Fridays 1/2 off bubble tea is an added bonus :)"}
{"text":"This is a nice, quiet little tea and coffee house. The decor is clean and a little modern, in a good way. The cappuccino is good, although a bit small. The desserts look incredible, but unfortunately, we didn't try them. Maybe next time. 
We have been here before, but this time, we discovered a beautiful tea room downstairs that we never knew about. Perfect for a small office gathering or tea party. Looking forward to seeing what they offer. 
Will definitely be back again and again - this place is a quiet gem for a nice, relaxing break in your day."}
