{"text":"Came in for lunch on Monday and had the burger. AMAZING! best burger i have had in years! big, juicy, lots of flavor. not too shabby Ric's Not..too....shabby!"}
{"text":"So just stopped in while I was getting my car worked on. I went with the 1/2 rack ribs, slaw, and tater salad. Not impressed. 

When I asked for a good recommendation the counter guy just told me \"everything is good.\" Not really what I was looking for... 

The ribs were just ok, much fattier than most, the potato salad was runny and just had too much sauce. Slaw was pretty good. 

Overall it was ok for a quick stop to fill up, I just probably won't be back especially since I spent $20 for mediocre BBQ. Bobby Q is where I'll be next time I'm looking for great BBQ."}
{"text":"Can't believe  this place is even open. I went at 4 and was literally the only one there. Stood around in dining room for a good 5 minutes before someone finally came out of the kitchen. The staff wasn't able to ring in my order and they were out of the first 3 things I asked for. Finally they figured how to use the register but when i handed them a $20 they looked like they had seen a ghost! They were both once again baffled by the register. A good 15 minutes had now passed and they hadn't even started cooking anything i asked for my money back  and left. Shame, i live in the area and love bbq."}
{"text":"I love a good bbq and this place knows what they're doing.  The menu is simple but what they do is done to perfection.  The staff and owners are super friendly and made sure everything was up to snuff.  The only drawback is that they are not open much past lunch so if you're in the mood for Ric's for dinner, you're out of luck at the moment."}
{"text":"This restaurant is terrible!  My wife picked up two BBQ brisket sandwiches and the meat was tasteless and dryed out;  not mention the shitty sauce and white bun it was served on. It was a $20 rip in the a$$."}
{"text":"great BBQ and awesome sauces.  staff was great.  i will go out of my way to stop in to Ric's!  Looking forward to my next visit and seeing more of their expansions, and trying out more menu options.  had the pulled pork and brisket...top notch!"}
{"text":"I was wanting baby back ribs and my wife and I stopped at Rick's Smokehouse and BBQ Grill for Saturday lunch. We were surprised the ribs were actually advertised as we walked in on the lunch special, either 1/3 rack or 1/2 rack. Beginning to salivate, I ordered the half rack for $12.99 which came with one side and a drink - kinda pricey. My wife ordered the pulled pork wrap for $7.99. We both  ordered the coleslaw as the side. 

When my wife's wrap arrived, the bottom of the bread was burned to a crisp. She gave it back to the staff and asked for one that wasn't burned. Meanwhile my ribs arrived and were likewise burned beyond recognition on the bottom.  Back they went too. After a moment, one of the staff came over and said they were out of ribs and asked if I would like something else. WTF - it's 1:00, they are on the lunch special and they are already out?! The staff person said they normally don't sell that many ribs so they ran out. You have got to be kidding. The only reason we came to this place was for the ribs. Grudgingly, I ordered the same pork wrap as my wife and waited for it to come out, eating my cole slaw, which was just OK as cole slaw goes. 

When my wrap came out, I asked the server to credit back our debit card the $5.00 difference between the ill-fated ribs and my new pork wrap. He came back a few moments later and told us they couldn't do that because there was no manager on duty today.  WTF again! The staff can't do refunds or handle over-rings, etc, without a manager? The staff person said they could give us $5.00 of something to take home to make up the difference. At this point, I just wanted to leave and knock the dust off my shoes, but not wanting to be ripped I asked for $5 of pulled pork to take home. A few moments later, the server returned with a small container with about $3.00 worth of pulled pork. WTF - for the third time. We headed for the door. The A-frame sign in the entrance to the place was still up advertising the rib special as we made our way out the door.

All in all, this was a most unpleasant experience. The wraps were dry and mediocre, the cole slaw was OK. The ribs - who knows? This place has mediocre food at best, and seems to be poorly managed. Buyer beware!"}
{"text":"My wife and I just had the pulled pork sandwich... I added some of the chef special bbq sauce to give the sandwich a bit of an euphoric feeling. Very pleased."}
{"text":"I only eat seafood so coming here the staff helped me with my seafood needs and made me a stellar fish sandwich with a jalepeno spread and chipotle sauce (I love spicy!) My boyfriend had the Big D burger medium which was so mouthwatering when they delivered it to us! Ha had their gumbo and chili which he said was super flavorful! We finished the night off with one of their desserts, ice-cream topped with salted Carmel and cookie crumbles! So good! Can wait to come here again!"}
{"text":"I decided to try this place instead of my usual BBQ place since it is close to my work. I ordered the pulled pork and a side of coleslaw. The coleslaw was ok, but the pulled pork was really mushy. Another thing that bothered me was that the containers which hold the sauces at each table were clogged up. This made me wonder how long they had been sitting there, and I had visions of people using their forks to clear the clog - which made me wonder again - could they have used the fork they were eating with? I don't know... maybe I am thinking too much. The mushy pulled pork had a good smoky flavor, but in after about a half an hour I had un upset stomach. Not necessarily their fault. It was just meh."}
{"text":"Where do I start here..
 
I work right around the corner and despite having been in the neighborhood for going on 6 months, this was my first, and last visit to this place.
 
I generally like to give a second chance to places, but there has to be something redeeming for me to want to go back.
 
In this case there wasn't.
 
If you are looking for a good rack of baby back ribs, you are in for a disappointing time.  They use Spare ribs, not baby back.  So more bone, less meat, but by the prices you would never know it.
 
And where is the smoker in this place?  Not there. They reheat the old meat in a steamer to try to give it back moisture, but I digress, on with the nightmare.
 
Anyways, I went there after work, wife didn't make dinner.  I decided to take home.
 
Bought a half dozen ribs with 2 sides.  Brought sauces home with me.  One was sweet and spicy, the other was just sweet.  Not that you could really tell the difference between the two.  They dont cook the sauce onto the ribs, the ribs are dry rubbed with a montreal mix from what I could tell. 
 
Here is the thing about the place.  They probably cater heavily to the lunchtime crowd.  The office workers in the area, of which I am one, and random driveby's.  If you go later be prepared to eat the leftovers from lunch.
 
When I got there one table was occupied with 4 people.  Its just a small place and two women were sitting in the back.
 
I didnt really know what to order.  They have a menu that is about 'meat'.  2 meats, 3 meats, etc.  No idea what that means, and later I figured out that at least as far as ribs go, its 2 ribs per 'meat'.  So I order 3 meats and 2 sides.  Sides being mac and cheese and hush puppies
 
So I see the girl doing her thing behind the counter.  Here is a hint for the person working the counter.  Don't lick your fingers when preparing someone's food. Checking the old cheese sauce left from the lunch rush with your finger tips and then tasting it isn't making me want to eat your food and certainly violates more than a couple health codes.. 
 
That Mac and cheese, even as unappetizing as it appeared when I opened the container, went straight into my garbage at home.  But I didn't want to ruin the meals of the people eating in the restaurant.
 
I watched and everything else was done with tongs.  Probably because it was too hot for her to touch with her licked on fingers.
 
So I get home, and after throwing out the mac and cheese I see the hush puppies which were rather pathetic in that styrofoam takeout container.  Which turned out to be rather said and pathetic lumps of dough deep fried though thankfully un-licked.
 
And the ribs. 
 
So the ribs were dry rubbed.  you could tell that they were really bad ribs though.  Lots of gristle and fat on them without a great deal of meat.  And when I say gristle, I mean strings of completely inedible and un-chewable pieces of sinew that run width wise through what little meat was on these poor bones. The meat that was on them was like jerky.  I mean tough enough that I had to seriously CHEW on it.  It really did remind me of pork jerky and not fall off the bone rib meat.  You ever have a piece of dry meat that was so dry that it hardens almost into little meat slivers that threaten to puncture the roof of your mouth?

Thats what these were.
 
They actually weren't even warm by the time I got them home and I live 15 minutes away from there, straight shot up the highway. And they were packed in heat saver styrofoam.  

 
The whole experience was absolutely horrible.  From the woman licking her fingers to the knowledge that I was eating food that had probably sat there for more than a few hours, and that means the mac and cheese that she so kindly sampled as she was putting together.
 
I realize that restaurants can't make fresh constantly, especially ribs, but do you have to make it that obvious that the food you are selling and serving is well past its shelf life?
 
I hate the idea that I helped kill the environment with their to go containers and some pig lost its life so that this really pitiful excuse for a Smokehouse BBQ and grill could ruin the appetites of so many people out there.

Seriously...I am taking a hard look a going a vegetarian from this and I am indeed a card carrying carnivore.

Its just too bad there isn't a rating lower than one star on here....

Edit:  I have no idea why YELP is doing this, but this review is being flagged as hidden, and so the results are not being shown.  Seeing as how I am a legitimate customer, have several reviews on several restaurants, somehow they hid this review because.....Well i don't know why actually...I wonder if the owners can flag it down and hide it.  If so, Yelp really isnt what I thought it was."}
{"text":"Ill start by saying this. As I sit here eating my \"food\" I realize why I'm the only person in here. The one star is only because the guy begin the counter was polite. This is a horrible excuse for BBQ. 

I ordered the two plate meal. 15 bucks. You get two sides and two rolls. Waited about ten minutes which should be expected from a BBQ place. 

My dinner just came and let's just say the price is a little steep. Poor quality and no flavor dry dry dry. Do not get the ribs. I mean two ribs ? Really and there old and chewy. I wonder how many I these five star reviews are from family members. Hopefully they read these reviews. This is bad bad bad bad"}
{"text":"No ambience, poor air conditioning.  Music sucks.  Really, really slow service.  26 min to prepare lunch.  Small portions.  Turkey sandwich is just a small plain bun and turkey."}
{"text":"Slowest service I've ever seen. Severely understaffed. Waited over 25 minutes for food to arrive. And it was slow."}
{"text":"Ok for what it is. Not a lick of smoke smell in the place. BBQ sause choices are ok in flavor. I like my smoked meats to have tons of smoke flavor and theirs is mild to ummmmm this is smoked meat.

will eat there again but won't go out of my way for it"}
{"text":"I live less than 2 miles from here and was really hoping it would be a good neighborhood bbq joint. The staff appeared to be new to the food serving industry, but they tried to be friendly and were mostly successful. Man, I hate to be critical of places, especially new small business trying to make it but.. When I go to a smokehouse bbq place, I almost always ask what kind of wood they use since I sell smoking wood chips as part of my business. Problem here was I could barely smell any smoke. This was an immediate worry. The first two people I asked didn't have a clue what wood they used- What?? Note to owner: Teach staff what wood you use, it is a fairly big part of the smoking process. I ordered the pulled pork with beans and mac n cheese. The pork sandwich was a decent portion, however, as suspected, there was not much smoke flavor at all. Now you can definitely go too far the other way and ruin good meat by smoking it too long, but a decent chef should know what he is doing. The meat was actually mushy as if it were being held in a vat of juice or water. Not the way to do it. The sides were all of 2 bites each. the beans were ho hum and the mac and cheese was made with joint compound it was so pasty!  These are such easy mistakes to overcome, they need not be. Give people decent food and decent service and they will love you. Try to cut corners, forget it. Sometimes experiences sound horrible only because they were simply disappointing."}
{"text":"Maybe I am BBQ starved because I am from Seattle, but I thought the place was decent and I have Kansas City as a reference point where I lived for 10 years. The meat is tender and the sauces good. Nice to have 4 different choices. I was visiting from out of town and ate here a couple of times. Ambiance is good. Place is clean including the rest rooms, a challenge for greasy, smokey BBQ joints. I would suggest he serve two sides with each lunch order instead of one, or maybe one side and a drink. When lunch hits the $10 mark it needs to. But I think you should try it for yourself and decide. BBQ is kind of a personal taste kind of thing. I liked their cole slaw, get that as a side. Beans were decent."}
{"text":"Have to say I have passed this several timds and really excited to finally try it! So sadly disappointed! The pulled pork was decent but the brisket was very fatty and swimming in oil (grease). The mac n cheese was horrible! Dry, almost no cheese and old like I got the last scoop of the night! Cole slaw was more like a bowl of cabbage. No flavor at all and dry!! No sauce or dressing at all! This place is mostly popular at lunch and maybe the food is better then but NOT for dinner!! Really sad to print this......sorry won't be returning or recommending! Price way too high for this low quality :("}
{"text":"Came here hoping to get an awesome grilled burger and that's exactly what I got. Also came with some delicious homemade fries. 

Food looks to be prepared fresh, not frozen. Other items I saw being served to other customers looked good too. 

Came back again today for the burger, but I'll be trying their pulled pork next time."}
{"text":"OK, that burger was awesome.  It clearly earned Ric's the final star!  I can't wait to go back once i recover from the last one!  YUM!"}
{"text":"Disappointing. Had the brisket sandwich and Mac and cheese. The meat tasted like what you would find in a deli at the grocery store, did not seem smoked. The Mac and cheese was grainy from some reason. Staff was nice but don't think I will be back."}
{"text":"Just ok bbq. The place is nothing special, portions are weak. If you're in the neighborhood, do yourself a favor and go to pork on a fork."}
{"text":"Not the greatest place around.  

I ordered the pulled chicken (which a great menu option to have).  And cornbread as my side.  menu says i should have got 2 but that was only if you paid extra for the sides??? But a side was included in my $9.80 meal and no drink.?? 

So here i am waiting in a place filled with 4 people eating and 6 staff. Waited... It took about 9 mins to bring me already cooked and kept warm chicken on a dry bun and 1 corn bread muffin which was straight from the fridge.  


Way too much money for what you get.

I agree with one reviewer that there doesn't seen to be a smell or taste of 'smoke' in the smokehouse.

I did get more meat than at other bbq places in the area and 1 of the 4 readily available sauces was pretty good.  but despite being seconds from my door ill travel just down the road for a better fork load.

Bottom line
Way too much money for what you get.
Warm your bread
Too much water used to keep the chicken moist...bun was mush.

Room for improvement in many areas.  Ill try again in a few months."}
{"text":"Great little place off my normal path. I was able to try the slow cooked brisket sandwich which was very tender and flavorful. They also make the own BBQ sauces which great mixture of spices in them. Very friendly staff with a nice concern of my experience. 
     I'm coming back, there's a lot of items I need to try! Oh yeah price is right too!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice now within the past month or two. From what I can see from previous reviews, they might not have been too great in the past, but they are pretty good now.

Their pulled pork sandwich is really good! And for those who complain about the price, I don't. I haven't had a pulled pork sandwich with so much meat on it before. They really do give you a good amount, whether it is for dine-in or to-go. It's worth the price considering the taste and quantity. Fries are good too, I like to dip them in the spicy sauce that they offer. I've tasted the other sauces too, and they were pretty good, but spicy is my favorite.

For those of you who went here for the burger and were disappointed, I don't get why you went there. The place is obviously a smokehouse, go for what they are catering to! Which is smoked meats, not burgers.

I only have two gripes about this place. The first is that they have a tendency to run out of things, both meats and sides. This doesn't bother my fiance as much, because to him it sends the message that its made fresh and not frozen or reheated for the next day. But for me, I feel like you should have enough of something so that you aren't already out of five things on the menu an hour and a half before closing.

The second is their hours. They are funky. I know that they must cater to the lunch crowd in the area, but they should reconsider. A) Their actual hours don't match the hours on the website, so beware. We went the first time on a Friday, expecting that we had plenty of time. When we got there, we realized they were closing in 20 minutes. Fortunately, we still got our food. B) They are advertising more about starting up a \"pub\" aspect, with alcohol. Closing early in the evenings just doesn't lend itself to that. On top of everything else, they are only open until 2 on Mondays. Their crazy hours different days of the week make it more hassle than it's worth to make a quick decision to go there. I won't go unless I am home first and can double check their RELATIVE times that they are open based on what's listed on the website.

At the end of the day, I'd say give it a try. But try one of the smoked meats, considering their name. And make sure you go when they're open :-)"}
{"text":"Awesome pulled pork! I love that you can add your own sauce, there are different flavor choices. I stopped in one day for lunch, was in teh area and had never tried it. I was plesantly surprised and will definately go back again!"}
{"text":"With so many good BBQ places in the NW valley, Ric's would be an \"also-ran\".  The service and staff are some of the nicest people but the food wasn't to my liking.  I had the Hot Links Hoagie with \"caramelized onions\". The sausage was good but it was really about a half serving on a bun and the onions were not caramelized at all, they were quasi-grilled with some seasoning thrown on them, (and they were half raw). My wife had the pulled pork sandwich and it was adequate, nothing to rave about.  I had the mac & cheese side and it was disappointing.  Kind of had a crust on it like it had been sitting under a heat lamp too long.  Wife had the potato salad and she liked it, said it had a \"zip\" to it.  I tried it and it reminded me of a packaged \"resers\" salad that may have been doctored a little in lieu of actually making homemade salad.  

I would go to Pork on a Fork, Shane's at Happy Valley Town Center, or Bobby Q's rather than Ric's."}
{"text":"This restaurant is my go-to place for BBQ food! Their meats are always tender and flavorful, plus the staff is very helpful and friendly! AWESOME fresh French fries too. I'm always surprised when I come here to find that it's never too busy-- it's like a well kept secret. Definitely going to keep stopping by."}
{"text":"My meaty potato(brisket) was excellent. Service is slow and not good. Drinks are soda, beer and  black tea. Not having one hydrating drink in AZ is ridiculous. GF's chicken was too salty, her kiddo loved the pulled pork potato. Air conditioning woefully inadequate!"}
{"text":"The place is small, but comfortable booths. Small bar and TV in a corner, but this is mainly a place to eat. We split a pulled pork wrap and each had a side of the gumbo. They offered to bring out on two plates, which was nice. Pulled pork was excellent, but really loved the gumbo! Wide variety of BBQ sauces to choose from. Beer selection limited, but pretty good. 3 micro brews out of four taps. We will be back."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a balanced meal do not come here. We shared the 3-meat plate with tasty meat + 2 sides: beans and fries. The sides tasted homemade. Good. No cornbread, or roll for the meat. They were out of cole-slaw.
However, a green vegetable or salad--nada, nyet! 
It was quiet in there, which was nice"}
{"text":"Today I had the meaty potato spud with beef brisket and some BBQ Beans!!  Amazing!! great flavor profile."}
{"text":"This place is just down the street from us. I'm assuming it gets more business from the corporate workers M-F and then from the patrons from the hotels in the area. However, we decided to stop on in (we drive by it almost every day!).  They have the huge menu with specials on the wall so its easy to decide what you want. We approached the counter to order and the customer service was just such a delight. The person greeted us very warmly and asked if we had any questions. I asked about the coleslaw to see how it was prepared. She let me try a bit of it to make sure I'd like it if I was to order it with the meal. It was pretty good, not really too creamy at all. It was really light. We ended up ordering/sharing the 3 meat platter (to sample 3 of the meats) it came with 2 sides (we got coleslaw and baked beans). It was around $13-$14. But for two people, it was a deal.  So we sat down and they brought it out to us and they had 3 BBQ sauces on the table to choose from (1 honey mustard type/ 1 sweet type and one that had a bit of a kick). They all tasted quite nice. The meat was juicy and looked great. I enjoyed the chicken and pulled pork more that the brisket. The coleslaw was as expected (rather plain, but decent in texture). The beans on the other hand were not so good. They had this creaminess to them, we really didn't like (mushy) and it was rather flavorless. Oh, well, at least we tried them. We didn't order any ice cream, but apparently they make there own. Maybe we will try another time. 
And just a side note, we did have a good experience while were were eating also. The guy behind the counter would try to get the restaurant going with \"How's everyone doing out there, hope you aren't still hungry after all that food you got!\". Things like that to get a laugh out of us. It was really amusing. I like fun and unique places like this. It felt comfortable and it stood out to us. (Not cookie cutter).  We will being going back to try the other items...there was a loaded baked potato with your choice of meat I just gotta try! :o)"}
{"text":"I had the Brisket Sandwich which included one side and a large drink for $10.36 today.

The Brisket Sandwich was tasteless. It came packed with plenty of fat which I had to remove by hand. The beans were hard, I never have had hard beans before today. There was even a small bone that I bit on while eating the sandwich.

I can safely say that there are better BBQ options in the general area."}
{"text":"Saw the sign for this place for weeks on end. Finally got a chance to go there on my lunch break. I Tried the pull pork sandwich when I checked this place out. The pork was good and they give you a good amount. I really like the bread that the sandwich was served on. Very light and fluffy. They were pretty stingy with the sides as I got the potato salad. It was good but so far I prefer Shane's BBQ over this place which is right down the street from here. Ill give the place another try cause the burger looked really good. And the bbq sauces also were very good. They need to give you more sides though. The prices are a bit steep. For $10.68 I don't think I got my moneys worth. But for a place that just opened, its not bad to check out. Just don't expect to find any kind of $1 value menu in the place."}
{"text":"I have to say that the staff here was very friendly and courteous (they earned the 2 stars) but the food was just so-so. I ordered the cheeseburger and fries with a drink. I had heard that they had a really good burger and I like a really good burger. 

The burger was seared nicely and had a nice grilled flavor. The lettuce and tomato were as nature intended, no more - no less. I was very disappointed in the bun. It was hard and crusty to the point of breaking when I tried to smash it down a bit.

They included a hush-puppy on the plate, which seemed a bit odd with a burger. I took a bite and immediately spit it into my napkin. It was like biting into old grease since the outside was soaked in whatever frying oil they used and amazingly the center was uncooked raw corn meal. 

They had three sauces on the table and I squirted a bit out of the first and gave it a taste. I like either sweet and/or vinegary barbeque sauces. This was unlike anything I've experienced in any state that I've been in. And that's quite a few over the decades. This sauce was the most bitter and acrid sauce I've ever tasted and even after swishing soda in my mouth to try and clear my palate, the aftertaste was still there. It was not pleasant.

After about 5 minutes and 10 drinks of soda later I tried the second sauce. It was just as bad as the first. I don't know if they had some bad batches or not, but there was no way I was trying the third sauce.

Like I said, the staff was nice and the atmosphere was pleasant... but you can't eat ambiance."}
{"text":"Really good food. I tried the burger with cheddar and bacon, and the pulled chicken with cheese and green chile. Holy schmoly. Best burger I've had in Phoenix. Top quality beef. The chicken sandwich was generous, tasty, well seasoned. I loved the hush puppy each plate comes with and I really think it was the best one I've ever had. I felt very welcomed, and can't wait to go back. Great place for lunch!"}
{"text":"Other reviews about this place not smelling like a smokehouse are correct, but I am more concerned about the way the food tastes.  So far I have had the Loaded Baked Potato, which is $7.99, and the bacon cheeseburger, which is 8.99. 

When I saw the $7.99 pricetag for the baked potato I thought it was outrageous, but after seeing one being served I decided to give it a go.  The thing is massive.  I would compare it to about 1.25 Chipotle burritos in size.  I was a little uneasy about putting BBQ sauce on a baked potato, but it turns out that it is delectable.  The tater has your choice of pulled pork, pulled chicken, or beef brisket (I have had the chicken and brisket and recommend the brisket) and all of the usual suspects. (bacon, chives, sour cream, etc.)  It has been awesome every time that I have had it.

The burger was also very large. (I think they dole out oversized portions of pretty much everything except for sides)  It came with 2 sides and I chose the mac and cheese and cole slaw.  The mac and cheese was dry and squeeky and miserable, and the coleslaw was average.  The burger however was very good and more than made up for the terrible sides.

I am glad this place opened up near my workplace because I condsider it a good deal and it can be obtained quickly enough to be an option for a lunch break.  It is NOT super high quality food (the reviews about the meats soaking in warming bins are correct), but it more than satisfies my palate for the asking price.  Many of my co-workers feel the same and have frequented the place since discovery."}
{"text":"I came in for my burger fix, but sampled the chicken and the brisket... it was a hard choice. 

The brisket was Smokey, tender but still had some crew to it. 

The chicken was sliced breast, with a nice smoke taste and light seasoning. It was tender and juicy. 

I still went with the burger... 10 oz medium rare... how can you go wrong?"}
{"text":"Here's why you should go -- Their pull pork sandwich is very good!  House specialty BBQ is very good!  Fries are good!

Here's why you shouldn't go and all of you out there that ever worked in the food industry can relate.  Don't treat your employees like Poop! Especially, not in front of me or any other patrons of the restaurant. 

Story: We place our order with the counter gal and she relays the message one at a time to Ric. Ric yells, \"How bout you tell me how many burgers total instead of telling me one by one\"!  Then asked everyone else in the restaurant \"Does anybody else want a burger!\" while shaking his head. The gal was mortified and was holding back her tears. I felt bad! I felt so uncomfortable sitting there eating. Needless to say my burger was over spiced and too salty!  Why? I ask would you do such a thing!?  Does it make him feel empowered by such actions!?  It was uncalled for!

You, yes you out there that ever worked in an environment with a crappy boss knows what I mean.  Overall the food was pretty good, but in the end Ric left a bad taste in my mouth! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Ric's \"where's the smoke\" Smokehouse BBQ & Grill needs to rethink their restaurant strategy quickly or they will find themselves closing faster than what it took them to open....

I reeeaaalllyyyy wanted to like this place!  I'm a huge fan of BBQ and a fan of small business owners.  They are somewhat handicapped with a location that has gobbled up prior restaurants that closed almost as fast as they opened, never to be heard from again....  But it was their choice to open a Restaurant in this spot.

\"Where's the smoke\"?  One of the first things you will notice about Ric's Smokehouse when you enter is there isn't any wonderful aromas of cooked BBQ, smoked or otherwise.  There is no BBQ aroma, What the heck?  You should always smell some kind of aromatic BBQ goodness when you enter a BBQ, especially when the word \"smoke\" is in their name!

After a completely disastrous first visit with horrible food and poor service I held back on writing my Yelp review to give this new business an opportunity to work through the kinks. I shared my concerns about their food with the people at Ric's in hopes they would consider making some changes that would help them.  

Now that I have been back twice since my first visit and the issues I pointed out during my first visit still exist.  I don't feel so bad at all in letting my Yelp friends know that Eek! Methinks not! when it comes to choosing Ric's Smokehouse BBQ & Grill as a BBQ place to eat at.

Food ~ they offer four to five different selections of BBQ sauce, which two of them are really good.  Pork sandwich comes with one side at $7.99 when other BBQ places give you two sides for the same price.  The pork on all three visits was over cooked with no smoke rings.  When pork is over cooked the ends of the pork become very dry, hard and chewy.  It taste a little like pork jerky.  Now they keep their pork in an au jus but it still over cooked and the au jus just soaks into the bun and does not keep the pork moist.  The bun they use is very tasty and they toast it.  The sides ~ not so good...

The brisket was pretty good however they sever it with the fat still on it.  Some fat might be ok but when the fat is 1/4 of the portion of meat your getting it's not so good.  Again it too is missing the aroma of BBQ  and a smoke ring.  The first potato salad was disgusting since they used frozen potatoes, however during my last visit the potato salad wasn't much better.  The mac-y-cheese and baked beans were huge flops with little to no flavor.  Most of their food is supposed to come with either a cheese biscuit or cornbread.  They keep forgetting to give that to their customers and when you ask for it, they give it to you cold, blah...

I'm not going to elaborate on the service since this review is already way too long.

This owner needs to rethink their business strategy and get some culinary help and advise quickly!  Buy a smoker maybe?  

Their are other BBQ options in and around the Phoenix metro ~ all of them are much better than this place unfortunately."}
{"text":"This place is great!  The food was tasty, the BBQ sauce selections tasty.  They also make their own ice cream there which was tasty as well.  Definitely headed back.  We had a sampler platter to try out the different meats and they were all tasty!  Sides were average, although the beans were awesome!  (don't be deceived, they look like regular beans, but they are barbecue beans and have a good kick to them!). As for not smelling like a smokehouse...due to space etc they use a special smoker. While we were dating we sat by the owner and he told us all about what they use, how they smoke their meat, etc.  So if you want to know, just ask and they'll tell you.  Definitely give this place a try!"}
{"text":"This is a really weak 3.  If it wasn't for the burger being alright the place would have been a 2.  My first trip there I got the pulled pork sandwich with macaroni and cheese.  The pork was dry but dripping with the au jus it sits in waiting to be used.  I tried 3 of the 4 sauces and found one I like and used a lot of.  I really did not care for the macaroni and cheese or the cold cheese biscuit.  On my second trip Ryan and Daren had convinced me to try the burger.  The meat had a nice char to it and the ingredients were fresh, the bun was mush before I was done eating it.  The cole slaw was ok.  I noticed they are now down to 3 sauces which is ok as the one I like was still there.  Both times the orders came correctly and service was pleasant enough.  The one trip I made to the restroom it was clean and orderly."}
{"text":"I had a craving for good BBQ and this was a disappointment. Ordered $35 worth of food and did not enjoy most of it. The pulled pork was okay. The brisket was mediocre. The chicken was okay. The beans were under cooked and pretty bad. Threw that away. The sauces were decent. I just ended up asking my father in law to make some brisket since I couldn't find anyone to buy some good southern style brisket. 
 The staff was extremely nice and the place is really clean. Inside and a little outside seating. The portions were really small though so I was not impressed."}
{"text":"I walked over there for lunch yesterday. Upon entering I noticed that there was a health inspector writing a review. I almost turned around right away as that grossed me out 

I ordered a pulled pork sandwich with Mac and cheese and an extra side of Mac. I was super let down by their Mac and cheese. It was absolutely awful tasting. It supposedly has bacon in it? I didn't have any bacon nor any taste of bacon. It also tasted like it had been cooked in stale, super old, water. The pulled pork was way over cooked. Bread was decent as they toasted it but the meat took forever to chew. Sauces were decent but nothing out of the ordinary. The staff was super nice and the guy who served me was a great help. They need to change up their Mac and cheese because it has nothing on pork on a forks"}
{"text":"This place has BBQ food down to a science. I have been coming here for a year now and I love everything about this place. The service is always really friendly and I can tell they work really hard to make their food taste good. The burger is amazing, one of the best I've ever had without a doubt. If you've never had gumbo or even if you love gumbo I'd absolutely recommend theirs. It is SO good. Their BBQ sauce is homemade and delicious. It goes well with any of the meats, but the meats taste so good by themselves you don't even really need it. I will continue to come here as long as they keep making such good food."}
{"text":"I went in out of convenience and find myself looking at an extensive menu. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich despite the high price and figured the portion would make it worth my while. It was served on a regular bun  in not so much abundance. Flavor was okay but I had to add the sauce myself and the meat was a bit stringy perhaps overcooked. The gumbo was delicious but the \"homemade ice cream\" was frozen solid and tasted old and frost bitten. Overall I would only order the gumbo if ever returning."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch with hubby and friend. The place smelled incredible, just like a smokehouse, which is cool because this is at the end of a strip mall. I would have gave 5 stars for my pulled pork sandwich and fries. Pork was excellent-tender, full of flavor. Liked having a choice of 3 bbq sauces. 

My husband ordered a shrimp po' boy, and was surprised to get a salad with shrimp on top. Now, he could have sent it back, but since we were on lunch break and it took about 20 minutes to get our food, I split my pulled pork sandwich with him. My husband is 6'3\" and loves bbq, a shrimp salad wasn't going to cut it! The shrimp itself was good and also the potato salad that came along with it, but the salad was made with iceberg lettuce-some other green would have been better. I felt that it cheapened the entire dish. 

Our friend ordered the 2 meat platter-pulled pork and brisket. With a drink his lunch came to ~$16. The platter had a generous helping of yummy fries, but the meat portions were meager for the price. I think I had about as much meat on my pulled pork sandwich as he did on his platter. For platters we'd expect to get the same amount of meat on a platter as a sandwich, he was disappointed. He said it was very tasty, but felt he didn't get his money's worth. 

So five star for the pork sandwich, 1 star for getting my husbands order wrong, 3 star for the two meat platter-taste was great, portions were small for the price."}
{"text":"Ric's is right near my work, so they get a lot of business from my coworkers, especially my boss. Because of this, I end up there a few times a month.

If I would have had yelp when Chef J was here, this place likely would have received 4 stars. But he's gone now, and so it appears is any of the appeal of coming here on my own. 

I know this is a review, and I'm sure I should be very detailed, but I wouldn't expect to leave this place with a smile on your face in regards to the food, service, or ambiance. 

It's not total crap, they do get two stars I guess, the food is edible, its not a total sh*thole, but lately it has just been \"meh\". 

I'd recommend passing on Ric's for now and going to Pork On A Fork or unfortunately even Shane's."}
{"text":"Food is good service is terrible. I phoned in an order for pick up 15min prior to showing up and the fries had not even been dropped yet, as I have a very limited amount of time for lunch as most people it did not leave time to even finish my food. I have not been to Rics in over a year because of prior service, but thought I would give them another try. Oh well, maybe I will try again next year."}
{"text":"I went back to sample the food again. I have a few new views. The meat is too smokey flavored, sort of smoothers the natural flavor of the meat.  Some items are even too salty just as the turkey. 

Ric's burger was great. 

The pulled pork was flavorless ironically. 

The BBQ sauces are good."}
{"text":"Came for lunch again with Daren c.  I had a bacon cheeseberger again.  I swear next time I am going to try something else besides the burger.  Maybe pulled pork or maybe loaded baked potato."}
{"text":"Best BBQ I've had in the state of AZ!  We go almost every week for our fill of BBQ. The pulled pork is scrumptious and you can tailor it to your liking by adding your favorite sauce. Their BBQ is all slow cooked and melts in your mouth. The Brisket is awesome but they run out of it so quickly! I am soooo glad they extended their hours and very pleased with the hot sauces that are supplied by a local provider!!"}
{"text":"Driven by many times.  Decided to stop for lunch today.  Ordered the salad with pulled pork and Carolina BBQ sauce for dressing.  Really, really good with plentiful portions.  Saw a couple of potential lunchers strolling by and suggested they go inside and get the same thing.  I'll be back with friends."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch to go.  No greeting while I stood at the counter waiting to order and two employees looked at me.  

Ordered brisket sandwich and fries.  Fries were ok but they were dripping in grease.  

The brisket was very tender but lacking in flavor.  I loaded it with chefs special sauce and it was much better.  

The carolina sauce tasted like French's mustard with paprika and a little bit of onions.  It made for good sauce to dip my fries.  

All things considered I would give them a B-"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times before with my boss and the bbq is pretty decent. When I went in today though it was clear things have declined. I got the pulled pork and french fries, which is what I normally get here. The pork was cold and not as tasty as it has been in the past. The french fries were really awful, like little lead sticks, I didn't even finish them. Maybe it was just a bad day but there is room for improvement."}
{"text":"Awesome. Came in on a whim for lunch and had the lunch special. Pork had a great smoke taste to it, and plenty of bbq sauce to choose from for topping. Had the fries as a side and was more than pleased with my choice... they were bomb! Shout out to the service as well, the chef came over to ask how our meal was as well as clear our plates. Would definitely recommend and visit again."}
{"text":"I eat here a couple of times a month and I love it! Ive tried everything but the burger & the sausage. My favorite meat is the turkey. And the gumbo is amazing. The only thing Ive had that I didnt like was the mac & cheese. The guys who work here are very friendly. The prices are spot on too. I highly recommend it if you havent tried it yet."}
{"text":"First timer today....  wasn't happy... at. all.

This is the first time in my 50 years on the planet that I was served green pork.  Yes green, and it was cold (at 11 am?).  Don't you know you can kill people with that crap?  Also, Pulled pork is NOT a big flat slab of fatty port meat.  It is supposed to be PULLED APART.

The beans sucked.  I can't even describe the flavor other than it's just overpowering.  I could only take two bites before wincing.

The slaw?  Couldn't tell ya.  I ordered it, but was served potato salad instead.  Cuz they look alike and all...

PS.  The place was deserted at lunch time.  I guess the word is out."}
{"text":"PORK BURGERS !! 

(please, sir - I'm using that as an adjective, not a verb)

ahem THEY HAVE PORK-BURGERS !! 

A delicious addition to the menu. The only problem is, I already had a short list of must-try-it-next-time that I can never seem to get to, since everything I've had I loved so much I didn't want to order anything else.
( until the next time Ric or Chef J talked me into trying something new, that is )

This is the new favorite.  I don't even put any catsup or sauce on it, just meat, bread, veggies. 

French fries are hand-cut and double fried to a crispy-chewy constistency that is rare and satisfying.

I really mean to try to 'Loaded Spud' and the chopped chicken someday, but between the burger, porkburger, and pulled pork, I may never get there."}
{"text":"Not greeted when we walked. Seemed to be an annoyance we were there. Gross outside and in. Cigarette butts littered the outside and everything was sticky and grimy inside. Dirty silverware and dirty employees. Gross"}
{"text":"A darn good burger today..  Cooked perfectly.
That secret extra spicy sauce in the back is great, don't hide that.

Service is great.  A little heavy on the \"everything ok\" inquiries.  
Its fine to ask at the end.  During meal usually people will signal if they need something, either verbally or non-verbally.

I'll be back for more."}
