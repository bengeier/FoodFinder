{"text":"This place is a fun place to eat. The prices aren't bad, around 10 dollars per dish. However,  the portions are not that filling. I went with one other person and we ordered one more dish to share between us because we were still hungry after our first dishes. We ordered the duck breast pasta with Tom yum sauce and the spicy mentaiko beef udon. We both loved the duck breast pasta a lot. The flavours were on point and the duck tasted like bacon,  which we didn't mind. The spicy mentaiko beef udon was also good.  It was an interesting blend of a cheesy, creamy egg like sauce with chewy udon noodles.  The dishes are on the oilier side, but that's what's expected from a place that serves dishes on a sizzling plate. The meat cooks pretty fast so for those of you who want to take videos, have your camera ready. For dessert, I tried the sesame panna cotta. It wasn't amazing, but the presentation is cute. I wouldn't get it again though. Lastly, the service was quick and attentive. Worth going but don't go if you're looking for a filling,  inexpensive meal."}
{"text":"Food was ok but the lunch special is cheap! Got the supreme beef which was kinda bland. Also got the curry beef udon and the curry was somewhat bland but still pretty good considering I love udon.   The service however really sucked. My date got his supreme beef first and I had to wait for my udon. By the time I got it he already finished his meal... Would have just waited longer so the chef could prepare the faster dish later so we can both get out meals at the same time...  Ice cream was okay. Didn't really like the pudding/panna cotta but the ice cream was good"}
{"text":"Food :8/10 Service 4/10 Atmosphere 7.5/10  Overall 6.7/10   Went on a Sunday evening around 6:30. It was only half full when we got in. placed our order and 10 mins later the waiter came to me and my friends asking if we can move to another table as they JUST got a call for a reservation for a huge group. There were 3 empty tables beside us, so I asked her How many people is the reservation for and she said its for 10 so they need at least 5 tables to push together. Ok that's fine but when I look over the girls a few tables down were already finishing up their desserts and the table beside them look like they are almost done too. so I asked the waiter if those tables are almost done. I asked twice just to confirm and both times she said yes those tables are almost done. so then I asked her why she wants us to move if those people are almost done and she can use those tables and push them together. She just said 'Oh' and walked away. now we been sitting there for almost 15 mins and still didn't get our water. I had to ask for our water and nobody came to refill the water at all during our whole time there nor did they come to check up on you. TERRIBLE SERVICE  Me and my 2 other friends ordered a hot plate each and an appetizer to share (Tom Yum shrimp). Our food came we were almost done our hot plate (totally forgot we even ordered appetizer) then FINALLY our appetizer came. The sauce was SUPER salty. Shrimp was ok in general but the sauce ruined everything. Would not recommend this plate.   my friend ordered salmon spaghetti with tomato sauce. The fish was super fresh, really yum! My other friend had duck spaghetti with tomato sauce, didn't try her plate but she said she liked it a lot! Both spaghetti doesn't come with too much sauce, if you are the type that likes to have more sauce, you can add on more sauce for $1. I ordered the beef curry udon on hot plate. This one came with a lot of sauce, I enjoyed it a lot! I added an egg and mushroom to my order and it came up to almost $15    I would definitely go back to try their dessert and other hot plate but they seriously have to look into improving their service, not impress with the service at all this time I went."}
{"text":"I first had this in Hong Kong and really enjoyed it so I was happy to hear that they opened in Toronto. I've been here a few times with friends and AKA (almost) never disappoints.   My first time I ordered the Atlantic salmon pasta with herb cream sauce since it was my favourite in HK but it was super dry... it felt like maybe they forgot the sauce? But my boyfriend's dish was really good and they had just opened recently so I decided to try again with another friend. No regrets!  My favourites are definitely the spicy mentaiko beef udon and the sukiyaki nabe!  Service was kinda strange the last time I went though. They were very fast in clearing our plates and cutlery as if they wanted us gone asap, but getting the bill took forever. Just trying to get their attention to waiting for them to bring the card machine added another 15 or so minutes to our meal. Other than this, I haven't had any bad or negative experiences with their customer service."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place... when I arrived it seemed decent. The menu was pretty simple. We ordered fries, beef supreme and the duck pasta. We waited for about 40 mins... and still no food. We looked around and the table that ordered AFTER us got their food first. We asked the server how much longer...and he said he'll go check and come back. He didn't come back with an answer. So we left and had banh mi boys instead. Which was a much better choice."}
{"text":"My friend and I went during their soft opening period. The space is quite large and open with mostly comfortable seating along one side of the wall. The other larger, semi-communal tables have large benches that are more difficult to maneuver into and sit comfortably.  There is a lot of variety in the menu, ranging from the more Asian style rices to the more wafu-Italian style pastas. Almost all menu items come on a sizzling teppan (hot iron plate), where you mix the ingredients together at your table yourself before the plate cools down too much.   We ordered the brown sugar crispy single-boned chicken wings. They were tender and deliciously spiced, albeit small and a bit pricey. For mains, I ordered the duck breast rice, while my friend had the Atlantic salmon pasta. The mountain of rice has corn and sweet sauce soy inside, and the duck breast to rice ratio was surprisingly adequate. My friend also enjoyed the salmon pasta. The experience of mixing all the ingredients on a hot plate in front of you is very enjoyable as the food stays piping hot for a while and the aroma is heavenly.  I definitely enjoyed my experience at Aka Teppan. The service was good, but the food came out a bit slow, which is understandable during the soft opening period of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Our group of 10 came in to celebrate a birthday. We ordered a few appetizers and the standout was the okonomiyaki fries. The other appetizers we ordered were wings, Tom yum shrimp and mushrooms. All were pretty tasty.  Our mains ranged from their regular hot plates of reef and pasta to the premium steak and chicken dishes. My husband ordered the angus steak and I ordered the house special chicken. Both were ok but a little too peppery and salty.  Service was good. Everything was ok but looks like overall they are still fixing some kinks in both menu and service."}
{"text":"This place is much better than the Markham Location. The service was fantastic and very informative. I ordered #20 on the menu, which was the supreme beef. Very good, But very small portion. The Butter was hidden in the rice. I would have preferred it on top of the beef. This place is similar to an asian franchise called Pepper Steak. Same concept.  I would come back again to try their other dishes."}
{"text":"The food here is a wonderful mix of Japanese, Korean and Italian. I would recommend the red miso and the milk hot pot. The service and the food that you get are well beyond the price that you pay. Also never leave this place with out having one of their desserts - the pannacotta. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"3.5 Food: Duck breast pasta with tom yum sauce: The duck breast was just ok but the pasta and sauce were very tasty and flavourful. Beef teppan rice: nothing special and not really flavourful either.   Service was friendly but slow."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch - only two tables were occupied. I had the duck breast with rice, which was mixed with corn, butter, black pepper, and onions. While it was tasty, I don't think this place is somewhere I would recommend to too many other people."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a weekend. The first thing that I noticed was... \"wow, a simple and modern decor\". They had this sign on the front of the hostess' table that gave a warning that we can be seriously injured by the hot plate which is over 200 degrees Celsius! I felt that I needed to sign a waiver before ordering. Anyway, I ordered the salmon rice. The food came out nicely prepared with about 8 slivers of raw salmon that are cooking on the hot plate (ya, it was over 200 degrees C). The waiter offered to mix the rice for me, but I said I would do it. I dunno, it kinda reminded me of when I was a child and my mom had to mix food for me cause I was somehow incompetent. The food was tasty but a bit too salty. The service was pretty good considering it was still in their soft opening period. My only negative (and why I am giving it only 3 stars) is that the food was inconsistent. 2 people ordered the exact same dish but one was way saltier than the other. A restaurant is supposed to be consistent with its food. My feeling is that they need to still work out some issues in the kitchen. I will give it a try again later to give it a second chance."}
{"text":"I wish I could have given it a 3.5 stars. Overall Its like a more expensive izakaya, with decent food. I would return for the desserts alone, I loved loved loved the tiramisu and every one else loved the black sesame panna cotta. I  Also enjoyed the wagyu beef, milk hotpot, okonomiyaki fries a lot. It came to about $35 after tax and tip, and hubby said he's only about 75% full.  I do understand they're in the trial mode with soft opening and definitely would return to check out the more complete menu."}
{"text":"AKA is A-OK!   I'm not a hot pot or teppan expert but for my first experience of both, it was a success! This restaurant is clean, modern and it was pleasantly busy when we arrived. No trouble getting a table.   I love a good choose-your-own-adventure meal. The salmon teppan was nicely spiced and I enjoyed the various tastes are both the fish and rice got crisped up from the hot pan.   Hot pot was REALLY new territory for me- I'll be the first to admit- but I really enjoyed it! I thought it was a little strange the the beef slices were still a tad frozen, but they cooked just fine in the broth. Speaking of the broth, we couldn't get enough of it as we made our way through the accoutrements to cook within it. But once we got to the bottom? The broth was thankfully refreshed. Apologies for the breach in protocol.   For a cold winter day, this will do the trick."}
{"text":"Food: 8/10 Atmosphere: 8/10  Service: 7.5/10 Overall experience: 8/10  We stepped into this place just before it was to close for its post-lunch/pre-dinner break. The wait staff had no attitude about this, however, which was a pleasant surprise.   The interior is clean, tidy and modern. They were even blasting some top 40 music, which was slightly strange but fine.   Our dishes came out quickly and sizzling hot. I had the spicy udon - very tasty, would highly recommend!   Tip - the portions are a bit on the smaller side, so if you're the type that likes to pack it in at dinner, I would recommend Aka as a lunch spot for you.   THE BOTTOM LINE: great spicy udon in a clean and modern spot."}
{"text":"If you want a sizzling platter - hot, hot, hot!  We ordered the okonomiyaki fries, cheesy molten hamberg steak, and deep fired chicken cartilage to start.  All items were good but we enjoyed the entree the most: Duck with noodles with Tom Yum sauce. It was super tasty and a generous portion - I'm glad we ordered it!  We ordered two desserts: tiramisu and the Black Sesame parfait. The black sesame parfait was giant with lots of crispy bits for topping.  The tiramisu had a cute presentation - like a potted plant. :)  Overall, this place is cheap and cheerful.  I'll visit again sometime!"}
{"text":"Came in on a weekday around 6pm. Got seated and recieved our drink and food menu. Decided to order 2 of the teas, a lavender and rose flavoured tea. Both were made perfectly but I preferred the flavour of the rose tea. My bf works with tea and told me that it was made properly and the tea leaves were not burned in the process of making it. We also ordered 2 Teppanyaki hot plates, the kumamoto black curry beef rice dish and the duck breast pasta with herb cream sauce. I throughly enjoyed both dishes. As for dessert we ordered the original Tiramisu and the parfait dessert. He enjoyed his black seasame ice cream on top of what looked like cereal flakes, peanuts, jelly and whipped cream. I liked how the Tiramisu was presented and it was delicious as well. I would come here again for the food but I thought that the service was horrible after they recieved our order. They never came to check up on us to see if we needed anything, never refilled our water and never took notice of us finishing our meal. We waited at least 10 minutes after we finished our meals to see if they would come over to clear our table and ask us about dessert buy instead after the 10 minutes I had to wave someone over. Same thing happened after dessert as well. Thought that we could make it out of there by 8:15 pm so that we could pick up something on our way home but even paying for the bill took forever. They only had one card machine on hand and we waited at least 10-15 minutes to pay. I was not happy with the service we recieved knowing that there were only 3 or 4 other tables around I just saw the waitresses behind the counter chit chatting not paying any attention to our table. Hopefully the service isn't always like this cause I want to give them a second chance."}
{"text":"Called to ask when they were close and the server said 11:00pm. Came to dine at 9:30p.m on a Thursday night and the server told us they were closed, even though moments earlier I was told they were open late and their door even said 11:00p.m. Management should do something about their lazy staff which is evident from other reviews.   Also, they only take cash on their lunch special which we all know what happens with that money next."}
{"text":"Waited 1 hour for my takeout. Inside of the restaurant is dead and I asked the server why my food is taking so long, she said they are getting a lot of uber eats orders. I don't know if she's lying and I really couldn't care any less, for a customer who order 2 items to wait 1 hour is crap."}
{"text":"I really wanted to give this place 5 stars, but due to some minor service issues, I retract one star. It is almost like an izakaya where a table would share several dishes if they please. I enjoyed all of the dishes with the exception of the hot pot. Not sure if the red miso broth was supposed to be that sour, but it was a bit excessive.   In regards to service, I don't think they have sufficient servers so they are extremely busy and cannot attend to all of the patrons' needs. Secondly, my draught beer was flat twice.  Possible, the key was tapped awhile ago and not enough people ordered it. A redeeming factor was the server offered be a bottled beer as a replacement which was generous."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with their customer service!!! They delivered me the completely wrong order and when I called them they try to deny it. And then they just blocked my call when I try to call them again."}
{"text":"I enjoyed there location in Markham and was excited to see that they were dt. Came here for dinner with a few friends. We asked for a table and found it strange that we were told to wait because the restaurant was fairly empty, and there were no reservation placards on said empty tables. Regardless we waited for a good 5-10 min and were finally seated.  I ordered their signature beef rice and thought it was A-ok. I think it might actually be a better deal to get the pasta because I feel like portion wise it is a bit bigger than the rice. My friend also got the hamburg steak set. It is a pricier menu item, and I don't think it lives up to the price. The hamburg steak was a bit on the tougher side, and was not flavourful. It's flavour was dependent on the sauce you chose to go with it, which was on the disappointing side as well. Overall, the restaurant is ok. There's always the novelty that your food comes on a sizzling plate. But beyond that novelty the restaurant is only ok."}
{"text":"??????frd?????????????????????????????pepper lunch????????????aka???????????mushroom beef teppanyaki rice????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"It takes lifelong to bring my food to my table. The hotpot is the WORST hotpot I have ever eat in  my life, it contains nothing but a whole cabbage with only 5 tiny pieces of beef. The waitress asked me whether I want my change back when my bill after tax was 51 dollars and I gave her 70. Even after I said yes, she forgot to bring my changes to me until I asked for it which is really awkward. The environment is good tho and the food LOOKS pretty."}
{"text":"I really liked it. My friend and I went on a week day, there was a handful of people  there but wasn't packed. They still seem like they are trying to figure things out even though they opened a few months ago. But food was tasty.   The premise is that everything comes on individual teppenyaki plates, that comes sizzling hot and rim covered by a paper trim. Makes me wonder how many plates they much have and how much paper they waste, but a necessary evil to protect from the hot plate.  You can get it on rice or noodles (like beef, vegetables, chicken, duck breast) and it comes to you sizzling. Servers can mix it for you and it becomes like a fried rice. It's a little difficult to get out with a spoon. Or you can mix it yourself. A little gimmicky, but it tastes good.  They also have hot pot (milk or sukiyaki).   We ordered the Kimichi Udon (which I thought was the best). It was creamy and spicy with bits of beef. A good sized portion. $12  We also got the duck breast rice. After she mixed it, the duck breast looked the texture of cured bacon. It was good, but I wouldn't have been able to tell it was duck. The rice became just a fried rice to me.   We also got the Chicken Wings with brown sugar. Super yummy and easy to eat.   Okinomiyaki fries were tasty, but a bit heavy because fries.   For dessert we shared the black sesame panna cotta. Sesame ice cream, on top of a cold black sesame custard. It was good but hard to share given that it's a in small bottle with a narrow neck.  I couldn't imagine finishing this myself, would be too much.   I just realized that utensils are fork and spoon and no chopsticks, which I would a little odd. I also a suggested they need a place to put utensils when not in use. The small eating plate given wasn't the ideal place because it keeps falling off and making a mess of the table.   Was good, and might consider coming back if in the area."}
{"text":"Downgrading it to 3 stars.  We came here for dinner last night, and I ordered the Atlantic salmon pasta with herb sauce. And my bf ordered the chicken on rice dish. His food came first and I ended up waiting 15 mins for my pasta. My noodles seemed dry and a bit bland, wish there was more sauce on it but I thought the salmon was really good. Although, I wish they gave more salmon. I don't think I'd recommend this dish because I quite prefer the chicken on rice one more..the rice was crispy and the chicken wasn't too dry either."}
{"text":"The lunch special is pretty good. I think the dessert (I ordered Matcha ice cream with Match pudding) is more enjoyable than main course."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend who really wanted to try their milk shabu shabu on a Saturday night. The service here is friendly but SLOW, and the food... MEH to me. I ordered a salmon salad and a butternut squash soup, and both had a great presentation. The sesame dressing for the salad is rich and flavourful. But the soup just has too much cream and onion, and with absolutely no flavour. My friend really enjoys having the milk shabu shabu, not because of the flavour, because it has none except the milky scent. It's a fun dish to try, but probably won't come back. Also, we came in the night that their heater is down, and it was -20 outside. Had to wear parka the whole time we dined in."}
{"text":"Service was really fast and the servers are really nice! Constantly removing the empty plates from our table.   The food is fairly cheap ranging around 6-12$. I got the supreme beef teppanyaki. This was my first time ever getting something like this and I was surprised when I got to the middle of my rice there was sauce inside! Apparently you have to mix the entire thing once they give it to you for the full experience. It's pretty good and they have this night special deal.. You can get the supreme beef teppanyaki for 6.99 and it comes with a miso soup! I think the deal is from 8-10:30?   Also got the rice cakes.... Sooooooo good!!!! You have to get this when you go there   For dessert my friend and I got the matcha and sesame panna cotta. Sesame one was okay, the ice cream was good but once you got to the panna cotta part the flavour wasn't as distinct. With the matcha panna cotta the flavour was distinct all around.    Will definitely be coming back!!!!"}
{"text":"No star for this restaurant. We waited over 30min, then other customers who got in after us started to eat. Our food didn't come even 2 other groups got foods. Also there was not busy. Nobody took care of customer much. Didn't say any apology. They should know what the customer service is before they start business."}
{"text":"Great spot, food was delicious and fun to eat. A hot pot u can mix yourself. Will def go back for more!"}
{"text":"I came here with a few of my friends when it was just opening. The entrance has a cool AKA circle light shining on the floor, similar to what'd you see at a downtown clubbing event. Maybe because it just newly opened, but the place was kept extremely clean. The interior designing is filled with polished marble. Even the washrooms had a nice sink in the middle of an open room for both genders to use and separate enclosed stalls on the side, which was something I've never seen in Toronto!  It took awhile to get a seat, and even so it was in a spacious area. The servers were very polite, but would not seem to follow up with anything unless we grabbed their attention (eg. getting a menu, glass of water, ordering).I could give it a pass because they're just opened and perhaps they're still in training.   The menus were really cool. I developed a curiosity for almost everything on it so we had to try a little bit of everything. They specialize in hot plates (spaghetti with customized sauce OR rice and gravy + meat) as well as hot pot (2 soup bases available), and of course specialty drinks/desserts.  We ordered 4 items. All were superb:  Okonomiyaki Fries ~FREE -  This was complementary from the soft opening. It was actually one of my favourites of the night, because I have a bias towards potatoes. Anywho, the sweet sauce, japanese mayo, bonito flakes and seaweed pieces made them flavourful and was surprisingly amazing. Don't expect octopus pieces in there though ;)  Duck Breast with Rice Teppan  ~$12 - The dish came out in a sizzling plate with paper wrapped around the circumference indicating that it's 200C.  The duck was smoked and chewy in texture, and the rice was seasoned with corn, onions, and black pepper. Flavours aren't overwhelming and is good for a non-lethargic meal. I recommend not only mixing the rice (since there is a ball of butter and gravy in the centre), but also patting down as much of it to the plate as soon as it comes out so that it crisps up.   AKA Sukiyaki Hot Pot ~$14 - The setup was cute, since the propane stove and bowl they used were miniature in size. The soup base was very good (if you think of ordering hot pot GET THIS INSTEAD OF THE HOKKAIDO MILK  SOUP BASE). It was like soy sauce, but so much more, and I haven't tasted anything like it before. The waiter informed us of the cooking time for each section, as well. Even though we had a lot of fun bonding over this particular dish, I felt I could do something like this at home too on a grander scale for about the same price.  AKA Tiramisu ~ $6 - The tiramisu came in a flowerpot presentation, which was instagram-worthy. I could taste oreo crumbs for a lot of it. The majority of it was heavy cream, with only a small corner hid a delicious cakey-crumble. It was served with whipped cream and strawberries. Still worth to try  :)  If you're looking to impress your friends with some cute Japanese creations, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Went here today to try their food since I heard a lot of good reviews.. My overall experience was okay , I like the food but the service is kinda bad .. You need to raise your hand so they can serve you or Else you'll wait forever. But overall I think you should try their food .. Pretty unique food selection and fairly okay price"}
{"text":"First stop in Toronto and I was able to get some hotpot. So glad they had a variety of options since I love hotpot but my boyfriend isn't a huge fan of it. He had two orders of the sizzling beef pot while I had the milk hotpot. It was interesting since I've never had it before.   Since we aren't from Toronto and had just arrived after a long drive, we didn't get to take out any Canadian bills. That being said, their debit card machine wasn't compatible with our American cards since it says it was declined. But once we called our bank, it states that nothing was wrong with our side. Anyways, the staff was extremely helpful and patient with us even though it took us nearly two hours to figure out our situation. After being super embarrassed, we paid 30% tip because they totally deserved it!   Would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"The food is great actually. Servers are friendly but one waiter screws up our orders and nobody came to check on us as to why we have been sitting for so long without food on our table. I feel this is a very poor quality of service because I was expecting so much more when I saw the price of the food (spoiler alert: everything is overpriced). It has been 1 hour and we just got 2 apps lol... It's a good thing we aren't that hungry. Avoid this restaurant if you're looking for a restaurant that pays attention to you. Otherwise, if you have spare money and time to spend, it's not a bad restaurant."}
{"text":"*I have been to the Markham location before, prefer this one over the other.  *The interior of the downtown location is much more fancier and spacious *the servers here were very polite, but would not seem to follow up with anything.  *not a place i would come back tbh. But worth a try once.   -Teppan Milk Tea A bit too sweet for my taste (you can't adjust the sugar level) but strong black tea flavor and perfectly creamy!  -Duck Breast Pasta with Herb Cream sauce - $10.99 while there was an abundance of cream sauce, the pasta got really dry really quickly - which was the same problem I had with the Markham location.  -Sukiyaki Hot Pot - $16.99  Both of the hot pot sets are served with udon, tofu, enoki mushrooms, cabbage and Naruto Maki. The setup was cute, since the propane stove and bowl they used were miniature. however I felt I could do something like this at home too for the same price.  -Aka Red Miso Hot Pot - $18.99 If you ask me which broth is better, I would go with the Sukiyaki more than the Red Miso as the first one had a nice distinct sweet and salty flavor. I honestly can't exactly tell the difference between red vs white miso. In my opinion, red miso is usually more salty and assertive in taste than white miso, thus this hot pot was quite salty in general. C actually found that her Sukiyaki was also salty as well, but not as much as mine.  -Creme Brulee Not too sweet and had nice sound once you crack the sugar layer - which is all I'm asking for in creme brulee   -Tofu Cheesecake - $6.99 Not the best tofu cheesecake I have had but it was still quite good! The texture was just firm enough for the spoon to go through yet had a melt-in-the mouth texture. Loved how it wasn't too sweet either and you still could have tasted the soybean. I didn't think the raspberry sauce was even necessary but it went well with the refreshing cheesecake.  -Aka Original Tiramisu - $5.99  the tiramisu didn't have the espresso flavors that I was looking for in a Tiramisu. I found that 80% of the dessert was actually cream then topped with cake-crumbles. Overall a good dessert for an Instagram picture, but don't expect too much."}
{"text":"wait for 30mins for my order.  What I got is my salad. People came after me already paid. 10 more mins ok I wait.  5more. I'm being nice.  Another 5 min.  Sorry"}
{"text":"really delicious food! Their milk hotpot and noodles with herble cream are my favorite! And their service is really nice and friendly! Already went there for 4 times since October, definitely goona come back many times!"}
{"text":"Not sure about the low reviews, I enjoyed my experience and left happy. This place is still in the midst of their soft opening, so it's reasonable for them to take this time to find their groove. Service was super friendly, though admittedly sparse at times (but they're hiring too).   We went with friends so we shared the dishes.  Started with the curry powder chicken wing appetizer - very flavourful seasoning. They say it's one bone and 8 wings, but it's really 4 wings cut down the middle. Still very good.   The beef rice was good; beef comes out raw on their tepanyaki plate (over 200C!) and it cooks in front of you. Pretty good! But the real winners were the Duck Breast pasta with Tom Yun sauce (spicy Thai). The duck was consistently red throughout (sliced for you), and appeared to be sous vide. Very tender and smokey. The pasta had a great kick to it (you'll be warned that it's spicy) but it was very tolerable.  The Kimchi udon with beef was amazing too. Udon was chewy and the sauce was good. You can taste the kimchi but it's not too heavy. The beef that came with it was good, but if would've gone well if they had duck breast too.   For dessert, we ordered the Tiramisu and Black Sesame panna cotta. The tiramisu had a beautiful presentation (looked like a small planter box), though it was very light. The black sesame ice cream was very good, as was the panna cotta portion, It may be difficult to share as it's served in a tiny jar.   The place is well designed and very spacious (lots of room between tables). I would come back. 1 app, 3 entrees and 2 desserts came out to around $60 ($20/person). Not bad! Sure, service can be improved but they are working on it."}
{"text":"I came to this restaurant today with great expectations since I haven't been for a long time. To my disappointment, the service's terrible: the waiter did not serve us water and they took our order and left without showing any hospitality. The food was okay. I ordered the hotpot with creamy soup and it tasted good. However, when I asked for more soup for my hotpot when it's drying up, the waiter poured herbal soup into my hotpot. A COMPLETELY different soup than the original soup of my hotpot. It tasted terrible afterwards and the waiter just acted like nothing's wrong. I don't wanna come to this restaurant again due to its bad service even though the food was okay. I wanted to give it one star for the unpleasant experience, but I decided to add another star for the quality of the food."}
{"text":"Got the cheesy rice cakes, deep fried mushrooms and the kimchi udon. The cheesy rice cakes were really good, I just wish they were cooked longer. They weren't chewy and a bit firm, but the sauce was pretty good. The deep fried mushrooms were bomb, the seasoning was great but it's even better when you dip it in the cheesy rice cakes sauce! As for the kimchi udon, presentation was good, but like others said there isn't enough beef.  And a tip: the egg is an extra dollar.  Would definitely come here again - it's just a wee bit pricey."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere, creative dishes, and cheap beer! Overall good food quality and great service. Reasonable price for the experience, would definitely go again."}
{"text":"Aka Teppan is a take on popular Hong Kong chain, Pepper Lunch, where meat dishes are cooked on tabletop hot plates. I went to the newly opened location on Bloor St W to meet up with some friends for lunch. Aka Teppan is currently running some lunch specials (ends September 15), where dishes range from $7.99 to $10.49. My friends, and I were the first customers during the lunch hour on a warm Saturday afternoon. However, service started picking up once we were in the middle of our lunch, and more people arrived. The overall ambiance was clean, minimalist, and bright with wooden tables.    Since pictures of this particular dish has flooded my Instagram feed, I opted for the Supreme Beef Teppanyaki Rice ($7.99). It arrived in a personal-sized teppan that was steaming hot at 300°F, and came with raw beef, corn, green onions, sauce, and steamed white rice. All you have to do is mix everything together, and cook the beef to your liking. The heat from the teppan will thoroughly cook the raw meat, and ingredients. Our server asked if we wanted him to mix our teppanyaki rice for us, which we appreciated. I thought that the sauce mixture blended quite well with all of the ingredients including the black pepper, and the beef slices were tender enough. I also added an extra raw egg (+$1) to the mix, and it added a nice texture to the rice.  I have read several reviews that have mentioned the poor service up at the Markham location, as they are often quite busy. However, I thought that the service at the downtown location was attentive, and good. I liked that our server mixed our dishes for us, and quickly took our dishes away when we finished our lunch. My friends, and I were able to continue our conversation after our meal, and never once felt rushed. Overall, Aka Teppan was a pretty solid option for a quick lunch, and I would definitely return."}
