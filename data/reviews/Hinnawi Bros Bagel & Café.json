{"text":"Nice and cozy place. In a rush the service is really slow. I ordered the \"sherbrooke\" its a bagel with avocado,salad,cheese and chicken. It took 40mins until i received my order. Ignoring the slow service during rush hours, the staff is really friendly and the bagels are worth the wait because they're amaaaaazing."}
{"text":"You know the drill - 1, 2, 3 - Atmosphere, Food, & Service :)

Atmosphere: Love it ... simple, clean, functional.  It's a pace you come in, grab a table, and order yourself up some bagles.  This particular location on the corner of Maisonneuve & Makay is new - so the place does need some more time to grow into itself - but the decor the owners chose to go with indicates that they want to keep things simple & clean

Food: You definitely get what you came in for.  Bagles - more that two dozen kinds of Bagel \"Sandwiches\" - your Atlantic, Alaskan, Vegi, Bacon etc. Ingredients are super fresh - which is the reason you'll come in.  The bagels used are St. Viateur made but the owner (Mr. Hinnawi) is hoping to start making his own soon ... hmmm ambitious.  Prices are reasonable (about less than $10 for a bagel topped with your choice + coffee + chips)

Service: very minimal but courteous - food brought to your table (Mr. Hinnawi again) and he is considerate to take time out every so often to check on his dinners - on a Saturday morning with not much of a rush this works perfectly and give one a sense of serenity to enjoy in peace :)

Should you go? Yes absolutely! It's a non-serious place for the non-serious or those looking to just unplug a bit!"}
{"text":"Pricey for what you get, and a long prep time for sandwiches. No drip coffee available. Ordered the BLT, and 10 minutes later was served the Montréalais. I would recommend looking elsewhere for an urban breakfast to go."}
{"text":"Really good bagels! The waitress was super friendly too :) I live very close to this place but never went because I was super put off by the color of the sign (yellow - I know, super silly). I will definately be coming more!"}
{"text":"Nice, cozy and clean place at Mackay. I definitely recommend it! The staff always smiles and the service is excellent."}
{"text":"Arrived here on a Saturday morning. I believe it was their rush hour so it took an incredibly long time for two simple sandwiches to come. The servers did not look very friendly and approachable either. Despite the service, the bagel sandwiches tasted AMAZING! Would definitely come back for the food but I would hope they hire more people during rush hours."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere complimented with outrageously overpriced food and coffee."}
{"text":"This was our first stop in Montreal on the way to the AirBnB.  Since they were the first, they will forever be remembered as the nicest of our trip.  The coffee was good and its a nice location."}
{"text":"A good bagel sandwich and an excellent coffee.The bagel itself was nothing special but the sandwich overall was fine. Staff were very friendly."}
{"text":"Wasn't the traditional NY breakfast I was looking for but I think I didn't understand the place before I got there. This place is more of a cafe than a bagel store, regardless my breakfast was pretty tasty. Everything was done well, coffee of course was great and it was by far the cheapest breakfast I had the whole time."}
{"text":"I've been a Concordia student for a few years now and this spot is a nice option to grab some eats, a drink, and study for some quizzes/exams. 

I had the New Yorker bagel sandwich which consisted of mortadella, tomato, lettuce, mozzarella, and pesto with a side of chips.

Bagel was pretty good. Nice and crispy with a lot of filling. Haven't tried the smoothies yet but will definitely be checking it out this coming semester!"}
{"text":"I've walked by this place I don't know many hundreds of times on my way to school. Now that I finally have walked into this place and tried a delicious bagel as well as a yummy coffee I feel like I've been missing out. The bagel I tried was called the Romain with prosciutto, mozzarella, tomato and pesto :) There were so many options conveniently written on the wall behind the cash that I definitely have to return to try a few more. Each of the bagel plates automatically come with some chips which were plain Ruffles from what I could tell and I wish I could have had only the bagel... But overall it is a cute place to eat with friendly staff and a large selection of delicious bagels. If you have a craving for a yummy sandwich I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Filling the shoes of a former Second Cup-come-student copy shop on the PRIME Concordia ajascent corner of Mackay and DeMaisoneuve, Hinnawi Bros unremarkable exterior reveals a surprisingly cosy \"Snack & Study\" spot.

Reasonable prices, free Wifi (and power outlets), original art, and good coffee all work towards making this cafe a success. The \"Petit Quebec\" sandwich with chips and small, beautifully crafted late came to $5.75, less than half the price of the fare at my usual study spot up the street. Sandwiches, all made on Montreal style bagels are served in pub-style baskets with waxed paper. Not the most stylish of présentoirs, but gets the job done! They have a wide variety of sandwiches, salads, and assiettes to accommodate a breadth of tastes both omnivorous and vegetarian.

In proud café style, the artwork adorning the walls is original, of professional caliber AND for sale. A logical move considering its close proximity to Concordias and fine arts department. A win-win situation for both the cafe and the artists!

I have only minor disappointments concerning Hinnawi Bros, both easily fixed! The cafes table layout is uninspired. 2-seater tables currently entered down the length of the space could be placed against the wall, easily transforming them to larger 4 seater spots. Take it a step further and build cosy booths! The other minor irritation is the fact that the outer door opens directly into the cafe letting the FREEZING winter air in! Again, easily fixed with a decorative \"vestibule\" curtain.

I look forward to the evolution of this cafe, and its eventual summer expansion to the buildings patio area, which will hopefully help the business ordinary exterior more close resemble its potentially extraordinary interior!"}
{"text":"A very cool place to hang out with local artists displaying their work on the walls. The specialty bagel sandwiches are huge and I think are the best in the city. Try the fresh squeezed orange and grapefruit juices."}
{"text":"Thai place was pretty good. Very nice staff. The sandwhich options were good. I ordered the Alaskan, which classic bagels and lox. An interesting point, all the bagels were sesame. No other options!!! That was a bit strange. Also I did ask for an Americano with milk, but received it without, but the drink was so tasty I didn't bother going back up. My Alaskan bagel was good, but my complaint was that it wasn't toasted. Usually when I order my bagel with salmon, it's a toasted one with all the usual fixins. That was my only disappointment, but the sammy was good overall. Nice artwork inside, clean bathrooms. A bit expensive overall, but nice lil spot."}
{"text":"I was instructed to try a Montreal bagel before departing this great city - so I complied!

To be clear: I'm not entirely sure if what I had is what is considered a famous Montreal bagel, so take that perspective with a grain of salt. *Okay I just googled it - I'm pretty sure this was a chain and not the famed Montreal bagel, but I'll still write my opinion.

Pros: The options were plentiful and the I was pleased with the options on my \"Le Couchon\" bagel, the prices were reasonable, staff was friendly. 

Cons: Everything was so bland - both my chai latte and my bagel (like literally, my latte had no flavor...not even chai), the bagels were chewy and very dry, there was a creepy hole in the bathroom ceiling that made me sure there was a video camera somewhere.

If I lived close enough to try another option or two, I may frequent this place on the way to school or work, but for now I'll look forward to my next Ripple Bagel & Deli trip!"}
{"text":"This was my first time trying a bagel in Montreal. BEST. Bagels!!!! This is a very small and cozy cafe, very quiet. The hostess was extremely friendly. The menu is entirely in French, but she explained everything in English for me. I ordered the Le Cochon (bacon, egg, cheese and mayo). I'm not a mayo fan but it is the perfect addition on this bagel! The bagel comes chips too! 
I highly recommend eating here. They also have plenty of other bagel options!"}
{"text":"Really good breakfast place . They make fresh juices and coffee as well. Delicious Authentic Montreal bagels and fresh bagel sandwiches."}
{"text":"On our last morning in Montreal we decided to stop here for a quick bite before our drive back to NYC. We had $25 left in Canadian currency and wanted to use it all before leaving Canada. My boyfriend ordered a bagel with smoked beef plus ginger tea kombucha and I got this combo (montrealis bagel with chips, salad and a small coffee). I wanted a latte and the cashier said it was fine to replace the coffee with a latte without extra charge. All this was a bit over 25 dollars and we were able to charge the rest on a credit card, woo! 

Food was delicious, loved how they sliced the tomatoes and cucumbers really thin so that my bagel wasn't falling apart when I took a bite into it. 

If I were a native I would come here all the time to work and drink coffee :) 

Thanks for the wonderful last meal in Montreal! Merci Beaucoup!"}
{"text":"So as a new comer to Montreal I found this place rather randomly when rather hungry and was amazed at the quality of the food, ingredients and service. Good quality Wi-Fi and an open breezy environment seal the deal. Can't comment comparatively on Montreal bagels, but in terms of UK bagels they are on another scale. So 5* for food. 

The cappuccino was ok, nowhere near the excellent Cafe Myriade just around the corner, but drinkable. Essentially too milky. 

In sum amazing food and highly recommended."}
{"text":"Love this cafe!  The bagels are exactly what you'd want in Montreal!  Mmm. Had an awesome latte. Great ambiance and the service was prompt and courteous. What else could you want?"}
{"text":"Des bagels de chez St-Viateur. Ok.  Une seule étoile à cause d'un service leeeeent..... 20 minutes pour apporter les cafés????? Sérieux?????!!!!!! Menu UNIQUEMENT AFFICHÉ EN ANGLAIS!!!! Je suis très à l'aise pour dire que je me plaindrai à l'Office de la langue française."}
{"text":"This is where I get my salmon and cream-cheese bagel fix. I've also tried the Petit Quebec as part of their MyPiece deals, doesn't disappoint. It's a good place to go if you work in the area and need to get quick breakfast on the way!"}
{"text":"This place was perfect for a morning fix! Quick service and great food. The bagel sandwiches are very tasty. The bagels in Montreal taste 100x better than most bagels in the United States so they are a must try."}
{"text":"It's a bagel place, but the stand out here for me was the coffee. It was one of the best coffees I've ever had! My basic breakfast came with the bagel topped with lettuce, egg, and swiss cheese as well as some tomatoe and cucumber slices on the side as the \"salad\". Despite the low price, I was very impressed with how meticulously well-made and well-presented everything was. The staff were friendly and the atmosphere was very cozy as well."}
{"text":"Visiting Montreal, I had to try one of their famous bagels. Unlike a NY bagel, these are smaller, crustier and more dense. A little bit of cream cheese along with a cappuccino and you're set to start your day. 

The staff at Hinnawi Bros are exceptionally accommodating and friendly, unlike many quick-serve establishments. 

Try a bit of the 'za'atar' sprinkled on your cream cheese bagel. It is an aromatic mix of sesame seeds, cumin, thyme, oregano and other herbs that, at first, seemed a bit strong but really made the senses dance with delight. 

Don't forget to have their fresh-squeezed orange juice with your meal!

I forgot to mention they also exhibit artwork from local artists, a great way to help talented people establish themselves."}
{"text":"Really cute space! If I lived in Montreal, I could totally see myself coming here to study or get some work done. 

There are a ton of bagel sandwich options to choose from, and I thought all of the prices were pretty reasonable.  It took a pretty long time for our bagels to come out, but when they did, they were pretty good! I thought my lox bagel had a good amount of lox, but I thought there should have been more cream cheese (maybe that's coming from my American habits). I think the bagels come from St. Viateur, and I wasn't positive if they were fresh. Compared to NY bagels, they were smaller, a little chewier, and sweeter. 

Overall, this place didn't wow me with their bagels, but they were satisfying and I enjoyed my time here!"}
