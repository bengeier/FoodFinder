{"text":"Completely overpriced. Food was tasty but not lived up to the prices. Also very small portions."}
{"text":"Super cute cafe!! Stopped by here with a friend to grab a coffee before walking around. It's got a really cool vibe w an ancient shiny gigantic cool espresso machine. Clean shop. Ordered a latte and americano. Both were good. Also bonus points because they carry lactose free milk! ;)"}
{"text":"Food is extremely tasty, and appears healthy. My husband and I both had the breakfast empanadas and they are so good! The muffin and latte were great too. A cute place and nice service. Will be back."}
{"text":"I was in Toronto for a business trip and stumbled upon this gem for breakfast. I was so happy I did - it lifted my mood for the entire day! The service was fast and so friendly, and the food was delicious and simultaneously simple yet complex. The portions are small, but I still was able to compose a satisfying breakfast for CA $12 (had the breakfast empanada, fig and walnut biscotti and an Americano) and the experience was well worth it! I felt so comfortable and welcome, the music set the perfect mood, and I loved how much of a community feel it had (for example, there were photos displayed that were taken by children at a local festival - I really enjoyed looking through them!). Overall this place was lovely and if I'm ever back in Toronto, I'd make a point to return!"}
{"text":"This was a nice stop to grab a delicious empanada... customer service was spot on! You have to try their food out."}
{"text":"Had such a great latte and breakfast empanada here this morning. All the condiments and everything are made in-house, and it all tasted great. The space is well designed, bright, and clean, and the owners are really friendly. I have my daughter's ballet class there every Saturday, so I'll be sure to go! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick lunch with a friend. Clean and nicely appointed new cafe in The Junction. Reached for my Aeroplan Gold card a few times subconsciously. Where else besides an airport can you be overcharged for bland food ? And $3 plus tax and tip for a small cup of coffee ? I wish the owner well, but I probably won't be back.  Strange mix of self service and scrambly table service."}
{"text":"This shop smelled amazing (amazing food aroma wafting onto the sidewalk despite the wet paint) so we just had to stop in. Had the \"award winning 10k\" sandwich - Brie, pear, mustard, etc making a great combo of flavours balancing savoury and sweet. The bread was toasted perfectly and arugula salad on the side was a good accompaniment. Highly recommend! Didn't get to try the empanadas but they also sounded delicious"}
{"text":"Cute cozy cafe. Great location in the junction. Had breakfast empanada and a delicious Americano. Owner was super attentive. Will be back."}
{"text":"I've stopped twice at this place, once for an iced coffee and once for lunch. The coffee was great and the owner was so friendly that I decided to come back with my Mom for lunch when I was in the area another day. We had the detox tea, the tuna melt and the lentil salad. It was all fantastic! We cannot wait to go back and try the Argentinian empanadas."}
