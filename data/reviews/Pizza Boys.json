{"text":"Terrible customer service. I called to enquire as to why my order was cancelled on Uber Eats and the guy was very rude and told me to try again in 2-3 HOURS!"}
{"text":"Terrible customer service the \"manager\" yells at you when you have a complaint and does not deal with the issue at hand. Just tells you never to come back.

This is my first review and I'm disappointed it's a negative one. I've been going here really often since it's close to work and I like chicken wings. However they gave me raw wings one day, and the next day they gave me wings with no sauce. I came back the first time for my raw wings, after complaining about my wasted time and the simple fact that the wings were raw they finally decided to give me the remade wings. I thought alright they messed up once I yelled at them and now they have their stuff together. The second time, today, with the wrong sauce they swore and yelled that they don't want me as a customer and told me never to come back. His reason for there not being sauce when there should have been spicy ranch was that the ranch evaporated. He was very aggressive and rude while yelling at my dad and I. How can you after messing up my wings have the audacity to tell me I'm making things up and trying to get free food. I brought the wings with me as proof that there was no sauce on them and you still have the gonads to yell at us? And you finish off by telling me to never come back? What kind of a business operates like that. Makes an error then screams at the customer for it. How does ranch sauce even evaporate within 10 minutes and leave no trace? Could you really not think of a better excuse as to why there was no sauce on the wings?"}
{"text":"Honestly some of my favourite pizza in Markham! For $11, I'm quite impressed with the quality of my pizza, and the fact it came with a free ranch sauce! I had ordered a Hawaiin pizza and was pleased to find a huge amount of pineapple, ham, and bacon. Just a personal preference, but I love when pizza places put their cheese on top of the toppings opposed to under. Overall, it wasn't too salty and just the right amount of flavour. The regular crust wasn't too thick and was nice and soft. Would highly recommend for a cheap, but amazing pizza!"}
{"text":"If you're into heat, this is the pizza place for you. 

I can only comment on Pizza Boys' food as I haven't actually been in the establishment itself, but I have tried their mutton pizza and can confirm that it's really good. The mutton is where the spice comes from. Being a guy who's only starting to delve into spicier foods, this was perfect. It wasn't too hot, but yet it still packed a punch. 

I also really like the spicy dip that they sell for their pizza. Usually pizza dips are creamy and mild, but not this one! This dip was packed with chillies and other spices, but it still had good flavour. 

I'm a big fan of Pizza Boys cause they fill a food gap I never even knew existed - spicy pizza! Will definitely try to make a visit if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I'd give it a 3.5 rating. I ordered this via UberEATS. I ordered a 5 topping large pizza and their spicy fries. I couldn't believe how many toppings they had listed on their menu. I'd say they had about 20 toppings to choose from. It arrived in 50 minutes which UberEATS did say it would take that long. 

Pizza was good; nothing special compared to other places but what makes them special is the variety of toppings you can get. Their spicy fries was good at first but made me really nauseous and a bit sick.  It was very spicy which isn't the issue; I think their sauce and the fries were very oily. 

Don't know if I'd order again but wouldn't rule them out if craving for pizza takeout."}
{"text":"Just popped in for a slice. While it was edible it was mediocre at best. Crust was flat, sauce was bland. I'm having a hard time figuring out why this place has a few great reviews. Yelp was the reason I checked this place out and I have to say it left me very disappointed. You are much safer at chain pizza joints as much as it pains me to say that."}
{"text":"So I just ordered their pizza via ubereats. I have to say I was a bit skeptical at first but, now this is probably my favourite pizza joint. The prices and portions are phenomenal. They have ingredients that I've never seen at other pizza joints(e.g. Crab, leaks, salami, feta cheese,...etc) service was quick, the only reason I know this is because I received my order so quickly. My purchase was a large pizza. (Chicken, double cheese, hot peppers, and pineapple; tai sweet dipping sauce; cola) It came with 5 toppings, dipping sauce, and a pop. All for an affordable total at $10.99+ tax."}
{"text":"The pizza here is just as good as nearby competitor Spicy Pizza Wings. However, Pizza Boys offer an extra topping and offer this free option of making your pizza with cheese chili which gives it a great flavour"}
