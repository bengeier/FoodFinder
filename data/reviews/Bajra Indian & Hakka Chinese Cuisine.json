{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to head out for dinner tonight, and we are so, so glad we found this beautiful place!!! By far some of the best Indian food we have had, and that is saying a lot as he is British, and they know their curries so he is a harsh critic. To start, we had onion bhaji and chicken pakora. The onion bhaji was THE BEST onion bhaji we have ever had. They were fresh, hot, and very light. Very obviously freshly made. The chicken pakora was also beyond amazing, as it was juicy, lean, and very flavourful. It isn't the normal 'deep fried in a massive layer of batter' kind of pakora, it is very much like it was lightly coated pieces of chicken breast which was then quick fried. Many places I have had these dishes feel like they are coated in a thick layer of oil, but that is the furthest thing from what you will get at Bajra!! On to our entrees, he ordered the salmon tikka and prawn biryani. He would not stop raving over how amazing it all was. Like I mentioned, he is British, and knows his Indian food. I ordered the chicken vindaloo with a side of saffron rice and a garlic naan to share between us. I have only amazing things to say about my meal, everything was so flavourful and filling that I had to take some home with me and I cannot wait to eat the rest!! The garlic naan was out of this world. It is light, airy, and chewy. Exactly how you want your naan to be! The staff were so attentive, accommodating and incredibly friendly, they are amazing!
If you are looking for a great place for authentic, flavourful Indian eats, this is the place you have been looking for! I cannot speak highly enough about the food here, and I will continue to support them. My whole family cannot wait to pay them a visit!"}

The food is the best I've had for a very long time. The staff are all extremely friendly and best of all, it's extremely cheap!

Their coffee is also fantastic!"}
{"text":"Ordered through Skipthedishes and the food arrived hot and fresh.  The flavours were great.  I ordered butter chicken and mutter paneer, with naan and rice.  The only reason I am not giving 5 stars is because I expected more chicken.  There were about 8 medium-sized cubes of chicken in a ton of sauce (no complaint about the amount of sauce).  Didn't seem like good value for the price paid."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Food was fresh, tasty and portions generous. Will absolutely order again."}
