{"text":"I would hope this place wouldn't get any more business but sadly it won't be the case.  We tried to have a milestone 30th birthday party for a friend only to have a nightmare that dragged the whole night down.  Right when we get there it's a disaster.  It's supposed to be a pool party with swimming and good times.  All we got was hassle and disappointment.  We get there and the little door boy is confused as to why we have bags.  Hello, it's for our towels and clothes so we can go swimming.  Only to be told the pool is unusable on Fridays and Saturdays because of the \"nightclub\" it turns into.  So much for the 24/7 pool that it is specified to be on the website.  We are also told there's a dress code.  SERIOUSLY!? A dress code of nicer shirts, pants and shoes for a pool area!? What idiot is running this place!? Get over your elitist \"we are better than everyone else\" crap and accept the business we are trying to give you.  We have a reservation for a party, GET OVER IT!  Then we get up there expecting luxury and what do we get?  Cig butts and cheeze its in the middle of the deck that the staff decided wasn't important to clean up until a long time later, a dirty and stained bar top, huge roaches running around and constantly tripping over loose fake tiles.  So to recap, we had a difficult time being accepted up, crappy environment, the further problems with a dress code didn't allow a good portion of our guests to join the party, ruining their night and wasting their time and not being allowed to use a pool especially when the place is empty enabled us to pack up our things after a short amount of time and promptly leave.  We decided it would be more fun to go to someone's house rather than stick around this place.  We made the right decision by leaving.  Places like this are what's wrong with trying to have a good time in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"This is the storied epicenter of single life in Scottsdale since 2008.   WET is the week-end pool party held on the second floor of the Starwood's W Hotel, Scottsdale.  A bouncer guards a velvet rope at the foot of an open stairway that rises to a bar with misters, a large pool with infinity edge gutters, and lots of large cushioned lounges.  Private cabanas with bottle service can be reserved for $350 a day.  The party goes on from 11 AM to 5 PM.  Live,  popular DJs provide a club beat that greets anyone arriving at the W.  Expect a young crowd (Are those girls really old enough to drive?  Are those guys cutting class?)  strutting fit and often enhanced bodies in revealing suits, large floppy hats, designer sunglasses, and high heels. And of course, reality show worthy TV tans.

All that WET scene seems like a whole lot more work than when I was 18."}
{"text":"Great place to just hang out and relax.  They play great music and you can't beat just getting away from it all here......Paul was very courteous in helping us with our request .....the drinks were fabulous we will be back for spring training.....the W and Scottsdale beautiful together....."}
{"text":"W Pool is probably the best place in Scottsdale if you are looking for a pool party. The pool is super nice but a little small. The area surrounding the pool is really cool. The deck can get hot so bring sandals. Drinks are a little pricy and there is a coved charge on the weekend. It's always an awesome time there though. It's less rowdy than the Pool at Maya, more chill"}
{"text":"Just came back from a girls trip to Scottsdale. We rented a daybed at the W on Sat. The pool party was awesome. Best time ever!"}
