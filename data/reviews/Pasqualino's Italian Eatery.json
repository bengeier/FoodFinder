{"text":"My husband and I ordered 2 speg and meatball dinners. When we got home we had 1 chicken parm, even though we paid for our original order. It's too far to go back and to tell the truth It wasn't that great anyway. Make sure to check your orders b4 you leave."}
{"text":"First time for a long time that my family and I have eaten here.Our waitress was nice we were seated and there was about 3 other couples and a family there.So my hubby and I both got chicken parm over whole wheat linguine it was OK at best the breading had a fishy taste like it was fried with old grease.it is sun. Mind you so it should not be where there drink machine just happens to run out when we asked for another diet coke.the sauce was just bland and really canned looking.not very good.For what it is worth not coming back for a while.Very disappointed with the quality and overall taste.Mama pasquelino would also be dissapointed."}
{"text":"I ordered a take-out of the stuffed shells. The shells were kind of small. For $8 I received 2 rather small shells, small chunk of bread and 1 meatball which seemed to be more \"filler\" than meat. The bread was good. The shells, albeit small, was pretty good and sauce was ok, not too heavy or too light. However, it was like I just ate some appetizer only and was still a little hungry after finishing my dinner.  I would have thought for $8 there would have at least included a small or tiny dinner salad. 

I may impulsively be back as they are in a good location for drive-byes for take-out and just try something else another time."}
{"text":"The steak um hoagie was almost okay but for no real flavor or meat, and I've never thrown away leftover pizza before, reminded me of bad pizza day in 2nd grade. Horrible, never will go again"}
{"text":"Bad.bad.when we arrived they were painting the lines to the parking spaces at 5 o'clock on a busy Friday afternoon.  They had no wine to choose from as the waitress said they were busy that afternoon and no one went to get the liquor order.  Ordered to go, ordered what I always do. Pene Ala vodka w/a meatballs.  Get home no meatballs.  I will not be back. Plus what I ordered when I got home not good.  Who is running this place.  Used to be good.  Now not at all.  Don't waste your money."}
{"text":"The last 3 visits extremely disappointing. Regularly travel from Mt Pleasant to enjoy stuffed shells. They no longer look or taste as they previously did. They look flat & cheese tastes microwaved with sauce dumped on top. Salad was a huge bowl with Fris√©e & Endive sprinkled with black olives. We often use your catering (shells) and have been completely satisfied.  Waitress so so."}
{"text":"Have eaten here many times. Overall solid quality food. Way too much marinara on the plate. Like the food."}
{"text":"Everything is amazing. The wedding soup is authentic and delicious. Minimal seating is really their only downfall."}
{"text":"My parents absolutely love this place.  Just tried it for the second time this week and am still boggled as to why.

First off, no complaints about the service.  Very happy with that.

Appetizers: we tried to get the calamari...they were out.  Sad!  We opted for mozzarella sticks instead, which were solidly mediocre.  Parents got the chicken fingers which were actually quite good.

I got the pasta siderno...it was, to put it mildly, not good.  \"Tossed in olive oil\" is apparently another word for, \"no sauce, no flavor.\"  Very very dry.

I tried my mom's stuffed shells which she absolutely raves about.  The shells weren't too bad, the meatballs were a little mealy.  But she loves them, too.

Dessert was the highlight of the night.  Pretty good tiramisu; obviously frozen but it was defrosted correctly and had lost none of its flavor.  (You would be surprised how many places kill their tiramisu; ice crystals left in the dessert will just murder it.)  My mother and I planned on splitting the dessert; she wanted to take her half home, I wanted to eat mine in-house.  Instead of splitting it the waiter just gave us an extra tiramisu for free.  Awesome!  The highlight of the night.  If the food isn't great, at least the service is.  That kind of service will keep my parents coming back again and again.

I dunno, I wasn't impressed, but I live in Columbus OH now and we have some great food options.  You're a little more limited in Irwin PA.  My parents seem to love it, maybe you will too, as long as you don't regularly eat in Pittsburgh or other cities (which generally have higher food quality due to all the competition) - if you do, I think you will be disappointed."}
{"text":"Amazing service and AMAZING food. Great for a family dinner or romantic dinner. Very clean and the atmosphere is great.  I would HIGHLY recommend this restaurant for your next family dinner, business lunch or if you are just in the mood for great food."}
{"text":"Their meatballs are the best in the Pittsburgh area and their homemade bread was great too.  Nice cozy Italian restraunt. Great experience. Sammie our waitress was nice and professional. I see a couple bad reviews which seem baseless. Don't let anyone keep you from trying this place. I grew up on homemade Italian food and this is as close as you can get to authentic. If you like real Italian food then you'll love this place but if you like imitation like olive garden then this might not be for you."}
{"text":"Went to the restaurant for the first time since they opened the new location. I had the bolognese, which was really good. I know a number of the staff and several of them stopped by say what up! Bar is pretty slick, will have to stop by for drinks."}
{"text":"My wife and I highly recommend Pasqualino's! The food is amazing!!! And is authentic as it gets, and I lived in Italy! I love the atmosphere and the service is outstanding. Very cozy!"}
{"text":"This place has amazing food!!! I didn't try the wedding soup so i cannot say anything good nor bad about it. Bill and I both ordered the diavalo marinara (penne, chicken, sausage, mushrooms, hot peppers, and marinara), which was exceptionally good!!! We both ordered the small portion, (which was big in itself!!! ) I wondered what the large or family portion looked like.... The wait staff was very attentive, we didn't have to wait long to get a refill on our drinks, and in addition to that the refills on the bread kept coming as well....The prices are very affordable here, and its a nice place to take the family. The only downside to this place ( that's why its getting 4 instead of 5 stars) is the appetizers. We ordered the cheese sticks, which cost $4.99, and when it arrived at the table, there were only 4 small cheese sticks, um... can you say RIP OFF!!!!. OH, if you're looking for a quite romantic time here, forget that...the place is so small, you can hear the conversations of drunk women across the room very clearly ( yes, this did happen to us yesterday) But all and all , this is very good place to eat out if you like Italian food, and you'll save money here rather than going to the Olive garden."}
{"text":"After hearing really good things about this place, I was excited to try it. My dinner was horrible, the service was friendly but lacking. I ordered the fettucine alfredo, which was not fully cooked and the sauce had no taste whatsoever.  I also paid to add chicken to it, which was a few tiny pieces of rubbery, inedible chicken.  My husband's pasta was not much better.  By the time the server finally came to check on us 20 minutes after we got our dinner, we just asked for the check and left.  It seems like a nice atmosphere, but we won't be coming back to give this place a second chance."}
{"text":"Good service. Decent red sauce on the Mamma Mia pasta which you can order w whole wheat linguini -- bonus!! Cappellini pomodoro was covered in diced tomato and good garlic flavor. Ordered meatball appetizer that comes w four meatballs and generous sauce/melted cheese which was great to add to the cappellini and linguini dishes. We ordered the small size which was more than ample. The Italian rolls were very wet on the bottom and undercooked. They can do better on that. Overall good food for the price. Ladies room was very clean & neat."}
{"text":"This place is small but has a nice atmosphere. It has a great selection of items on the menu. If you like thick pizza this is the place to come. You can order your crust several different ways if thick crust isn't for you."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good. I had the pasta with meatballs. Sause was good meatballs good. My wife had the lasagna she said she liked it. The food took a little time to come out but they were busy."}
{"text":"I ordered from the catering menu for a very important lunch for a large group. It was a fantastic experience from talking to the owner Don and their delivery driver. The food was delicious and they even set it up for us. I would highly recommend them and would love to take my family to enjoy their delicious food."}
{"text":"Dropping this review another 1/2 star if I could. Service was slow and incomplete. Waitress doesn't bother to ask you which of their sauce to go on you pasta nor which kind of 4 crusts for your pizza. I guess she will bring you what she wants. Last time tried their Sicilian square pizza. For my taste it is way over the top. I am downgrading this place one star from my former review (4 stars) due to this. This pizza was way overloaded with toppings and the crust was not even close to the tasty thin pizza they have. Don't get me wrong. We have liked the other meals we have had and are big fans of the thin pizzas. Beware though, if you order sausage on your pizza it is an italian sausage sliced in to slices and they put a lot on there. 

I am just disappointed that there was such a great disparity between their pizzas and they don't seem to know it. FYI - I am a big fan of a good Sicilian pizza - Check out my review of La Tavola."}
{"text":"Always my favorite - a true hidden gem for Italian food! Nicely priced and generous portions. The dinner was as big as my face. The place is a little small so it does get crowded at times, but I believe that speaks more to its quality."}
{"text":"Great little Italian gem!     :)

This is a really small Italian restaurant which I would say is family-run.

PROS:  
Casual Dress Code
Good Food
Moderate Pricing
Full Bar
Small Restaurant (a plus in my book--diminishes that cold, chain-restaurant feeling and replaces it with intimacy :)

CONS:
Service has been inconsistent, but the last two times it has been good.
Parking is a shared lot in a very small shopping strip, so it can be tricky @ times.

Lots of great items on the menu and they have three basic sauces to choose from on the menu.
A basic spaghetti red sauce, a meat sauce--i believe--and a really tasty mushroom-cream sauce.

There is a nice little bar area, so one can have a glass of vino with their dinner and its also good for groups, but def call ahead for that kind of stuff.

Jeans and nicer shirt are adequate here--these little places can be a bit confusing on dress code if you've never been in, but jeans are just fine.

My Fave:  Homemade Gnocchi in the Mushroom-cream sauce!  
nom nom nom!  :)"}
{"text":"I have never had Wedding soup with chicken in it but theirs is awesome. Highly recommended!

Service was slow to start."}
{"text":"Great service and an excellent pizza!  Highly recommend the Tuscan Harvest pizza."}
{"text":"I'm going to start with the good. The food here is very good and is priced very well for the massive amount of food you get for the dinner portions. My personal favorite is the gnocchi with vodka sauce. I honestly crave it more often than I should.

Unfortunately the good here is overshadowed by the bad service that I've had there the past few times has kept me from coming back. We had a server that didn't refill water, never have us our bread, and wouldn't acknowledge us even if we tried to get her attention. I honestly haven't been there for about a month, and I hope that, when I most definitely return due to the quality of the food, the service matches the excellence of their food."}
{"text":"Mmmmmmmmm

Mmmmm

good lasagna.
great wedding soup.
Good pepperoni pizza.
Affordable.

If this place was in Texas, you'd have customers out the door.
I was so happy to get real lasagna.  Not the fanciest place, its in a strip mall, but if you want good Italian food and casual atmosphere... go here. Forget Olive Garden up Route 30 and for the same price get the real deal."}
{"text":"We ordered a to go. The girl who took our order had such attitude it was hard to even talk to her. And then she got the order wrong in the end. We called the manager when we got home to tell him we were charged wrong and had the wrong food and he didn't want to hear it and hung up on us.Food was ok but cold. Probably won't be back for along time."}
{"text":"great food as always havent been here in years the place is small sometimes you have to wait never had a problem keep up the good work dom"}
{"text":"Ugh.  Had a not so great experience here tonight.  First off, the bread came out, warm and not cooked all the way.  The pizza was ultra thin... i'm talking paper thin and not crispy.  My partner's pasta aglia & olio was garlic(k)y like it was supposed to be, but it also had a fishy taste to it.  I don't think I'll be back after this experience."}
{"text":"I've been here on several occasions and the place does not disappoint. The food is good overall. I personally have never had anything that I didn't like. On my most recent visit, I went with my parents - mom had the Margherita pizza. I had a bite of hers. She loved it; but it was a little too thin for my taste. Dad had the Diavalo Marinara and loved it. I opted for a large Chicken Caesar Salad but got the house Italian dressing instead of Caesar dressing. This is basically because I prefer romaine lettuce over iceburg. Let me just say that this salad was huge! And...it was only $7.99! Most places you would have paid at least ten bucks or more for the same thing. And the house dressing was very good. 

I have to say that the service is also consistently good. A few months ago, my husband and I came here - I got a Caesar side salad and he got the wedding soup and we split a pepperoni pizza. The waitress came out to tell us that they burnt the crust a little and were going to make us a new pie. Well, my husband will eat anything and is beyond polite...so he insisted that they bring it out to us anyways. (And don't let him fool you...he's thin but he can put away the food!) Well, the waitress brings out the pizza. The cook cut some of the crust off and you 1) couldn't tell it was even burnt and 2) tasted delicious. They bring us out a second pizza anyways... free of charge! We end up taking the second pizza home. Voila! Lunch for the next day!

Other Pros: Small, cozy atmosphere, restaurant and restrooms are clean, fast and friendly service

Cons: It's next to a UPS store and a Supercuts, so the parking is a little tough at times. Also, they took the calamari off of the menu, which was one of my favs! Still, not enough to knock this little gem down a star!"}
{"text":"I live in a California and every time I come home to visit I come here to eat.  I am never disappointed by the food.  I always get the salad with house dressing and wedding soup in addition to any entree i order."}
{"text":"I came here with my aunt this weekend and it is a nice, cozy Italian family restaurant. The menu has a lot of great choices and the prices are really reasonable for what you get. 

First, let me just say that any place where I can get 2 tasty entrees, 2 salads, and 2 glasses of wine for less than $30 is awesome in my book! I salivate over checks that small since living in DC is a constant drain on the wallet. 

We both had house salads with blue cheese dressing, and I ordered the eggplant parmesan (though it is called something different on their menu). The salad was pretty big and the dressing was really good--so strange that this is a notable fact--but it was thick and creamy and delicious! The eggplant parm was nothing to write home about as it was evident that the eggplant patties were previously frozen and when I tried to scrape some of the breading off there was basically one centimeter of something that could qualify as eggplant inside. It was served on a bed of pasta, though, which made it plenty substantive. The house wine was also decent. 

Definitely not a bad meal if you're in the North Huntingdon area!"}
{"text":"First off the food is a 5 tastes great and is a great value. However our service was awful the waitress could not count she said that we had 7 drinks but brought out 6, and forgot to enter an order mine in fact, nothing too difficult just a chicken Ceasar salad this after she tried to bring us someone else's bambino pizza. She came back when she realized that she entered a club salad instead of a Ceasar, really. The worst part is this was our fourth time there and at least the second time with her and she was bad then. The rest of the staff was nice and friendly I can only assume that she must be related. In honesty it would be great if she used a pad and paper as she can't remember. Otherwise like I said we liked the food and everyone else was fine. In the past when a waitress would screw up like that I have seen where they compensate you for the mistake but not here once again must be related. Beware the little black haired one who did not care to pay attention to the customer. It will be some time before we go back."}
{"text":"Great food, great staff. Whether you are looking for great Italian meal or just a pizza you can't go wrong here. The restaurant is a bit small, it is well worth the wait if they are full. One surprise was the homemade chocolate chip cookies. I highly recommend the pasta diavilo, gently spicey but flavorful."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here for a late lunch at 3:00. We were both on our hour lunch break from work. I ordered a small cheese pizza and he ordered a grilled chicken salad.  There were only two other tables of two in the entire restaurant.  We place our order and 40 minutes in we still haven't gotten our food and we can blatantly smell something burning.  Five minutes later our server comes over and said the pizza was burnt.  She said it would be another 10 minutes to make a new one.  At this point we have to go back to work.  I'm not sure how it would take any restaurant over 40 minutes to make a small cheese pizza and grilled chicken salad when there were a total of 4 other people in the place.  We had to run through a drive thru somewhere else and scarf down some food at work. Extremely disappointing and unacceptable."}
{"text":"Pasqualino's is one of our local favorites.  The service is friendly and prompt, and the food is consistently good.  Yesterday, we had the Mediterranean salad with chicken (delicious) and eggplant parm (it's called something different on the menu, however).  Excellent.  Try the stuffed banana peppers, too.  Their prices cannot be beat.  My in-laws from the south hills always request to go here when they are in the neighborhood.  Nice atmosphere, friendly service, quality food, good prices, what else do you need?"}
