{"text":"They have an actual chef. You can request more spice bold flavors and if it's the right night just ask the chef to pick. I believe the frutti to be the single best play on sea food I have ever had."}
{"text":"Absolutely a great service experience and food experience. All six of us were very satisfied with food quality, atmosphere and service. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a real foodie experience."}
{"text":"Where do I start? My wife and I including our families have been coming to Pranzo since I could remember. Birthdays, graduations, anniversaries, celebrations, date nights, long nights and special days. In the summer we love to dine outside on beautiful patio and in the cooler months we enjoy the cozy inside by the fireplace. Every time we go it's always the best food and wonderful service. Every time! Regardless if my wife and I go on a Friday evening after a long tough work week or a Saturday celebration with the whole family; Pranzo never disappoints. This is our \"go to place\"  Food: Excellent food and HUGE portions. Quality matches Quantity here which is extremely hard to do in today's world. Most menu items and dishes are cooked in their outside wood fire oven. Please get a wood fire pizza even if it's just an appetizer. The pizza is so good, so fresh, so amazing. Most of their pasta is homemade and extremely delicious. They pair the pastas with an array of marrinaras and cream sauces. Try the cavatteli with cream sauce this is a fan favorite with our whole family. You will leave with a smile on your face as the homemade pasta is cooked perfectly swimming in a big bowl of creamy sauce. Me? I always order the fabulous veal parmesan that comes with penne pasta. I can litterally write a whole review just on this dish its that good, but I am going to be short sweet and simple: Order it!!!! All dinners come with a tasty salad as well. Even the complimentary bread is wonderful and could probably be a $5-6 dollar app on other places menus.   Drinks: Good drink menu but what I love about Pranzo is that it's BYOWine for a small fee. Tip- bring a big bottle! :)   Service: Service is always great! Fast friendly and always going above and beyond. I feel like we have had every server in the establishment and never had an issue. Great people.  All around great place!"}
{"text":"The scallops were absolutely delicious, and this would have been a 5-star review, but the waiter was the rudest I've ever had. I asked him a question about the menu, and rather than answering me or politely telling me that he'd be back momentarily to go over the menu, he coarsely said, \"I'll tell you when I come back.\" When I was ordering, the scallop dish that I selected came with a choice of risotto or ravioli. I asked if I could please substitute asparagus for the pasta, and the waiter responded, \"It doesn't come with pasta.\" I replied, \"I thought ravioli was a pasta.\" He glared at me. Even if the scallops didn't come with pasta, which they did, that wouldn't be an appropriate answer."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant !!! Fresh food ... It's fancy restaurant classic ... Not bar or fast food .. valet parking next door .. Easy .."}
{"text":"Was there last night with a party of 8!  Service was very good!  Everyone enjoyed their food from start to finish!!  Apps were very tasty!"}
{"text":"No more BYOB!!  Increased prices!! Super disappointed. Used to love it here but you can no longer bring your own wine or beer or liquor and their prices have skyrocketed!! Not worth the cost. Little Italy is 20 minutes away with half the prices and better food."}
{"text":"The food was so-so at best and really OVER-PRICED.   Does anyone remember when Pranzo was located on Vine Street, in a hole in the wall ?  And their prices were much, much less ?    Well, it's the exact same food only they charge much more now that they moved to downtown Willoughby.  It's just not worth it.  Save your money and go to Davatino's or Mama Roberto's."}
{"text":"We use to come here once a week (about 2 years ago), now we hesitate to keep trying it and last night proved why..once again!       Can't really mess up caprese pasta, there were no complaints there, but the eggplant parm & filet were definitely lacking! Cutting into my filet, it came apart in layers (top half from bottom half)-It didn't slice right. Almost like it was frozen & boiled! It was grey, rubbery, unseasoned, watery (not juicy) & worried me. I showed the server how weird the filet looked but he wasn't interested. I can't get over how strange it looked! It definitely wasn't a filet! Not worth $25 by any means- do not waste your $! They use to do seasoned filet medallions over mushroom risotto which was great, but now quality is just gone. Eggplant-bland & had no spice (asked for an 8 of 10 spiciness) & the last 3 times here gave us all stomach problems. Sad it's gone so downhill! No more trust here at all."}
{"text":"The good...Went with a party of four and got seated right away for our reservation time.  And that is where the good ended.   The bad... wait staff unatttentive would be putting it nice.  Food average at best.   Try this place once put don't expect a lot, or just do yourself a favor and skip it."}
{"text":"When you think of downtown Willoughby, late night drinking is what usually comes to mind (come on, most of us have been there), but Pranzo now brings fine dining to this little strip of bars.  Two things right off the bat - take advantage of the free valet parking (unless you feel like walking or are one of the lucky few to get preemo street parking) and make reservations.    Once seated in the cozy restaurant (sometimes TOO cozy - seating is VERY tight), your server will uncork your bottle of wine or graciously take your 4 or 6 pack of beer and keep it chilled in the kitchen until you're ready for another.  Oh yeah, one other important thing - it's BYOB!  The menu is somewhat on the small side, however the selections are great.  I would suggest salad (the arugula and fennel is a favorite) and a flatbread pizza.  This will be MORE than enough food and I always end up splitting the pizza with someone and still have food to take home.  Prices for entrees range from relatively cheap to pretty darn expensive, but I will say the pricier options are worth it - and besides, you're not paying an arm and a leg for those glasses of wine or beer that you'll consume throughout your meal.    There is a cute patio out back if you're in the mood for outdoor scenery and I will say that the seating is much more spaced out.  Overall, there is much to be enjoyed about Pranzo."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the top Italian restaurants in the Cleveland area. In my opinion it is better than any establishment on Murray Hill.  This is my first review of Pranzo, but I have now been 3 times.  Each time the experience has been more enjoyable. The restaurant is somewhat cramped, but don't let that steer you away. They don't sell alcohol, so it is bring your own booze!  We always bring a bottle or two of our favorite wine. As for starters, I have had the bruschetta and meatballs.  The bruschetta was out of this world fresh. Others use a spread, this is all fresh tomatoes and basil.  The meatballs were cooked perfectly and were soft on the inside. I hate when places overcook them or make them to dense.  Its about the meat, not the bread crumbs! The main courses are unique and most offer fresh cooked pasta.  Overall, a great local place that has excellent food and is the exact atmosphere I have been looking for."}
{"text":"pizza is like art, .... and as such people appreciate different types, and as such needs   to be categorized when evaluating, thin crust pies, medium, deep dish, sheet, ect..  http://www.passion-4-pizza.com/types-of-pizza.html  pranzo makes one of my favorite pizzas on the planet!  thin crust, neopolitan style (or NY style for my bronxs bomber friends), that is crispy and made to order in the stone oven on the patio.    their home made pastas are also a real treat as well as the wood burning oven roasted duck, salmon, basa, beef tenderloin and lamb!   they also offer season specialties like pan sauted zuchinni blossums, chianti rissotto, roman gnocci, and polenta, along with standards like calamari    did i mention its a BBYO joint"}
{"text":"I've been to Pranzo three times and each time I have tried something new and it has been delicious! The prices are very reasonable and I love the fact that it is BYOB since there aren't too many places like that in Cleveland. The service is excellent and the staff is also very friendly. I would also say that the portions are very generous as well so you are usually able to bring some home. Love this place!!"}
{"text":"If you have time to wait, and love eggplant parm go. Best eggplant parmesan I ever ate.  Arugula fennel salad great too. Eggplant is not breaded but loaded with cheese basil layers. Service is typically slow here but generous portions. Worth the wait. You can bring your own bottle of wine or get one there. Staff is friendly. Baked penne and white fish also delicious."}
{"text":"It's been awhile but I wanted to add my 2 cents. Got the lasagna special. I vaguely remember it being excellent. Then I got the bill. $24 for lasagna that came with a crappy iceberg lettuce salad which included yellow core nastiness. Are you serious? It's lasagna! It doesn't get much cheaper to make. $16, MAYBE. And this was our second attempt to dine here as we had previously and a bit rudely been denied for the lack of a reservation. If you've seen the movie then you will understand - \"Claw, you're welcome\".  If you haven't seen the movie then just think - self righteous - and you will understand the vibe here."}
{"text":"Another great meal at Pranzo.  Made reservations a few days ahead and the place was full so it was a good thing.  Had a window seat.  Ordered the Beef Braciole (sp?) and took half of it home since it included a salad and bread. Love the BYOB policy, saves on the usual 100% plus markup on wine.  Paid the $2 corkage fee PP and my wife and I enjoyed our wine with meal.  Ben was our server and he does an exceptional job, we asked if we can request him on future visit."}
{"text":"Food was great and service was excellent! We brought our own wine, and ordered a variety of pastas and apps. Everything was melt-in-your-mouth delicious, and we left feeling fat and happy. It was everything I hoped an Italian restaurant [in Cleveland] would be!"}
{"text":"We were delighted with our meal. Good service and good wine at this Main Street Italian eatery.  Perfect date night"}
{"text":"Pranzo is a modern Italian restaurant with a contemporary interior and a brick pizza oven in the kitchen. The food menu is extensive, with choices ranging from pizza to chicken to seafood and a selection of different pastas, which includes gnocchi, ravioli, penne, and spaghetti.   The bread was fabulous and is served with every entree. After much debate, I opted for the Gnocchi alla Ranallo, which was dressed in a lovely cream sauce - simply heaven on a plate! I will definitely be back here to try the other dishes, and so should you!"}
{"text":"As I've pounded into your thick skulls about 100x now, I'M ITALIAN. So, like, I rarely eat at Italian restaurants because they just don't do much for me. Most of them anyway.   Pranzo did something for me though. Their pasta was just as good as my nonna's macarones. I honestly wasn't too impressed with the wood-fired flat bread we got. It wasn't terrible but I've had much better. I dunno, I think they may have just cheaped out on the toppings.   This place has great ambiance. It's very Tuscan-esque (that's a real word.) However, if I were you, I would sit on the patio if it's a nice night. It's cozy, adorable, and lovely. Plus you can smell that beautiful wood-fired oven smell out there.   If you're smart, you'll bring your own wine or beer or whatever sort of cocktails you'd like. We didn't remember this place was BYOB and so we just drank water. Booooring. Some people had fully stocked coolers out on the patio. Friggin' smartasses."}
{"text":"I came here thinking this was a pizza joint.  Don't let the name fool you.  This restaurant is definitely a fancier Italian place.  Nevertheless, we ate here and had a good experience.  The combination of prompt service and wonderful authentic Italian food won me over.  In particular, the pumpkin tortellini as well as the eggplant flat bread were both fantastic.  Prices are definitely a bit steep; however given the generous portion sizes and the high quality of the food you tend to get what you pay for.  The addition of complementary valet parking seals the deal.  So why 4 stars?  Maybe I'm being superficial, but I still feel like I was played.  Drop the \"pizza\" from the name so as to not be misleading!"}
{"text":"So who gets excited about pasta anymore, right?    Last night I ordered the Mussels Marinara sautéed with white wine, butter, garlic, parsley and marinara and then tossed with spaghetti.  Yep, spaghetti.  And I was served the absolutely perfect spaghetti al dente along with a wonderful marinara sauce.  I had a little cheese put on it, and I was in seventh heaven.  It is wonderful when something so simple is done so right.  My wife had the fish, I think it's called basa.  She enjoyed it.  We shared a bottle of Kim Crawford Savignon Blanc which was a perfect complement to both our entrees."}
{"text":"Pranzo is one of the many dining choices in Downtown Willoughby, Ohio...a suburb northeast of Cleveland. This Italian restaurant specializes in wood-fired meats, fish and pizza, as well as traditional pasta and seafood or poultry dishes. It seems to be a decent place for dinner, but it did not knock my socks off during my first visit.  Our table of four shared a 10\" pepperoni pizza appetizer called the Dominic. It was not too bad, but the crust was not caramelized as it should be coming from a wood-fired oven and the sauce was not as zesty as pizza sauce could be. Maybe not enough oregano? Not sure. Anyway, the pizza was great for four people, but would have been too much for a smaller group.  I had the chicken parmigiana, which comes with a dinner salad. (They also have bread sticks with olive oil and balsamic dipping sauce...just so-so in the taste department.) The chicken parm was nicely breaded and fried slightly crispy. The chicken was slightly overdone, but acceptable. The cheese was melted well and covered a generous portion of the patty. However, the tomato sauce (again) left me wanting more taste. Had they given me more zest and tang in the sauce, I might had thought about 4 stars, but I just can't go there.  Additionally, the service was friendly, but deathly slow. We weren't in a hurry, but we would have been irritated if we were it seemed we had one server for the entire one side of the restaurant. Lastly, they are a BYOW (bring your own wine) place, so grab a bottle of red before you come or face the consequences.  Overall, Pronzo was a slightly above average meal with just average amenities. I have definitely tasted better Italian cuisine in Cleveland...and had a better experience. However, this one is likely worth a try at least once if you're in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I will say up front I am a food snob when it comes to Italian food - I am Italian and my Mother and Grandmother (95 years young), as well as aunts, etc, are excellent cooks. Add to this I am a New Yorker, so you know I am going to be a pain in the ass when it come to Italian food.  This place was great. We had the meatball appetizer and a burrata appetizer - both excellent.  Then we had the chicken parmigiana and the eggplant parmigiana - both excellent!!!  Service was great - very attentive, remembered special requests and even went the extra mile to make things just right. Will definitely be back!!!!!!"}
{"text":"#1 rule of reservations.  Have the table ready.  Especially when you are dead.   25 minute wait for a 7 pm res.  sat on patio, table was falling apart.  Wobbly where I was concerned it was going to fall apart.  Pranzo seems to be aging poorly; it's in need of some repairs...broken lights, faded/peeling lacquer on wood doors.    I had Chicken Parm.  Was okay, chicken was greasy.  Was pounded flat (which I like) but was not left to drain.  I guess.   Server seemed frazzled and a bit stretched.  She also had a large party of obnoxious kids at the next table.   Started raining and moved inside no problem.  Ordered dessert and took a while to get it.  Get it together, Pranzo."}
{"text":"great meal which includes side of pasta, small salad & thee BEST homemade bread! nice atmo. everyone on staff goes out of their way to please - Excellent service!!"}
{"text":"Every dish is awesome! Excellent service. If you can, treat yourself to something that can be cooked on the wood fire grille. Seafood,  pasta, steaks, pizza are the best in town. Took a tour of the kitchen,  very clean and organized."}
{"text":"Everything about this restaurant is fantastic! The ambiance, the menu, the staff is all five stars. The specials change constantly with fresh, house made choices. You can start with a bottle of wine (they have bottles starting at $25), and enjoy fresh bread and dipping sauce while you wait for your meal. I ordered the shrimp linguine in a Rosemary cream sauce, which was fantastic. They have a great selection of Italian desserts as well. This is my favorite date night restaurant. My fiancé and I ordered a bottle of wine, the stuffed hot peppers appetizer and two entrees. Our bill was just shy of $100, but there were both cheaper and more expensive options as well. If you're looking for a rustic, upscale Italian restaurant, this is it!"}
{"text":"Nice place! Fun, happy, great food! The best thing, is you can bring your own wine for a small fee!"}
{"text":"A lot can change in 4 years. But in the 4 years since I've been to Pranzo, I think my life has changed a heck of a lot more than the restaurant has.   I still think they serve solid, if not pricey, Italian fare. I'm not cheap when it comes to food, but...I still feel like you pay more than you would elsewhere. (I.E. cavatelli at Trattoria in Little Italy = $9 cavatelli here = ~$15) They now sell alcohol, too, but you can still BYO for a small fee.   I will give Pranzo points for being vegan friendly. My waitress told me that everything is made to order and just about anything could be veganized. I asked for suggestions on what to get and she got a little huffy with me, but it was a busy Saturday night. I ended up with a mountain of penne pasta in a tomato sauce with a hodge podge of veggies - peppers, onions, broccoli, and more. (I'm not sure how much I was charged for my meal because someone else picked up the tab.) It was ok. I appreciate that the chef made me something special, though.  What was incredibly good was the bruschetta. It had lots of fresh garlic and was really flavorful.   Although this isn't my thing, they let my mother bring in a cake to be served after dinner and were really nice about it. They brought the cake out with a candle and some plates.   Overall, this is a nice little place in downtown Willoughby that will satisfy you if you're looking for an upscale Italian meal."}
{"text":"Great Italian restaurant and perfect for date night!  The homemade pastas are great very fresh, ordered the lobster papparadelle. The only complaint was that the pasta was all stuck together in a clump, but it was still tasty.  The pizzas are made in a wood burning oven and pretty authentic, great for sharing as an appetizer or main dish.  I love the idea of a BYOB, it's fun to bring our own an in pretty sure they don't charge a corkage fee.  I also love the bread they serve with oil to dip as well as the salad with homemade dressing.  Even though the place is pretty small and tight quarters it is fun to go as a group as well and each bring a bottle of wine to share together at the table. I did see people bring beer and liquor as well as a different option."}
{"text":"My friends and I go here quite often because it is a wonderful atmosphere with a great wine selection.   We have had a variety of appetizers and entrees. My personal favorite is the calamari and my friend is obsessed with their lobster ravioli.  I recently got the wild salmon that was a special and unfortunately I wasn't fan. It was over cooked and lacked flavor.   Overall though, we cannot get enough of this place and we keep coming back for more!"}
{"text":"Okay...this place is an incredible find...especially for those who would love to bring their OWN favorite bottle of wine to drink with their dinner.  I have done a lot of fine dining and will say if you can get the Purse Pasta enclosed with a Black Truffled Cream Sauce (Sacchetti?), then you most likely will think you have died and gone to food heaven.  It is absolutely one of the best pasta's I have ever tasted!  The fennel and Arugula salad rocks as do many of the Risotto's.  Also, if Ben is working, you should most definitely ask for him.  He is an amazing server and watching him serve is performance art!"}
{"text":"Very good food and the price was reasonable for the quality and atmosphere.   I have to say I wish there was a place like Pranzo when I was drinking. The bring your own beer or wine style really saves money. This type of restaurant would surely charge top dollar for beers and wines. You also do not have to rely on the restaurant's wine selection. The choice is limitless.  I do however have to rate my overall experience as poor since the valet service, Park Avenue, really blew the night up for me. First, the man who took my keys seems uninterested in me in many ways. I guess he may have judged his potential tip by the car I drive. Being a 2010 Mazda, I imagine it did not compare to some of the of the other cars (I am only saying this in retrospect since I can figure no other reason for the mans cold attitude and I would not have thought of it had this been the only issue).  When dinner was over I went outside to give my ticket to the attendant. This attendant seemed either overwhelmed or just ignorant to me standing outside waiting to give him my ticket. Then the guy jumped into a car and left for several minutes to park the car without looking to me. When he returned once again he went to another arriving car. I now called to him and he said to give him a minute. Funny I had already given him 15 to 20 minutes in 30 degree weather, but I did.  When he finally took my ticket he could not find my keys. He looking on the board and then I looked after him. Sure enough the keys were not there. The man then said he was going to go find the other person who parked my car, and he left for another several minutes. When he returned he helped another person get their car checked in but when I went to ask him what was going on he put his finger in the air for me to wait.  After a few more minutes I asked my wife to see if she had her set of keys. She did, so I began walking through the lot behind the restaurant hitting the unlock button to track down the car. Sure enough I found it and pulled the car out.  I drove the car up to the front of the restaurant to wait for the man. As I stopped the car I saw someone in the lot and called back if he found my keys. The man said yes I dropped them and he walked over to where my car was parked and picked up a set of keys.  He was not an employee, but luckily he was a person walking out to his car while I was pulling out my car. He heard my keys fall on the ground. So it appears the first attendant must have left my keys on the car and went on to other people. Luckily I did not see anything missing from the car.  Due to the extra 45 minutes to an hour I waited to get our car back I have to say it ruined any good experience I had going to Pranzo.   The major reason I limit the times I go to downtown Willoughby for dinner is the pain of parking. My wife and I were planning on going to a movie after dinner and we chose Pranzo for the valet parking. NEVER AGAIN. We missed the movie and had to settle for just dinner and a parking fiasco instead.  This makes my overall experience of Pranzo as it sucked."}
{"text":"Second time visiting...Excellent service. Food was simply amazing. Was there for birthday dinner even other patrons wished me happy birthday.  Very intimate and wholesome. Very nice place. Lastly, it's a BYOB or you can purchase wine there either way you should dine it you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This was the fifth visit to Pranzo, five of us went for dinner and the food was amazing as always.  Everyone was extremely happy with their food, and it ran the gambit from lamb to flatbread pizza to salmon and gnocchi.   I had the gnocchi and it was amazing as always, and they even went so far as to grant me a special request to do something not on the menu.  We simply love this place but don't Forget, if you want a wonderful glass of wine, beer or a mixed drink you need to BYOB !  We can hardly wait till our next visit!"}
{"text":"I love this place!! Very authentic Italian food, wine and atmosphere! Everything is fresh and homemade and it's the only place that I have found amazing Cavatelli that's not in Little Italy!"}
{"text":"Great meal. The eggplant parm was fantastic and kale ravioli was also very good"}
{"text":"Menu had a nice selection of entrees, we opted for flatbreads - a bianco with feta and spinach and one with tomato sauce, cheese and eggplant. They were good, well at least the toppings were fresh and tasty; however, the bottom of both were completely burnt, like almost all black. I have had coal fired pizza before, but the crust never was that burnt. I would recommend asking waitress that the crust not be burnt or try another item, they had some really good specials.   We chose a wine bottle under the wines under $25, which is decent for the high mark up of wine at all restaurants.   The restaurant is small and cozy. The waitress and hostess were very friendly. Service was quick. I will probably be back to try something else."}
