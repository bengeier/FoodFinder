{"text":"Good food in a comfortable setting with frequently changing art for sale......kitchen is out front so you can watch the food prep.......very good service compared to other Pittsburgh restaurants. Couple dinner with a movie right next door at the Oaks Theatre and you've got an unbeatable combo."}
{"text":"Average food and atmosphere. Perfectly fine but not worth a special trip unless you are in Oakmont"}
{"text":"I made my way out to Boulevard Bistro a week ago and was fairly impressed by the quality of the food. The menu is a little small, but you can order off either the dinner or lunch menus, and they hit on just about every type of food you might be looking for. They also do a pretty good job presenting plenty of vegetarian options.

The food itself was presented fantastically and packed quite a bit of flavor with ingredient combinations and formats you might not have come across in the past.

One note: they're listed as BYOB in a couple of different places, but they also have a drink list (see the web site). The beer options are sparse, but could be worse (though not much). I would recommend bringing your own and sticking to food from Blvd.

I also did a full review on my pittsburgh restaurant blog...

{"text":"It's surprising it has taken me this long to review this place since it's in my hometown and I drive by it daily.  Oh well, that oversight was remedied today.  This is a small spot with a nice partially exposed kitchen with an open flame oven in plain view.  The space is small, warm and dimly lit.  There is nice local art on the walls and several booth type seating and a few tables.  It's a nice spot in the winter because of the exposed oven and it's even better in the summer because the large glass doors fully open to the sidewalk.  It's located next to a great little one screen cinema that typically shows some independent flicks.  Howeve, this weekend was madagascar  for the kiddies.  Nevertheless, you could make a nice date night by doing some shopping in the boutique shops that line the beautiful oakmont blvd., grabbing a bite and then seeing a flick.  Another benefit and one I appreciate more and more is that it's a byob which is especially helpful in this current economy.  They do charge a $10 corkage fee.  I had lunch here today and started with an above average tomato bisque.  The waitress Melissa nudged me a bit to try this, because like most of us when I think of tomatoe soup I'm thinking Campbells.  This was served with large chunks of delicious tomatoes in a creamy broth with some bacon added, because everything tastes better with bacon, even ice cream,, trust me.  This was the highlight of the meal, however the rest was about average.  I tried the \"baby\" burger which was a 4oz. serving as opposed to the 8 oz. typical serving.  I asked for medium this was a bit overcooked.  I'm guessing if I had a regular burger it would have been cooked fine.  It's served on a nice toasted bun with whatever options you want.  I tried the Bb mac n' cheese instead of the fries.  The mac n' cheese was truly engulfed in chedder cheese.  I know mac n' cheese is supposed to be heavy, but this kind of hit my stomach like a sock full of nickels.  It wasn't bad, but I would have preferred less hunks of cheese and more of a cheesy sauce.  Take this part of the review with a grain of salt.  I'm a big fan of mac' n cheese out of the box.  The bill was $17.50 + tip, which is probably a little pricier than it should be considering I got a cup of soup instead of a bowl and the \"baby\" burger.  The dinner menu seemed creative and most entrees' were under $20, so if you bring a bottle of wine it's probably a relatively inexpensive night out."}
