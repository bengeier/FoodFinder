{"text":"I took a trip out there last weekend after hearing their advertisement on the radio... Definitely worth the trek from the South Hills! 

Started off with getting the BBQ Shrimp appetizer, they were sweet and a little spicy but mainly delicious. 

Next thing that caught my eye was hand made ravioli, couldn't pass it up... and I was not dissapointed! Nice sized rav's stuffed with cheese and covered in a delicious marinara sauce. 

I'll be back! It's worth tasting!"}
{"text":"Really deserves 4.5 stars.  Hadn't been there in years, but had a really nice dinner with visiting family over this past weekend.  Good food, friendly and prompt service in an upscale semi-formal dining setting.  Will be looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"Food was very good, service was great. Was there for a large party of 15 and our waitress was awesome wish I could remember her name. The atmosphere was classy yet laid back"}
{"text":"Not great. Has the shrimp diavilo which had about a tablespoon of sauce and the sauce was not spicy at all. It had two shrimp and two scallops and a ton of pasta. Service was not bad but everyone I was with also was disappointed."}
{"text":"Must go to for fabulous food, great atmosphere, and exceptional service. I love this place so much that I had my daughters bridal shower there this month. It turned out FANTASTIC. I couldn't have asked for a better event. They made it perfect!!!"}
{"text":"Very close to the Marriott courtyard.   Service was extremely slow and food was ok.   Had the calamari for a starter which was good and huge.  Then had the shrimp and crab mac and cheese.   It's a pretty heavy meal."}
{"text":"Joe the Chef are finally trying to change the elegance back and the privacy we all shared:  I am not thrilled about the menus as of yet: I am thrilled for now it has turned slowly in an upper scale family place where they actually care.  most are a beautiful people and I am honored to eat there when I can. The  whole staff:,are people I am proud to be able to present to friends and family in this kind if atmosphere."}
{"text":"This place has revamped its menu and remodeled since the last time I was here.  Menu is now updated and more trendy, but the prices have increased as well.  I had the jerk shrimp the other night and my husband had the seafood risotto.  We also had bruschetta, calamari, French onion  soup and salads.  Everything was really tasty and came to the table with a great presentation.  I noticed that the crowd is older--we went on a Wednesday evening and were the youngest ones in the room (we are 48 yrs old).  I would think this would be a great place to bring extended family for a birthday dinner or father's day, etc."}
{"text":"I recently held a baby shower in the banquet room here for about 35 people. The room was beautiful, the staff was excellent and the food was all served beautifully and delicious. I received numerous compliments on the food and restaurant. We were so pleased with the whole experience. I highly recommend this restaraunt for an event or just a meal."}
{"text":"We had a great meal for Valentine's day.  The New York strip steaks were delicious.  We were seated right away even though the place was packed and our server Caitlin was friendly and checked on us several times throughout our meal.  Even the master chef stopped by to make sure our meal was to our satisfaction."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a very pleasant Thanksgiving here. We were traveling from Washington DC to Cleveland, and hoped to stop in Pittsburgh for a meal on the way. Wooden Nickel was one of the very few restaurants open, and it met our needs perfectly. 

My husband and I avoid gluten, and that is a challenge on a holiday, when restaurants are so busy. When I called to make a reservation, though, the hostess was very helpful, and let me speak directly to the chef. All of the staff, including the chef personally, were very welcoming when we arrived and throughout the meal. The dining room is attractive and warm, with noise at the \"cheerful background\" level - not dead, but easy to converse. 

The food was very good - we opted for the salmon alternative to turkey, and had a large piece of fish, perfectly cooked. Portions of sides were generous and varied. The price was an excellent value. Since it was a holiday, a 20% tip was included, and that seemed both appropriate and deserved. 

We are very happy we found Wooden Nickel. If we lived in the Monroeville area, it would definitely be a solid choice for frequent visits."}
{"text":"A unique jewel that is leagues above most chains.    Food is excellent.    Service is good.    A little too pricey for frequent dining, but an excellent choice for a special event or just when you want to treat yourself.     

My only suggestion to them for improvement is to either use larger coffee cups or provide the table a small coffee pot for self-refills."}
{"text":"The  Wooden Nickel is phenomenal! The best eatery in suburban Pittsburgh! Staff is superb! Crab cake melt sandwich is delectable!!!"}
{"text":"Do not host an event here!! I hate to write a bad review because the food is actually good and there are not many non-chain restaurants in Monroeville BUT the service is atrocious!! I hosted a Sunday event with nearly 40 people and they had two waiters working our party AND the entire rest of the restaurant. 

Drinks and water were slooooow to be refilled, food was slow, the waiters could never be found, alcoholic drinks were made wrong, we could not find anyone to bring the check, waiters were downright rude (I complained about slow service and one rudely commented \"I don't know what you're talking about, we were on you like white on rice\"). 

The very worst part? I brought it up to the owner who I worked with booking the event and instead of apologizing she had the nerve to argue with me that they were appropriately staffed with two people working all the tables in the entire restaurant and that I should have paid for my own bartender!!

Whatever happened to the customer is always right attitude? All it could have taken to turn my opinion around would be an apology, but instead I have to resort to a bad review to warn others away from a non-customer oriented business."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful dinner at the Wooden Nickel.  Each course was beautifully prepared and the quality was excellent.  The decor is very comfortable and while not trendy, it lends itself to romantic dinners as well as a great place to enjoy a night with family or friends. It is a keeper....one of those restaurants that deserves its longevity!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place when they reopened.... My wife and i used to go here when it was an old lady bar, and we always had the chicken Romano, which was the best we've had... New place has a nicer atmosphere for sure, but the food... Sorry but was just okay... Not anything exceptional... And man,i thought the prices were way high...i don't mind paying for a good meal.... But the key word i is \"good\".... It just gets an okay for me. Like i said, i was really hoping this was gonna be a great little find but unfortunately it was not. Two stars only since the prices were so much higher than they should be for the quality of the food."}
{"text":"I thought the place was going to be old and dingy for some reason but it was beautiful. Great location and parking. Quiet and out of the busy traffic. Very bright and up to date. Its traditional yet modern. Not too many places pamper you with nice table settings and decor. The music was pleasant. Staff well dressed and groomed. The food was right on. Menus were clean and easy to read. 
I ordered a mojito and the mint was picked fresh. The assorted breads were warm and flavorful. The service was right on. The pace was relaxed. 
No rush. The server's timing was perfect. 
Nearby table of guests was way too loud but we can't control the manners of others. 
The restaurant accepts reservations and the host greets you at the door. She actually opens the door for you. 
Oh... The portions are really large so think about taking some home. 
Monroeville is lucky to have a nice place like this. 
I will go again. I haven't tried the dessert yet."}
{"text":"Food was great, had the signature vanilla bean shrimp and scallops.. Absolutely delicious! The service was very good also, I would recommend giving this place a try.. One down side, it is a bit pricey."}
{"text":"With all the chain restaurants in monroeville it is a pleasure to find one that is unexpected and family owned. My wife and I ate here because of a friends recommendation and I am glad we did. The seafood is the freshest and best presented I have had in years. Their crab cakes are by far the best in the city!!!!  Try the meatloaf. Sounds crazy but wrapped in a smoked bacon with BBQ sauce and mashed potatoes... How could you go wrong. Make sure to drink one of the amazing scotches they have here too. I was shocked at the wine and scotch list. This place is a downtown restaurant out here in monroeville. Great to not have to drive through the tunnels... But worth driving through of your not from the east!"}
{"text":"We went to celebrate my father in law's birthday tonight and everything was wonderful!  Our server Lindsay was super awesome and very friendly! Food was great and the pulled pork nachos were some of the best I've ever had! The only negative thing was that they ran out of cheeseburgers so they must be good!  Fish sandwich was a fine second choice!"}
{"text":"This place is a dive. Maybe great for this area but don't expect much. Becomes a bar later at night."}
{"text":"On Sept 19 2014 the wooden nickel hosted my bridal dinner the food was great and the staff was so nice to my family and friends.They made my event a wonderful memory.The only thing l would complain about is we ordered off the buffet menu and we wasn't able to take the leftovers with us that was about 30 percent of food that when in the trash.But it is a fantastic place to any event.

{"text":"Meatloaf. Not exactly the first entree choice that comes to mind when being seated at the fireplace table of a fine dining establishment. Sipping on my tall, strong and delicious margarita, waiting for what would be our fresh, crispy fried calamari appetizer with just-spicy-enough red sauce to be brought to the table,  I mulled over the menu. The vanilla bean stuffed shrimp looked interesting enough (my boyfriend, who had enjoyed the shrimp before and insisted I try them, ended up ordering them so that I could do just that...and they were excellent. Balanced, with flakey crab and just a hint of vanilla, these were definitely worth venturing outside of my strictly savory comfort zone), and the salmon sounded tempting, but my eyes kept retreating to the ridiculously intriguing description of Not Your Mama's Meatloaf. The waitress (professional and attentive without smothering) returned. I committed. 

I was not disappointed.

When my main course appeared, I was presented with what appeared to be half of an entire meatloaf, wrapped in bacon, glazed in smokey sweet BBQ sauce, smothered in perfectly textured red skinned mashed potatoes, crispy onion straws and resting on fresh, thick, chewy rosemary bread. The meatloaf itself was so juicy and flavorful, it would've been sufficient even without all of the fixings. But despite the sheer volume of what was going on on that plate, every component worked together and achieved a deliciously balanced meal...the obligatory leftovers of which made an equally excellent second meal later that evening. 

Classic dining with modern culinary stylistic touches, perfect execution, excellent service...everything you would expect from a restaurant whose manager was inducted into the Chaîne des Rôtisseurs.

I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I really hate to do this but restaurant email doesn't accept emails for some reason.
Dine here on average every couple of months. Always loved the place until 5/12/13, Mothers Day. Holiday menu extremely limited. Potatoes were so bad...little squares that you probably could get at Dennys. No choice of sides...take what they give you. Ugh! We're still drinking water the day after food so salty. How about a baked potato? Prime rib was all gristle...totally inedible. No bread but saw only other table near us with patrons had some. Waiter so very bad. 
When seated a loud party was behind us. We asked to be moved because we really couldn't have conversation. We were told no by hostess because they were going to get busy. Guess what? No one came. Tables were empty all around us. The quality of food (except for crab cakes) was so far below it's usual fare. The waiter could have cared less if we were there or not. What a waste of money and disappointment on a holiday.
We'll be back...just never on a holiday."}
{"text":"Recent Sunday afternoon early dinner. Even my in-laws loved it, and they can be hard to please when it comes to restaurants!

Nice atmosphere without being stuffy or snooty. Service was great - friendly and respectful without all the annoying interruptions. Kept our wine glasses full! 

Food was fabulous, and the chef came around to thank his guests!"}
{"text":"OMG this place is awful !  We took my Mom here for dinner.....what a mistake......I had to laugh at the review below that described the atmosphere as a 'funeral parlor' LOL  That was my Moms first comment !!!!! When we were seated, she started looking around......I said \"What's wrong Mom?\"......she says \"I'm looking for the casket! I feel like I'm at a funeral home!\" .......my husband and I howled......anyway, the place is weird.....employees stood at bar and just looked at us LOL They all seem socially odd or backward. None of us liked ANY of our food.  I got the meatloaf.....menu says it has BBQ sauce on it......I asked if they could skip the sauce, they said OK.....well.....trust me......it NEEDS like a gallon of something to make it edible LOL OMG it was the absolute worst meatloaf I ever had anywhere in my entire life......I brought it home to my 3 dogs......they sniffed it, looked at it, took it hesitantly and I found it the next day under the dining room table LOL  The ONLY worthwhile thing about this place is that we still joke about it !!!! When we get in the car, to go out for dinner.....I always say \"OK folks, where do we wanna go?\"......one of us ALWAYS says \"Oh boy......we should go back to the wooden nickel!!!\"  It always starts our night with a laugh ! What a crappy, weird, odd place.....maybe they should just become a funeral home. BTW.....we observed same as another reviewer below......we had a few tables around us that were agitated and angry.....we heard the complaints about their food......"}
{"text":"Disappointing. That's my one-word review of this place. We came out to Monroeville after having an AMAZING appetizer at the Pittsburgh Restaurant Kickoff Party and we were beyond disappointed.

LOCATION
I'm from the South Hills so venturing through the Squirrel Hill Tunnels is not something that I do willingly. Once we got to Monroeville, we passed it three times because it's wedged between a Petco and Dennys.

DECOR
Old. Outdated. I felt like I was in a nursing home. The outside also had several signs about cat burglars (strange).

FOOD
Disappointing. Our bacon wrapped scallop appetizer was the shining star to our otherwise bleak dining experience. Although the PA Mushroom Porridge was pretty good too! I had the ivory salmon which was overlooked, dry, and VERY greasy. Our other entree was the \"Three Little Pigs.\" The meat was good (although I don't know if I'd cover it all in basalmic) but the potatoes had a strange metal taste to them. Our dessert was supposed to be \"macerated berries and grilled banana bread topped with a raspberry whipped cream.\" The berries were sliced strawberries and blueberries (not macerated) and the banana bread tasted like lemon box cake with bananas on the bottom (absolutely no grilling involved). The whipped cream might not have tasted like raspberries, but at least it had a pinkish color to it?

After our amazing food at the Kickoff Party, we were HIGHLY disappointed. The food has potential but our bill was over $80 (with only one beer) and not worth it. 

SERVICE
Our server was nice and pleasant."}
{"text":"I love The Wooden Nickel. It is the best place to eat in Monroeville. 

Don't let the front of the building be your judge, once you get inside it is beautiful! Decorated very lovely with warm and white tones. Very classy! The bar is very pretty too and has a sophisticated look! The fireplace adds a really nice touch and is especially cozy in the winter! The staff is awesome and make sure you are taken care of. They are very friendly and bubbly. 

The food is AMAZING and the portions are HUGE! I love just reading the menu and the descriptions, so unique and mouthwatering. Vanilla bean shrimp, I am basically drooling right now!

Their mixed drinks are really good too. There is pretty much always a special on drinks too! 

Remember to save room for dessert because you want to here. The desserts are certainly memorable. Last visit I had a seasonal dessert with berries and chocolate cake with mousse topping! Delectable!"}
{"text":"Very nice for an occasional outing or just something different. The restaurant was a little fancier than I had anticipated, so I would recommend dressing in more than casual style (if you are someone who gets bothered by that kind of thing). Overall, the food that I had (the meatloaf stacked with mashed potatoes and onion rings) was a generous portion, but this kind of nicer atmosphere comes at a price (but not outrageously so). 

Overall, I would eat there again for something special."}
{"text":"What a strange place. I came here primarily because I had a Groupon and my friends came here before and really liked their meals, so my boyfriend and I had a date night here. Everything was strange. When I called to make a reservation, the woman I spoke with seemed really confused and was kind of mumbling to herself which made me unsure about if we were really going to have a table waiting for us at the time I requested. When we arrived at the restaurant, the hostess was nice but also socially awkward, making it a strange first impression. It was just two of us and we were sat at a 4 top. The ambiance in this place is very weird- almost funeral home like. Our server was friendly though and very busy, but she remained friendly and professional at all times (even with some difficult customers). I started off with the French onion soup and the boyfriend got a salad. I loved the French onion soup- it was amazing. My main course was the Parmesan chicken with mashed potatoes and a sun dried tomato sauce. Brendan ordered the steak, medium, with \"frites\" and frizzled onions. My chicken was way over cooked- it was dry and stringy and honestly just terrible. The best part of my meal was the mashed potatoes. Brendan's was not only presented extremely weird, but it was also tasteless. The fries were ok but they were just frozen fries with truffle oil on them. The onion straws were good. As we were waiting for our check, it was uncomfortable because there were a lot of unhappy customers around us. One was waiting an hour for their meal and another one received something she didn't want. We also noticed the servers giving the guests their leftovers in shop n save take out bags- not kidding at all. Overall- I would never come here again. Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"We had a lovely dinner there last weekend. I made the reservations through the website and everything was ready and fabulous! Three of us chose one of the specials and one of us ordered from the menu. We all enjoyed our food! The wait staff was friendly and gave us excellent service and the prices were high average. We will dine there again!"}
{"text":"After a rather exhausting morning of errands, and before I returned home, I needed to grab some food.  Being in Monroeville and racking my brain where to go in this mecca of fast food and after looking for over a half hour, I kind of just stumbled upon Wooden Nickel.  In fact I had just come out of Petco and was sitting in my car contemplating whether I should take the road right outside the store or cut through the adjoining parking lot that was shared with a fast casual chain and this hidden gem.  When I saw it, I thought what the hell, give it a try.  So glad I did.

I use to frequent Monroeville a lot years ago, especially when I lived right outside the general shopping area, and I never stepped foot in here, been by it a million times, but never actually inside.  The outside, to me, doesn't look so glamorous.  But as I got out and took the walkway up to the door I thought to myself, \"Man, I'm way under dressed to be coming in here.\"  That did not matter though, once I got inside and noticed that by my watch I was in between the lunch hour and dinner rush it was not busy and there was actually one dining party in the section I was seated and they too were in their casual clothes.  As I said in my one picture this place is elegant without that pretentious feel.  

Every interaction I had with an employee here was a pleasant one.  When I was first greeted at the host stand the lady was so pleasant.  Chit chatting away all the way to the table.  Cluing me in on some of the hot dishes and just chatting about how nice the weather has been, smiling all the while.  Once my server showed up that pleasantness continued.  Polite and courteous, never stammering when I asked a question and fast on her feet.

The menu wasn't a huge one to look over, but it still took me a few minutes to make it through the descriptions.  I started out with a side salad which is a simple green salad with diced cucumbers and tomatoes with a few cuts of onions, ranch dressing to drizzled on top, perfect way to start the meal.  I ended up picking the entree called Not Your Mama's Meatloaf.  This thing was a behemoth.  It all starts with a nice thick piece of toasted bread covered in melted cheese, next comes an equally thick cut of meatloaf that is wrapped in Applewood-smoked bacon.  Seasoned to perfection and fall apart when you finally put it in your mouth.  But it doesn't stop there, a generous amount of whipped potatoes sit on top of that and then add a heaping amount of frizzled onions.  All topped off with a drizzle of smokey BBQ sauce.  Each bite kept me coming back for more.  I wanted to devour this but not look like a monster doing it.  It was that good, I would come back just for this meal again.

The price tag may come off as higher than usual, but in all honesty after thinking about it, and eating at many other places, the price tag is right in line.  Credit accepted, wonderful experience, I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great \"new\" restaurant in the area! I live in Murrysville and even though I heard the name, I have never eaten at Wooden Nickel until last night. I went there with my wife and daughter. The restaurant is under new management and according to older reviews I believe it's a great thing. We loved everything about our visit. The food was excellent (we had NY steak, sea food and lamb chops). Service was also great! Between bread, drinks, salads and dinner itself there was no wait time whatsoever. As soon as we would finish with one plate, the next one came. I never had to ask or wait for drinks either, our waiter would ask if we would like more wine as soon as one of the glasses was empty. Another thing that we noticed is extremely friendly atmosphere and it's not fake friendly. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The menu has got a much needed update by the new chef. Who has turned it from expensive old country club food to well prepared upscale food. You'll get a better steak here than the Aussie chain down the street."}
{"text":"Came here with another couple for dinner while in the area.  Tucked away behind the hotel, it was a nice find.  The restaurant is clean inside and the food is excellent.  Our meal arrived in a reasonable amount of time and was hot.  Pricing is also reasonable.
The staff was nice, courteous and friendly and all the things you want from your wait staff, but they were younger (late teens, early 20's) and might need a little training in a few areas - nothing earth shattering and nothing that would keep me from coming back, just a few things my wife (former waitress for 20+ years) and I noticed.
With so many choices in the Pittsburgh / Monroeville area, it's difficult to choose a good place to go.  This is one of the good places to go"}
{"text":"I would recommend skipping this place. Went there on a Saturday night and the place was dead. After getting my food, I could see why."}
{"text":"Had the special pork special something wasn't a chop. It was raw, twice. The sad part was the knife they gave me wouldn't even cut it. I didn't want anything done about it my stomach was turned.  When The bill came and it was 40 dollars for one supposed to be a pork chop. Fine I paid and didn't think any more of it. Bad night but that happens.  Now my wife and I both have food poisoning of some degree from the Caesar salad dressing. Won't bother going back."}
{"text":"Decided to hold a company function here even though there were many bad reviews about the service. I even told them I was bringing in a VIP group of customers and asked that they be taken care of very well.  All of our guests were very upset at the poor service - one waitress for an entire side of the restaurant! The food was good but it just didn't not make up for the service. This is a beautiful upscale restaurant and they should treat patrons with excellent service to go with the atmosphere, but it lacks greatly unfortunately."}
{"text":"Went with a big group (12 people) and the service was terrible. They didn't have enough menus for all of us, even though the restaurant wasn't full. 

They took forever to get our drinks, and even when they finally did bring the drinks, one person at our table had to wait over 20 mins for hers. 

You're paying for quantity here, NOT quality. I had the chicken carbonara. It tasted like it was made from a can tomato soup base and the veggies in it were soggy. The people bringing out our food couldn't remember which plate belonged to whom even when there were only 3 people left without food. 

Restaurant could use some remodeling. 

I do not recommend."}
{"text":"It's okay. Nice to stop at a place that's locally owned. 6 beers on tap and only one watered down version if a beer, so that's a plus."}
{"text":"I had the chicken Parmesan with linguini and it was absolutely delicious! Thanks Rachael for the excellent service! The atmosphere was quiet for a Sunday in the dining room and felt like I was at home enjoying a wonderful dinner."}
{"text":"I've come here quite a bit since it has opened, and this place is great!  Recently had the special: Scallops with pumpkin ravioli, absolutely delicious!!!  Warm bread is also quite tasty, as they had a jalapeño bread and I believe a parmesan bread.  

Definitely one of the best food options in the East Burbs!"}
{"text":"Pulled pork nachos...at the bar. Seems locals gather here, friendly, nice wine glasses and drinkable wine. The nachos were awesome. Tri-color chips pulled pork barbecue sauce different cheeses and great thin onion strips.
A must try."}
{"text":"I went here with my family for Easter brunch and was not very impressed. There was a very limited buffet (the only thing they were offering) and all of the muffins, pie and cookies were store bought and the store containers were sitting out on the bar. Very disappointed as there were good reviews which is why we chose to go here. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"You will not be disappointed.  Sit at the bar and ask for Sean. The seafood is incredible--fresh and perfectly cooked."}
{"text":"Closed for dinner at 6pm on Mother's Day! Seriously? What business are you in? Supposedly this restaurant is \"Under New Management\".  Maybe you should try again!"}
{"text":"My father and I took my Aunt and cousin here for a late dinner and it was nothing but delicious. The dining seemed a little bit upscale at first from the look of the place, however once we got inside it wasn't as bad as I thought. Prices are reasonable for amount of food you get and the quality as well. Typically $20-$35 a plate. Our appetizers came out quickly, and the food didn't take long either.. I ordered the scallop scallopini and it was scrumptious. Jessica took care of us and she was nothing but great, answered all of our questions and dealt with my at times \"overbearing\" family lol... 
I definitely recommend it for a fancier meal if you're staying at the Marriott which conveniently is located directly behind it."}
{"text":"Was not treated warmly by the woman at the front.  She abruptly asked if we had a reservation.  No smile.  Waiter was extremely slow.  Never checked on us after we received our meals which were hastily thrown down on the table by some other person who also didn't ask us if we needed anything before she left us.  My meal wasn't done enough.  Ordered cheese ravioli and I felt like I was eating licorice.  Pasta just wasn't done.  No spice to the sauce either.  Weird smell throughout the restaurant too.  Will not be revisiting."}
{"text":"Check out there martini Mondays.  Half price awesome tasting martinis and a cool vibe, slightly older scene.  Bartender is friendly and certainly knows how to mix, stir a martini.  

They also tend have boxing big fight events...if you're into boxing, a fun scene to watch a fight.  Call ahead to make sure it's on."}
{"text":"Irwin location-Delicious meal-- Salad, French onion soup, crab stuffed shrimp and scallops-absolutely amazing! Great wine menu too and 40% off bottles on Saturdays. Specials other days too. GO!!! Worth every penny. Not only great for the area but one of our favorite meals anywhere, coast to coast."}
{"text":"My best friend had her wedding reception here on the night of April 22, 2017 and it was absolutely a disaster. The banquet room was booked from 6:30-9pm. The guest all arrived promptly to the staff still setting up the tables and fully unprepared for our arrival. The food came out about a hour and a half after it was supposed and was cold and disappointing. I must mentioned that the restaurant had a printed food choice  of every guest that attended so there shouldn't have been any reason why they were not prepared. One food choice was the steak, which we were told was cooked one way only and basically our cooking temperature could not be accommodated, this resulted in many guest not even eating their meal. The other meal choice was chicken Parmesan which was cold, dry, and underprepared. It basically was a chicken patty with noodles under it and that's it. The marinara for the dish came out ten minutes after the actual dish was served, serving no purpose at the point. The last dish was salmon Oscar which was great, I have no complaint about it, nor did any of the other guest. The waiter was not at all knowledgeable about the menu because when a table ordered a few bottles of wine he quoted them one price but after they received the bottles of wine and were prepared to pay for them the waiter had doubled the price, very misleading. Of the six tables that were there 3 of them didn't have any beverages other than water. The worst part about this whole situation is that the bride never ate because they forgot to bring her food and when she informed them of this they brought her out the wrong thing. Also, as the bride and groom were being rushed to cut the cake due to timing one of the staff members informed her that we needed to be out by 9:30pm and would be charged for overage fees in the contract, ALTHOUGH it was the fault of the restaurant that were running over the contracted time. They staff cut the wedding cake and butchered it. They were passing out chunks of cake and totally ruined it. The whole experience was awful, especially for a bride on her wedding day. I am truly disappointed in the service that was received at this established. They were unprepared, rude, and the customer service was absolutely disgraceful. I will never patronize this restaurant again. For the money that was invested in wedding reception, it was a huge disappointed and a total let down."}
{"text":"I'm in the area on business from time and go here because it convenient. Was here before the renovation and the work really freshened the place up.  Seems to have a older crowd of locals that are regulars to the place. I think the food is okay although a bit pricey.  I think the wait staff needs a makeover...  The bartender was distant and not tentative and seemed to be new at bar tending. I have real problem with someone pouring the alcohol in the glass first and then adding ice to the glass - what's up with that???"}
{"text":"Our service was excellent. We were seated by the fireplace in the dinning room. Made reservations through Open Table via Yelp. I had Crab Cake stuffed with Shrimp and my wife had fillet, medium rare. We had chocolate cake for dessert. I had coffee. The entrees were excellent, couldn't have done better. Dessert was both beautiful and excellent. The coffee was strong enough that I could not finish it. Ran out of drinking water to dilute it. I recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I'm riding along with hubby on business and took some time reading the reviews for this place.  The overall rating isn't that great so I read through all the reviews.  

We were wanting to try a local restaurant, rather than a chain that we can get at home and the name The Wooden Nickel, is so cool!  The other reviews here are either excellent or terrible, but we decided to give it a try.

They need to fire the older woman with short white hair, serving as hostess!  We walked in in business casual attire, and instead of smiling and greeting us, she looked us up and down and gave an expression of \"what are you doing here?\"  

We actually had to speak fist, as she stood there looking at us.  We asked if we could eat there and she asked \" just the two of you?\"  We answered, yes, did we need reservations?  She said that it is best, and we told her no one at the hotel or people who've eaten there had mentioned that, but we were sorry.  She didn't even answer.  She looked down at her book and said \"I THINK we can squeeze you in\".  So we followed her into the left dining room.  It appeared very nice and a place you'd go to celebrate something.

We were seated back in a corner of a mostly empty dining room.  She returned to pour us water and still wasn't friendly.  I let her know that I'd read reviews online that weren't promising, but we'd decided to take a chance on it because of hotel recommendation and the name. I hoped that would help her to be more friendly and anxious to please, but her only response was \"Of course.  They always recommend us!\" And walked off in a haute huff.

This left such a bad taste in our mouths, that with all the negative reviews I'd read, we decided to leave.  

I'm sure the food is delicious, based on people who've eaten there, but my husband had had a long tiring day, and we wanted to have a pleasant dinner, not one where we were looked down on and treated as if we weren't welcome.

On our way out, my husband graciously told her that the menu wasn't what we were looking for.  He didn't want to tell her we were leaving because she was rude and arrogant.  

I feel bad for the servers, who looked like they'd be nice and friendly, and also chef and owner.  Price was not an issue, since it was an expensable business dinner.  

FYI for anyone who decides to give it a try, make reservations and plan on $26-40 per person.  If you get a nice hostess, it's probably a great place to eat and celebrate, but we probably won't take the chance the next time we're in the area.  Too stuffy an atmosphere."}
{"text":"My wife and I visited last month. If was her birthday and we were looking for something different. This place has been around as long as we've lived in the area. Probably longer. Don't know why we've never been here before. Long story short. I had the NY Strip. She had the filet. Both quite good. Cheaper than downtown. Service was good, but they were not very busy. All in all, a pleasant experience. Would've been better if it wasn't for the table full of financial advisors trying to impress each other at the top of their lungs. Not the restaurant's fault, but I don't know if they're the exception or the rule."}
{"text":"My family hosted a Life Celebration event at the Wooden NIckel on September 2.  Deenie Ross, the Banquet Manager, did an amazing job putting together a wonderful event for 70 people with less than 3 weeks to plan and prepare.  Ms. Ross was responsive, made great suggestions and was just a pleasure to work with.  The food was really delicious, especially the crab cakes, and the pulled pork nachos.  The red wine sangria was a huge hit.  Our servers,  Kim and Mary Lou,  took great care of us and all our guests, anticipating needs and being right where we needed them to be at all times.  Everyone that attended commented on the warm and welcoming atmosphere (even on a really rainy and cold night!).  The Wooden Nickel staff earned our family's return business and our deep appreciation for making our event memorable for all."}
{"text":"Very dissatisfied with dinner and service. 
Ordered two kids spaghetti with meatballs we received the meals with no meatballs.   Asked for them and they were brought but were definitely microwaved.  Also ordered chicken parmigiano and received it with no cheese.  Our salads did not have the correct dressing.  The waitress pored a miscato wine into a chardonnay then a pinot grigio because she didnt know who was drinking what!  
For around $32 a meal i would expect really great service.    
Not what we received..."}
{"text":"We arrived 20 minutes before closing. They told us we were very welcome. They seated us, even though there was only one other table of guests in the house, and they had finished their meal.

The restaurant is beautiful, one section looking into a forest. The decor is lovely, and the tables are nicely spaced. 

The Wooden Nickel has a small but diverse and reasonably priced wine list, along with a nice selection of beers and a full bar.  My Cosmo was delicious!

The menu features primarily steaks and seafood - although I was tempted by the duck breast. I finally settled on the vanilla bean stuffed shrimp with asparagus and red skin potatoes  

My dinner companion chose the salmon oscar - but when our waiter told us it was farmed salmon (not wild) we decided to substitute filet mignon for the salmon 

Our starter was Italian wedding soup - a favorite of mine - and it ranked among the best I've ever tasted... Delicious broth packed with pastina and lots of perfectly seasoned tiny meatballs and spiced wonderfully.

Our entrees arrived and they were stellar - the filet majestic and cooked medium rare as requested - tender and flavorful. My stuffed shrimp was overstuffed with pure, fresh, mouthwatering crab 

Out of consideration for our most attentive staff we didn't order dessert, but if the desserts are as good as the food we were served, I look forward to having one when I return - and that will be soon

The chef came out at our request so that we could extend our heartfelt thanks for keeping the kitchen open for us, and preparing such a wonderful meal.  A great place to eat!!

CAVEAT:  it's easy to miss this culinary gem. It's tucked away behind the PETCO - which is well-marked. Bon appetit!"}
{"text":"Food was very good but service was terrible-wait that would mean we had service. Sat for 10 minutes waiting for someone to at least say they would be right with us. Didn't happen. 3 servers were entertaining what appeared to be a former employee because they received all the attention of the staff. Once they realized we were there, it was an argument as to who would take us. The argument loser then became the most condescending server that I have ever had.  She rushed us with appetizers & salad within 5 minutes of each other. If I didn't have a gift card I would have left before even getting dinner."}
{"text":"HAPPY NEW YEARS 2016!! My girlfriend and I made reservations for New Years Eve late, and The Wooden Nickel came through!! On One of their busiest days of the year, they were on their A-Game! Our waitress was great, she helped pair a great wine with our dinners and desserts. From their Special Event Menu, we ordered The Truffle New York Strip Steak w/ Fries and Onion Straws and Vanilla Bean Shrimp and Scallops. They were Delicious! Those two meals secured that we would be back! Then, the Cheesecake with raspberry sauce put things over the top!! Everything worked out perfect for a late call on New Years Eve!! I would suggest Wooden Nickel for people in Monroeville or traveling through!!"}
{"text":"Complaint for management in Monroeville. Myself and spouse visited on May 10th, 2016. We had three different waitresses, the first was useless and took forever to bring us our entrees (50 minutes as the second waitress gave our entrees to another table who took bites out of them and we had to wait for new ones to be prepared of which my spouses entree was just placed under a heat lamp and left to go hard and crusty while my new ones was being prepared from scratch all over again) and the third waitress just left our appetizer plates on the table.  We asked for refills several times which never came and then the first waitress offered us our complimentary bread when the bill came.  The food was not correctly cooked either, terrible experience all-round."}
{"text":"We have had nothing but wonderful experiences here.  Tonight we ordered the Vanilla Stuffed Shrimp and the Crab cakes.  Both were the best we've ever had, no exaggerating.  The flavors and combinations were excellent.  Everything down to the last vegetable was perfect.  Every detail was accounted for. The service was great, atmosphere was very nice and relaxed.

This is one of the nicest places in Monroeville and noteworthy for Pittsburgh overall.  The menu is filled with great options for all tastes.  A friend swears by the meatloaf, and while I haven't tasted it, I can certify that the presentation is extraordinary. 

This is a great place for a special occasion or a nice date. The cost varies per meal but it's well worth it.  They are a bit tough to find through, tucked back behind Denny's and Petco, you can turn in at either since both parking lots are connected.  

This really was an excellent restaurant experience."}
{"text":"We stop every once in a while on Fridays for happy hour. Great drink specials. They offer a bar menu with dinner and appetizer choices.  I had a chicken salad and my husband had the 3 little pigs. He really enjoyed his meal."}
{"text":"My friends took me to the Wooden Nickel for my birthday and I have to say I was underwhelmed. 

We shared a few appetizers: calamari and stuffed mushroom caps. I've had much better calamari for less. The other appetizers are equally pricey.

I ordered the strip steak with a side of pasta (you get to choose between a vegetable, pasta or potato). The steak was overcooked and the pasta was quite frankly terrible. Others liked their dishes (the chicken picatta, for example). But all of us were surprised at the cost.

The waitstaff were accommodating and friendly, but unfortunately that is the only positive thing I have to say about this restaurant."}
{"text":"We had a party 6 for a birthday party. Three of the 6 people were unhappy with their meal and all 6 were unhappy with the service. There were several mistakes made
with the drinks ordered and with the dinners ordered. Salad plates were removed before we were even finished with them. We all felt as though we were being rushed by the server and were disappointed with her arrogant attitude. Needless to say this restaurant will not be seeing business there again."}
