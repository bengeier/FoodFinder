{"text":"Dined here for brunch on a Sunday morning. Overall food was good, service was good! French toast was super yummy and a must order, especially with the cream cheese spread and fruit. Breakfast burrito was tasty with crispy potatoes, bacon and egg, but dry and needed another sauce maybe? The spicy sauce on the side that came with it was a bit too spicy. Food and service is solid 4 stars! Manager here is friendly, just like at Base Pizza. Great family owned vibe that Arcadians love! 

Reason for 3 stars is that the kitchen is open, so you leave smelling bacon grease in your hair and clothes. Glad they have a patio, that will be better once weather cools down. Hopefully they can get some ventilation going or close off the kitchen. Also the menu is missing a standard veggie omelette and pancakes."}
{"text":"Great food! The BLT is amazing. They also have great prices for the quality of food. Breakfast all day too! Can't beat that!"}
{"text":"Very good experience here for Sunday brunch.  Great menu selections and the owner is very personable as are his staff.  I will definitely be back to try other items."}
{"text":"I don't really do breakfast much but I'm going to now!! I had breakfast here with a friend and it was a classic breakfast (eggs, bacon, hash, toast). But the ingredients and how it was prepared made me feel good afterwards. It wasn't greasy like other places. Portions were spot on. Not too little not too much. Our server was happy and energetic but not over the top energetic because sometimes in the morning you're just not awake enough to accept that. Maybe after a cup or two of their deliciously smelling coffee! ;-) I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"First time checking this place out. Not the best area but once you walk in everything changes. The wait staff is super friends and they all seem to work together well. 
Food was better than expected. I'm giving it a 5 star because I had great breakfast and a pleasing time, just wished they server alcohol. A mimosa would have gone great with everything!"}
{"text":"Replacing the long lived Acacia cafe the smith has a more limited menu & while was our first time there we found food to be good but not great. The corned beef hash is very good, the house hash potatoes were somewhat hard and cold in the middle.  The corned beef dish comes with one egg & a lot of hash- really needing that 2nd egg. Plus toast is an extra cost as is substituting a side of tomato for the potatoes. Service friendly and it's a sit down table service which is nice; however higher prices too. Miss the casual easy going breakfast of the former cafe. We miss Mike."}
{"text":"Decided to try someplace new for breakfast and stumbled into The Smith. Almost immediately realized upon sitting down it is owned by the same people as Base Pizzeria, and we love that restaurant. Good sign #1. Child/baby friendly, great friendly service, and yes, the food was delicious- we both had the special - it was like a chilequiles benedict with chorizo and the eggs were poached perfectly, and ordered a side of the bacon which was delicious as well. So happy to have found this place in our hood and can't wait to try more from their menu!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a breakfast on the patio.  We really enjoyed the avocado toast and eggs.  I would highly recommend the smith."}
{"text":"really wonderful family-oriented dining experience. you get what you pay for here. 20% more for 5star service and experience

$17 lunch with a strong tip, h2o only (you should tip heavy too). an obvious referral. probably ideal for sunday brunch  

bring your girlfriends, not a spot for the boys"}
{"text":"Our family went for breakfast this morning and had a wonderful time - amazing service, yummy food. We especially loved the avocado toast and the corned beef hash. The staff is awesome and welcoming. If you are planning for a family breakfast outing, there is no better place. We will be back"}
{"text":"This is the second time I've eaten here, both times were absolutely delicious. Nice and friendly staff and a warm sunny patio with umbrellas. Good music, great food...Yummmmm.

We will be back."}
{"text":"Delicious!!
If you were here when it was Acacia cafe, it's mostly the same staff. The menu is different, but good!!
I had pancakes and a hash to go. It was very good!!
I will be back for more!!"}
{"text":"Owned by a spirited and friendly group of Aussies features a unique breakfast (brekkie) and brunch items.  Cozy atmosphere, inside or outside seating, pet friendly and great service!  One of my new favorite breakfast / lunch spots in the Arcadia area."}
{"text":"We had the Queen Mother and the Breakfast Sammie.  The Queen Mother is a traditional English breakfast.  It was fantastic!  We discussed the intricacies of baked beans with one of the owners - American BB are sweetened while British are not.  Apparently The Smith went with baked beans canned in Ireland that have a little sugar in them in order to be closer to the American palate.  I would like to voice my support for British baked beans - 100% savory and no sugar :-)

Both items were delicious and the portions plentiful.  The service was very friendly.  We sat out on the patio, which continues to be dog friendly (the last establishment at this location also had a dog friendly policy).  The kitchen was a little slow to get the food out but not terribly slow.  The tables along the wall on the patio are arranged such that you will sit facing the wall, or with your back to the wall.  While this allowed for more customers, it also meant that if you want both parties to be in the shade (in early May) you should plan to finish your meal by 11. 

As you can see by the rating we very much enjoyed our meal and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Today I'm having the corn beef hash good stuff the wife is having the green chili bowl all good and good service good place for breakfast"}
{"text":"Adorable breakfast spot in a great location in Arcadia. The service couldn't have been friendlier. I ordered the avocado toast with an egg on top. 

The toast was thick and delicious and there was sprinkled crumbled cheese over the avocado. 

This would be a great brunch spot to ride bikes to!"}
{"text":"Friendly atmosphere, reasonable price. I had the Southwest spinach salad but with arugula. Very generous portion size and delicious flavor."}
{"text":"Me: the \"Smith Hash\", her: the Reaper Scramble fixed burrito style (at the suggestion of Lissa our outstanding server). Both were delicious, the corned beef was \"pulled\" not chopped or diced and the chilis added a great flavor. Probably the best corned beef hash I've ever had. PS A dog friendly patio."}
{"text":"Stopped here for breakfast this morning. Excellent food and unique menu. This ended up being the perfect place. We both wanted to try something different and this fit the bill to a T. I had the Chili Verde Bowl and it was delicious the pork melted in your mouth and the Eggs were perfectly cooked . My friend had a hash of sorts that was finished with a Carolina Reaper drizzle. He loved it and said it was the perfect amount of spice and the dish had great flavor combinations."}
{"text":"Very yummy, and great service!  I shouldn't have been caught off guard by the Australian accent that greeted us when we came in the door (I had read up ahead of time), but was because you don't always have owners working the front of the house-- VERY cool.  I find it awesome and indicative of quality leadership when you see an owner participating directly in his restaurant like that!  My husband and I brought friends from out of town here, and were very pleased at the original breakfast offerings-- basically we were sick of \"new American\" fare. ;)   Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Second time here. First time was very good. This time was not quite as good.  One dish was very tasty, the Reaper Scramble. Nice and spicy. Plenty of flavor. The French toast was a little on the dry side for our taste.  It was not quite hot enough to melt the butter and syrup didn't help too much."}
{"text":"We went here on Saturday morning around 11:30 a.m and the place was packed. We waited for 15 minutes to get our seat. The crews are friendly and helpful. 

Since, they were too busy that day, our order took a bit longer (30-40 minutes) before they served it.

I ordered \"The Reaper Scramble\" and the crew said that if I like hot and spicy food, then this is the perfect food for me.  When I got my food, I was dissapointed because it was not hot nor spicy at all. So I asked my friends to try it just to see if they have different opinion on my hot and spicy order and they we're dissapointed as well. To be fair, the  food was savoury and appetizing but it was not hot and spicy. I also ordered cappuccino and it was so good that I ordered 3 cups.

I gave 4 stars because there can be improve in their services and"}
{"text":"If you haven't been, go NOW. I work across the street so I got to know the last owners pretty well. Nice guys with basic food. This place is COMPLETELY TRANSFORMED into great food and a fun atmosphere. 

I was first introduced to Rosco through his other restaurant Base on Lincoln and 32nd. After my 10th time there he told me they were taking this place over and I was ecstatic. I've been around 5 times now and everything I've had is great. FYI - I don't check in at every place I go cause that would be super weird to me. 

I recommend the Reaper Scramble, Green Chili Bowl, and the Chook. Since I've lived in the southwest for a long time, the food isn't as spicy as some places so don't worry. If you do want some extra heat, use \"The Smith Oils\" they have next to the back door. 

Awesome pace and I'm really happy they are in Arcadia. Thanks guys."}
{"text":"Saw the reviews and thought I'd try it.  The owner, man with the accent greeted me and seated me. Very polite and cheerful.  Ice water and coffee offered first.  Ordered the hash.  Presentation was nice with the skillet.  The meat was stringy and dry, potatoes had no taste even though there seem to be some peppers or whatever added.  I saw them roasting the diced up potatoes in the oven. Maybe I got there early and got yesterday's batch?  Anyway, nice place, owner was friendly, the host who came in later and another staff didn't seem attentive to coffee refills.  The place seems fairly new.  Seems popular with more guests coming in after me.  Funny thing was my AirBnb host kinda made a face when I mentioned this place, he said it was average.  Well, he was right.  I'll go back to my other breakfast spots."}
{"text":"Great breakfast place! Ordered the egg and bacon plate. Very very good fresh bread served with your meals. Service is friendly and warm. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood spot to grab \"brekky\" or lunch. The specials are worth trying, they prepare eggs well, and they do a good job all around. The staff is on top of things, and pleasant to deal with."}
{"text":"My husband took me here on my birthday and it was wonderful! I can't believe we haven't been here before being so close to our jobs! The inside was very attractive with the blackboard showing specials and the pallet wall, it was decorated very tastefully! The food was really good my husband got the caprese sandwich which was absolutely delicious and I tried the French toast I would get both again!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Impromptu brunch with my 19 month old  grandson and daughter in law. We were welcomed by the owners and immediately seated and a high chair was placed at the table. Blueberry French toast, avocado egg and toast and an omelette with cheddar spinach and tomatoes....crisp bacon... yummy potatoes ...who could ask for anything more? Did you say coffee? Endless cup hot and delish. Will miss this place"}
{"text":"Went here a couple of days ago for breakfast. They have a great little patio and friendly, attentive service. I had a flat white with almond milk and my husband had iced tea, both were delicious. I had the Hungry Man and my husband had the scramble. Both were very good, he helped with mine as it was so large and we still had leftovers. We love independently owned restaurants, The Smith will definitely be added to our rotation!"}
{"text":"Awww yeah!  This place is my new favorite for brunch-healthy and indulgent options and both are done to perfection."}
{"text":"This was my first visit here. I was very pleased!  We were seated quickly with excellent, regular, and extremely friendly service the whole time, even during the brunch rush. I got the chili bowl and was pretty happy with it. My friends got some other plates that were ridiculously large portions. We split the bread pudding for dessert and didn't regret it:) prices were more than dennys but pretty reasonable. I'll be returning."}
{"text":"Super cute little cafe. Friendly staff,  and if you get a booth comfy seats. We had the caprese sandwich,  and the chicken chop salad...very yummy and fresh! As a treat we had their desert of the day, and a cup of coffee (nice and strong and not bitter!). I will definetly return when I area. Nice and relaxed lunch spot."}
{"text":"Food is delicious with nice sized portions. On a busy Sunday we were seated in less than 10 mins. Would definitely eat here again!!!!"}
{"text":"Please note there is no 1/2 Star this amazing breakfast place deserves 4.5. Here is what was up during my visit. 
It gets busy and the day I went it was apparently clear that they were under staffed. Sat at the breakfast bar giving me access to look down the line and see the amazing food headed out. 
Green chili pork was spot on!! Lots of pork just enough spice. However only got one egg instead of two asked for over hard got over easy. 
Egg sandwich was amazing! The bacon was 5 Star!!from what I could see going out the avocado toast is unreal! Even the berry and granola looks amazingly good. Personally not a fan of there chosen coffee company so skipped that....
Great job all the way around so I will be back for some hash."}
{"text":"Great fresh food prepared very well, consistently. Great staff and owners - the place has a family and community environment. We love their other restaurant, too, BASE Pizzeria."}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot! Would definitely come back here again to try the rest of the menu.

Cool little place with hearty breakfast. I had the Queen Mother and I'd definitely recommend it to anyone with a big appetite! 

It had 2 eggs, Schreiner's sausage, baked beans, bacon, potatoes, grilled mushrooms, roasted tomatoes, and toast! 

Everything was prepared well, seasoned, and it's a very generous portion.

This breakfast was the drooling face emoji for sure.

They try to source local ingredients, which is great and I think this place is a great addition to the neighborhood! 

Not a whole lot of seating inside, but that shouldn't be a deciding factor for this place. The staff were friendly and present. 

Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Had the special today. On my Yummy! I'll be back for sure! Great design, great people, delicious food!"}
{"text":"I had the Green Plate. AMAZING!! Hubby had the special breakfast sandy (grilled chicken, sausage, etc). All was absolutely amazing/yummy!"}
{"text":"Crazy good!  Took Mrs Z to the Smith for a breakfast date this morning and had an amazing experience. 

The newly remodeled space was very bright, yet rustic.  Had an amazing feel to it.

We had two latte's which were absolutely perfect, before settling in for the Green Chili Bowl and (Mrs Z's) French Toast - which used Noble Bread.  Both were very very good and a great size.

Service was casual but very friendly.  This hidden neighborhood gem won't stay hidden for too long so we will be going back as much as we can before the crowds catch on."}
{"text":"Though unassuming from the outside, Smith Cafe is a standout brunch spot with excellent food and fun trendy atmosphere. I tried the BLT and it was DELICIOUS, I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"I was totally Azande with the different dishes as the four of got something different and tasted of each dish...wow, great cook and great service!!"}
{"text":"I am sooooo disappointed.. wahhhhhh! I read terrific reviews and ordered the Reaper Skillet, I love spicy and it looked great. Stinks because after all those raving reviews I'm sure it could be good. It may have just been over cooked and left out? Not sure. It was takeout and we waited 45 minutes for it to be cooked. I thought typically they don't make Togo orders wait as long. It tasted like it needed some salsa or sour cream. Probably because it was so dry. Petty much tasteless besides the spice. Egg I don't taste..... I suppose if we ate there I could send it back, but the 45 min wait for them to bring our food made me extra hungry then in our Togo bags had no salt pepper or anything. Good thing I added avocado otherwise if we eating over cooked onions and hard potatoes. I saw some reviews that were extra greasy with oil, I almost think that would be better than an overcooked no egg Skillet."}
{"text":"new neighborhood hot spot for sure! awesome portion sizes. easy going, attentive staff... their kitchen knows how to cook an egg! 
recommended: the hungry man (huge breakfast platter) and The Chook for lunch (chicken sandwich). 
owners are Australian and make the experience fun and unique. feels like going over to their house for \"brekkie\" 
make brunch at The Smith a priority! :)"}
{"text":"I loved this place!! Wonderful food, great tea selection, and exceptional service from our server. Cannot wait to go back."}
{"text":"Awesome food, great service, reasonably priced, but most importantly... GREAT COFFEE!"}
{"text":"Best English Breakfast in Arizona, and the Best Coffee in Arcadia. Exceptional quality and service."}
{"text":"Loved the Smith Hash!  The portions are huge and we were able to get a seat right away.  Our only critique was that our server seemed to desert us towards the end of meal.  Even then I'd still go back."}
{"text":"I love this place.. the staff is amazing, the food divine. The Smith breakfast is going to be my go-to from now on. My granddaughter is gluten free and dairy free and the staff totally accommodated us. I completely recommend this place.. will definitely be back... Often."}
{"text":"WELL...This is exciting...A breakfast place in the Arcadia area that really has great breakfast...Full Service...Awesome attitude and ownership that really gets it......Amazing menu and tasty food at great prices...My breakfast today was CRAZY good!!!...Can't wait to go back...This will definitely be my GO TO place for breakfast from now on...So hard to find great breakfast...This is long overdue..."}
{"text":"Last stop on our way home and Yelp didn't disappoint. The portions on the Hungry Man are great and the bacon is delicious. The Arcadia burrito and the salsa verde is so tasty."}
{"text":"Passing thru town for work and my co-worker found this place on Yelp. Gotta say - amazing. I had the Smith Hash breakfast and, as far as m concerned, they can take everything else off the menu. I'm not even a \"hash\" kinda guy and that just blew me away. 

My co-worker picked up the BLT. Sounds like a safe and uneventful event - but no - even that was crazy good. (Maybe too much bread that distracted a bit from the flavor)

If you're looking for a good breakfast/brunch/lunch place, swing by here. Absolutely spot on perfect. Couldn't have been happier :-)"}
{"text":"Perfect spot for brunch. Quick service and delicious food. 
Portions are good to share. My boyfriend and I ordered The Smith Hash and a side of peppered bacon. There were so many dishes that caught our eye on the menu so we'll definitely be back to try more."}
{"text":"Delicious filling food served with a smile. This place was great. 

I wish there was one in NJ!"}
{"text":"I have been to this location for many years.  The new menu is pricey.  The omlett I received was pretty poor.  Overall a poor value.  Time to find a new morning hangout."}
{"text":"Stopped in at The Smith for Sunday breakfast ... what a way to start the day!!!

From the warm greeting at the door (nice Aussie fella) to the cold brew ice coffee to the actual food itself everything was perfect!

We were made to feel welcome and the staff were attentive and gave some great menu recommendations.

Our food was served quickly and it was hot, how breakfast should be.

Well priced too!

We will back, check this place out as soon as you can."}
{"text":"Great breakfast on the patio. Generous servings. Avocado toast was outstanding. My guest enjoyed the corned beef hash."}
{"text":"GREAT BRUNCH today!! Came in during a busy shift and we were greeted right away at the door. LOVE the remodel and the menu. It was very cozy but still trendy, and the menu really had an option for every taste. I had the green chili pork and my friend had the reaper. Both had GREAT flavor and were more than enough food for one :)

Jordan was our server and she was awesome! She was genuinely attentive and did a great job of anticipating our needs! SO GLAD to have this place around the corner!!"}
{"text":"First visit to 3on Smith and surprisingly pleased. I know the space as the former Acacia Cafe so I'm curious to know what happened and when the turn over. My friends and I had good service, food came out quick, and was delicious. My daughter and I had shared the Hungry man, which was A LOT of food, but very good, and a good amount to share between us. The French toast is amazingly sweet tasting. A small outdoor patio is simple and works for group setting, but the tables and chairs are wobbly and hard to maneuver with the wood plank deck. The patio also needs more shade now that temps are warming. While we were seated against the building, by 11:30-12, our friends who were backed to the parking lot were getting beamed on by the sun. Maybe some misters and pergola over structure would be nice. Inside is modern and simple, with private single restrooms. While I used the restroom during our visit, I didn't recall seeing a baby changing table. Seating inside isn't really accommodating for large groups, which is a bummer. But they do have a great menu choice, and kids items reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Great for breakfast.  Get something spicy!   Small but food and service are better than most."}
{"text":"Had breakfast. The place is clean, food was hot and fresh.  We had French toast and a toe egg breakfast.  The food was well prepared, though I loved how the spuds were cooked, I didn't really care for  the rosemary. On the potatoes, but I ate it anyway because they were prepared perfectly. The prices were good and the amount of food was appropriate. I would return again when in the area."}
{"text":"WOW. Quick service. Super friendly. Cozy. Delicious breakfast food. We had the breakfast burrito and b+e roll both were perfect. Coffee? Even better! Instant Classico"}
{"text":"Amazing- the Avo smash with the poached egg and the school sandwich were both finger licking good! Quick service and a super fun & Arcadia atmosphere. Loved how fresh the food was and will definitely be back for a healthy and delicious weekend brunch!"}
{"text":"Had a fantastic lunch here, another welcome addition to the neighborhood. My husband and I sat on the patio and enjoyed the Green Pig sandwich and the napa salad with arnold palmers. The green pig had a perfectly cooked green chili pork with a flavorful cilantro aioli which went really well on the pretzel bun. The napa salad was a nice combo of sweet and savory with oven roasted grapes, filling farro and a tasty sherry vinaigrette. 

Roscoe, the owner was warm and welcoming and the staff was very nice as well. The restaurant is clean and modern, definitely an upgrade from the previous Acacia cafe. We will return for sure!"}
{"text":"The Smith--what can you say other then fabulous and entertaining!! Roscoe makes the vibe and restaurant what it is, fun fun!  The food is always tasty and plentiful. The Corny Cow never disappoints and The Shook is delicious!! An Arcadia gem!!"}
{"text":"The Queen Mother is a legit proper English breakfast. Actually, it's better, because everything is quality. 

And the potatoes have rosemary in them. Rosemary makes everything just so dang delicious.

I'm actually not even that into the big English style brekkie, but sometimes you just need a really big breakfast. Sometimes, your air goes out on the hottest day of the year. When that happens, you need to find a cool place to wait and a meal with enough variety to distract you from your problems.

I mean, food is cheaper than therapy. Actually, no, it's not, because I have to pay for two different gyms to balance out all my \"therapy.\" Dammit.

I will probably be back for this better than London English breakfast feast, and if not, I'll be back to try something else. Cause breakfast food is life."}
{"text":"Ate breakfast here and was a little bit of a let down given all of the good reviews. Wasn't bad by any means, but not 5 stars.

I had the green chili bowl and my gal had the breakfast burrito.  The tortilla is store bought and not hand made. 

The pork had really good flavor, but some pieces were tough. Green Chile sauce is delicious. Her burrito tasted bland..but I blame her for that. Some salsa would have made it better. They only had orange juice and nothing else to offer for juices. Disappointing. 

Ordered a side of bacon..and taste was great, but it was thin bacon. I prefer thicker sliced. 

Good spot, not great IMO."}
{"text":"Loved this adorable place. The hostess was acting many roles and doing an amazing job. When I commented on this she mentioned a few people called out sick. While I noticed our food took some tile her attention to service made me still feel this is a 5 star place. The good was also great with big servings!"}
{"text":"The Smith is my FAVORITE brunch spot in the valley! From the moment you walk in till the moment you walk out you are given the best service. The smells that come out of this place alone make you full! The food is absolutely delicious the avocado toast is a mound of mouthwatering deliciousness! The breakfast burrito is the size of an arm and the skillet meals are always filled to brim with more delicious creations from the open air kitchen! The coffee is always fresh no matter what time of day you get it! Come here hungry because you will be stuffed all week when you leave!"}
{"text":"We came here for a friend's birthday brunch, and really enjoyed the ambience and setting -it's clean and quirky inside with benches and a rustic vibe all around. I ordered a breakfast sandwich after eyeing another diner's meal, and while I wasn't blown away, it was a very generous portion.. I ended up saving half for later, as did another friend with his meal, so they definitely have decent to larger servings :)

I took off a star because it is a 30min drive for me to come here, and I don't think I'd make the drive again just for this restaurant. Also, I ordered regular iced coffee, and they don't offer refills (or let you know beforehand about this policy) -not a big deal, but I didn't really think it was worth $4 per glass :/ 

If you're in the area though, I guess I'd give them a try.. I just don't think I'd go out of my way to come here again"}
{"text":"Visiting AZ needed a great breakfast and found it!! There was 5 of us and we all enjoyed our meals! The Queen Mother plate was delicious! The service and people were incredibly nice!! Good coffee which is a big plus in the morning!! We will most certainly be coming back here on out next visit!!"}
{"text":"This place is a great addition to Arcadia. We sat at the patio on a hot, sunny Arizona morning and had a wonderful time. There was no wait and we were seated promptly. 

I had The Smith Hash which I really liked. It was a nice break from your typical breakfast dishes. My dish came in a sizzler plate with pieces of corned beef, cubed potatoes, roasted green chiles, onions, topped with an over easy egg. This meal was definitely HOT. I am usually a bigger fan of finely shredded corned beef like you would see in canned corned beef hash but The Smith's was pretty delicious. I would suggest getting some smashed avocados for a little extra.

My boyfriend had the BLT and it was one of the best BLTs we've ever had. The bread that accompanied it was perfect, and it had just the right amount of avocados. You won't regret getting this one.

Our server was attentive and the owners were making rounds at the tables ensuring everyone was satisfied. The prices were affordable. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Wow! The Coconut Chia bowl is amazing! I have some food sensitivities and this was beyond expectations. 

The sausage and potatoes should not be overlooked. 

Great, friendly service and family owned! Love it!"}
{"text":"I found this place on a whim! I was looking for something quick and yummy and I found that here at The Smith. Place was small but super inviting when you're inside. I had the scramble which I was obsessed with. It was served in a HOT skillet and by hot I mean I have a scar on my arm. The reaper is also a great meal. It was cheap, quick, and delicious and I'll for sure be back!"}
{"text":"I wanted to give the place more than 5 stars. There's fantastic service and the food is great. I can't complain about anything....other than I didn't see a cocktail menu. A fast as the food came out and as good as it was, I didn't even care ."}
{"text":"Good service - great food ! Fresh and well prepared .The CHOOK  may be the best chicken sandwich I've ever eaten ."}
{"text":"This place is awesome for breakfast, lunch and of course brunch 
Smith Cafe is a very homely environment, I felt very welcomed when I came here and they are known for being busy but my girlfriend and I were able to get seated quickly.
Our sever was very nice and did a great job of recommending/highlighting things on the menu.
We had the \"Smith Hash\" w/ a side of peppered bacon....BOMB. 
This only made us excited to tryout the whole menu. I recommend this place to everyone. But don't be surprised if you have to wait, this spot is pretty popular for breakfast."}
{"text":"Wow - what a great new breakfast place!  We stopped in this morning and luckily grabbed two immediate seats at the bar.  The staff was so friendly and welcoming and the atmosphere was lively and comfortable all at the same time.  We quickly figured out that the owners also have Base Pizzeria just a little north of the Smith - another great place, so we knew we were in for a treat.  My husband ordered the hungry man platter and I ordered the Queen Mother...such a ridiculous amount of food, but they had me at roasted tomatoes and baked beans.  It also came with two cage free eggs, bacon, Schreiner's sausage, grilled mushrooms, breakfast potatoes, and sourdough toast with strawberry jam - yummy!  We will definitely be back - loved it!"}
{"text":"Fucking amazing!!! I always go back and forth on the idea of being a vegetarian and then I have a piece of bacon, so perfectly crisp, so good in fact that it pushes me back to square one. I had the French toast and a side of pepper bacon, it was phenomenal! My fiancé had the Arcadia breakfast burrito and his response to it was \"that was wonderful.\" (Not a phrase he uses often, I might add.) The entire experience was great from the food to the abeyance. HIGHLY RECOMMEND AND WILL BE BACK SOON!"}
{"text":"We were greeted with a warm hello as soon as we walked in which is always a nice touch from a business. My mom and I enjoyed the B&E Roll which was a little on the bland side but very filling. I really enjoyed the pickled onion on my sandwich and the country spuds as my side. The cilantro aioli could use more cilantro BUT I love cilantro so it is probably perfect as is to someone else. I liked the atmosphere of 3on Smith Cafe- relaxed and open. The decor isn't distracting and the industrial touches add a bit of edginess."}
{"text":"Fantastic restaurant with friendly staff,  I had the Chook and to date it might have been one of my favorite sandwiches in years!  Thank you so much for the great experience!!"}
{"text":"This is a very cute little spot off Indian school that has an outdoor patio area. The owners are from Australia and super incredibly friendly! They were very accommodating of our seat choices (we went back and forth) and only smiled the entire time. They're menu offers a great range of breakfast and lunch items that all taste wonderful."}
{"text":"My new favorite place! We had the Monte Cristo, Reuben and Green Chili Stew - all were superb! And the darling little waitress was attentive, yet not annoying; pleasant but professional; and full of menu suggestions, that she had personally eaten! Breakfast and lunch only and well worth stopping by!"}
{"text":"Came for brunch with friends. Very friendly staff!Great vibe. Great food, had the \"have it your way\" breakfast. The table had the Pretzel Club and Reaper Scramble and they all loved their meals! Definitely a must try!"}
{"text":"Great good, quick service, and perfect facelift for the old Acacia Cafe location. We had the Green Chili Pork bowl and the Hungryman's breakfast. At $15 for the Hungryman's breakfast, I'm convinced this is the deal of the century for AZ brunch. They aren't kidding when they say \"mountain of bacon\"--- and it's top notch bacon to boot. Sausage was phenomenal, and the poached eggs were some of the best we'd had. The potatoes weren't much to write home about, but that's partially because everything else stole the show. The Green Chili bowl was good too- but could have used a little more heat. All in all I would HIGHLY recommend. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Try to sit there in the morning so you can sit on the nice patio outside. Try the orange juice it's freshly squeezed. 

The food portions are quite large but well done. Will be heading back very soon..."}
{"text":"Just tried this spot the other day! I'm a huge fan of brunch (I think it's the most important meal of the day) and I was pleasantly surprised to find that this place has an amazing brunch! 

I ordered the avocado toast. As an avid avocado enthusiast, I was impressed with the flavors and presentation. My friend ordered the pulled pork sandwich, which was good, when it was finally brought out (details below). The Smith has a lot of healthy options which is always a refreshing break from the Oreo-Red-Velvet-Caramel-Sugar-Pankcake places. 

Only reason for not 4-5 stars was the service - not sure if it was just an off day, but my waiter/kitchen got my friends order wrong twice, and on the third time it was brought out cold. I totally understand that things happen, it's just that no one offered an apology or even acted like anything was wrong, and the waiter actually seemed annoyed with us for trying to get the correct order brought to our table. Hopefully next time it will be better!"}
{"text":"We had just landed in Phoenix and headed toward our hotel in Scottsdale, it was only 10 am so we wanted a good brunch. This place did not disappoint - we ordered the Smith Hash and the Green Chile Bowl with a side of country potatoes. The hash was spicy, but they flavor of the house cured corned beef was fantastic! The potatoes on the side were crispier than the ones served with the hash. I could have used one more egg with the hash, but overall it was a perfect place. I didn't try the green chili bowl but my husband was satisfied."}
{"text":"In a word, delicious.   

Simple, comfortable cafe with friendly service and creative, quality dishes.   

No sign of the snottiness often associated with the high quality, locally sourced menu.

My wife and I had the French toast and chilaquiles, respectively.  Everything was just right.  The French toast wasn't too sweet (as is so often the case) and the chilaquiles not too salty (even w me adding a side of chorizo).  Spicy enough, but not so much that it overcomes the rest of the dish.  

And after what would usually be coma-inducing choices, we feel surprisingly good and Mobile.

Definitely bringing the kiddos next time to try the fresh churros which looked spectacular walking by..."}
{"text":"Too expensive for breakfast and experience. Paid $17.00 all in for French Toast, egg, and iced tea. Food was nothing special...blueberry topping seemed canned. Ambience is \"casual upscalish\" . .. a few steps above fast food niceness...ala Matt's Big Breakfast. The staff, however, was very nice and attentive. It would be a good choice if you want or need to go to a \"nice\" place for breakfast and you're not particularly concerned about value."}
{"text":"3on Smith Cafe is a small Breakfast and Lunch Restaurant located in the Arcadia Part of Phoenix at Gaslight Square. It's a very casual restaurant with a big open kitchen. The atmosphere is energetic. The restaurant was named 3on Smith Cafe because Smith Street in Melbourne Australia is a sort of Restaurant Row and the three owners are from Australia. All the breakfast listed on the menu are called Brekkie because that is what they call breakfast in the land down under. I didn't notice any obviously Australian Foods offered but I can tell you that the breakfasts served looked big enough for you to hike the outback or a few Camelback Mountains.

We ordered sandwiches off the Lunch Menu.

I ordered the House Corned Beef Sandwich called the Corny Cow. WOW...how impressive for a small restaurant to make their own Corned Beef in-house. It's very rare that you will come across house made corned beef anywhere. I received a generously sized sandwich that came with a mixed greens side salad. The Corned Beef was very unique but good....It was tender, it had not too much and not too little fat and it was good..in the MOST DIFFERENT WAY. Flavored very different....than the usual corned beef and was heavy with what seemed like cloves, ginger and allspice. It was almost refreshing....in a really odd way. I guess it paired well with the charred onions and grilled sourdough and Swiss Cheese. It was a very non-traditional Corned Beef Sandwich but I have to say that it was very good.

My husband got the Green Pig Sandwich. It was tender, flavorful with just enough heat Green Chili Pork with pickled onion and a small squirt of just the right amount of cilantro aioli on a pretzel bun. I hear it was really good!

We were both really impressed with the value here as our sandwich platters cost less than we expected them to cost...but MORE IMPORTANTLY BOTH were quite delicious!

Service was quick and efficient...

A hidden gem! (for Brekkie and Sandwiches)"}
{"text":"I'd give them 4 stars for service alone. The hostess and servers were AWESOME! Very attentive, friendly, accommodating staff. The menu is concise but gives an array of options to fit your tastebuds for brunch. The portions are large enough to get full, however execution from the kitchen could use a little improvement. I asked for \"crispy bacon,\" but what I received was a pile of mostly burned in some places, but undercooked in other places, bacon stacked on my plate. On the up side, I notified the waitress of the issue and a new, evenly cooked order of bacon was brought out quickly enough for me to enjoy it with the rest of my meal. I normally would have not mentioned something so minor in a review but this bacon was initially burned badly, staff should not put food they see is not quality onto someone's plate. Overall though, I'd give them a try again for service alone."}
{"text":"FINALLY! A great breakfast place in the neighborhood. This used to be the Acacia Cafe, which I never had been to, but this place was super great. 

They have GF options and big plates, with reasonable prices. Their menu has a lot of awesome stuff (except for pancakes) and it all is so good. We had the BYO omelette and the Hungry Man Platter, both were big plates and tasted great. The service was fast, and we weren't without anything for too long. Super happy about this place! 

We will be back!"}
{"text":"The Smith is one of the best breakfast spots in Arcadia! The servers are excellent and the menu is great. 

The sourdough bread is the best I've had outside of San Francisco and the cold brew is perfection. Everything I've tried has been a hit.

Downfall: No alcohol. I would love to grab a mimosa with breakfast!"}
{"text":"Went based on reviews and first impressions were very good, open
kitchen, nice build out, open seating. Only challenge is its late in their
business cycle for the day, will it be as  good, they say restaurant thrive
when they are busy, its bumpy after the rush. It was a bit bumpy.

Nice menu, simple, not too exciting. The food took a long time and my
pet peeve is servers not keeping you informed along the way. Coffee
(very good) was not filled in the interim and it was starting to turn down
when empty restaurant couldn't come up with food in a reasonable time.

Food was fresh, better than average , the only issue is my corned beef
sandwich still has pieces of picking spice in the sandwich, didn't know
if it was suppose to be there, though sandwich was \"off\" and  after
thinking about it, it was a sloppy mistake by the Kitchen, yuk. What
operators and staff need to remember is that customers often come a
long way just to eat in their establishment, it needs to be extra special
for them to return, wow factor. This fell short.

Two other suggestions, bring house made chips or fries to the menu. Also
a piece of bread with the entree salads. When guests sit with nothing to do
or eat while waiting 25 minutes, things turn south quickly."}
{"text":"We arrived when it wasn't too busy and were seated quickly. We ordered our food within 5-10 minutes after we were seated. We ordered very basic breakfast items, eggs, bacon, toast, and an omelette. There are extravagant items available but we just wanted something basic. We waited for 45 minutes for our order to come and when it finally came it was wrong and awful. She had ordered scrambled eggs but they can out as over easy eggs. I ordered a bacon and sausage omelette, but it was far from an omelette. It was literally just overcooked pan cooked eggs with meat just sitting inside it. The house potatoes weren't really good with the addition of ketchup. The only good part was the bacon and toast, that's all. Maybe if we got something not so basic would be good but I'm not trying it out again."}
{"text":"Went in on a Wednesday morning. There weren't many tables which was nice considering it is a smaller cafe. Booths were comfortable and our server was friendly and attentive. The food was fantastic."}
{"text":"Great tasty food! Great service! I ordered the Reaper and it was delicious with a kick of spice! I will recommend this place for a SundayFunday spot! It would have been nice to have a mimosa there but they don't serve alcohol :("}
{"text":"I love shopping local - being involved with the movement since its early day when LocalFirstAZ just started - so I actually waited almost two weeks to write this. 

I went in to The Smith (great name and logo) and was confused about whether or not to seat myself, but someone called to me and let me know they'd help me in a minute. Kinda awkward.

I got my table and ordered a build your own omelet right away. The omelet came quickly. It was basically an overlooked disc of eggs with a melted slice of cheese in a lump and some veggies stuck to it on one side. There was also a side of potatoes that had great flavor but were really dry and warm-ish

The server checked back (yay!) and I explained my problem.  He looked at me like eggs were supposed to be mottled brown discs and unenthusiastically asked what he could do for me. I suggested I'd just take some scrambled eggs and eat them with my veggies. I requested that they weren't brown \"in any way\". My next dish was a browned bunch of eggs. 

I asked for the manager who turned out to be the owner, Roscoe. He was nice and told me he was interested in honest feedback so I shared my thoughts. I said I'd try again another time because other dishes looked good around me, but the egg situation should be given some attention. 

The decor was almost there but too industrial to be comfortable - very cold and unhappy. The music was also cool, bands I love, but too fast to eat to.

Hopefully, honest, constructive feedback will be considered because I'd really like to see Roscoe and team succeed."}
{"text":"Great food , freshly baked muffins, thick soft bread, fresh coffee, nice decor , friendly down under hospitality. Central location"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful brunch great mom pop place ! Parking was easy to find and the servers were very attentive and never left any glass or cup empty."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS!!! The coconut chia bowl is SO ADDICTING and the reaper scramble (potatoes, egg, Schreiner's sausage chorizo, egg, spinach) is SOOOOOO GOOD! my new fave spot in town"}
{"text":"We came in for breakfast on a Saturday.  We were seated tight away on a nice shaded patio to eat our meal outside.  

Coffee was excellent, plain old drip but made in a perfect way! Servers also came around a refilled many times...always nice to get this service without asking:)

Ordered the french toast and they were great. My husband ordered a skillet dish with corn beef and it was good - needed some freshness like tomatoes or a dollop of sour cream or salsa - seemed dry.

Defiantly a good spot to grab a meal!  Plenty of parking all around. 

We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Can't believe I have yet to review this place. Easily my favorite breakfast spot in Phoenix. I've eaten here at least a dozen times and I usually get one of two things - the green chile pork or the smith hash. Both are fantastic and I struggle with the decision each time. The pork has some spice that will vary in its intensity from time to time, but my fiancé (who doesn't do well with spicy) still orders it so it can't be that bad for those of you on the fence with spicy food. Service is always top notch and I can't recommend this place enough."}
{"text":"I was here earlier in the week and had a pretty average experience.  As another reviewer said, there really isn't a hostess so you have to catch a server's eye to be directed to a table.

The menus are on the table but it took a while for someone to get me a drink and take my order.  Speaking of drinks, I was interested in one of their $3 Arnold Palmers but when I asked about refills or to go cups and was told that's not what they do I decided to pass.

On a positive note, my corned beef sandwich had good taste.  If you are it's thinking a large deli-sized corned beef sandwich then think again.  This was more of a ladies-who-lunch portion.

I'm not sure that I'd seek this place out again.  There are a lot of other great options in this neighborhood."}
{"text":"Huge fan of 3on Smith... we go there at least bi monthly on our way to the zoo or if we are in the area. The team is super friendly just as they are at BASE pizzeria their other place ( go if you haven't)! The food at Smith is always fresh and always properly done, this is our go to when we hunger for some good brunch!!"}
{"text":"Fresh food locally sourced great service music kind of loud for me in the morning.  I like the whole energy of the restaurant.  The food was delicious with lots flavor made well not sloppy.  The waitress (Jackie) asked my name and called me that the entire time like a professional!  Their coffee - passport coffee is amazing.  Tastes so good doesn't need sugar or cream.  Tasted great black.  Stop by give it a try!"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff, good food, and large portions. I probably could have shared my breakfast with my husband.  They have some unique breakfast dishes and we are looking forward to going back and trying something different."}
{"text":"Just had another great breakfast/brunch . We all had perfect plates of enjoyment. Good time had by all!!"}
{"text":"Holy cow when I went looking for a breakfast place to sustain me for a long day of errands, paperwork, and bureaucracy, I picked The Smith on a whim. I didn't expect really nice staff that were joking with each other as the brunch rush started, the cute decor, or a plate of food bigger than my head!  And it wasn't even the biggest!

I never understood the difference between an American breakfast and breakfast from the U.K./Australia. I do now. Roasted tomatoes and mushrooms might sound weird, but trust me it's worth it! I thought I was in the mood for a big breakfast, but I have to take some home. When they say a mountain of bacon, believe me they mean it! I had the Queen's Plate (sans the beans cause I'm a wimp), and I wound up taking most of it home. 

They even indulged (and maybe understood?) my sometimes absurd tea needs, and had a wonderful collection to choose from.

The Smith has definitely earned a repeat customer, and I can't wait to bring my parents here next time they visit!"}
{"text":"Best Chai Tea in the area!  I don't know exactly what they do to make it so delicious, but it is legit!  Great tunes and great breakfast burrito.  Patio seating for sure."}
{"text":"Great staff the breakfast burrito is the bomb! The chook is an awesome sandwich. Usually the daily special is awesome however yesterday it was carnitas over chips with an egg and it just didn't have much flavor even with the green sauce. I definitely recommend this spot in the heart of Arcadia i would give them 4.5 but can't post 1/2 star."}
{"text":"This is my first Yelp review and I couldnt keep from letting others know about this place.

Tried this place last Sunday in the 9 AM hour. It was just 2 of us and we were able to get a table immediately suprisingly due to the amount of customers already seated.  

I ordered the green chili pork bowl and water.  My partner ordered bacon, eggs, toast, and potatoes and a tea.  Please be aware, your normal staple of condiments are not on the table (salt, pepper, sugar).  When she got her tea, she asked for sweetener.  She was given 2 packets of Splenda..she doesn't use Splenda so we had to wait for someone to come around again and ask for a different option.  We couldn't understand why they were so controlling w/ their condiments... As well there was someone continually walking around with coffee but I had to keep waiting on water refills....

It took 40 minutes to get breakfast!  When we did get our plates, they forgot her bacon!  Mine looked good but on the surface had ALOT of oil.  First bite I noticed decent flavor.  Next bite was fat...third bite was fat.... I ended up spending 5 minutes taking all the fat out of the bowl.  It equaled out to a third of the bowl!  The waiter and staff watched me go through this and no one offered to take the bowl back or give me something different.   They gave me a bowl to put the excess fat in!  No apologies for the time it took to get our plates or for the additional time I spent taking all the excess fat out that shouldn't have been in the bowl to begin with.  I decided I couldn't finish the bowl between the oil and fat.

I asked for a to go box so I could take what was left home and doctor it to work for me.  The waiter asked how everything was I told him about the bowl, still no explanation or apology.....definitely won't be back here."}
{"text":"The environment is really pleasant! And I particularly like this burrito that tastes so good!"}
{"text":"What a great place to relax and enjoy some great food with a perfect amount of creativity. The owner was working the tables and you could tell how passionate he is about the food and people. I travel a lot and am lucky to find great places like this. I will be coming back again. He was also thoughtful enough to give us some coffee to go because he knew we had a day full of meetings. Nice touch!"}
{"text":"I went in to this wonderful food establishment and was served by this wonderful beautiful waitress. She seemed super positive, she was never on her phone, always running to tend to the emotional food needs and desires of all the various customers. It's amazing to watch such correlated and knowledgeable management of the restaurant and time from Chayse. She gave me everything I ever needed. I have one complaint though she kept asking for my sausage. I said she could have the tip but she wanted the whole sausage. I was intrigued and perplexed... is that what they call a food-gasm? Either way, Chayse( my future wife) is awesome and Megan is pretty cool too. I would probably make them co-presidents of the Smith if that position was available. Just saying, they're pretty vegan."}
{"text":"The food was really good. The service was even better. On other reviews people seem to have had trouble being greeted. We went this morning on a busy Sunday and were not only greeted right away, but they also found us the best seat available on the patio and got us in right away. 

My wife, brother and I had the green chili pork bowl, the breakfast burrito, and the avocado toast. We had a great conversation with the owner, who also owns Base Pizzeria. This is a huge upgrade to Acacia Cafe - better food and a better vibe. If you're expecting this to be like Acacia, you'll want to go somewhere else. This is modern and higher quality.

Oh, and if you're one of the people who is mad at Pita Jungle for getting rid of Passport Iced Tea - be angry no more - just go to The Smith and get Passport Tea there along with better food."}
{"text":"Another gem of a place on our first visit to Arizona. The reaper scramble is delicious - not very spicy but the flavor of the pepper really makes it."}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise this little place is. 
We came in on a whim and so glad we found this place.

My wife had the pretzel bun club which has loads of goodness. I had the corn beef n Swiss on sourdough...
The soup was something we just wanted to try. It's a very unique flavor profile with pumpkin seeds and almonds in it.

Overall a nice little place that will surprise you and your taste buds.

The service was prompt and Megan was very friendly and full of information regarding items on the menu."}
{"text":"Outstanding food and service!

We came here for breakfast and had a delicious meal.

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"The restaurant's vibe is great, the food is amazing, only negative was the coffee. I have ordered a cappuccino and wasn't as expected. Other than that, it was great! I have ordered The Chook, and it was fabulous!"}
{"text":"Amazing! They support local vendors like Noble bread and the bacon made the kids very happy. Perfect addition to our rapidly growing neighborhood restaurant scene."}
{"text":"What a delightful restaurant. We were looking for a dog friendly pretty patio for breakfast after our hike and we found the perfect spot! Yummy  all-day \"brekkie\" offerings and amazingly friendly and attentive customer service. We got the avocado mash. They even had tasty gluten free bread for me! We will be back...I want to try the English Breakfast next time."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I tried this place out. We found it on Yelp after we went to church. I had the Reaper Scramble and it was phenomenal. It's spicy but really good. I recommend adding bacon and avocado to it!"}
{"text":"These guys know how it's done.

I am so glad to have The Smith so close to home.

The menu is packed with tons of great options for carnivores and veggies alike. My man loves their corned beef hash, so he tried the corned beef sandwich today - to die for. The caprese sandwich was delicious. The almond pesto was phenomenal - couldn't get enough.

I cannot wait to try pancakes or French toast with berry compote. Saw it getting tossed on some French toast earlier and it looked so yummy.

The interior is great - the wood tables and siding along the bar and kitchen area make it seem homey and I love how clean and simple everything seems. 

So glad the Base team has opened this spot. This is such a step up from Acacia Cafe. Props, guys.

Check this place out as soon as you can!"}
{"text":"Didn't know that Acacia Cafe was gone and this took its place.  Loved A.C., so I was skeptical.  Great, friendly, fast service to go, and the sandwich was great."}
{"text":"Great cafe food. Ingredients n preparation w detail. Can't go wrong. Very friendly staff, they care n like what they r doing n it shows."}
{"text":"Yelp recommended, I had French Toast, bacon and OJ. EVERYTHING was delicious.  The service was pleasant and efficient and it looks like I need a few more visits. It all looked so good!!"}
{"text":"Darn good, I'd say similar to Matts Big Breakfast which is also fantastic! Next time I will split my order because we each ate half of our meal. Definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"I was a bit disappointed with the new place, we went to check out the changes, instead we were stuck outside the doors, while they had both their doors open- we were left to figure out what to do- 
There was no greeter, no host, no welcome we will be with you nothing ! We actually stood there waiting because we wanted to try it- knowing it would be busy- but finally opted to go elsewhere-  a small greeting, sign in sheet- nothing at all-   No thank you.

Good luck though- I hope you do well-"}
{"text":"We had breakfast here a few days ago and I can't rave enough about the place. It's a small little brunch place with a big sense of attention! The food is fresh, tastes great and the service is amazing! Definitely we will be going back!"}
{"text":"Staff is very attentive. My coffee cup was never empty for long (very important!). I decided to go with the BYO omelet and I'm so happy with my choice! Between the omelet, potatoes, and toast, it filled my entire plate!! Very nice outdoor seating area which is a perfect early morning spot before the day got really hot! They also let dogs outside on the patio!"}
{"text":"Went to The Smith today after a 3 hour delay getting into Phoenix. It's a cute little quick-serve restaurant with delicious options. I ordered the avo smash which did not disappoint (I couldn't even finish it)! The avocado was fresh and the lemon added the right amount of tangy-ness to the dish. 

I did not see one thing come out of the kitchen that didn't look delicious! I would definitely come back here for a quick bite."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE This Place!  It is 100% my go to place for brunch.  I come here every single weekend.  (The only downfall is they do not serve alcohol, I do love bloody's and mimosas)  But the food is always AMAZING, and the service is top notch!  Love my Aussie friends there, they always make me feel like I'm stopping by their house for some brekie.  A couple of my favorites: 

1. The Daily Special, what I usually get
2. The Hungryman if you are starving and/or hungover
3. Avo Smash (with an egg)  when you're feeling like a good basic b**ch...lol"}
{"text":"This place was SO good! From the bubbly greeting when we walked in to the quirky staff to the awesome list of brunch options, I was a happy camper! I had the HOT scrambler (can't remember the name offhand) and instead of getting the oil mixed in they let me add it myself which was perfect! My co-worker had the pretzel club Sammy and loved that as well. The whole place smells like bacon so that's always a plus ;-)

It has a very unique, rustic feel to it which I always love. Great bevy options!"}
{"text":"Awesome food! It was hard to pick just one thing! We got the Smith Hash and the Arcadia Sunrise Burrito. Both were excellent and so big we took over half home for tomorrow's breakfast. Great, personable service. This is my new regular stop when visiting Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Went in for breakfast. The wait staff was friendly enough. My friend said she was going to order The Smith Hash based on reviews. After receiving her food she never commented about her meal and she didn't finish it so I take that to mean it was nothing special. I had the BYO Omelet which was also nothing special and definitely overpriced. Some of the potatoes were so crispy that I somehow scratched the roof of my mouth.

It was nice to see some vegetarian and vegan options on the menu. $2 to substitute eggs for mushrooms seems overpriced.

Overall, ok food that I can get cheaper somewhere else. Not worth the price. I won't return."}
{"text":"Loved this place. We just landed from San Francisco and stopped here on the way from the airport to Scottsdale. Food was great, service was very friendly, and the design modern. Great experience overall!"}
{"text":"With only two visits (so far) this place has become one of my favorites. 

1st Visit: I had that day's specials which was a \"B&B Cristo\" sandwich that consisted of 2 eggs over med, bacon, jalapenos, swiss, clinatro aioli, topped with a homemade blackberry syrup with a side of potatoes. This sandwich set the bar high because the following weekend I ordered a \"monte cristo\" sandwich at ANOTHER restaurant thinking it would be something similar to the \"B&B Cristo\". I was very disappointed with the monte cristo. Sadly, the B&B Cristo is not a regular item on the menu. 

2nd Visit: I had the Noble French toast, not a special and is on the menu. They were good, but they didn't blow me away like the sandwich mentioned above. I need to have some kind of meat with my breakfast food, thankfully my boyfriends had a mound of bacon and a few sausage links with his Hungryman platter. 

Overall, I love the place and that fact that you can see the cooks doing their thing. The service has been super friendly and I can see myself going back again."}
{"text":"The Reaper scramble was outstanding and the open kitchen was really cool. Friendly service, fun atmosphere, and great food. I look forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"Ok, if pictures are worth a thousand words, what are these pictures worth on a Sunday Morning?!?!   A LOT!!!  Great food, great service and an awesome patio!!!  Breakfast, brunch or lunch, you've got to give it a try!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were honeymooning in PHX and we were looking for a cute brunch place to eat at. I found this place and the service and food was great!!! I really recommend the coffee and espresso drinks. I can't wait to visit this place again (:"}
{"text":"Went here for brunch and loves it!  The hash is made in house and was the perfect blend of spice without being too salty.   I'm definitely going back."}
{"text":"Based on Yelp reviews four of us tried The Smith for breakfast.  Super friendly staff with more of an industrial / sparse design theme. We each tried a different dish and everyone loved their meals. They use Shriners Sausage and Noble Bread so quality ingredients. Maybe $2 more a plate than normal, our ticket with two coffees and 4 meals was $59 before tip. We all agreed we will be back."}
{"text":"Came in off of a recommendation, unfortunately was disappointed. Although the service was friendly, food was bland, coffee was less than mediocre and staff seemed disorganized."}
{"text":"I'm visiting a friend in Phoenix from Cincinnati and wanted to get a quick but good late lunch and found this place on Yelp and decided to check it out. The location is in a strip mall, but those tend to be some of the best restaurants in my opinion. 

I came in around 1:30 on a Tuesday so I was one of the few people there. Roberta sat me down and was very sweet and kind the entire time. I got the Green Chile Pork Bowl and it was AMAZINGGG. So many different flavors that all worked together so well. I wish I could come back and try the rest of the food. 

Overall great experience!"}

Food is fresh and delicious. The staff is friendly and attentive. Definitely a spot I will keep coming to over and over again."}
{"text":"With the influx of new restaurants in the Phoenix area, my wife and I have been trying new coffee/brunch places every weekend. Today, we decided to try The Smith and man, did we find a winner. This place is excellent. Owned by some very friendly Aussies (who also own Base pizza) who know how to serve great coffee and delicious food. Ordered the Avo Smash and Reaper Scramble and loved both dishes. Would absolutely recommend and will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Decided too check this place out while on this side of town after reading the reviews. My husband and I split the reaper scramble it was amazing!!! The kids loved the French toast! We can't wait to come back again :)"}
{"text":"Found on Yelp! and went on a whim.  This place was amazing.  Food and service were impeccable."}
{"text":"You gotta try this place.  We stopped in for breakfast today and it was amazing.  My wife had the B&E roll (fantastic breakfast sandwich on a pretzel bun) & I had the Green Chili Bowl - and it was some of the best pork green chili I've tasted.  We'll be sure to come again."}
{"text":"came here during spring training about a month ago. My cousin and I both ordered the Reaper scramble. It was pretty good. Not too spicy. If you like spice you will like it though. I would order it again.
my wife got a breakfast burrito and liked it and also got a latte that she really liked. my daughter was also able to get gluten free toast, so great all around along with the service."}
{"text":"Went there today to try it out. The food was fresh and very good. Their corned beef was to die for.  

The downfall is their seating. The chairs are super uncomfortable.  

The staff was friendly but sure walked around a lot doing nothing and dropped four things in forty minutes which was very loud and scary."}
{"text":"Went to check this place out this morning and it's probably my new favorite breakfast place! I had the reaper skillet which was amazing. Spicy but very good flavors. Jackie was attentive and friendly!"}
{"text":"We tried this spot because of the great Yelp reviews. It didn't disappoint. The breakfast burrito is huge! Perfect to share with someone. The salsa verde was the best I've ever had. Food was fantastic. We will definitely be back the next time we are visiting the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"I work right across the street from here and when I forget my lunch this is my go-to place!!!

\"The chook\" sandwich is AMAZING. I've had it every time and I can't bring myself to get anything else. The bread is so fresh, the chicken is so tender, and the chipotle aioli has the perfect amount of kick without being spicy. 

The same waitress is always there. I believe her name is Roberta. She is so kind and attentive and has the best attitude!!!!

It's a tad pricey, but great food, great service, great atmosphere!!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast joint. Very delicious flavors. The reaper scramble and  smith hash I highly recommend. Especially there potatoes and scramble. Excellent customer service. Outdoor patio. Bike racks. Bikes rentals."}
{"text":"Well we found another good place for brunch!!  Noble French toast and sausages were very good and the egg burrito was just as good!! Nice little restaurant!!"}
{"text":"If you want fantastic food, great vibe, awesome lattes, hip decor ideas (industrial), then come to the Smith!    My new fave :) ty"}
{"text":"Love this place! The food and ambiance is great. The owners are from Australia and are very warm and friendly. You wouldn't know that this little gem was here because it is tucked away in a little strip mall. Very unrevealing! Anyway... great place to check out!"}
{"text":"Great food and service. I had the green pig pork sandwich,  very tasty good pretzels bread. Salad was crisp. Wife had blt and salad"}
{"text":"So I biased and was one of the first to review base.  But they guys have the touch. More realistic they have the drive to work their a** off to put out a great product. Please support a business that cares about what they do.

Great breakfast spot everything we tried was amazing.  Large portions of everything. 
The hungry man is amazing.
Pancakes are best I have had since original pancake house
Bacon is crispy
Sausage is amazing 
Can't wait to try the rest of the menu.
And yes their ice tea is good there too."}
{"text":"We were disappointed to find that our favorites, lox and bagels and eggs Benedict,  were not on the menu.  Neither was the yummy tuna salad sandwich or the spinach salad.  I realize that new places want to update and offer new items, but many Acacia patrons went  there for our old favorites.  I wasn't attracted to any of the new items, so I ended up having eggs which were okay.  The person with me, who was disappointed there was no lox and bagel, had a sandwich.  She said it was okay.  I may call now and they to see if the menu changes, If not, I probably won't be going there as often as I did."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick breakfast. Best bacon I've ever had in my life. Best breakfast potatoes ever.  Next time I'm in Phoenix, I'm coming back."}
{"text":"I had an overall wonderful brunch experience at The Smith. The food was delicious (I got the B&E roll, seriously recommend it!) and my iced latte was one of the best I've had in the Phoenix area.

The kind service really stood out, though. Our waiter was attentive with refilling drinks and checking in, and he even gave me a free latte to go, since my car died in the parking lot and my friends and I had to wait for the tow truck after our meal. Such a nice surprise!

Then when the tow truck arrived, another staff member came out and offered us some water while we waited for the driver to get my car ready to go, as it was quite hot outside.

I'll definitely return! Can't wait to try some more items off the menu, and hopefully no car issues next time."}
{"text":"Delicious food and amazing service! The owners are extremely friendly and hands on. Great neighborhood cafe!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places for brunch. The food is excellent with large portions. Everything I've tried so far has been wonderfully prepared. The staff is very friendly and personable, making one feel like a lifelong friend. The atmosphere is energetic and fun. No complaints from me and I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Cute place, great music and friendly staff...however they could not get an over medium egg right..finally gave me an over hard egg and it was inedible. Plus kinda pricey ;("}
{"text":"I got the Avo Smash Toast - there was WAY too much avocado for the amount of bread. It was probably equivalent to 3 full avocados. With the egg on top, it was 13-14$$. My bf got the French toast with berry compote. Butter was like an orange butter. He was \"¯\_(?)_/¯ \" about the thing. Not
Sure if we'd be back... def better spots out there in the area. Service was great tho! And the coffee was yummy!"}
{"text":"Great stop! Flew into Phoenix and stopped here for breakfast. Got the avocado toast and an almond milk latte- both great. Would definitely recommend this breakfast spot!"}
{"text":"I'm moving to the area next month and am glad I found this gem. The turkey sandwich on a pretzel roll is amazing. Fast, friendly, and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Ended up at The Smith with my four kids while my wife was out of town on a girl's trip. It was busy, which is a good sign, but the wait wasn't to bad. We squeezed into a booth and after a seat switch got comfortable and perused the menu.

Kid number one order the Hungryman Breakfast. This was a plate of food that could have been split three or four ways. Really. Three eggs. A pile of sausage and bacon. Big pile of small cubed potatoes. Toast. And he ate it all. How it goes for a teenager. He gave it a big thumbs up, but now is in a food coma.

Kid number two ordered the Arcadia Sunrise, which is a burrito. It had egg, bacon, cheese and potatoes and was split into two big pieces. He ate half and said it was good, especially with a small dip into some ketchup.

Kid number three ordered the BYO Omelet with onions and spinach. She liked it, but thought too much spinach and not enough onions. Came with lots of potatoes too.

Kid number four order the Jr Noble French Toast. He really liked it and ate the whole serving. He is a super picky eater so that equates to a good review from an 8 year old.

I ordered the B&E Roll, which is a tasty breakfast sandwich. I did it without the bacon. I know, so un-American. Deal with it. And it still was good. Egg, cheese and pickled onions on a pretzel roll with potatoes. 

Good breakfast has seemed to get pricey, but The Smith was no more expensive than similar breakfast places. 

All in all we would go back!"}
{"text":"Since I discovered this place a few months ago, I've held this place close to my heart. The staff is incredible, the daily specials are to die for, and the food is both amazing and consistent every time I come here for breakfast and lunch.

I've had breakfast and lunch at this place more than anywhere else in many years. 

This place and its people have me hooked. It was love at first bite."}
{"text":"Arriving at about 11:30 on a weekday, I was surprised to be offered breakfast or lunch.  Breakfast actually sounded pretty good, so that is what we went with.  We were warmly greeted as we walked in from the patio, and decided to sit on the west-facing patio as it was a warm day.  

The Smith was once The Acacia Cafe, a place we visited on occasion for fresh sandwiches and we had been hearing about the changes for a few months.  Celebrating the completion of our Tax Returns, the wife decided she needed a treat and this was it.  Finding a shady table, we ordered green iced tea for her, and black iced tea for me.  It seems that many of the Queen's subjects have a disdain for iced tea, but I would guess they've never really tried a good, fresh-brewed iced tea.  Apparently, the black tea I was served was not fresh, as evident by the fungish sour taste, but it was quickly and unquestioningly replaced with the green tea which was very tasty.  Tea has such a high profit margin that it should always be served fresh and stored cold after brewing, especially since it does not sit well in a tepid container and will ferment quickly.  Given that, I am a bit of a tea snob, so I can be somewhat critical of a bad brew.

Moving on to our 'brekkie', the wife had the traditional brekkie sandwich, sans bacon, which I would have happily devoured.  I was intrigued by the green chille (sic) bowl and had to have me some of that.  This dish is slow cooked pork, green chilli sauce, over easy cage free egg, cotija, cilantro & pepitas with tortilla, served in a cast-iron boat.  It was quite tasty and a large portion of tender chunks of pork, but I would have liked a bit more green-chile spiciness.  I'm also a green-chile snob :-).  The wife loved her sandwich but wished she had asked for avocado added to it - perhaps next time.

Service was friendly, and our meal arrived quickly.  We enjoyed the quiet ambiance as we finished our breakfast, our tea glasses being refilled without question and before we needed.  Prices are a bit high, but that seems to be a trend in this Arcadia neighborhood, and the value for the meal was fair."}
{"text":"Get The hungry man breakfast! The place has a great ambience and the staff really care about the overall dining experience. The food has high quality, great taste and very good portions. Pretty much everything I look for in a restaurant"}
{"text":"I was a big fan of Acacia Cafe so when they changed it I almost didn't try The Smith.  Well let's just say that the change was well done and executed.  Decor is nice, service has been spot on and the food is yummy."}
{"text":"To start, I never was a fan of British food. Hubby choose this place and he's a foodie so... Fine.

Hubby ordered Queen Mother with a black coffee and I ordered the Green Chilli Bowl with black Americano.

Wow...I can honestly say...this is the first time I found British food taste good...so good!

The Queen Mother is HUGE...the mushroom is a-m-a-z-i-n-g. The Chilli Bowl has the right amount of spice and the pork is soooo tender. One of the review said it has too much oil, I don't found that to be the case, it is pulled pork after all, I'm surprised it didn't have more oil.

Oh, their coffee... So so smooth. I never had an Americano so smooth before. Hubby coffee is also excellent, it just the Americano is a tad better.

Lastly, customer service is excellent... Decor is farm house rustic... Love it. 

Eat here, you won't regret."}
{"text":"We found this gem thanks to Yelp while staycationing. Food is phenomenal and the service fantastic. The Smith sources their coffee locally from Passport, best cup we've had in a while. Build your own omelet was perfectly made with tots & toast for sides, wheat trumped the sour dough. Boyfriend had the breakfast burrito & still talking about the green sauce on the side (tangy with a serious kick!). Pricing is more than reasonable, breakfast for 2 + drinks = $24.

Long story short... we'll be back, soon!"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I stopped by for brunch. I must say from the staff to the food everything was perfect! We will definitely be back here soon. We are foodies and this is definitely up there on the list."}
{"text":"Wanted to try a new place and wow!!! Cute place! The service was great and the people are super friendly! Short wait during the brunch rush. Got a dirty chai and it was amazing. I had the avocado toast which was delicious! Their portions are the perfect size! I would definitely come back and tell everyone to come try this place out!"}
{"text":"This is my neighborhood go to place for coffee or breakfast. I love how friendly people are and the owner is super nice as well. They have outstanding coffee and great breakfast options. I've had the green chili bowl and it was amazing but the last time I had it there was a little too much fat. I also like the avocado toast. I love eating at the bar for a quick meal. 

This restaurant has a lot of great things to offer, mainly that it is small and friendly and they take pride in their offerings. The employees all seem to be happy as well."}
{"text":"Found this place after a failed Google search (thank you yelp). Perfect local spot for a Sunday breakfast or quick stop lunch. The green chili pork breakfast skillet was especially tastey"}
{"text":"Brunch is easily my most self-indulgent sin and not something I do often nor take lightly. 

Phoenix has become a culinary paradise over the last 10 years and with all the excellent chefs and options restaurants must be on their game to impress.

The Smith Cafe has elevated my taste buds to another stratosphere. The place is open and casual with a great little patio. The staff is warm and truly engaged. So, let's talk about my brunch.

Corned beef hash is by no means 'haute cuisine' and not always available on breakfast menus at most places. 3on not only nailed this, they DOMINATE!! Homemade, with fresh potatoes and real brisket, they balance a touch of spice with nutmeg that brightens all the components of savory and spice, proteins and starch leaving my palate with an unforgettable experience!

Not that I needed anymore to eat,  brunch somehow feels incomplete without bacon. Theirs did not disappoint. (Is that a hint of maple??) Generous enough portion to share, too!

I cannot wait to come back and try EVERYTHING. Bravo!!"}
{"text":"What?! Only 29 reviews? Listen, I'm a vegetarian and when I walked into \"The Smith\" it smelled AMAZING! Just fresh herbs, meat, food, yummmmmm. I had a veggie omelet with their potatoes which were awesome. My friends ordered other dishes I can't recall (sorry I was too hungry) but both said their entrees were spectacular (yes, SPECTACULAR!). It looked it, I was tempted to taste it. Anyways, the service was on point. They were so attentive, friendly, and available and it got busy for lunch too. I love finding a cool funky place like this with indoor and outdoor seating that has amazing service and food. What more could anyone want? Well, I'll tell ya. They have great options for vegans, vegetarians and carnivores alike! What do you have to say now? Go to The Smith, you'll thank me for it and feel destined to leave them 5 stars!"}
{"text":"We had breakfast in this remodeled restaurant this morning. The service was friendly and fast. We had pancakes that were golden orbs of wonderfulness. One person had the Green Chile with a egg on top with flour tortillas that were delicious. We will return again for a great breakfast."}
{"text":"Such a cute place! It was a bit pricey (22.00 for one person breakfast) but the portion was big enough to share so,in my opinion, it was worth it. Plus it was really good! I got some sort of pork skillet with egg and tortilla. Amaze!"}
{"text":"Came here on a weekday and loved the simple but classic cafe ambience. The cafe is run by Aussies with a \"Brekkie\" section of the menu that seems notorious for their flavorful twists on breakfast concoctions.
I've been stalking them on Instagram and it looks like they kill it at their specials; walking in I was excited to hear what they have in current rotation, especially since they released a chorizo breakfast sandwich that's more than drool worthy, a few months back.
The special did not disappoint! Dubbed the \"Dr. Seuss Burrito\", this whimsical beast of a burrito was chock full of eggs, potatoes, green chili pork, provolone - and topped with salsa verde and queso cotista. And the size?! This is where the term \"burrito baby\" originated. Here. This is where they make 'em!
On top of this burrito baby, I also ordered a Chai Latte. (How my stomach didn't explode is still a mystery).They get their coffee supplied by Passport coffee, and I  indulged in that cup of Joe, sipping while writing down in my journal for a while. That's how you know it's good.
Great ambience, great food, great lattes? Holy cow I'm in love."}
{"text":"My husband and I have dined here multiple times and I am obsessed! The service is always outstanding, and their green plate for brunch is heaven! Local ingredients, excellent coffee and friendly waiters. My husband also swears that they serve the best almond milk chai latte he has ever had! We will be back time and time again."}
{"text":"My new favorite lunch spot! All of their food is delicious!! I've had all the salads and I still can't choose my favorite because they are all that good. The sandwiches are yummy and quite large. Also they serve breakfast ALL day."}
{"text":"I suspect this will become a regular place for you. The smallish dining area is supplemented by a pleasant patio. The place is run by the same fellas who operate the terrific Base Pizzeria, so we expected and experienced some of the same traits. Pleasant venue, terrific staff, fresh and tasty ingredients, a reasonably wide range of savory and sweet options, and reasonable prices. We are particularly fond of the green chili bowl and the hash presentation, but you won't go wrong with anything. If you are going to have the hot oil, I'd suggest getting it on the side: it is liquid fire! Enjoy the bottomless cup of coffee. We ourselves will be regulars, as we are delighted to have these folks in our neighborhood."}
{"text":"The menu is simple which is a good thing. Big nice portions, good value. Server was very nice and had tasted most everything on the menu. I had the pretzel club sandwich. It was big and fresh tasting. The bacon was done to perfection, Turkey was a nice flavor too. Decent parking and all in all a perfect little spot to drop into for a sandwich. My friend had breakfast. He LOVES daytime breakfast so the Smith did not disappoint with their all day breakfast."}
{"text":"This place was great! Not only was the food delicious but the service was amazing. It's rare to come across authentic customer service but their staff was delightful. I ordered the English Queens breakfast and would highly recommend it. Large portions and yummy food. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff although servers seemed overwhelm .  They keep trying to take our plates and we weren't done. Food as cold and order was wrong. Atmosphere was pleasant. I would suggest food be hot and not cold! This would of made a difference for a return visit. Serving can be corrected. Good luck !! Hope this helps since it can be a great place."}
{"text":"Love this place. Friendly , awesome staff and excellent good. Go for either breakfast or lunch"}
{"text":"Arcadia has a hot new breakfast spot that is gonna have people lined up with lots of bored, screaming kids for brunch on a weekend not long from now. 

The Smith's here. 

I went to my normal breakfast spot, Acacia Cafe, and saw that it's been reborn as The Smith, under new ownership with a totally new but still very familiar menu loaded with really fresh, delicious and local offerings. 

Homemade corned beef? Done. 

French toast with Noble bread. It's here. 

Not just breakfast, either. They have a very competent sandwich board also, on homemade sourdough bread. 

Come in so you can say you've been here before the line is around the building. You'll still wait in it, but at least you'll have some good times to look back on, when things were easier and you were one of the few people who knew about this place for the two weeks before it blew up."}
{"text":"Good place for breakfast. It was packed so I'm pretty sure the locals agree. Service was fast, and food arrived hot. Only complaint was one waitress chewing gum - not a very professional. The"}
{"text":"First time coming here with the family.  My daughters exact words were, \"this is the best grilled cheese that I have had in my life.\"  I would consider her an expert on the subject and consequently, \"The Smith\" a place that you should treat yourself to!!"}
{"text":"Yummy eats, great staff and awesome vibe.  Parking for your bike too! Cute patio to enjoy our amazing weather."}
{"text":"Great little breakfast/lunch cafe in Arcadia.  The atmosphere is clean and modern and the menu features many natural and organic options.  The French toast was insanely tasty- you have to try it!"}
{"text":"For me, the Smith was impressive from the start. I first visited about two weeks after they opened and then proceeded to return every weekend for over a month. The green chili pork breakfast is fabulous. The pork falls apart. The sauce has a nice kick, but isn't too spicy. The tortillas are served warm and taste fresh. On top of that, the dish is so large I can easily take half home to make tacos the next day. It's awesome. The husband loved their pancakes..... Buuut unfortunately they took them off the menu  because they were taking too long to make. This puts us in a bind, since the husband can't eat egg dishes and doesn't want chia pudding. They did say they might bring the delish pancakes back as a special. The coffee here is good and the wait staff keep it coming. I also went once for lunch and had a super delish chicken sandwich that was just as good the next day as it was the first.....yummmm.


So here are the negatives: the French toast is not that sweet, not that flavorful, and generally a waste of calories. The b and e roll sounds good, but really isn't. The pretzel rolls is way too prevalent, overwhelming the other flavors. 

Overall, this restaurant has a lot of high points, but order carefully my friends."}
{"text":"Great food and service from the owner to the waitress. I got the peppered bacon and the corned beef hash. Both were amazing and I'll def go back"}
{"text":"By far the best breakfast spot I've eaten at in a loooooong time!! The quality of service was outstanding and the food was incredible. If you live in Scottsdale or in the state of AZ I don't care you need to eat here! We stumbled upon this bc we needed to turn around to go the other direction and now we never want to leave!"}
{"text":"Have been to this place three times for lunch and always get the Green Pig Sandwich. The green chili pork has a little heat but very well balanced flavor with all the ingredients.  Tasty salad and very reasonable price. Service has always been excellent."}
{"text":"We shared the hungry man and it was enough food for three really. Great quality in the food the meats are clearly high grade. The space itself doesn't have a great flow or feel however the food is good and appears to be a good value. Great coffee as well small detail. We had great customer service here everyone was super friendly and accommodating I can only assume the douche bags who found these people to be rude have their own issues. No the menu is nothing like Acacia which is ok for us a person can only tolerate so many nuts and grains. I will say a few more sweet options might be nice on The Smiths menu but as for meaty and filling they got it covered!"}
{"text":"Top notch breakfast. Great selection and service. This is my new favorite breakfast spot. I will be taking my visiting friends and family here when they come to town. I highly recommend this local spot."}
{"text":"This is cute little spot. I found it on Yelp of course. The was about a 15 minute wait for me and my husband. There were some great options the menu. My husband and I settled for them burrito and have it your way meals.  The food was very good and my server was very nice and attentive. My only complaint was that my potties were a little hard. I would definitely eat here again"}
{"text":"Got the reaper scramble. It was amazing,  and would recommend to anyone. Very filling, but not as spicy as I was hoping. But still delicious!
Service and being seated is kinda slow, but then again they are really crowded on Sunday mornings so I understand. The location is also not very large. There is outdoor seating,  but this particular week I was not gonna sit outside in 115 degree weather. Will come back for lunch one day."}
{"text":"Walked in for the first time.  A few open tables, no wait, asked for the booth.  Was told they are saved for parties of more than two, yet both others had parties of two.  Hmm,  host demanded we eat at the table by the bathrooms.  Walked out. Thats not the kind of service that wins in my world.."}
{"text":"The food  is pretty good here I would love to ty other things on the menu. Definitely my kind place to go to for an awesome breakfast  the chili bowl is a must your 1st time here"}
{"text":"Get the Queen Mother. Biggest breakfast dish I think I've ever eaten. This place has great morning vibes. Mellow, great coffee, plus the rosemary on the table makes it smell like you are at a moms house, which is nice when you are eating breakfast. You can tell they take great care in making the food. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This has been a spot that I have wanted to try since first seeing it in the Phoenix New Times and the wife and I finally decided to see what all the hype was about. At first glance the ambiance was hipster and the staff was friendly. You order and pay when you walk in the door.

We ordered the hungryman breakfast for me and the tuna special sandwich for my wife. The breakfast did take some time to prepare and looked and tasted good but didn't seem to be enough on the plate to warrant $17 price tag. I did try the wife's sandwich and it was just average. 

When I left I still was hungry and felt a little taken. The food was good but just felt that I overpaid for what I ordered. I knew that I could have gotten the same quality and better for less money so the value was not there for me. 

Still I would recommend trying the Smith. The breakfast was good but still not sure what all the hype was about."}
{"text":"Unassuming place tucked into Gaslight square.
Friendly staff.
Small patio.
Okay it is based on one visit and one dish but the food sucks balls.
Green Chili pork platter for breakfast .
Geezus could you not find a cheaper cut of meat than that fat laden gristle you poured into my plate .
Unspeakably subpar."}
{"text":"Amazing food and an attentive staff regardless if they are your server or not. They are willing to accommodate any special requests and it is a favorite breakfast/brunch spot for my fiancé and I."}
{"text":"I'm so in love with this little cafe. The staff here is extremely friendly and the restaurant is gorgeous. I was here for breakfast on Friday. I ordered The Smith Hash {House corned beef, roasted green chillies, country spuds, onion, an over easy egg & toast}. It was the perfect breakfast. Instead of the over easy egg, I opted for the sunny side up. The egg was perfectly executed. Needless to say. I was one happy camper."}
{"text":"Food, service, and ambience are all excellent. Rossco and the other servers are friendly and fast. The breakfast sammie, omelets, and avo on toast are on point. The bread and sausage (Noble and Schriener's, respectively) are outstanding. Lunch salads and sandwiches are delicious, too. I haven't tried the French toast or pancakes with berry compote, but from the way people were scarfing it down, I'm sure it was amazing. They also have a full English breakfast on offer--not easy to find in Phoenix. A wonderful addition to the Arcadia area."}
{"text":"LOVE this place. This is my favorite new place in the neighborhood for breakfast. I've been here twice now and my wife and I have tried several different dishes. All were delicious. The service is above and beyond. They are SO NICE, it makes you really enjoy your experience. Good coffee, great patio on the west side of the building so it has morning shade. Dog friendly. What's not to like? The portion sizes are no joke as well, so you will probably be fine even splitting something unless you're really hungry."}
{"text":"The Smith is now my favorite breakfast spot!


 I just moved into the area and came across this spot because it had great reviews on yelp and now I know why.

I ordered the Queen Mother and it was so big but still delicious! The lady next to me ordered the smith hash and looked great too so I will definitely try that one next!

Also, Audriel, the server, was great! Always prompt on refilling my water and coffee! Great job guys! Will be back soon!!!!"}
