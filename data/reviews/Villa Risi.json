{"text":"I've gone to Villa Risi many times to celebrate special occasions.  The food, the service and the atmosphere were all amazing! I recently went there to celebrate Valentines Day.  We ordered their Valentines Day specials.  It was delicious but they gave very little pasta and the salad was disappointing.  It wasn't really worth the money.  Maybe they were having an off night.  Usually, I love it."}
{"text":"25 years worth of excellent meals here. If it was closer to Toronto I would go once a week. Special place in my heart, great family run restaurant."}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent atmosphere. Very good prices. If you want great Italian food with great atmosphere go here. 

They should lighten up the outside a little more. You can pass by this gem without even seeing it.  Other than that I think they also have a piano singer for added romance on the weekends. Just awesome"}
{"text":"Wow I had such a terrible experience here. I took my 80 year old parents here because my mom wanted to treat us out for dinner.  The young waiter was extremely rude and impatient with us. We took a bit of time to order and asked him questions about what he recommended and he acted very annoyed. There were only 2 other tables taken in the restaurant at the time. Our food was nothing special and below our expectations given the previous reviews. I would not recommend this restaurant and will not return."}
{"text":"I had a recently had a private function at Villa Risi. I spoke to the owner prior and he was very receptive and listened to exactly what I wanted out of the food (I found this step important).
The day of the event I was not disappointed. The food was above par. Everyone was raving about it and we all had a great time. I will definitely return."}
