{"text":"The food was a solid four, but the awesome service brings them up to a 5!  

Every employee that stopped by our table was friendly, helpful and professional. Additionally (and unfortunately a rarity these days), they were all very neat, clean and well groomed. 

The food was quick and all very tasty. No complaints at all.  I wish we lived closer so we could come back."}

{"text":"Solid spot off Highway 74 in Monroe. Very clean and festive inside.  I ordered the shredded chicken burrito off their lunch menu.  It was very good and a great price for $5.95.  

Also looks like they have an authentic drink menu.  I saw about 15 different types of aged Tequila."}
{"text":"Everthing was so good and fresh. Started out with fresh guacamole dip, cheese dip, and a drink called chohata. So amazingly refreshing. We ordered the 4 steak tacos and I had the fajita chimichanga. Bursting with flavor and I will be back for more."}
{"text":"Clean, great service, good prices.  Some of the best mexican food yet.  How can you go wrong?

Domestic bottles for $1.50 and well drinks $4.00.  I love a business where the owners really try to please the customers."}
{"text":"I expected a lot based on reviews, but was let down..
The service was not very good, maybe we came on the wrong day..?
Friday night. Wasn't very crowded. 
Had to wait 10 minutes on drinks and they were brought one at a time, the food was served the same way..
mine was 15 minutes ahead of the rest of the table and we had to ask for napkins 5 times before actually receiving them. 
2 of the waitresses had plenty of time to stand and flirt with a couple of guys though (1 was our waitress).
Taco Salad was completely covered in grease so I got it to go, but couldn't eat it. Wasted money."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful food and service. This location has never had anything that lasted. This place better. So clean and comfortable. I would have taken pics of the food but I was so hungry and couldn't wait. Health rating of 96

They have a huge selection of tequilas. The menu is so cool cause it lists them and gives you an idea of the flavor"}
{"text":"This place just opened and I have already been 3 times!  They have the best service amongst the Mexican restaurants in Monroe.  The spinach queso dip is a unique yummy combination.  I also like the TecMex taco salad.  My spouse likes the chimichanga.  Dessert menu is tops as well.  We will keep coming back."}
{"text":"this is my second trip to Monroe. This is by far one of the best local Mexican restaurants that I've eaten in. service is fast and I would definitely visit here once I get back into town."}
