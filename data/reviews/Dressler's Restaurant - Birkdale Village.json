{"text":"So... it's Friday night date night... and... no date. \"Nother Chardonnay please and follow it up with the largest slice of Chocolate Volcano Cake ya got\".   I found myself in quite a 'state' after having driven around the Brikdale Circle for ...an hour I think, trying to find a parking place. After being sufficiently aggravated and haven only eaten a salad 8 hours ago I needed a bevy and substance... STAT !   I wandered into Dressler's because tonight I can't take the crowded bar shenanigans and I needed some quite relief to relax and unwind. The restaurant was somewhat busy but the bar area was peacefully Sarine so I \"dined\" or rather \"wined\" at the bar. Kevin, the bartender, who also happens to be from Buffalo kept me company while I gorged myself on my cake. We had a nice conversation and then a big group walked in. It was after 10PM now and they were the only other folks in the bar area. I could tell they were receiving a loving reception by the staff and I later learned it was the Pit Crews for two very prominent local race teams. Very cool.   After my over indulgence I felt ready to call it a night. However, the Manager John and I got talking and before I knew it, it was closing time (11PM). They were so attentive and made me feel very welcomed. By the time I left, I had forgotten all the day's troubles and felt like I gained some new friends and probably a few guilty lbs ;) .... o well it was worth it!   Thanks Dresslers... you know how to make a girl feel at home."}
{"text":"Everything at this restaurant is done right from appetizers to dessert.  Our favorite meal is \"Just for the Halibut\".  They have a great wine list and the servers know how to pair them very well.  The desserts are homemade so save room."}
{"text":"My wife and I had dinner at Dressler's in Birkdale on Friday at 6pm.  The Ribeye and the level of service were outstanding.  I would highly recommend it."}
{"text":"My husband and I have a 13 month old toddler, so date nights don't exactly flow like they used to... So when I was looking for a restaurant to kick off our night out on the town I 100% made the best choice!  Dresslers food is second to none!  Seriously amazing. Their calamari is such a unique and delicious version of the old and tired out calamari. I had the salmon and grape tomato risotto (who doesn't want to try legit risotto that you see week after week on the food network) and it made my mouth water at the sight of it... But once I tasted it; forget about it. I was HOOKED!  My husband had the shrimp linguini and he couldn't stop raving about the abundance of shrimp and the unique favors present. We also had dessert!  (both separate, we aren't much for sharing) and they were to die for!!  Now set aside from the amazing food and decent prices for the quality of food the service is was really set up our evening!  Our server really went the extra mile to make sure we felt like we were celebrating something fantastic and special!  Our whole experience at Dressers was top notch and will now be on top of our list for date night restaurants!"}
{"text":"Great service and food is outstanding.  Always Top notch! One of the best places in the Lake Norman area.  Never disappointed, check it out if you haven't tried it!"}
{"text":"***Note*** This is the same review we wrote for the Midtown location.  We feel they are equal and also we are lazy.  We have been to both locations (Midtown and Birkdale) and both seem to be equally great.  Inside decor is nice although we only see it as we walk thru to the patio seating.  FYI, people watching at Birkdale is probably better but the skyline view of the Midtown location is excellent.  Parking is decent.  I believe there is valet at both places in addition to plenty of street and garage parking within a block.    We always get the crab dip appetizer...yummers!  Our entrees I'm a little fuzzy on as it has been a few months.  I know we've done the crabcakes which were great.  And I'm 99% sure I got the filet mignon once and it was great.  Outside of that I can't exactly recall but I know whatever it was we liked it.  One thing I do know for sure is we get the carrot cake for dessert.  Homemade by Mama Dressler we are told and holy crap is it good...and big.  I think we've even gone once or twice just for dessert alone.  We give Dressler's 4.5 carrot cakes out of 5"}
{"text":"I've been here countless times and I've never left unsatisfied. Steak is amazing and the crab dip is a must. Great value!"}
{"text":"Calamari.  Maytag Blue Cheese salad.  Seafood & Grits.  Awesome!  Great staff and great food."}
{"text":"This is the best! The bartender is wonderful and the owners are awesome! The heart of the ribeye was cooked to perfection!"}
{"text":"It doesn't get better than Dressler's in the Lake area. In fact, I would put it up against any gourmet restaurant in the country. Fabulous service, great wine list, crab dip is amazing, Cheesecake is second to none. The Dressler's take a great deal of pride in their business and it shows."}
{"text":"I treated my aunts (from out of town) to dinner here to celebrate their anniversary. When I made the Open Table reservation, I put a note in the comments section about it being their anniversary. To my delight, they came home after dinner and shared with us all of the ways in which they were treated to a very special evening. I was so surprised that the staff had taken the time to read the special requests and act on them!  This is a place my husband and I enjoy for a special occasion, and it was nice to know I could send friends and family here for them to celebrate their special occasions."}
{"text":"I have dined here in the past and have had wonderful experiences. Tonight was not one of them. Four of us sat at the bar for predinner drinks. We asked for a drink menu and my husband was handed a tablet to scroll through while the bartender stood there impatiently waiting, once he made his selection it had to be passed off to the remaining 3 of us individually because a tablet is not user friendly enough for multiple people to look at all at once (especially if one wants beer, another wine, etc.). Use an old school menu people! I didn't like the impatient feeling from the bartender at all. Once we arrived at our table we ordered an appetizer (even pointed to it on the menu) and a bottle of wine. The server comes back and rearranges our small table for 4 to put a huge ice bucket in the middle of our table. I asked for a wine stand, he said they don't have them. How can you not have a wine stand?! I told him that wasn't going to work, because we needed that space for shared appetizers. So it was moved to the edge of the table, not ideal, but better. Of course when they arrived, they were wrong and had to be remade (how can charcuterie and tuna be mixed up)? Our entrees took 45 minutes to arrive (due perhaps to a large private party?), no one ever apologized, three of the four entrees finally came out. My mother-in-laws dish trailed 5 minutes behind so we waited for hers to arrive. I ordered rare tuna, when I cut into it finally, it was medium at best. By the time we had waited for my MIL's dish, of course the remaining entrees were not as hot as we would have desired. The server didn't check in on us, so I begrudgingly ate it. All of the food tasted fine, the quality was good, but it wasn't how I ordered it, and it took forever to get to the table. Dressler's used to be a good go to spot, but if last night was any indication, just skip it. There are too many other places out there at this price point where service and customer satisfaction is paramount."}
{"text":"The goat cheese app was my favorite of the evening....except maybe the Carrot Cake. The owners mother makes it. IT IS PERFECT.  The entrees were...ok. nothing stellar. Salmon was good, but the risotto was...unexpectedly cheesy. crab cakes were crab cakes. the remoulade was good on them.  their wine list is almost overwhelming, but i can't say that it's a bad thing!  will we be back? eh, maybe.....?"}
{"text":"Went with a groupon.  I had the duck with wasabi slaw and it was delicious!  I would definitely recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"I would suggest making reservations, it's typically busy. My wife and I eat here on occasion, but every time everything's been perfect. Food, wine, service and overall experience, without exception, are always above expectation.   It's a casual, relaxed atmosphere which we thoroughly enjoy. With drinks/wine, dinner can be a bit expensive if you're budget minded but there's no question it's worth every penny.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"We have eaten at Dressler's about 5-6 times, and have always come away raving about it. Though it is a bit more expensive than most of our usual \"date night\" choices, it's one of those few places that is absolutely worth the extra expense. The food quality exceeds just about anything else you will find in the Lake Norman area, and the service is always outstanding."}
{"text":"I have been to the Birkdale Dressler's quite a few times and always had a good experience. Until last Tuesday, June 23rd. When we arrived only one table was occupied but we were asked if we had reservations (Tuesday at 5:45pm) which I thought was a little odd but shrugged it off. They must not have been ready for the evening because they didn't deliver the usual quality and service we've come to appreciate there. The calamari was undercooked. My crab cakes were dry and looked like maybe they were left over from the night before (never seen them like this previously). The mashed potatoes with my wife's filet were not good, they were gritty and cool. So needless to say we were disappointed. The carrot cake was good though. I am assuming it was just an off night for them and unfortunate for us."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for our anniversary. We can't speak highly enough of this restaurant. The food was amazing as well as the service. When our waitress came to our table she immediately asked if we were celebrating a special occasion. When we mentioned it was our anniversary she offered us complimentary champagne. As if that wasn't enough, we were given a complimentary dessert at the end of the evening. All of these wonderful things made our anniversary even more special!! This restaurant puts such an emphasis on the details and service! We will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"I love Dresslers and granma's famous homemade recipe cheese cake!  I like to sit outside and Birkdale and people watch as I sip my wine.  I love the food.  Sometimes I can spend a lot of money here but it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Visited Dresslers on Saturday evening. Was the best time my family and I had in a long time. The food was great, srevice was awesome, and the manager is always nice and hospitable. I would definitely reccommend this place if you're looking for great food and great service, in a nice quiet setting. I promise you it will be a memorable moment for you and yours!"}
{"text":"This is the best restaurant in the Lake Norman area. Very consistent and solid service from the waitstaff. I highly recommend the crab dip, crab cakes, just for the halibut, or grouper if they have it on special. If you like calamari, you will love it Dressler's style. If you aren't a seafood lover, the heart of ribeye with blue cheese butter is magnificent."}
{"text":"The Birkdale location is the one that we go to most frequently.  It's close to our home and feels like an upscale all american bar and restaurant.  The maitre de is fabulous and has a great memory of who our family is and is quite friendly on the way to our table.  Mind you, we are by no means regulars.  He just has a great memory and wonderful customer service. We go to Dresslers 5 or 6 times a year. The apps are great but we always get the thai style calamari.  It's crispy, tangy and leaves you wanting one bite after the other.  The dinner fare is always dead on but the portions could be lighter on the potatoes and increase the volume on fish, poultry or meat.  The tastes are unique and flavorful.  Desserts are a real treat here. Imagine the best dessert you've had and up it by a notch.  Every time we go to Dresslers we want to return the next night!"}
{"text":"Decent wine list, and the crab cakes are great. The rest of the meal was OK. The plate presentation could use some work, and they forgot the sauce (Demi glacé). We will likely return, just not too soon."}
{"text":"Love this place! The food is so flavorful and their customer service is the best. They make you feel so special. Had a groupon and you get so much food."}
{"text":"I frequent this great restaurant as often as I can because the service is warm and friendly, the food is outstanding and they have a great wine list. Jon Dressler and his staff always make us feel welcome and the ambiance is nice without being stuffy. I love the calamari app, the \"Just for the Halibut\" entree and their Filet Oscar. Mom's cheesecake can't be beat! I'll be back as soon as I can!"}
{"text":"Of all the restaurants in the Lake Norman area, Dressler's Restaurant is in the top three for a dinner out with that special someone.   The food is VERY good and the staff personnel are friendly, polite and helpful.   The décor is tasteful.   There is a very good wine selection.   And the prices are not overboard for this level of dining."}
{"text":"My husband and I visited when we were visiting family in the area.  We were seated in a private booth. The atmosphere is very nice.  The wait staff was very attentive! I tired to order the moscato, but they were out.  I tried something else bubbly, but it was gross.   We ordered the sausage appetizer.  It was not good at all.  It was over cooked and a total waste of money.  We both ordered steaks.  For my side I ordered the risotto, which wasn't very creamy, but ok. The steak was very well cooked and tasted delicious.  My husbands was also very good.  For dessert I ordered the key lime pie.  The real whip cream was very good.  The pie could gave used more flavor,  but was good.  The staff was incredibly attentive, we literally took sips of our water and it was filled within seconds.  It was a nice meal out!"}
{"text":"We have been to Dressler's in Birkdale many times and always have a nice time.  The food is really good... for apps I recommend calamari, crab dip, or the goat cheese.  My favorite dishes are the seafood but my husband has never been disappointed with his red meat entrees! There's also a nice bar area just to have a drink or two."}
{"text":"Wife and I ate here as part of $30 Dining Week. It was busy, but our wait, with a reservation at 8pm, was short. The food was quite good, especially the calamari appetizer, which featured strip cuts vs rings. The entrees were tasty but not exceptional. The service, on a very busy night, was better than expected. In all, and experience that will result in a return visit,"}
{"text":"Dressler's is a fantastic restaurant in the trendy Birkdale Village. Sitting among other nice restaurants, I normally pick Dressler's because of the nice combination of ambiance, quality of food and service.  I travel to North Carolina for business and this is a great place to take customers or be entertained by suppliers. The environment is perfect for business, and quiet enough for a more intimate dinner.  Food quality has always been fantastic and their wine selection is very good. We did have a situation where they ran out of the wine choice we had made, only having one bottle, but it was OK in the end as the service was of excellent quality, as usual.  The only knock on the restaurant is that it is rather expensive, but you generally get what you pay for and in this case, you do here."}
{"text":"Let's start with the positives: service was great. Very attentive, great waiter/Bartender. Food....hmmm. Ordered the cheese and meat plate. The cheese was awful. Two different types, one was a cheddar. Tasted like Cabot brand or another supermarket variety. Meat was a basic salami. Three small pieces of bread (one inch in size each). Some kind of pickled onion. About a tablespoon of this. No mustard, no honey, no fruit no nuts. It was so subpar! Next course chopped salad. Wasn't chopped. Iceberg lettuce. Awful. At this point I could not even order dinner. I instead ordered a slice of key lime pie. This was fine. Not good or bad. Quite honestly Publix's has better pie. Not quite sure why this place is four stars. Much better restaurants in the area"}
{"text":"always good but not great, A bit pricey but nice atmosphere and great service so a good place to go on a date or when you have a babysitter. Try the apple crisp for dessert. Mom's cheesecake was not the best."}
{"text":"I recently ran an outing with 17 people.  The folks at Dresslers did an amazing job putting it all together.  The service and food were excellent.  They mix a heck of a martini as well.  A GREAT time was had by all.  I am not giving it 5 stars because I think I was expecting the Capital Grille.  It is not that, but IT IS A VERY GOOD, SOLID RESTURANT with good food, good service and GREAT atmosphere."}
{"text":"So delicious. Their calamari was fantastic. The decor and service were first rate. It's a little pricey but worth it."}
{"text":"The restaurant was packed for restaurant week and service was still excellent.  The waiter was very knowledgeable about the food and it was hot and beautifully presented.  Best of all, despite the restaurant being full, we could easily carry on a conversation without having to shout.  Dresslers is our favorite high end eatery in our area."}
{"text":"Dressler's is amazing.  From the bread and sweet cream butter to the creme brulee dessert!  Had the Mahi - delicious tropical fruits on top of a grilled filet of Mahi.  Just For the Halibut is a delicious huge Frankenstein of a dish.  Halibut, with corn bread, and vegetables all with a delicious sauce.  Price is expensive, but you get large portions!"}
{"text":"We wanted to go to a nice restaurant as we has many reasons to celebrate for myself, my husband, and my aunt.  Instead of going to some of our favorites, we decided to try out Dressler's.  When we got there, we were seated immediately, not very busy for a Saturday evening - with it even being prom night around the area.  I love peach drinks, so I was very excited to try the peach martini that I saw pictured on yelp...except it is not offered at this location, only the midtown location.  Why can't they have the same menu?  I'm not going to drive all the way to another location just for something different.  So I settled on a wine that was supposed to be rose in color, but ended up being white.  Still tasted good, but I think their menu is incorrect in what they were actually serving.  We started out with the baked pimento cheese app.  This was the best part of the night.  It was great and the tomato jam on top added a nice extra flavor.  A+ on this.  For entrees, my aunt had the crabcakes (which she liked), my husband had the surf and turf (crabcake and ribeye) and I had the filet mignon.  My husband did like the crabcake as well, but the steaks here are not that great.  My husband can cook a better ribeye.  My filet mignon, which I ordered medium, had very little pink to it, so it was over cooked.  I didn't bother mentioning anything, as I'd rather eat with my group rather than sit around and wait for a properly cooked steak.  It was still a good steak, just not properly cooked.    It seems like most plates come with some form of potatoes or nothing at all.  I'd rather them just not have anything come with it and for it to all be ala carte.  I don't necessarily care about potatoes, and since I love macaroni and cheese, I would rather have that.  I still ordered the mac and cheese on the side, but I didn't need two starches.  The mac and cheese was over powered with the bread crumb topping and was not cheesy.  Creamy, but not very cheesy.  It was even worse as leftovers, just tasted like buttered pasta.  For the dessert.  The server told us a specialty for the night was oreo cheesecake - my favorite dessert!  Had to order that, but we also ordered the chocolate molten/lava cake, and the apple cake.  The apple cake was the winner of the three, while it was good, it wasn't great.  The chocolate molten/lava cake, was a huge disappointment, it was just a warmed up chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream, there was absolutely no center to it.  Instead, there was a chocolate sauce thrown on top.  Then there is my favorite...oreo cheesecake.  It was a jiggly mess.  The consistency was almost pudding like, but very also very gritty.  My aunt and I agreed, it was not good.  I decided to take it home and put it in the fridge, maybe allowing it to firm up a little.  It was slightly better, but not very good for my favorite dessert, ended up throwing the leftovers out.  Do yourself a favor, walk across the street to Red Rocks and have their oreo cheesecake, the consistency, the amount of oreos, is wonderful.  Sorry Mrs. Dressler, my sweet tooth was not impressed with the desserts.  Overall, I have higher expectations for a nicer restaurant.  If I'm going to be paying higher prices, it should be better than something I can cook at home.  To me, this was more like your every day chain restaurant except at an expensive, not worth it, price tag.  Disappointing since there are a number of good reviews.  Glad I tried a new restaurant, but I will not have second thoughts about coming back here, it is one and done for me as there are so many other better nicer restaurant options in Charlotte.   *Side note to restaurant - The server crammed 5 to go containers in one plastic bag tied.  Made it very awkward for carrying around Birkdale Village.  At any moment this could tear.  I supposed the server wanted to fit it all in one bag rather than us carrying multiple bags.  If you are going to be a nice restaurant, invest in some durable paper bags for ease of after dinner walk carrying.*"}
{"text":"Excellent find on Yelp!! I was looking for a nice, up scale spot to celebrate our 15th anniversary and the fellow Yelp reviewers did not let me down.  Excellent table service, superb wine list, entrees prepared to perfection - I could not ask for more. I had the Heart of Ribeye - one of the best steaks I have had anywhere. She had the Crab Cakes - excellent flavors as well with huge hunks of crab meat. You have to try the calamari appetizer - peanut sauce drizzle with a bit of wasabi was simply outstanding.  Dessert - homemade cheese cake from the oven of the owner's Mom? you bet - I almost ordered a second it was so go.  I'm already planning my next visit!!"}
{"text":"We all live in hope. Finding people and places to match those high expectations is one of my daily quests. It is my great pleasure to report that Dressler's is such a place and the owners and staff see to it. I always prefer a locally owned place and the Dresslers are welcoming hosts. In fact I enjoy the place so much, I've had takeout more times than I've actually dined in the restaurant. My experience started with my friends reserving the whole restaurant for their wedding. So drinks & appetizers, the ceremony, and dinner. When wedding food is that good - it's on!  What makes a dining destination a gem is perfection of food, service, and environment interior is warm and beautifully appointed. The service is stellar. They've made sure that the folks have prefect timing, without being intrusive.   The ingredients are fresh and carefully chosen. They take great care in plating the fine fare. Now for the particulars - the Onion soup is my new standard. Nobody does it better. Other must have apps - the Thai Crispy Calamari - made with fillet strips (not the rubbery rings) with a peanut glaze and heavenly wasabi aioli. The Low Country Crab Dip is another delectable choice. Who doesn't love something to dip their crunchy bread into?  Every entree has been a flavorgasmic experience. I love the Niman Ranch Pork Chop. The Herb-Citrus Grilled Salmon is flawless as well. Make sure to try their risottos - they do a three onion and a lobster version.  Desert - they are made in-house. I'm a carrot cake fanatic. But on the advice of the Wise and Wonderful Kimberly (ask for her - she is a Service Goddess) I tried the apple cake. She also convinced me to try the Seafood and Grits for dinner. I never been a grits guy - but the shrimp, lobster, mussels, and scallops with the spicy kick of the Cajun sauce was a perfect counterpoint to the mellow nuttiness of the grits.  They have a well chosen wine selection. Ask for any special reserves or treats that are not normally on the wine list. Yes - I heart Dressler's."}
{"text":"We have been to Dresler's many times before, unfortunately we were not impressed this time.  The food was poorly seasoned and portions were cold/cool.  Service was attentive, but the kitchen no longer is backing the wait staff up.  It seems since the downtown version has opened the quality of the food has dropped.  Almost as if the better chef's went downtown.  Disappointing"}
{"text":"If you are into Farm To Table eating, Dressler's is NOT for you. Ordinary food, ordinary service. And prices that should be delivering much better of both. \"Ribeye\" ordered was tough sirloin, at best. Key Lime Pie, no, no! If you have to go there, order the vegetables!   Go find yourself a place with some REAL food!"}
{"text":"Graciously greeted and given a lovely window table.  Our waitress introduced herself when I believe she spotted our Groupon Voucher, her demeanor became curt as she explained the process for our Groupon dinner which actually was better than we thought.  Our shared sausage appetizer was quit dry and overcooked and shrimp cocktail dry.  My chicken dish was lovely but my husband's rib eye overdone.  We will return for another try, however."}
{"text":"This was one of my first stops for restaurant week. Made reservations via opentable at 5 which is the time they opened. Got seated in a timely manner. For the first course I got spicy crunchy calamari, I got the wasabi sauce on the side. Next, I got the blackened heart of ribeye with roasted garlic mash potatoes. And to top it off, carrot cake. The waiter was friendly as well as the employees. The ambience was peaceful and overall great!"}
{"text":"Happy Birthday to me. I had a beautiful meal with a wonderful attentive host and staff. Everyone said Happy Birthday  from the mandatory valet  (sweeet) to my server Allison.A beautiful person. Yes I used a  Groupon I got a steal  2 APPETIZERS . The fried oysters were delicate and not like gristle. That sauce did not over power it. There was a complement something a great chef knows how to achieve. The hubby had the steak bites. He enjoyed lapping up the sauce over these tender grilled bits. 1 SALAD the wedgie. I couldn't help it I love blue cheese and I ate every single crumble with the yummy bacon bits. He had the sirloin I h ad the rack of lamb. Oh yea  the red mashed potatoes accompanied.  Beautifully cooked tender meat. If I was home I would have suck them bones . That's how good it was. The man tried to eat this huge steak and potates.  Took home plates. Then yes Dessert. Creme Brulee to share. Golden blazed crisp sugar top creamy goodness inside.  All together the bill would have been $145 but Groupon was $69 bucks. Woohoo . They made my Birthday dinner fantastic.  Thank you Dresslers. Huggles"}
{"text":"I'm here from the SF Bay Area visiting my folks and we went to Dresslers for a nice evening out.   Service and atmosphere was very nice...    chatted with the GM (I assume) about his trip to Big Sur, Yosemite and San Francisco... talked California wine..  etc etc...   and when our server found out I was visiting for the first time in 3.5 years she sent out a chocolate cheesecake for us all to share.   Very nice people.    For appetizers we tried the fried calamari (good, though I would like it crispier) and the goat cheese, roasted garlic and tomato chutney on flatbread.. which my folks LOVE.    It was good and I could see sitting in the bar and having that... a salad and a couple cocktails.  That'd be a perfect night for me.   My mom had the halibut and dad had the rib eye....  both were quite good and they were happy with everything.    I had the organic chicken breast with pickled onion, molasses gastrique and mac n cheese.    Sadly the chicken breast was a bit dry, and the mac n cheese needed salt.  I also would have liked some green on the plate somewhere.  It was surprising that there was not even a few vegetables.  So be sure to ask ahead of time and/or order a salad.    Wine list is good with some reasonable prices and of course.. some impressive bottles as well.     The aforementioned cheesecake was good but be sure to split it.  It's DENSE.  Even with three of us we couldn't hardly finish half.    Good date night, business dinner or small family special occasion place.  I'd go back."}
{"text":"Went here recently for the husband's Xmas party with a group of 14 folks. Even though everyone at the table had varied tastes and preferences, everyone seemed to enjoy the meal. And service was also quite good, which is never guaranteed when you roll up with a large crew.  I was eyeing the mussels for about a week before we arrived and was not disappointed in the delivery. Broth was quite tasty. We also got the gnocchi, which I would have much preferred with a lighter sauce (came with a creamy one with prosciutto), but they would not sub. Oh well, it was very good. The Thai peanut calamari was just OK for me, but others at the table enjoyed it.  I had the tuna over rice and absolutely loved it. First, it was a massive piece of fish, second, I don't think I have ever enjoyed a more delicious or perfectly cooked tuna dish. Amazing! However, even with how good mine was, I stole about half of my husband's plate. He went with one of the specials, a pecan-crusted piece of grouper over a lobster rice cake. Oh lord, it was delicious! And again the piece of fish was huge and beautiful.   Even though we were both stuffed, we decided to get creme brûlée and key lime pie for dessert. Both were very very good.   Definitely worth the drive from Winston-Salem! I hope Xmas parties here become an annual tradition!"}
{"text":"This is my second time eating at dresslers. First was for lunch and this time was for dinner. We had a reservation at 8 and showed up early (7:30) and they seated us early which was amazing!!! We were seated at a 4 top which was nice having room. Order the salmon and the mahi which my husband thought she said ahi which is what he wanted. So he was disappointment when mahi came out instead of ahi. The salmon was delicious. Both meals were extremely hot and couldn't eat it for a while. The guy who brought us our bottle of wine said he worked in the restaurant business for 30 years and spilled my wine while pouring it and didn't try to clean it up even though wine was dripping down the cup and stem. Felt a little rushed for late dinner and a little over priced. Would suggest lunch over dinner scene."}
{"text":"I call BULL$HIT on John G.'s comment towards my review. I never let anyone know if I have a Groupon, expired or not, until I get my bill. I have never threatened an establishment with a bad Yelp review.  As I stated his staff were very professional, EXCEPT for the manager who mishandled my situation. My 'threat' to Mr. Surly was charge whatever he thought was appropriate  and my wife and would NOT be back again. John G., if you still want to dispute this, please contact me through Yelp and we can discuss this further."}
{"text":"Came for Restaurant Week and like every other time it was phenomenal. Service is great and the food was wonderful. You have to try Mrs. Dressler's carrot cake. It's to die for. Thanks for another wonderful experience!"}
{"text":"We went here for date night a few months back and was very pleased. The food was excellent - and it was still warm enough at night to sit outside. it was a nice treat to sit outdoors, have a nice meal with my husband and a nice glass of wine!"}
{"text":"This place is off the chain! Fine dining at its best. We went for our anniversary and it was amazing. Our waitress bent over backwards to make our night very special. The food was amazing and the deserts were to die for. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"DELICIOUS!   The mac and cheese they have is the definition of southern comfort. Rich and creamy with the right amount of crunch. I am so glad that I listened to my craving and experienced that delight. Then I got down to why I actually chose Dressler's...Key Lime pie. It was definitely worth it. Silky, refreshing and boasted a perfect balance of flavors. The added congeniality of our waitress topped off a wonderful outdoor eating experience."}
{"text":"Excellent local find as we were passing through.  Great food, large menu.  worth the stop as you are heading north on 77."}
{"text":"My wife and I love going to Dressler's for date night.  The martinis are A+ and I order the heart of ribeye steak and my wife gets the salmon.  Excellent food quality and great atmosphere.  Get there at 5:30 and you can often snag a seat in the bar and no have to worry about reservations."}
{"text":"So this is supposed to be the \"real fancy\" place at Birkdale, which is a cute little shopping center for the cleaner, more Stepford Wives crowd from the surrounding areas. I think they intentionally keep parking limited so you cannot park your double-wide here like this is g-d NASCAR. Speaking of NASCAR, if you know what any of them look like (and, living in the South, you probably do) I guess a lot of the \"famous\" \"athlete\" drivers hang around here so if you could kindly point out the more attractive, wealthier ones to me if you see them, I'd appreciate it (I'm single AND broke, don't be jealous, ladies!).   I don't mean to BRAG about how much money I've spent on food in my lifetime (resulting in my previously-mentioned broke-assedness) but I've been to some fancy schmancy places and this place is potentially the least impressive of them all in that category. The fine dining atmosphere sort of reminds me of a gathering at an old folks' home at 5pm dinner time, even though it was like 8pm. I was with my friend James who is my age (yet somehow has managed to get married, have a house, a real job, and a dog so YES, Mom, I do know it's possible) but I still felt like we stood out for being a little too young for this place (even though I am almost THIRTY for chrissake if I round up to the nearest decade). Whatever, old people have money and can afford things like fancy dinners and brand new convertibles, for totally random example, so that is to be expected.   But the food wasn't even that great. I got the filet mignon because it came with the extra-fatty Bearnaise sauce (French for \"eat this if you are planning to bulk up so you can hibernate like a goddamned bear, Fatty\") (pun humor!). It was just like dipping an average steak into a vat of mayonnaise, which would be perfectly acceptable if you're eating at home over the sink like I normally do, but even I expect to treat myself with some kind of dignity at this kind of a place. Also the wine list is alright but DANG ask one question about it and expect to have to wait for your waiter to go to the back room, fart a couple of times, and then come back with absolutely no clear answer. Ladies, just go across the street to the Red Rocks. The food's pretty good and the NASCAR drivers hang out there, too."}
{"text":"The filet mignon was delicious!! Cooked just right and so tender. I got the G's salad ( mixed greens, toasted pecans, sauté onions and goat cheese) so good. The warm goat cheese appetizer was yummy. And I substituted mashed potatoes for risotto, also very good."}
{"text":"The food and service was out of this world! One of the best crabmeat dip we've ever had. I loved their shrimp & lobster linguini and hubby loved the ribeye in their grand marnier sauce. Their chocolate moose cake was the happy ending!  We loved everything and highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This is an upscale restaurant once you walk into the establishment. Feels like a steakhouse with the interior design.  The waitstaff very attentive and check on us regularly to make sure if the food was to your liking.   My favorite is the Short Ribs with Mash Potato just melts in your mouth. This is Southern Food at it's finest. It's like Osso Buco falling off the bone or a Brisket cooked to perfection. These are meals that I just want to savor the moment and just enjoy.  They make good Cappuccino's here too. Held off on the desserts for I want to fit into my Halloween Costume for next week.  Will be back again just for the Short Ribs and the Cappuccino."}
{"text":"This restaraunt is pretty good.  They have a great menu, food is very pricy for what you get and the service wss great...  only 4 stars when I compare them to other \"like\" fine dinning restaurants that charge at this price point.  I went here with others and would come back.."}
{"text":"I was very impressed! Great selection of wines by the glass!  I got the chicken pan seared - and it was amazing! The Mac and cheese was to die for!  I started with the house salad - I recommend this salad- wonderful goat cheese and pecans added so much flavor!!!  I would go back! Service was outstanding!!!!"}
{"text":"It's been a few months since I last visited here but the food and service has always been excellent. My favorite is their french onion soup. I came her twice for dinner and once for dessert/drinks. Both times I ordered seafood. First time it was the mahi and the second time I had lobster. Both were very good and highly recommended. I also had the Creme Brulee for dessert there which is also excellent. They have a nice little bar area you can just stop by for a drink or dessert if you just want to relax for a bit."}
{"text":"It's always hard to decide what to get on the menu and then you hear the specials and it makes it even harder. My family have been going to Dresslers at Birkdale since it opened more then 10 years ago. Great food, good people. Favorite appetizers are the Gnocchi and Calamari. Main course is always a tough decision but the short rub is phenomenal."}
{"text":"Not sure how this restaurant gets the high ratings. I find this to be a very nice place with white table cloth service, but so-so food for the price. Service is great. The decor and ambiance is great. But the entree food is not great. It is okay, but certainly not good for the price. We did enjoy our appetizer of smoked salmon. The halibut had too many conflicting flavor profiles, was over sauced and no matter, could not make up for a just mediocre piece of fish which was tough and gummy. My wife's duck was well done and dry - what a waste. This was our second time here, which was designed to verify or refute our mediocre first visit. Unfortunately the second visit verified our take from the first time around.  It's sad, we really were hoping to find better food. Will not likely ever dine here again any time in the near future."}
{"text":"We have not been here for several years.  It was excellent!  The service was great and all of the food was very good. We all had steak and they were perfect.  There are several higher end restaurants in the area we regularly go to and this was the best meal and service we have had recently anywhere."}
{"text":"Our experience at Dressler's was no different from from our previous visits. From the time you are met at the door until you leave everyone goes out of their way to make you are feel welcome. It was a beautiful evening and we were given a great table on the patio. The food was perfectly prepared.  A request to change a vegatable with one of the entrees was handled with\"no problem\".  We were using a groupon and our waiter let us know that we still had nine dollars left and would we like to take a desert home.  Prices are reasonable for the quality."}
{"text":"Amazing! This place is the real deal! Pricey...yes, but totally worth it! I got the shrimp and lobster linguine and it's hands down one of of the best meals I've ever had! There were plenty of shrimp and at least a whole lobster, full claws and tail. Reasonably priced for the quality you get. We also got the goat cheese and garlic appetizer, which I highly recommend! Plenty of beer and wine choices and true professional service. Also you get complimentary valet service which never hurts! I would definitely make a reservation they stay busy! I can't wait to try the rest of their menu!"}
{"text":"I've been dining at Dressler's for a little over two years now; it started with walking by and it looked very nice from the outside.  This is a very classy place and the staff is great. Since just walking in to dine, I've now held many company events here. Superb Wine List for those going out to impress. If it happens to be a nice night, sitting outside is great just because of Birkdale Village; but I would still sit inside just because its a lot nicer. The food is fantastic- I have not had a bad thing on the menu yet. A must is the Calamari Appetizer- I try this dish just about at every establishment that has it, I've been ranking Calamari for at least 10 years- Guess What- #1 Calamari here!"}
{"text":"I've visited this restaurant numerous times and can honestly say it's the best. The food and service is perfect and Mrs. Dressler's makes all the great desserts."}
{"text":"$25 for $50 GroupOn is almost always on!  We have eaten at Dresslers atleast a half dozen times.  My favorite dishes are the Shrimp and Grits and the Blackened Ribeye.  It is a hard choice......  Excellent food, great wine list and spectacular service makes this joint one of our favorite spots!"}
{"text":"We dined here yesterday for our 50th Anniversary. Our special day was topped off with an absolutely wonderful meal. The food was excellent and our server Darla was exceptional. We mentioned that this was a celebration and we were treated to complimentary champagne and good wishes from much of the staff. A great evening. Thank you Dressler's."}
{"text":"Hello Manager John,  I wrote an email review last February which you will see below. Including your reply.  We had a very nice dinner tonight and yes they overcooked my rack of lamb. I'm sure you remember me. Thank you for taking it off the bill. That wasn't necessary.  Well, I ordered an espresso again and of course was served without any spoon. Meghan brought the spoon - a Teaspoon!!! Good lord!  Here is our correspondence from February. Enough said.  \"Had a wonderful meal last night, as always. But you fumbled the ball in the 4th quarter with the ball on the one yard line! After an excellent meal, I ordered and espresso and you served it with a TEASPOON! C'mon Jon! You didn't serve my lamb rack with a serving spoon, and you didn't serve the soup with a ladle! Why serve my coffee with the wrong utensil then?!!! Seems like you just don't care or that coffee service is less important than dinner service? I know the excuse - the small spoons get lost or stolen, right? THAT\"S THE COST OF DOING BUSINESS CORRECTLY!! Just order more and keep them in good supply. What's so hard about that? You just don't serve espresso with a teaspoon that barely fits in the cup! If I'm going to spend $200 in your restaurant, I expect good service from beginning to end. That's all.\"    Me: \"Thanks John! We've been customers of Dresslers for 12 years now. Just had to say something, finally. Get it off my chest, so to speak! I look forward to my next espresso! What kind of potatoes do you use in your mashed potatoes? Excellent.\"  John G:  \"John, Great to hear that everything was excellent until the spoon incident.  Love the analogies.  We use the football analogy in our training and at our family meals frequently.  Honestly, cost has never been a consideration in not having demi spoons, we have simply never used them.  I shall order some demi spoons immediately.  Thank you for the feedback and hope to see you soon. John Glenn GM Dressler's Birkdale\"  \"Sears has customers, we have guests!  Little red potatoes.  Lots of cream and butter.  Thanks for all the support over the years.\"    I guess you just forgot about what you told me? The meal and company of my guests was great but Dresslers disappointed me in their follow through and promise. I guess we are customers and not guests after all. I'll be back and let's see what kind of spoons you have! I have my money on teaspoons."}
{"text":"Overall, dressler's was a fairly decent dining experience. It did have a few execution errors that should certainly be beneath the upscale venue (and price point). The wine list was excellent and overall my large table of 9 was well-accommodated -- great service.  The appetizers were very good, most notably the Pimento Cheese dip which stood out among the rest. We also got the meat and cheese board which was tasty, though could have used a couple more slices of each item. The selection was safe and unsurprising (gouda, salami, etc), I'd have liked something a little more off the beaten path to try beyond what I can get at any chain grocery store.  I also had a starter salad, the waldorf (I think they call it a G's) which was quite good and I'd highly recommend.  For an entree I selected the Brasstown Farms sirloin. Much to my dismay, although I ordered it Medium-Rare, it arrived overcooked and thus dried out. I'd argue it was Medium-Well, my wife thought it was closer to Medium. In either case, I expect this of the cook at Applebee's when I order a $12 steak. When I order a $29 steak, the most basic expectation is cooked to order. It was quite a chore to chew through.  For dessert, I ordered Mom's Carrot Cake. I hate to pick on Mom, but the cake was dense and bland. I'm not sure if it was overmixed or overbaked but I would have liked something far fluffier in a carrot cake. I was also disappointed by the lack of large pieces of walnuts or raisins that typically accompanies carrot cake.  Again, overall a good restaurant. When paying over $50/head, however, I have higher expectations that Dressler's, at times, failed to meet."}
{"text":"Went here for a date night on Friday.  Very crowded, not very romantic.  French Onion Soup was fantastic.  The mahi dish was a bit lack luster.  My husband enjoyed his house salad and and short ribs.  The key lime pie was fantastic, but I rather go to 131 main for the same price."}
{"text":"Impeccable service and amazing food!  We love Dresslers!  The atmosphere is great and although it is on the higher end food/price wise, the atmosphere is casual and comfortable and not at all stuffy.  We've tried almost every appetizer on the menu and the calamari is the best, but the crab dip and tuna (ask for extra wasabi cream) run a close second and third.  My fiance likes to get the ribeye or braised short ribs and loves both - I prefer the crab cakes which are delish and ask for extra pecan remoulade - you won't regret it.  And the dessert...oh the desserts - hand made by the mother of the owner and her daily cheesecake flavor is always a good choice.  Definitely a great place for dinner and both locations are great - Huntersville has a great Birkdale location and Metro has a wonderful view of the skyline."}
{"text":"Ok, so where do I really begin?  My husband and I love this restaurant.  We have been quite a few times.    We revisited tonight after about 6-7 months (maybe longer) and when I tell you we were treated like kings and queens .....We were!  The sommelier, John, was awesome (as in previous visits) , but he remembered us, as did our waiter Marshall!    I don't know about you, but my husband and I both were totally taken back by the fact that both individuals remembered us!  Dresslers is an incredible restaurant not only for the food but also for the personableness of the people working.    I had my always favorite, \"The Halibut\" and my husband had the linguine with shrimp and lobster.  Both dinners were  incredible!    I would highly suggest the calamari for appetizer, the halibut /linguini/or pork dish for your main course.   We had the calamari for appetizer.  It is our favorite The french onion soup is good too.   Overall , you can not go wrong  Great atmosphere and great people to be around.   If you have time, you can go walk around the village and do some shopping"}
{"text":"Superb service, and delicious food. Money and time equally well spent. We entered without a reservation, unaware of how heavily patronized the venue was. We were seated at a table for two without delay, given the utmost respect and rendered impeccable service. At the end of our meal, the Assistant GM gently advised to call ahead for future visits, so we are certain to always have a table waiting and welcoming our return service. I like and appreciated his style!!  I will definitely be returning. Kudos and bravo Dresslers!"}
{"text":"Dressler's is the best restaurant in the LKN and one of my favorites anywhere.    Calamari is an all time favorites.  Always tender and the 2 sauces make it unique and delicious.  Our new love  is the BBQ Shrimp.  That'll be a new staple for us.    The Wedgie is a can't miss.  Just for the Halibut is a masterpiece.  Everything I've had there is amazing.  Sometimes I stray another entree and I'm never disappointed.  Lastly, the staff just ties it all together with a perfect bow. They make it a better experience every time and should be complimented.  Thank you."}
{"text":"Went here for New Years Eve with Friends.  All I can say is WOW.  Great experience and great food.   All together we had the Crab Cakes, Filet and Chicken.   Everything was done very well.  I had the crab cakes and it was all crab meat.  I added in the green beans and they had great flavor.   Service was top notch.  They know how to provide the right amount of attention."}
{"text":"Great steaks, great drinks and great service. This was my first time and was impressed. I got there late, so I just sat at the bar so they could clean the tables up. And go home on time. Kevin, the bartender was sociable and polite. I am looking forward to going there again, and try some other steaks on the menu. I had the heart of ribeye, roasted potatoes and asparagus. And washed it down with a nice glass of scotch.  Life is good."}
{"text":"What a wonderful restaurant.  In town on business and looking for a nice restaurant on Yelp and found this place.  When we arrived the restaurant was full but there was outside seating so we decide to give it a try. The waiter was great helping us with the menu and explaining the specials and suggesting a wine. The owner brought us our wine and thanked us for coming, over all a very nice experience and great food."}
{"text":"Excellent. Great service. Delicious scallops. My entire party of 6 enjoyed their meal, the service and the atmosphere. We will go back!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant on the heart of Birkdale Village. If you are thinking about blowing off $100-$150 at Morton's or Ruth's Chris think again... come to Dressler and you will have the same experience, same quality and maybe even better service for much less! There is free valet parking and the food is absolutely fantastic. I had the heart of Ribeye and it was as tender as the filet mignon but with MUCH more flavor. It is not a kid-friendly restaurant but they do have a kids menu with no fried foods!"}
{"text":"Dined here last week for the first time although I've been to the other Dressler's several times. I hadn't planned to eat here but it was a very sunny day out and the sushi restaurant down the street had a thirty to forty minute wait. We were greeted by the manager who was at the front when we walked in and he assured us we could be immediately seated....Yes! The ambiance was great and the setting was more intimate than the location on Trade Street. My friend had the crab topped grouper with risotto special and I had crab cakes and a salad and we shared spinach. My friend had creme brûlée for dessert and we were thoroughly happy with our meals. The waitress and manager came by to check on us frequently. I think this location has won us over...no need to go all the way to Trade St when we can go over the lake. We were happy girls on a busy evening at Birkdale!!!"}
{"text":"Good wine list, with a good selection of appetizers and entrees. I had the salmon dish which was cooked to perfection. They take opentable reservations, which is a wonderful thing for me being a VIP. Wasn't too keen on the desserts but appetizer and entrée was good. Great outdoor seating."}
{"text":"We had a great dining experience at Dressler's Restaurant in Birkdale Village in Huntersville.It was my wife's Birthday celebration dinner.The staff was very friendly and knowledgeable.Everything that we ordered came out perfect.My wife got a Birthday desert on the house.We loved the atmosphere and ambiance.All in all we give Dressler's five star rating and will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"As first time guests we weren't  sure what to expect. However, we had a great dining experience with our server Marshall! He walked us through the menu and made suggestions based on our opening conversation. For starters we had the low country crab dip and grilled sausages, both were tasty and plentiful. We followed up with the tossed salad with the champagne vinaigrette, it was ok, just needed a bit more dressing! For our entrees, he had the blackened ribeye and fingerling potatoes, the ribeye was cooked just right and full of flavor, potatoes were well seasoned and good too. For my entree, was the rack of lamb, the lamb was cooked to perfection and tender, the demi glacé was perfect with the mashed potatoes. By the time we got to dessert we were both full so we got the apple crisp to go. This is a definite go to spot for quality food and a quality experience!!"}
{"text":"There has never been a time where I am disappointed with any meal at Dressler's. Service is always above and beyond, there is honestly no way anyone could ever complain. Unless they were having a bad day and wanted to take it out on someone else.   This spot is perfect for date night, girlfriend meet-ups and just drink away from the kids."}
{"text":"The food is wonderful, and the service is top notch, but the prices....kind of steep. My husband and I had dinner there with another couple. NO DRINKS, just one shared appetizer and dinner for four. The bill with tip: $225.  Worth that? No."}
{"text":"My wife and I we're traveling thru the area and the person at the hotel desk recommended the resturant . We were VERY pleased with what we found. The people who work there are GREAT. The food was unbelievable and the price was right. Our next time thru we will go out of our way to eat there."}
{"text":"Coming from MD, I never expected to find good crab cakes here in NC!  Well!  I have found some!! Dresslers has  delicious crab cakes on their menu that totally live up to my Maryland standards!  I've been there a few times now, and Dresslers never lets down! My favorites are the crab cakes and the thai calamari!! YUMMM :)"}
{"text":"This is our go-to place for date night, celebration, or just to grab a great steak. The service is always amazing and so accommodating - it makes you feel at home. I love the filet with blue cheese butter, and you can't go wrong with the brussel sprouts! But the best part of all the Mom's cheesecake. It is such a treat! I love it so much, I request it every year for my birthday cake. The peanut butter chocolate chip cheesecake has my heart, but the chocolate cheesecake is a close second. Highly recommend this place to all!"}
{"text":"Dressler's is dependable good, fresh, thoughtfully prepared food.   My family relocated to NC about 8 or 9 years ago and my major complaint when I go visit is the lack of privately owned (instead of commercial places like Applebees) restaurants with fresh, good food. Or simply, anywhere that actually has a real chef!!   Compared to my other dining experiences in the area, Dressler's is as good as it gets. In NC, I give it a 5. My 'normal' rating for it would be a 4 as I'd love to see a little more imagination with their menu. However,  I understand that they need to keep the masses happy. Since the only other restaurant I really enjoyed out their (a french bistro) closed - I'll assume that imaginative menu's don't go over very well here. I'll take a boring menu to keep Dressler's open!   Very good food, very nice atmosphere and the owner does a great job of remembering his clients and working the room. He even remembered to come out to wish my sister a happy birthday.   Great job Dressler's. I hope to see you maintain your success, my family and I will return often!   *Note: while every in NC is casual, I marked this place as dressy because you can walk in wearing a nice dress and heals and not feel entirely out of place as you would in a lot of places here."}
{"text":"Dressler's is the BEST restaurant in Huntersville and the Lake Norman area.  I've been several times - but it's a bit pricey so I can't go as often as I'd like.  LOVE the half-price appetizers (served before 7 p.m. I think...) which I've done several times with friends.   I've had the steak and rack of lamb before - both excellent.  Had shrimp coctkail app and salad wedge.  Desserts are worth saving room for."}
{"text":"Terrible, this is my \"well done\" medium rare ribeye I just ordered for takeout....$40 in the garbage"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places for a date night and a good steak. The atmosphere, service and food are great. When it's nice outside, the patio seating is very nice. I would give 5 stars, if they added a draft beer selection. The 9 oz filet with blue cheese crumb crust is amazing!"}
{"text":"Was in last night for dinner with my boyfriend. Greeted by a not so friendly host. Waited on by a server lacking any personality, and had food lacking much flavor. It's soooo over priced, for mediocre food. My bfs ribeye was teeny tiny for over $30. My short ribs were okay... pretty much over priced pot roast. The wine sauce was pretty bland. His ribeye was okay, but nothing to write home about.  Read some reviews about the calamari being good. It was coated in a strong ginger sauce, like, coated in an overpowering way. I am in shock this place has so many good reviews. It's stuffy and for an older crowd. I'm 27 and felt way too young to be there honestly. Go elsewhere. You can get a better meal at Chipotle... seriously."}
{"text":"Horrible management and mediocre food. Management was so rude to us because we had our Groupon that we wanted to use. (There were no terms or conditions to the Groupon that we were not following) After much hassle, the manager reluctantly allowed us to use it...Um thanks?? I give this place one star because I have to and because even though the food was blah and the manager was a jerk, the server that we had was exceptional especially given the circumstances. I feel sorry for her having to work at that place."}
{"text":"Went on a spouse-date after kids went on a one month trip! We visited the Huntersville location. Mike was our server outside and was so attentive and phenomenal. He made suggestions and was easy to talk to. I had the NY Strip and she had the Pork Chop. Both were cooked exactly to specifications. We initially had appetizers - meat/chews plate and steak medallions w/ a Grand Marnier sauce! Both were great and left us full even before the meal. For dessert we simply for a key lime pie but had to get it to go as we were too full to eat on site.   I have been here before (but not in some time) and would highly recommend as a casual, upscale restaurant. You can't be super quality and taste of food! I will be back again - this time much sooner!"}
{"text":"John Dressler and his staff truly define service.  The staff is friendly, attentive and professional.  The food is always excellent and well presented.  The menu includes excellent appetizers--the goat cheese and roasted garlic are my personal favorite, but try them all!  There is an entree for every taste and \"mom's cheesecake\" is the signature dessert.  When you stop in the bar, Kevin will treat you like family.  It is one of my favorite restaurants and I can always be sure of a great meal, great ambiance and a lovely place for a drink and/or dinner."}
{"text":"Food and service are always wonderful.  An easy choice.  Reservations Thurs-Sat recommended."}
{"text":"Everything on the menu is excellent. I love the crab cakes, halibut and the short ribs. The apps are also excellent. The calamari, fried oysters, PEI Mussels all delicious excellent wine list and save room for dessert!"}
{"text":"I give it one star because the servers are good. Been twice now and thankfully neither time on my dime. First turn off was the BORING breadbasket. No excuse for the sorry bland skimpy piece of bread - which they slice into very thin slices - and has no taste at all. A saltine has more taste. Secondly, I ordered the halibut and it was so oversauced I had to ask them to switch it to a plate with no sauce. My date had the pork chop and it too was swimming in sauce. Creme brulee was as dull as the bread.  Ate there again to use up a groupon. Hey, whadda know - same boring bread basket!  Date had seared tuna app which he strongly disliked because of the 5 spice they use on it. He also ordered the duck and said it was mediocre. I had the filet mignon which was MR when I ordered it MW and too salty fingerlings. Place was packed and people were dropping tons of money and for the life of me I can't see why.   I will say I heard the calamari app is good but that won't make me go back - and I will pass on their next groupon offering."}
{"text":"Dressler's is one of our favorite places to eat in Birkdale Village.  Despite the higher-than-average prices, we are regulars here probably more than any other local restaurant.  The service is always great, and their outdoor dining area is the best in Birkdale.  In the colder months, we usually eat in the bar, where Kevin and Jack provide stellar service in a more relaxed atmosphere.  My husband and I have tried many things here, and most do not disappoint.  The french onion soup is the best we have ever had.  The halibut, salmon with (rotating) risotto, and heart of ribeye are our favorite entrees.  Sometimes, we'll be in the mood for a lighter meal and get just a few appetizers for dinner, like the salmon carpaccio, beef tenderloin, soup, and salad.  Most of their desserts are Jon's mother's recipes.  The cheesecake is especially divine.    Everyone who works here remembers you, and treats you like family -- we really love the hospitality here!  Being in Birkdale, parking is plentiful, but Dressler's also offers valet parking for those who don't want to find a spot on their own.    Our only wish is that they would start offering Sunday brunch.  Ah, well, I'll just keep asking!"}
{"text":"I took my girlfriend here because it seemed nice and it was close to where she lived. The establishment was small so there's not much privacy. For the amount of money you pay it would be nice for something a little more intimate. The food is good but a little overpriced. I don't think I would go to this place again mainly because of it being overcrowded and too expensive."}
{"text":"Great Spot for a date night or celebration.  We came here for my fiancé birthday and it was great!   We had the halibut and filet....they were both awesome.  The appetizers are great but small, we had to order 2 apps.  The crab cakes are delicious!  Overall I would come back here, but only for a special occasion."}
{"text":"The best restaurant in the Charlotte area in my opinion.  Well run from top to bottom.  Excellent service.  You won't find more delicious food anywhere.  You will need a reservation for a weekend dinner, but you'll be glad you made one."}
{"text":"Dressler's is a great place to go to for a semi-fancy dinner.  This is especially true if you are on a date or if you want to people watch from Dressler's large patio while you enjoy your meal on a nice day.  On this visit to Dressler's, I did both.  Atmosphere - Older/ sophisticated crowd (i.e. you probably wouldn't order a Coors Light with your meal), fancy/ affluent feeling (i.e. people seem like they are here to spend money and are not too concerned about price...they just want to have a good experience).  Service - Prompt, attentive, informative, friendly...professional  Food - On this visit, I had one of their specials for the night, which was a thick cut bone-in pork chop.  My date had the Blackened Heart of Ribeye.  I mention her choice as I sampled it and it made me rather regret my order.   The Blackened Heart of Ribeye she ordered was tender, as you would expect with a ribeye.  However, it had great flavor without a lot of the fat I normally associate with a ribeye.  I was impressed.  My bone-in pork chop was just okay.  I was a little turned off by how under cooked it appeared to be in the center and its slight rubbery texture.   My sides were Fingerling Potatoes and Blackened Green Beans, which were both good and enjoyable sides.    FYI - While we didn't get dessert, if you throw in a couple of drinks and tip...your total bill starts to really get up there in price.  Overall - This place has a nice atmosphere that will impress those with you and food that will not make you feel like it was a mistake coming.  Well, as long as you get the ribeye..."}
{"text":"Wow!  We were visiting the Charlotte area for work and found this place on Yelp.  It is nothing short of AMAZING!  ( this is coming from a couple of foodie's that live in Southern California) .  The Wedge salad is among the best we've had, and the Macaroni and cheese is probably the best I've ever had.  Great find!  We've been in town for work, and it's the best!!!"}
{"text":"Dressler's is a wonderful-family-owned staple. It's high quality food, great service, fresh ingredients, unique specials, and they really offer something for everyone. They are located in Birkdale, right at the roundabout. Great for people watching, even if you just want a drink.  I have a few favorites here:  Their mac & cheese (sounds weird for a nice restaurant) is AMAZING. It has such heft and melts in your mouth with its creaminess, a subtle crunch from the breadcrumbs on top, and enough cheese to satisfy the biggest cheese lover without being stringy or overwhelming. Seriously, it's great! If you don't get a dish that comes with it, like the roasted chicken, then get it as a side. I usually get this roasted chicken dish which has delicious roasted chicken with crispy skin, these delicious (an incredibly uniquely marinated) onions, usually over a molasses gastrique (which I omit - I'm not a fan personally).   I also think they have a good filet - get it oscar style. Pairs well with a bold red wine.  The majority of my other favorites are on their appetizer menu. Something fun to try for a date-night, just do what we call a \"tour of appetizers.\" We will just drink and get several of the apps to share. Plus, in the bar before 7PM they have 1/2 price apps.  My favorite of the apps is the Goat Cheese served hot in fresh olive oil, with marinated onions and tomatoes on the side (they have this uniquely mouthwatering sweetness to them) and chunks of fresh garlic. I usually have to ask for extra pita or bread, but it's just so delicious. All of the flavors work in excellent harmony!  I also love their calamari. It's not like everywhere else where you get those rings and weird squid looking things that come out oily with marina. In fact, theirs are strips (hearty & meaty), plus they don't creep me out the way the 'baby squids' do! They toss it in what I'd describe as a sweet-thai-like-glaze and also pour some wasabi aoili on top. I get it with the aioli on the side, it's perfect to dip just a tiny bit in and keeps it off the pieces my husband wants to eat.  They also offer a meaty cheese & crab dip. Very hearty, and very creamy - make sure you share or you'll feel yucky after eating it all! It is good.  Most of their deserts are made by the owner's mother - which is a concept I love. Over the last several years, I've probably dined here around 30+ times and have tried several. They are all good, but I cannot say their great. However, if you're in the mood for a homemade pie - try her apple desert! (I wish they'd serve the chocolate cake from Queen City... Hint hint!) :)  The owner, John Dressler, and his managers have stepped up on several occasions. I had one complaint once and it was promptly addressed with a more than sufficient apology and offer to comp the meal. I am impressed by their professionalism and how they can do both: serve great food, and treat customers as valued guests.  Sure, it's not the cheapest place in town... but you really can eat their reasonably if you don't get the filet, and if you do want to splurge, you're not disappointed. Oh, they also offer free (with tip) valet which can come in very handy on busy nights! I recommend reservations for dinner when possible.   Lastly, the dress code... I checked \"casual\" but it's more in between casual and dressy. It is not formal, and in fact, we've dined in there with baseball caps... though we usually try to go what I'd call \"business casual\" for dinner. The point is, it's not hot-dog-cart casual, but it's also not Ruth's Chris formal. I don't believe you would be treated any differently because of your attire. So dress comfortably and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Came here during Queens Feast with my wife and daughter.  The service was excellent.  I had the wedge salad, which was pretty good.  Lots of bleu cheese. For the entree I had the blackened filet which was really tender and tasty.  Over all, it was quite good."}
{"text":"Surprised there's no other reviews since I gather this is a fairly popular place, albeit in a sleepy suburb of Charlotte.  In any case, this is a very nice place that feels like a high-end restaurant in terms of atmosphere and service but is priced at the upper end of moderate. The food is fine - while nothing blew us away, the menu is compelling and everything we tried was quote good. The ingredients, composition and presentation all show obvious care.  The wine list is chock full of nice choices - a very solid selection from the high end of Napa including a few hard to find choices, priced at 2x (not sure whether this is good or bad by Charlotte standards).   A very solid choice that's suitable for a business dinner or special occasion but priced moderately enough to go anytime."}
{"text":"Tried it with a Groupon. We had thus far really enjoyed the restaurant and will go back.  Everything we have had has been very tasty and the staff is helpful. I dont know when you come in why they ask if they have our last name. They have asked us twice and when we tell them it, they type away and always say no. Odd, but other than that we have enjoyed both visits"}
{"text":"Good food with a nice atmosphere. We arrived 20 min early and they seated us right away. My Mahi was over cooked but with good flavor. My wife's linguine and scallops was amazing and cooked to perfection. It was a little more cramped then I expected and quite loud. Other than that it was very good. The waiter was very professional and a great help with food suggestions all in all I will go back!!"}
{"text":"We love the consistently great food and wonderful service! We have multiple favorites on the menu!!!"}
{"text":"Much better the second time around - not during restaurant week - food was excellent (the wedgie and the flat iron steak) and the service was excellent."}
{"text":"We have been to Dressler's a few times.  Good food, nice restaurant.  We arrived tonight without a reservation at 7 p.m. and were told a table for two would be an hour and 15 minutes.  They took our mobile number and told us they'd call when our table was ready.  They never called and so we went back an hour and 15 minutes later and were told it would be another 45 minutes.  As I was talking to the hostess, my wife meanwhile observed the manager discreetly tell another couple who walked in ahead of us (that he seemingly knew), \"I found you a table, come on back with me.\"  BS and screw Dressler's!  We won't be going back.  They screwed up our plans for the entire night because they were letting their friends in ahead of people like us who had our name on the waiting list."}
{"text":"We had purchased a Groupon for Dressler's quite some time ago, and decided to finally use it tonight. I made a reservation off of Yelp (via opentable) and we arrived a few minutes early. We were greeted right away, and after a few minutes we were escorted to our table outside on the patio. I didn't get too much of a look at the interior dining area, but the outside was nice. They have a decent number of tables, and ours was kinda tucked away on its own in the corner, so we had total privacy (aside from pedestrians who would stop directly behind us in order to read the menu posted on the wall.) The patio was pretty clean, which is something I usually look for when evaluating an outdoor eating area. All in all, it was a very nice environment for a nice romantic dinner.  Our server came out within a few minutes and was pretty knowledgeable and friendly. He took our drink order right away and returned fairly soon with wine in hand. I went with my usual Riesling ($6) and the miss' stuck with her usual Chardonnay ($6.50).  We ordered the Thai Calamari ($11) for a shared appetizer and that was also brought out pretty quickly. The calamari itself was extremely tasty and tender, but I wasn't a huge fan of the sauce. Rather than offering a dipping sauce, the calamari strips are doused in a peanut/ wasabi sauce prior to being served. While the sauce itself was tasty, it was too much to be a coating, and it turned what should have been crispy, light calamari into a heavy, gooey mess. Great taste, but the sauce should definitely be served on the side.  Our server came back around just as we finished our appetizer and took our entree order. A server's assistant eventually swung by and dropped off some fresh bread with butter and hummus as the spread choices. I've never seen hummus offered as a bread accompaniment but I liked it. It wasn't a \"heavy\" hummus in that the flavor profile was strong...it was very light and was definitely a good substitute for butter. After awhile a runner brought over our entrees, and they looked delicious.  I went with the Braised Beef Short Ribs ($19) that were served with a port reduction and mashed potatoes. The short rib itself was flakey and fell right apart, but it was a tad bit too dry for me. Luckily there was some tasty gravy on hand to help it out a bit! The mashed potatoes were definitely up there. These aren't your pansy \"smooth and buttery\" mashed...these bad boys came out lumpy and chock full of great potato flavor. Taking that short rib, dredging it through the gravy, and then adding on a dollop of mashed potato made for a pretty great bite of food.  The miss' went with the Roasted Salmon with a risotto. I was shocked at how good the salmon was, and it was definitely up there with some of the best fish I've had out. What really set it apart was that they seared the top to give it a crunchy, crisp crust that was great. So when you took a bite of tender fish, you also had this crispy element added and it was pretty darn amazing. The risotto was also pretty good, but nothing too out of this world.  And for once in our lives, we stuck around for dessert...I pretty much forced it on us after reading so many rave reviews of the sweets! We reached an agreement and split the Chocolate Volcano Cake ($7). Now it's not what you expect in that there is no molten chocolate center, but the molten goodness is indeed present on top of and in a pool around the cake. The chocolate cake itself was very good, and not in the least bit dry. The molten chocolate was pretty amazing, and the scoop of vanilla ice cream made things even better. Another thing to note is that it was a decent sized dessert...I would never dream of tackling this thing on my own!  In the end, the outdoor dining experience was what really made the night. The food ranged from good to excellent, but there were some aspects that were more \"meh\" than \"mmmm\". But I have to say, the miss' and I enjoyed a slow, leisurely meal while sipping wine and people-watching at Birkdale. We won't be in any rush to go back, but next time we are at Birkdale and want to spoil ourselves with a pricey, fancy meal, we will return."}
{"text":"Dressler's has now completed my quest to try all the foods in Birkdale! And I have to say, I'm very surprised! Whenever we passed by Dressler's, it never really sparked my interest. But we went since we had some family in town, and we wanted to go to a nice place.  The service was great - Allison was absolutely amazing. She talked with us for almost 10 minutes towards the end of our visit and she is just so sweet!   The food was delicious. I have to agree with a lot of Yelpers here, it is quite pricey. But the quality is there. We all tried something different; specials, salads, pasta, dessert, drinks. We really went crazy and it was awesome. If you're feeling spendy and/or fancy, come to Dressler's at Birkdale, and ask for Allison."}
{"text":"Dresslers at Birkdale is one of my favorite places to eat in the area. The food is spectacular and well prepared. The location itself is warm and very clean. The personal touch the staff adds to their service cannot be compared to. All of the food is not just good, the side items as well as whatever your main course is dresed with really completes every dish. If I am going out for a nice dinner and I am not in the mood to try a new venue I always come to Dresslers as I know it will satisfy in every way possible."}
{"text":"This was our first experience at Dressler's. We made a reservation and were seated immediately. Everything was first class from minute one. Victor was great and we have never had a more attentive waiter of all the restaurants we have been. The food was great, the lobster the best I have ever had. Melts in your mouth. I recommend the wedge salad, very tasty and only $6. My husband had the pork chop, and wow, cooked to perfection and huge. Also, the chocolate cake, to die for. This is a topnotch restaurant and well worth every penny. We will be back time and time again."}
{"text":"One of the most sepurb wine lists around.  John also does a fantastic wine pairing that is wonderful. The food and atmosphere is always great and the steak or fish is my sure thing!  As far as appys go; calamari, crab dip, or the goat cheese are amazing.    Did you know momma Dressler makes all of the Sweet Treats herself?  To. Die. For!"}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with Dresslers! Hit dinner for my sons 20th Birthday. We enjoyed the pimento cheese appetizer along with shrimp cocktail. He had the rib eye, which looked cooked to perfection. My filet was also very good with tasty mashed tatters. Washed it down with a nice Cab. Others at our table had the chicken and shrimp pasta.  He was given a dessert of his choice for his birthday! Molten chocolate cake looked great served hot with ice cream. My wife ordered coffee and had to wait a few minutes for it and our waitress gave us a piece of cheesecake for free! Great dinner!"}
{"text":"So nice for a special occasion. Dressler's has old school service standards - very formal and attentive with well-trained servers.  Food is stunning. Beautiful presentation with nice sides and great attention to detail. Salmon and tuna are my top recommendations but the specials usually sound great too..."}
{"text":"Since I reference Dressler's in another review, figured I should at least review them too! Been there on a number of occasions and we have always been pleased with both the food and the service. One dish I particularly enjoy is the center cut rib eye. I love the flavor of a rib eye but am not a big fan of fatty meats so I always feel I leave as much on the plate as I eat whenever I order one. The center cut version at Dressler's is the heart of the steak only and it has always been thick, juicy, well-charred and perfectly medium-rare as ordered.   The salads and accompanying sides are always high quality as well. I'm not a dessert person so, while I understand from my wife and others that they are first-rate, especially the carrot cake, I can't speak from first hand experience."}
