{"text":"The bowl I ordered was amazingly fresh and never disappoints! The staff is quick to attend to you and is super friendly. This is a great option if you're ever at the fashion show mall."}
{"text":"Yummm a good place for poke! Would like to go here again when I'm in Vegas!!! Would deff come back again! Get the salmon! Yes"}
{"text":"I really wish I could give this six stars! Maybe the most delicious poke I have ever put in my mouth! Loved in Hawaii for years and I missed my poke so so much! Thank God I got my fix!"}
{"text":"A small hidden gem in the mall. Fish pieces were really fresh and the portion size is good for the price. Super friendly staff too!"}
{"text":"This location is worth the trip even if you have to walk from a hotel off the strip.  The prices, quality of food and service were perfect.  They were patient if you had a question about the menu items."}
{"text":"Quality Poke! I have been to numerous poke restaurants all across this globe. I have never, I repeat never, have had poke this good before. I would like to thank the parents of the owner of this establishment for making the owner, because I have never been so happy in my entire life, OH LORD MAKE ME HUNGRY AGAIN SO I CAN EAT MORE POKI"}
{"text":"If you like Sushi give Poke a try. Worth a trip to the Fashion Mall for fresh fish Poke bowl. It's basically build your own - choose white or brown rice, fish (salmon, tuna, spicy tuna, albacore,etc), sauce and large choice of toppings. Everything was very fresh and tasty. Nice and helpful staff. Order at the counter with seating. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"The food was very good, decent size and price for a poke bowl. Fish was fresh and many topping choices! Love it"}
{"text":"When you want to find something good, light, and nothing fried this is the spot. Our hotel is nearby, and we have stopped by multiple times to get a quick bite.  I got the tuna house gogo, reminded me of tuna poke I got in Hawaii."}
{"text":"I ordered the Hawaiian bowl and thought it was good.  Not a fancy place but neither was the price.  I might be back this week! The one annoyance was when they swept under the table as I was eating.  That's just rude."}
{"text":"Visiting from Hawaii and passed by this poke place. Very awesome customer service! Eat here!!!!,  So ono!! (delicious)"}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients good service  It took a bit if effort to order but worth it Portions are a bit small so it might be a good idea order large option rather than the standard one. It is in the middle of Fashion Mall away from the food court and crowds.  Price was reasonable also."}
{"text":"Wish there was a Poke shop like this everywhere I went. Super unique and flavorful. Loved the concept of the bowl and how I could choose all my toppings. I don't love raw fish so I love that they had a shrimp option. The sauces were great and so was the service. Would recommend this for lunch!"}
{"text":"A colleague and I went for lunch and were very happy that the Poke was fresh, there were many options for add ins, the [lace was spotless and the staff, so friendly and knowledgeable about their product.  A great experience and for sure will go again."}
{"text":"Terrible! This isn't even close to what pok√© Is, but most people don't know the difference..... for the amount they charge the bowl should be way bigger"}
{"text":"The fact that I'm from the Bay & you can literally find a poke store every corner, this place to me is just like any other poke store. It didn't really stand out much but I was really craving poke and it was near my hotel, i wanted to check it out.  Two scoops for a regular which is pretty cut throat from what I'm used to in the bay. Here, it's 3 scoops for a regular (same price.) The concept here is just like any other poke place. They do have a lot of options as for toppings so that's the plus. I got all shrimp with a mix of house and spicy mayo sauce. They only mixed the shrimp in the sauce and nothing else. Everything else is just placed around the bowl. It didn't taste bad and but it didn't wowed me. The bowl was a little too salty which kinda killed it but the shrimp was fresh and the crab meat was delicious.   This place is just one of those place where yeah I'll come back if I'm in the area but def not the place where I'll go crazy for."}
{"text":"Hidden at the bottom floor near escalators lies Gogo Poke. I was so glad I saw it while shopping. Once I saw my cousin off to work, I got hungry and made my way back. They have a fresh menu of items to choose from. I ate it heartily. The two workers were very nice as well."}
{"text":"Salmon was fresh from Canada shipped everyday (according to the worker I asked) and they give a great value in their servings."}
{"text":"Great concept,  I'm really glad there is a healthy option for eating at Fashion Show other than Subway.  The fish is fresh everything is really easy to understand.  You pick your rice,  yuppie protein,  your extras,  and your sauce all while they build it for you Chipotle style  (so if you want extra of the crispy onions you can ask as they make your bowl).  My favorites of the fish are the regular tuna and salmon.  I've tried the spicy tuna and it wasn't as good as the regular sashimi style.    Hidden gem in between the escalators at fashion show mall next to urban outfitters."}
{"text":"Coming from Hawaii, I was really happy with the quality of the fish. Granted, it's not as fresh as HAWAII fish.... but it's one of the best I've tasted so far here. They have a lot of variety... I personally like to order the cubed tuna and put spicy mayo on it rather than getting the mushy spicy tuna pre-packed. It tastes fresher!"}
{"text":"The prices were a little on the high side, and the build your own poke is nice but the portions are small and the flavors are a little muddy. Plus it's kind of hidden. I would say avoid this if you have had decent poke in the past because it's really just not that good."}
{"text":"Great service, quick, clean space, ingredients tastes fresh and it looks fresh. I wished they had more sides and protein to choose."}
{"text":"First time having poke. It's inside Fashion Show Mall next to Urban Outfitters (between the escalators). Super friendly guys working and I had the Hawaiian bowl and my husband got the House bowl. Delicious!!! We wanted something healthy and this hit the spot. The combo of flavors and the right portion size. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Wonderful experience here while shopping at the mall. Their fish were fresh and had a bunch of great ingredients like cilantro, mangos, crab mix, masago and great sauces especially their gogo sauce. I would definitely try this place out if you're wanting something fast, healthy, and delicious!"}
{"text":"The dish was well prepared. Fish topping was fresh and no fishy smell. House gogo dressing was quite popular taste, just try if you have no idea. Those of you who are Korean, you could ask volcano sauce and sesame oil (it tastes like cho-go-chu-jang and cham gi reum) You should think carefully when you choose side toppings. If you just say everything, you would get too big pile of poke bowl, so it would be hard to eat."}
{"text":"It's 830pm and they are closed. We walked from planet Hollywood all the way to fashion show mall for some poke just to find them closed. There hours show that they should be closed at 9pm. Very disappointed and hangry."}
{"text":"I'm a Vegas local but happened to be staying at Encore for Memorial Day weekend. Was looking for some clean eats close by and decided to find some Poke.   Luckily, noticed Gogo on Yelp and saw it was conveniently located right across the street at Fashion Show mall. Went up to the 3rd floor thinking it would be in the food court but it is actually on the first floor at K1850 near Macy's Men.   First thing I noticed was the very friendly staff that greeted me. I will say that their fish didn't look as fresh as I typically would like to see and it didn't really feel chilled like I prefer it. Overall it was good, not great.   I did find the vegetables to be more fresh looking and tasting. They had good sauces as well.   Another thing is that I think it's a little more pricey than most Poke places. I got the large (3 scoops) plus 1 extra scoop ($1.99) and my total was around $16.50.   I would definitely go back and probably will tomorrow because I know I can get a tasty meal that is macronutrient friendly for me.   However, as far as Poke spots go, this one is about middle of the road for me."}
{"text":"Had large bowl for 12.99 with albacore, tuna (ahi) and octopus overwhite rice with bunch of fix ins (seaweed salad, furikake, fried onion, etc) with ponzilla sauce.  I have to say it's really good! Everything was quite fresh. The albacore was seared and smoky/meaty, ahi was soft and octopus was quite tender. The sushi rice (japonica) was perfect. The other fix ins were all tasty as well. The whole meal was quite light and fresh so my stomach felt good after finishing it!  I came with my family so got to try bunch of stuff. My recommendations would be: tuna, albacore, salmon, octopus, spicy tuna, spicy mayo sauce, brown/white rice, seaweed salad, crab meat, all the toppings.  Def worth it!"}
{"text":"So since I work inside the mall, I always bring my lunch--except this day. I wanted something semi healthy and not over $10 for lunch. With my mall discount it's just under $10, so it's a decent deal. (Pro tip: they don't ask for any type of proof you are a mall employee, but if you lie, God will know.)  I got the Gogo bowl, which comes with a choice of brown or white rice, salad, a mix of tuna and salmon cubes, wakame (seaweed salad), krab, corn, cucumber, and a few other veggies. The ginger sauce was nice and bright, and tossed with the salad greens and the fish. The tuna was bland though, and tasted very frozen/watery. The salmon was better; richer and better texture. I wish the rice was mixed with sushi vinegar but instead was served hot, with cold ingredients on top. I didn't care for that.  The portion size looked good at first. They aren't stingy with the amounts of fish/krab/seaweed, but still didn't keep this little Asian girl full for much longer than an hour. A plus though was if you order it to go, you get a lid on your reusable plastic bowl. A bowl I can use to pack my own lunch next time."}
{"text":"Soooo yummy.. gotta go try it out at at fashion show mall.. fresh and fast.. the staff was really helped in making my choices"}
{"text":"The salmon was fresh and delicious, very reasonable price for the portion and quality."}
{"text":"Best poke in town! Grab a quick and delicious bite while shopping!!!! Best service and location!"}
{"text":"Awesome fresh fish. Love that it was unlimited toppings. My only regret is I didn't ask to get the salad dressed."}
{"text":"I'm updating my score based on the prompt response from the management. I appreciate that they didn't dismiss the issues in my experience and took steps to address them. The food is definitely not to blame; it's a great place to get fresh poke. I look forward to stopping by again in my next visit to LV!"}
{"text":"If you had too much heavy food in Vegas, Gogo poke is a good option, sort of like a detox.  Gogo poke is hidden in a quiet corner of fashion show mall between the escalators. The vegetables and salmon were fresh, however, the spicy salmon was not. I imagined the spicy salmon to be marinated whole pieces of salmon, but it was mashed up salmon which was not fresh, not spicy and weird tasting. Though it was refreshing to eat something with rice and vegetables after a few days of heavy food in Vegas, but this poke is average. Most of all, it was because they were stingy in the sauces, only marinating the salmons with the sauce, so the whole poke was pretty bland after mixing together. That is, unless you prefer \"original\" taste of the individual food."}
{"text":"Poke is one of my favorite things to eat. I love fresh ingredients in a dish with yummy sauce that mixes well. That's exactly what I get every time I go to a poke spot. Gogo poke is inside of one of the many places to shop in Vegas. The menu is simple and I tore my poke bowl down lol. I ordered the regular sized poke bowl which comes with your seafood of choice. I got the ahi tuna and shrimp with white rice, corn, edamame beans, ginger, red and green bell peppers. I couldn't stop eating it was so good. The Shrimp and ahi tuna were coated with a sauce so good I can't begin to explain the taste. Just delicious!The employees here were very patient and helpful. The restaurant was clean and set up well. When I'm Vegas I will be back here for sure. Poke is my life!"}
{"text":"Yummm, you get to choose what you want for one price. Great customer service, genuine and nice!"}
{"text":"I totally forgot to redeem my 10%!! don't forget to do that.  The portions are great, fish is fresh, and I like the toppings.  I got the $10.99 regular bowl with brown rice, salmon, tuna, and a ton of toppings. Their house gogo sauce is ginger and sesame based and delicious!  I definitely recommend this place. Located inside Fashion Show Mall, it's convenient and cleanz"}
{"text":"Surprisingly good despite being a food court in a shopping mall. The fish tasted frozen but the toppings really made it up. Tbh I don't really care about the fish quality cause I was starving to death. I would come here again if I'm happened to be in Fashion show."}
{"text":"Excellent poke with fresh fish at a very reasonable price ! Hidden find in fashion mall indeed."}
{"text":"Tucked away between the escalators at the mall, this place is a nice little gem. Quick, friendly service with a healthy portion of fish.   The traditional sauce has a little too much acid and needs some more salt but still satisfied my raw salmon craving. Plenty of tables to sit and dine and very clean.   A large bowl with 3 scoops came out to $14.07. Avocado will cost you another dollar. Still a good value and good quality. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Amazing food, I had their salmon and Tuna and would highly recommend it!  Definitally try out their house gogo sauce too!"}
{"text":"Great food and service, nice to eat healthy while shopping in mall. We be back again. They are located in Fashion Mall"}
{"text":"They gave me a macaroon for making a five star review. The poke bowl was sub par and the octopus was too chewy, the veggies dry and mushy and the rice was deplorable. This was a phenomenal exercise in mediocrity. Would not return."}
{"text":"Excellent spot. Great food. You won't be sorry. Very healthy and filling. So many tastes in one bowl, it's amazing. Great everyday lunch spot"}
{"text":"Super fresh, super good! The ingredients are very fresh and tastes amazing! They also have recommendations of sauces to mix with your protein."}
{"text":"Located in the Fashion Show Mall, Gogo offers a very nice and quick Poke experience on the strip and Yay! I'm definitely a fan...=)  Service: I've only been here for lunch breaks and the staff has always been efficient with building your poke bowl quickly and correctly.  I love the signs that help you build your own poke bowl chipotle style.  I love even more how they label all the ingredients so the whole process is not so intimidating to someone new in the Poke world.  Poke Bowl:  Ingredients are measured and my experiences with the salmon and tuna have all been good.  Spicy mayo is mixed well and the seaweed salad is always fresh.  After a couple of visits, all the ingredients have been fresh with is key for poke bowl success.  So many different options to create a new poke experience every visit  Stationed between 2 escalators, there's plenty of tables and chairs to down for a quick poke break.  For a quick poke to go place, Gogo exceeds my expectations.  I'm glad there's a poke option on the strip and I'll be around frequently as I work in the vicinity.  Check them out if you're in the Fashion Show mall and want to get your poke on!  Enjoy yourself..=)"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! I tried regular bowl with spicy tuna and salmon. And it was so good!! The workers are nice and the place is very clean too. HIGHLY RECOMMANDED!! YUM!! ;)"}
{"text":"Got to this place by accident and I'm so happy we did. Such an amazing quality of ingredients at this price is just great.  You can add as many toppings you want and they have an amazing variety. Avocado is another dollar but worth it.  Defiantly will be coming back and recommending."}
{"text":"Healthy, fresh - love that you can pick your options! Worth the walk down the strip. Added house gogo sauce - delish!"}
{"text":"TL;DR: Sorry, but NOT 5 star poke! I hate to break this restaurant's 5 star combo, but it's not deserved and here's what you need to know:  First, the poke: the salmon is VERY good! Fresh, soft, good portion cuts, etc. However, the ahi (tuna) poke was chewy, muscular and tasted/felt like it was just thawed out. Also, $11-$12 poke bowl like this should come with much more poke! Which brings me to my next point...  Service: we had the larger of the two guys who working 11/25/2017 at approx. 7p. My wife speaks English as a second language and it's not easy for her to always communicate. Our guy who made our poke was not hospitable towards her effort at communicating (he would interject when she spoke, showed on his face he was exasperated trying to speak to her), AND gave her noticeably less poke than me! Working with him was all in all uncomfortable and made us feel unwelcome.  It's not a bad poke bowl, but it's not worth the price tag, the service can improve, and the ahi tuna could be improved. Go!ku in West Las Vegas had better raw fish IMO, but they are first and foremost a ramen place and off the strip, so take that into consideration if you're taxi'ing/ walking."}
{"text":"If you are shopping around at Fashion Show Mall and hungry? Must stop at GoGo POKE, if you looking for a healthier option at the mall. They have the freshest seafoods; salmon, ahi tuna, spicy tuna, albacore, cooked shrimp, octopus and scallop as well.   Don't forget the dessert; mochi ice cream and macaroons!"}
{"text":"My fiance works at the fashion show mall and whenever i'm meeting her for lunch or just getting something to eat when were off we come to this place.  The last time i was here Daniel was the one who helped me.  He provided great customer service and was very friendly.  He gave suggestions on new ways to try my poke bowl.  I will continue to visit this location whenever i'm at the mall"}
{"text":"This dish was extremely prepared.. everything was just fantastic! I love Gogo poke :)"}
{"text":"Solid food. Great prices. Friendly service. Customize to your heart's content. What else do you really need? Its inside the Fashion Show Mall so grab a bowl while you walk around!"}
{"text":"Salmon and Tuna were amazing. Highly recommend the GoGo Sauce.   Staff was very friendly and helpful, the location was kind of hidden but everything looked very clean and fresh. Food was delicious and the price was very reasonable."}
{"text":"Love coming here on break and the service here is amazing!!! The girl who serves me is always nice and welcoming!!"}
{"text":"I like how it's perfectly inside fashion show mall in the middle so people who work here have a healthier option. Tuna and salmon here is fresh and so yummy. I usually get half rice and salad mix here with crab, jalape√±o, onions, spicy mayo, seaweed salad, ginger, and sesame seeds! I really liked this place and i will eat here instead of the food court if i get hungry shopping!"}
{"text":"Super awesome that this is now at fashion show. Likely this will be the spot for us to stop and get a bite when we're shopping!"}
{"text":"Walking the strip looking for some kine grindz, this place hit the spot nice size portion of fish and sauce so good, will probably be back everyday here. Thanks Gogo. See you tomorrow"}
{"text":"house gogo works so well with their spicy mayo. i had the tuna and salmon, the fish was extremely fresh and flavorful! highly reccomend!"}
{"text":"Great value in Vegas!  Fish was really fresh.  Unlimited toppings!"}
{"text":"This place is great! First time and wont be the last! I had a long day at work and told the cashier to put whatever sweet and tasty on my bowl and she met my satisfaction standards"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  Finally, a healthy food option in the mall when I have a break.  The veggie bowl is wonderful.  Everything was healthy, fresh and delicious...This will definitely be my go to spot when I'm in fashion show mall.  So happy they are there!"}
{"text":"I was on a search for some appetizing fare on my lunch break and stumbled across this delicious dining establishment. The bowl I ordered consisted of shrimp, crab, seaweed salad and many etc. The young lady working 1/4/18 at 12:45pm was so courteous and offered some amazing suggestions. She is the reason my bowl was so amazing! I work across the street and will be frequenting this hidden gem and recommending to everyone."}
{"text":"I know there are tons of Poke places in Vegas. But this place hits the spot for being on the north end of the strip. The portions are generous and they allow you to put as many toppings as you want. Secondly this is located in the Fashion District Mall so while you shop this is a great and clean choice to fill up and refuel."}
{"text":"Yasss this poke really hit the spot. I was hungry and in need of looking for food and I stumbled among this place. Its pretty easy to order and I had no issues. The staff was pretty friendly and I went during an off time so it was pretty empty and most importantly...it was cheap. I recommend you come here if you're not trying to spend alot and are spending quite some time in the Fashion Show Mall."}
{"text":"Possibly the best poke I've had. Who would've thought that a poke kiosk in a mall in Vegas with less than 10 reviews would be this good! The place is very casual, it's a store sandwiched between a pair of escalators. The food however is fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"I had the Hawaiian bowl with salmon and spicy salmon. Everything was good, no complaints. I see some people complaining about the price. For a poke bowl on the strip, the price is relative. Any cheaper and you can expect food poisoning. Can't skimp on things like fresh fish. Maybe it's the sound of lots of people talking in the mall that prevents me from giving them 5 stars, but that's really not their fault. I've tried lots of different poke places in Vegas, California, Hawaii, and NY. The poke bowl here is just like any other place. If you're shopping around, the location is convenient, that's for sure."}
{"text":"Giving this place 5 stars solely based on the location, I come to fashion show often and I always thought the mall would not be complete without a poke bowl place, and now it's here!   Food here is good, comparable to most poke bowl places I have been to. It is certainly not the best poke bowl you will have, but it was actually better than I expected consider it is a small place stuck in between two escalators. The scoops seem smaller than other places, which is understandable since this is a tourist area. Fish was fresh and topping varieties were acceptable. I will be back next time I am in the mall."}
{"text":"When you brave the mall on a Saturday, no matter what city you're in, you deserve a treat. When you brave the mall on a Saturday in Las Vegas, you deserve a poke bowl.  I was handling some returns and needed a snack. I had passed by Gogo Poke while I was purchasing said returns but wasn't hungry at the time. I'm a big fan of poke, because Hawaii has my heart, so I'm always on the hunt for a great spot. Gogo wins for many reasons, the biggest one is that it was in my face at the moment I needed it most.  The set-up is simple. You walk right up, or wait in line when there is one, and start with your base. I did half salad, half white rice. I was surprised to find they don't toss the greens so, note to self to ask for that next time. I went with salmon and tuna tossed with a ginger sauce and spicy mayo. This was recommended by the friendliest guy behind the glass, who was basically telling me all of his favorite mixes. The fish was tossed with a perfect amount of sauce and I topped it with some seaweed salad, green onion, and sesame seeds. My poke bowl was exactly the combo I needed at the time.  I'm not math wizard, but I think your options are endless. #science"}
{"text":"Super stoked that we finally have a Poke place by the mall and let me tell you this, it's delicious! It's definitely worth the wait being said that it's easily accessible in the mall. A very awesome spot to be. They produce excellent products where you get to forge your very own bowl, crafted to your liking. A very well-balanced team that cater to your needs. But most importantly, the freshness of what they serve.   This place offers an adequate sitting area and their price range is very flexible. Very good for our \"price-sensitive\" consumers!   I guarantee your satisfaction if ever you crave a twist to the Japanese cuisine!"}
{"text":"Fantastic. In the Fashion Show Mall (odd) by the Macy's men's store for perspective, but the food was great.  Ordered the large bowl with greens, 3 protein scoops (I did salmon, tuna, spicy tuna), added my add ons (avocado $1 but worth it). Went with Ponzilla sauce, which was awesome and decent heat.  they had drinks, but there is also an ABC store next door if you want something different.   All in, $15 for a healthy and clean eating lunch. Absolutely worth it."}
{"text":"Super fantastic!!! Delicious!! Friendly servers and good service!   Gogo pokebowl is better than other places in Vegas. They have a lot of toppings and sauces. The place is easy to be accessible.   I ordered half and half (brown rice and salad), salmon, tofu, and scallop with every toppings,  volcano sauce and sesami oil. Definitely, desserts are your last choice to have satisfaction in Gogo poke."}
