{"text":"My Filipino friends assured me that the taste (authenticity) of the dishes here are mostly similar to those back home.  My understand of Filipino cuisine is that it's usually deep fried and very rich tasting so if that's not your thing, you may not enjoy the food here.  That being said it's also not something I can eat everyday, but for the couple of times I did eat here I enjoyed every dish I ordered.  Service is quick and friendly - I find the restaurant atmosphere very family-oriented so it feels very welcoming to be there.  The halo-halo is a must try!!!!"}
{"text":"We came here after a couple of months it opened so there's no ridiculous 3 hours wait. The waiting time was pretty much the same as the Philippines when you visit this restaurant. The chicken tastes good and the same as back home (PH). Though it was served with fries instead of sweet potatoes. The lechon kawali was also good but the sauce that was with it was too little. We ordered buko panda and halo halo for dessert. The halo halo was okay. The buko panda which is my favorite back home  wasn't as authentic. The look is similar except no pandan leaf served with it and there was just a very slight pandan taste. The servers were friendly and the ambience is nice. We'll probably come back here to satisfy Max product cravings"}
{"text":"You had me at Sizzling Tofu (my all time favourite)!! Max's is about 30 mins away from our place but it's definitely worth the drive  Great food, big servings, price is reasonable, and they have the nicest staff!"}
{"text":"As part of our \"summer bucket list\" - I finally took my family to dine on Filipino fare.  Embarrassingly, as a Canadian born Filipino, my knowledge of Filipino food is not as great as it should be.  So, eating at Max's fit the bill - a smaller menu offering Filipino food \"hits\" with \"no misses.\"  We ate garlic rice, lumpia, roast chicken, chicken adobo and pancit canton - the dishes very similar to my mom's cooking and satisfied my need to introduce to my family, samples of Filipino food.   The wait for food is very long- hubs and I weren't surprised (after having spent time in the Philippines and learning to wait..).  Just don't go hungry and all will be worth the wait. The restaurant decor is simple and modern, but so \"open\" that it was very noisy and loud.  Maybe some dividers would dampen the noise?? We'd come back to sample more filipino dishes- for sure!"}
{"text":"Foods alright chicken can be crispier. Slow seating and service but overall a nice place. Ordered half a chicken for $14, then my brother said he wanted some so I asked the waiter to make it a whole for $20 but they said they couldn't do it because of their system. All they had to do was cool the other half and charge me more. Dumb"}
{"text":"I ordered a palabok to go from this restaurant, it was pretty bad. Not sure if dining in would be better but it was basically noodles and some orange sauce and couple slices of boiled egg.  The sauce was runny and did not taste like palabok at all. The portion wasn't worth the price at all."}
{"text":"We dined  here when it was newly opened, probably a week or so. They did not have milk, despite them just being across superstore. That was disappointing. Other than that, I loved the food. Service was really slow. The food is all that matters for me, though. Made me remember the PH and gave a satisfying Filipino meal for my family. Second time, we had food delivered, was awesome! The pancit could have more stuff, though."}
{"text":"They just opened so they're still getting into the groove but it has the potential to be as good as the Edmonton location. The kitchen is a bit slow and it's quite expensive but the food is good. Get the Calderetta and Pancit Canton."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the Filipino food at this restaurant my friend brought me here before he moved to the Philippines and he said the food was authentic , we both enjoyed the food and service ."}
{"text":"Went here to eat yesterday NEVER AGAIN. Everything was dry Fries, chicken, rice had barely any flavor, and my tofu was over cooked.I actually felt sick after eating here, so if you wanna spend $60 on dog food this is the place to go."}
