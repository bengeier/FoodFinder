{"text":"As a group of new Toronto recruits, we decided to try out Rebel House at the suggestion of one of my coworkers. An easy walk from the Rosedale subway stop, we went the evening of the Stanley Cup final, expecting the place to be packed, but managed to find comfortable high-top seating, and friendly service, amidst a fairly busy night.

The Rebel House is a small pub, with a quaint upstairs section, where we sat. Several TV's aired the hockey game, and there was an eclectic mix of people, some older, into their 50's, but predominantly a mix of twenty and thirtysomething young professionals and students.

The menu is varied, but small, although they offer a revolving door of several daily specials that seem to be based on season and availability, which is always a good bet.

My dining partner decided to go with the daily special Mussels ($14), absolutely delicious in a white wine and garlic sauce, with toasted garlic bread. I ordered the Spicy Spinach Cheese Pennies ($10), small appetizer-sized cheese patties, with nary a spinach leaf in sight...nor were they spicey. No matter. These delightful little morsels were crispy on the outside, gooey on the inside, and came with a delectable tomato chutney and sour cream to top with. At our server's suggestions, I also ordered the Spinach and Apple Salad ($6), with cheddar cheese, toasted almonds, and a homemade maple dressing on the side. A wonderful combination. In fact, we liked the cheese pennies so much, we ordered another batch, only to find that that a repeat order isn't always as good the second time around. These pennies were so thick with grease, I found myself soaking up the oil slick with a napkin just to get them down. I think ordering a third time might have settled this dilemma for good, but for now I choose to remember the experience based on my initial encounter with the Spicy Spinach Cheese Pennies; delightful.

My dining partner, an \"adventurous\" drinker himself, ordered a Labatt Blue, but it did come in the extra large bottle, which made him smile from ear to ear. I ordered the Henry of Pelham Pinot Noir to start, but must admit that it tasted watered down and a bit weak. Not to be discouraged, I tried the 2006 Cabernet Franc Special Reserve VQA after dinner, and was pleasantly surprised by one of the nicer glasses of wine I have had at a pub in some time. It had a heavy quality, with a nice vanilla finish. I would go back to Rebel House just to try this glass of wine again.

Our server was friendly and talkative, and the prices at Rebel House are fairly reasonable. Wine was about $7-$8 a glass, and our meals were between $8-$12 for the appetizers, and up to $20 for an entrée. Except for the bad experience with the second order of cheese pennies, Rebel House is an excellent neighbourhood pub, serving up good food at good prices."}
{"text":"Just hands down the best pub in cabbagetowm!

They have an incredible menu as well as a great and friendly atmosphere. The roof patio that they just opened up has got great evening sun!

The best dish and my go to is always the steak pie!"}
{"text":"This is a well-oiled machine of a restaurant service model. 

The servers all keep an eye out for each other's tables, and it's clear that customer service is a strong value for this establishment. 

The food is fresh, offered at a decent value, and there is a lovely parachute-covered patio to relax on if you wish."}
{"text":"Best grilled cheese and chips. Always good and friendly service. The hummus is homemade and amazing."}
{"text":"wandered in this place while walking up Yonge Street.

Sat at the bar and the bartender was great. Excellent Poutine. Never had it before and had several times after this, went back here to eat it again.

Good beer selection and back patio with lots of funky style."}
{"text":"Still a top notch pub for pints and great food. First time back in years and they still are one of the cities best \"Gastro Pubs\"....hate that word, but it does best describe The Rebel House. 
Still great after all these years!"}
{"text":"Cozy. Nice selection of food and drink. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"Have frequented the Rebel house many times. Same routine... enter the door and the waiter is trying to seat you in tables at the back of the pub downstairs. Please give this up ! We end upstairs at the bar or table and have an enjoyable time. ( most time there is room there )  More than enough beers to select from and the food is average / above average for a pub. I apprecaite it is a small place and they are trying to \" direct\" people to optimze the seating... but don't make it so obvious. It takes the fun out of the evening."}
{"text":"Just got home from the Rebel House and I'm in a conundrum. If I rate the place too high, everyone will show up and then there's no more room left for me.  But if I rate the place too low, then the staff will feel bad.  

Heck, It was great. Tiny, cozy, awesome pub food, not pretentious. just right."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, drinks and food. 

Love this pub and it never dissapoints, except when it is busy and we can't get a table..... However the staff is very happy to please and get a table for those who are patiently waiting. 

Patio is wonderful and great for drinks in the summer. The atmosphere is cozy and warm inside. Food is delicious and the regulars like the mac and cheese, corn bread and the club sandwich are my favorites. YUM YUM....
The fries are to die for and like it that you have an option of a bit of both-- fries(kettle chips) and salad with your dinner.

The beers on tap...wow.  They have a large assortment and like that they have one of my favourite microbreweries beer on tap KLB.

Thanks Rebel House....see you next weekend"}
{"text":"Just by Rosedale, this little local pub makes me come back for the patio and the poutine! Beer selection at Rebel house is really good, and reasonably priced as well. However, the real gem in my opinion is their kettle chips take on poutine - come hungry its made to share!

The patio has beautiful lights in the summer and the menu is great for snaking/brunch."}
{"text":"Only good for beers with buddies. Food is subpar and kitchen is very small and unclean."}
{"text":"Rebel House is our go-to local pub. Moved to the neighbourhood to be close to it. Have been going here since the late 90s. Great to sit at the bar at the window and watch the world go by."}
{"text":"I am absolutely appalled by the server who showed up at our table after we finished our first round of beers to announce that if we \"were not going to order food, we should move over to the bar within 30 seconds, because he had people waiting for a table.\" 

This is the fist time I ever heard anything like that at a pub! Another waitress must have overheard my shocked reaction, and sent the guy back to apologize. Which he did claiming \"it was a joke, and we didn't have to move in 30 seconds.\" 

A joke... Seriously?!?!

I don't want to make a scene and look for the owner, but servers should be fired for this kind of unprofessional \"jokes.\"

Oh and by the way, we were there to have food, and really did not deserve that kind of treatment. 

The food at this pub is greasy and mediocre, and the place is cluttered and filthy."}
{"text":"I love this pub. Great patio, great service and Great food. Love their fries and the beer selection is tops with all sorts of microbreweries on tap. Be forwarned the place is always busy and its tough to get a spot on the patio at night unless you get there early. Located conveniently at Rosedale Subway station approximately. I went with the Mac/Cheese/cornbread, fries deal this time around and was not disappointed. Staff moved us to the patio from our indoor table seamlessly. Excellent friendly service. What are you waiting for?"}
{"text":"On a 45 degree July night, we hopped onto the patio. Straight from work in dress clothes, I unbuttoned my shirt nearly all the way - prompting the waiter to quip \"tone it down David Hasselhoff.\" 

Unpretentious vibe, plus an affordable and varied food and drinks menu, this is a solid neighbourhood spot, even if the service was occasionally sporadic due to apparent understaffing.

A ton of beers are on tap and the food - down to the hot sauce - was fresh and flavorful. 3 of us had the mac and cheese, a fourth had the buffalo and beef burger. All enjoyed the food. The burger looked solid and hand ground.

The place is slightly dingy on the inside but the ramshackleness adds to its character in a way.

The inside was still quite hot on this summer's day and at the tables near the stairs to downstairs I could smell, in a vague way, perhaps some small amount of odor wafting up from the bathroom. 

But no one else complained and I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"This place has been here a lot longer than since 2007!  Someone needs to update that!  Rebel house has long been my favourite patio destination.  It's so beautiful, no traffic, and the beer selection is so good!"}
{"text":"Visited this place few times. It's my favourite place to go especially for Sunday Brunch. Their Eggs Benedict is great! The food in general is good but the service is random. There was this one time that our waitress was very very rude! Like she had a bad day and wanted to get the revenge from all the customers LOL She barely responded to our greetings, was rude when getting our orders, and ignorant. It felt like she hates people :/"}
{"text":"what kind of a bar, on a tuesday night at 9:00, says you can only sit at the tables (as opposed to the bar) if you're eating food? Besides the fact that the place was NOT full by any stretch of the imagination, you do realize that you make more from the drinkers, right?

Getting past that frustration, we settled into a booth (my companion decided to eat some dinner, luckily), which was cozy and nice. A good beer selection and a fairly expansive menu were helpful too. Unfortunately the macaroni and cheese we got didn't have very much flavour and had one part that was basically hard as a rock (obviously from the edge of the pot). 

Very nice for a quiet beer, and I would return for that, despite the weirdness about tables. The downstairs is quite small, but as far as I could tell there was a second floor open, though I didn't venture up to see it."}
{"text":"I haven't eaten here since last summer, but from what I remember I always found it to be a really charming little place.  They have an amazing back patio, and if you can find a spot in the shade, it's perfect on a summer day -- like you're at a party in someone's backyard.

From what I remember the food was great as well, but I only ate here twice and haven't been back since -- I'll echo what others have said about the seating, it's pretty limited, and whoever is in charge of seating patrons is incredibly rude about filling tables as much as possible.

I get it.  You're a small restaurant, so ideally people who are having a drink should be at the bar, and people who are eating should have a table.  But when you're asking people to move about and having your patrons playing musical chairs, it interrupts my experience of enjoying a meal with a friend (at an appropriate table for two).

The seating thing definitely ruined it for me, and I wasn't even the one being asked to move.  There are other ways of politely explaining the seating arrangements, and for that reason, this place gets two-stars."}
{"text":"As someone who grew up in Rosedale, I've been to Rebel House more than 10 times. I recently had such a bad experience I felt compelled to sign up for Yelp.

I was was hosting two of my American business associates from New York City and decided to drop by to grab a couple beers this past Friday around 8pm. It wasn't very busy so we we're quite excited as I quite enjoy the laid back atmosphere.

The server was quite rude to us right from the get go, and she seemed like she just didn't want to deal with another group of customers. When she came back to take our order she let us know that she could not serve us alcohol, because the Americans did not have Canadian IDs, and wanted us to leave.

I appreciate part of her job is curbing under age drinking, but we were 25, 25, and 28 respectively and every single person had government issued ID. It felt as though I was in a farce.

As a Canadian, I was honestly embarrassed at her complete lack of hospitality and poor customer service skills. I will not go back there so long as she works there."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite places for a brunch on Sunday! 

The atmosphere of the place is so cozy and warm during the winter. I heard they have a nice patio during the summer, so I can't wait to check it out. 

I usually order the Mac and cheese, which is AH-MAZING!!! What I like about this place so they'll let you get half fries and half salad. This way you don't feel too guilty about eating their delicious fries. OH and not to forget about the delicious cornbread they have, it was really upsetting that they ran out of it when I visited last :( 

The server is pretty fast and their servers are friendly. Highly recommend this place as it is not too pricey too!!"}
{"text":"I lived in the area for 1.5 years and visited The Rebel House quite frequently. I LOVE the cozy feel of this place. It feels like you are in a log cabin somewhere in the Canadian wilderness. It is not a place where you will find sloppy and obnoxious drunks. They also have cool artwork covering the walls that are for sale that are changed up quite frequently to keep things interesting. 

The food is affordable and delicious. Portion sizes are generous. I've ordered the baked chicken wings which I loved - I do have to mention that the wings haven't always been consistent, however... I've gotten my wings both undercooked and quite burned before and had to return them. The mac n' cheese is also great. It is very rich and creamy and I love that some parts are crispy. I love that they allow you to do half&half for your side - not many restaurants accommodate this, let alone offer it to you. If you crave something healthier, you must try the spinach and apple salad - it is sweet (dressing), tart (green apple), crunchy (toasted almonds) and creamy (cheddar cheese) all at the same time. 

The beer selection is a good mix of the usual domestic and craft beers. It is changed up often and allows you to try out some new beers every once and awhile. 

My only complaint is that they do not allow you to sit at a table unless you order food. I just don't see the reason behind this. That is the only reason I can't give it 5 stars. Otherwise, LOVE THIS PLACE!

P.S. The homemade hot sauce is great!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere is great for a pub. In a converted row house. A heated patio in the back, with a parachute, interesting decor, Canadian Mountie at the top of the steps in the dining room upstairs. Good selection on beers. They have this written on a chalkboard by your table.

I ordered a steak and yam frites. My GF a salad, and friends ordered half order of wings. Food is average. 

Don't expect the world from it, it's not Canoe or an Iron Chef experience. It's bar food. Good place to hang if you're into pubs."}
{"text":"Friendly barman and lovely patio in the back. Order the fries! This is a central and happening little spot for rebels and people like me alike."}
{"text":"Cannot believe the rip-off on the pate appetizer... looked like a smear of shite and all the sad pasty baguette toast was burned (which I sent back) and then the homous plate was likewise stingy and tasteless. What happened to you Rebel? Our local has gone loco. Sad to see such a deterioration of quality. There is no excuse. The prices are high enough!"}
{"text":"This bar reminded me of 7 West Cafe except 4 times more expensive and the service was slow and unhappy."}
{"text":"This place is great. The service is fantastic and the food (KFC, Organic Fried Chicken with Green Beans and Mashed Potatoes) was the best thing I've had in a long time. Patio is tucked away, a great spot for the summer. I highly recommend. It's also really reasonably priced."}
{"text":"It's not bad for a beer at the bar in the winter. Pretty cozy, actually.

In the summer, they've got a great patio, but won't let you sit on it unless you're ordering food...even the place is empty. Odd, but that's OK, you can just go to another bar."}
{"text":"I went there for the first time last night.  As usual I read up on Yelp to get the D-L or the Down-Low on how jiggy or swank this place is.  Suffice it to say this place gets a massive thumbs up.  People like this place a lot.  Whether it's the beer menu, which I'm not really a fan of, or the \"cozy\" interior.  I put quotes around cozy because essentially this place is 2 levels, but cramped as hell.  It feels cramped, the staff will accidentally knock your chair or your coat on the way by just because of how little space there is to give for walking.

The atmosphere is great, the staff is muchos friendly and helpful and the food on the whole is great food. I had the poutine and it was horrible.  It's a great portion for the price, but kettle chip poutine in a gravy that tastes of bacon essentially gets you soggy thin sliced potatoe slices that just leaves something to be desired like what if they used actual fries? Or.... better gravy?  It's not good and people are giving this poutine a standing O?

3-stars means it's A-OK and that's what it is.  I'll go back, but not before I consider other places to go first"}
{"text":"This place is class! Everything you should look for in a great pub. Small intimate building. Wonderful local craft beers. Great fresh and unique menu with awesome specials every day. Owners on site behind the bar and great fun. Great with friends or your partner or even on your own if you've time to kill and a newspaper to hand. Best pub in Toronto. See for yourself!"}
{"text":"I am obsessed with the fries here. Ask to get them extra crispy... They taste better than potato chips. Been here a few times for breakfast and enjoyed the food very much :)"}
{"text":"Great place to hang out with friends and grab drinks after work! The staff are nice and friendly and the patio is aesthetically pleasing!

Atmosphere: Very laid back, none of that pretentious bullcrap

Service: Fast and Friendly 

Food: Affordable and quite good

Drinks: Large selection of Ontario Brews and Liqours ... I recommend Tromba Tequila :)"}
{"text":"Really good place with friendly staff. One word of caution, if you're going just for drinks, you have to sit at one of the two bars. Tables are for people ordering food only.

Great specials, good use of local ingredients, tons of microbrewery beers."}
{"text":"Downstairs washrooms at restaurants are like a built in field sobriety test."}
{"text":"Well, two years later and I'm afraid my original review no longer holds true. This place does disappoint. In fact, it disappointed me a lot on Saturday night. 

As a regular of nearly 5 years, the consistency of this place is what made us come back time and time again. Personable service. Great food. Charm. Character. On this night,none of these things could be found. Perhaps the regular staff was away for the long weekend? Sure felt like it. 

Our food was bland across the board. My go-to Rebel burger which I have almost every time I go, came on a rock-hard stale bun and seems to have shrunk in size. The wings were and very overcooked. The kettle fries were soggy and burnt. The service was inattentive and often non-responsive. We shouldn't have to track someone down 20 minutes after finishing our meal. 

I'm not writing this review in spite. Just disappointment. But, I will certainly try our favourite pub again as it has, over the years, been a great place."}
{"text":"Very enjoyable atmosphere - quiet patio out back of what looks like a house, which makes it feel like your own backyard... with another 20 people dining around you. 

The service was pleasant and quick. The Eggs Benedict were great and I liked that you could have half salad and half homefries on the side without an extra charge. 

I did find a hair in my homefries towards the end of my meal, but my entire meal was free and the server was very apologetic. The hair aside, it is a great place for a brunch with a friend or two."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner with a friend on a Monday evening. We sat at a table for 4 and were very curtly asked to move to a table for 2. Fine, I get it - it's a small restaurant and they're trying to optimize the space that they have, but the lady responsible for seating could have at least been nice about it. Maybe if they were so concerned about it they could have seated us themselves and it wouldn't have been an issue.

Despite this off-putting initial impression, we couldn't deny that the patio in the back was a picture-perfect, cozy little place to hang out on a summer evening. Looking at the menu, the prices seemed fair. When we got our plates I was a little disappointed with the portions, but I guess this is pretty much par for the course in the Summerhill area, plus you pay for the nice atmosphere. We had the chicken pot pie and bison lasagna and they were both quite good. The salad and garlic bread that came with it were average.

The service, on the other hand, left a bad taste in my mouth. The waitress treated us like we should be grateful they even let us in. She forgot to bring the garlic bread and was completely unapologetic. That may sound like a whiny remark, but isn't it just common courtesy to say sorry for something like that? Not a single nicety was exchanged with our server - not even a smile. It's been a while since I've been to a restaurant and been treated so poorly.

The aloofness of the staff, combined with the average and somewhat overpriced food, is why I wouldn't recommend this restaurant, especially when there are so many other options close by."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood bar! If you are looking for a place that has good food and warm service.. This is the place :)"}
{"text":"I still say this is the BEST place in town for wings. Plus they have excellent craft beers on tap. You just can't pair good wings with Molson products in my books. AND they make their own scotch bonnet sauce for spice lovers. I saw one review on here claiming bathrooms are in the basement, but there's another one upstairs that's more homey. I mean, the whole place is homey, not just the bathroom, but I just thought I'd throw it out there. Love the staff, love the patio and LOVE when Karen (the chef) puts her famous Rebel Mac on the daily special:)"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and really loved it. We sat at the back where they have a lovely and charming patio, which couldn't be lovelier on a nice summer day. The menu is quite varied, and they have lunch specials. The table ordered Lamb Burger (cooked well), appetizer portion of the risotto (just right), and I had a simple chicken salad.

Drinks included a Summer Sangria which was right.

Service was excellent! No problem to split the bill 4 ways. On the way out, one of us saw a fruity beer on the chalkboard and wondered out loud how it would taste. One of the workers (or managers?) behind the bar proceeded to pour a little serve for her to taste. This I thought was so thoughtful and great service.

Will be back!"}
{"text":"FatCat get excited when he hear the name \"Rebel House\".  FatCat think he going to bar full of angry, discontent revolutionaries, with plans to overthrow power mongers in government. FatCat like to hang out with rebels who try to free subjugated workers from indentured servitude. 

But BIG dissappointment for FatCat. When FatCat get to rebel house he realize his fantasy get crushed. Rebel house just another bar on Yong st, with happy people eating good food. 

FatCat pack away his ski mask and Molotov cocktails, and reduce his expectations for the night..  No chants for freedom. No protest for liberation. No burning cars in streets. No stores on fire.  No rebels in Rebel House.

Things FatCat like
- great ambiance
- food is good
- FatCat not remember how much money he spend. But thinking not too expensive.

FatCat remember thinking he want to maybe bring some classy lady to place like this for first date.

SIDE NOTE: FatCat feel insecure about his English because English not first language for FatCat. So FatCat go to dictionary.com to fine meaning of word \"rebel\".  FatCat feel good when he find out FatCat English is good."}
{"text":"Totally agree with the below reviewer's comments about the coziness and log-cabin feel of this place! My husband and I popped in here last night for a drink and really enjoyed ourselves...We were seated at the back on the main level and felt so at home. We also really appreciated the servers - all so down to earth and relaxed! 

I had the Brickworks Cider, which I was happy with (although it was the only cider option - I would love to see more, but this is an issue in 90% of the bars I've been to). My husband had the Left Field Oatmeal Brown Ale for the first time and loved it. 

We will definitely be back at Rebel House soon!"}
{"text":"Great back patio, and friendly staff. Rebel house had a good selection of beers, but not cocktails or other alcoholic bevvies. Their food was only good, not GREAT. Their burgers were close to great, but their wings and mussels were only ok."}
{"text":"I've eaten here before, it's nothing special but it's definitely a neighbourhood favourite.

I called to make a reservation and I was greeted with two things: 1) we don't take reservations (which is totally understandable), 2) \"the next time you want to make a reservation for a restaurant, call a day in advance (which I found very obnoxious). I mean, this is a family pub with subpar food and most of the appeal is driven from the bar. For an employee to have the audacity to think that he can say that kind of crap, especially for a restaurant that's viewed as a casual neighbourhood spot, is extremely pretentious and shocking.


Good luck in the long run, I really enjoyed your grilled cheese"}
{"text":"I've come to Rebel House quite a few times, and I have always had a good experience. I like their selection of beers (that's definitely the main attraction for me), but I also just generally really enjoy the atmosphere. It is definitely one of my favourite pubs in Toronto, especially in midtown. 

I have sat on the patio without ordering food on a very lovely summer evening, so I am not sure about the earlier comment regarding not being able to get patio seating unless you order food. That hasn't been my experience.."}
{"text":"Came after tutoring on Monday night. Was greeted warmly by the owner? who again, told us we could sit upstairs only if we ordered food. We decided to, I got Macki's back, the mac and cheese dish and my friend got the Pesto. They were both good but a little carb heavy (What can i expect from Mac and Cheese) Fries were also very good.  Beer selection was also quite nice and the place was very busy for a monday night."}
{"text":"I always like the atmosphere at The Rebel House, and the beer list is ok as well, but tonight I went for dinner and had the worst Mac & Cheese of my life: it was barely warm, and consisted mostly of crusty, dried and way-past-crunchy pasta that definitely wasn't macaroni. The fries seemed to be over a day old as well, full of grease and not much taste. I'll go back, but just to grab a beer or two."}
{"text":"I have been here a handful of times and always enjoy the cozy atmosphere and friendly staff. It is perfect for a winter drink & snacks with a few friends or a sunday meal. They have a patio for warmer weather but I haven't sat there yet. Who would think to order a salad in a pub, but the salad with blackened chicken, almonds, spinach and maple dressing is delightful... I would recommend it!"}
{"text":"Great food, great patio and excellent service.  I'm a huge fan.  My friends took me here for my birthday back in June and 5 hours of drinking and eating commenced.  My food was extremely good - I had the steak dinner.  We had 3 reasonably priced bottles of red wine and a light dessert of strawberries and cream.  The portions are large, but the food is so good you'll be willing to stuff yourself.

The patio is quaint and inviting, covered with a parachute.  The service is very good -- I never feel like I have to flag anyone down.  

Came here again last week and once again, impressed with everything.  And although I can understand if people get upset about the whole \"can't seat you if you're not eating\" thing, on the other hand this place isn't a pub-pub.  It is fairly small and people are coming to eat dinner (since it is more of a gastropub).  

Great place to go but beware, they don't have a cocktail list.  It is very beer-wine focused, although they can make you some general bar-rail type drinks if need be."}
{"text":"This is the perfect cozy pub with good food.  The staff is really friendly, they have great beers.  They have Canadian fare like poutine and tortiere that I come for when I visit from NYC.  It's the kind of neighborhood place that embodies Toronto for me."}
{"text":"Always a neighbourhood staple.  They got it going on.  

I got Ol' Mackey's Back anytime.
Cheese can be grilled to perfection.
Fries - probably the best in the city.
Poutine - interesting and awesome.

Great bourbon selection as well.

what's not to like?"}
{"text":"Can I just say I don't like to give big titles to just one place, I like keeping my options open, if you know what I mean. 
But seriously, The Best Chicken Wings I've ever had. 
I keep hearing rumors on how they cook them, I try to do it myself it never comes close. 

The atmosphere is a bit too country for me, but once they have the parachute patio no one can stop me. 

Great selection of beers on tap, and always good service."}
{"text":"The Rebel House is a fine traditional Canadian style gastro -pub, conveniently located on Yonge Street south of Summerhill LCBO.
 It has a delightful sunny patio in back and is an excellent restaurant to meet friends and family for Brunch, lunch or dinner. They have great traditional Canadian cuisine featuring what has to be one of the best plates of poutine in the city of Toronto. ( Spiral cut , kettle cooked potato fries ,smothered in rich buffalo gravy with fresh Quebec cheese curds.)
 The Rebel house also features a great variety of Canadian Craft beers as well as a selection of over sixty types of Tequila, Gold, Silver and Mezcal. They make a great Bloody Caesar as well.
 The Prime Rib roast beef dinner on Sundays is a must and the traditional Ontario fruit cobblers for dessert are a perfect finish.
 Friendly and knowledgable staff make this over thirty year old Rosedale institution one of my favourite places to dine out and have a drink in Toronto."}
{"text":"Good service, knowledgeable staff on draft selection (quite good variety).  The food seemed overpriced for what it was. The club sandwich had soggy bread. It wasn't toasted enough at all. The chicken was a little dry too. The kettle fries/chips were really good and would go back for those alone. 

I enjoyed the atmosphere, nice little place around summerhill."}
{"text":"Located just north of the Rosedale station on Yonge Street, Rebel House is a good place to go if you want a beer or two and perhaps some food.  I sat upstairs for some post-dinner drinks with old buddies.  We weren't eating (except for one friend who ordered the little potato/cheese rounds which he said were good) but it looked like a good amount of people do go here for the food.

They have plenty of beer on tap... like I said it's a good place to go for beers.  It's not a bar to go for mixed drinks.  The interior is cozy and it's lively yet quiet enough to be able to conduct a conversation.  

The staff was friendly enough and weren't bothered by how little we were drinking versus how long we were there.  Although we came on a Saturday night, it didn't feel uncomfortably crowded, either. 

So if you're like me and prefer bars where you can have conversations with friends instead of shouting over loud music at potential flings, then this place is for you."}
{"text":"The food is tasty, but the service is THE slowest I've experienced in a while. A table of about 10 of us came here for lunch on a Friday; we were the only ones sitting upstairs, and it took 45 minutes after ordering for our food to come. I can't imagine how long the wait would've been if it was a full house.. 

I ordered the roasted pepper hummus and it was very flavourful. However, the so-called 'pita' bread (which resembled closer to bread sticks) was SO oily! They definitely painted a layer of oil on top to make it glisten and look all pretty.. but it was just too much. I had to major oil pat the bread which didn't make the meal as enjoyable as it could've been. But hey, I gotta take care of my arteries! Anyway, it was a good portion for one to have as a small meal or two to share as a snack, it was 7.99 before tip and tax; pretty standard pricing for downtown pub food. 

I snagged a few of the kettle chips from my friend's side order, and they were pretty dang delicious. I definitely recommend getting a side of the chips while you're here! 

I should add that this place isn't all too vegan friendly. The only vegan options really are the hummus and one of their salads. Keep that in mind :)"}
{"text":"I've lived in the neighbourhood for several years, food is still decent, but the servers can be extremely pretentious. They tend to act as though they are doing you a favour by letting you eat there. Often snarky and rude when you ask a question, and if they screw up your order, forget about getting it fixed, the waiter will scurry away from the table and not return. Also, you must order food if you want to sit at a table, even when it is not busy. Over it, will not be returning."}
{"text":"Great little neighbourhood pub that serves Canadian pub food.    Stuff like meatloaf, burgers, poutine, steak, mussels, ribs etc.  Their daily special wild game sausage appetizer is always good.  The beer selection features Ontario and Quebec microbrewies."}
{"text":"I can't help but love this place. The beer menu is extensive in both bottle and draught. In addition to having great beer, the menu is just so tasty and is everything you want while having a few drinks. While enjoying my weissbier, we tried their take on poutine and were pleasantly surprised! Here, expect kettle chips in a great savory gravy...I'll definitely be back here even if only for the poutine!

Also, if you're a group this place has plenty of seating both in and out. Come a little North of the center and check this place out!"}
{"text":"Had a really quaint and low-key Valentines Day meal here which was totally our style - great pints and some gastropub food. Enjoyed the wild sausage platter and split a club sandwich with a side of poutine. The poutine was interesting in that the potatoes were sliced very thinly - like scalloped potatoes or potato chips - before being friend and covered in the most delicious cheese and gravy. Not sure what exactly was in the gravy but it had a very vinegar-Worcestershire sauce tone to it, which I loved. Club sandwich was average. Our service was great and I found the upstairs dining room super cozy with a little fireplace. The downstairs bar area is definitely a place for regulars - well worn but welcoming. Seems like a good neighborhood place that I would visit again if staying in the Yorkville area."}
{"text":"The Rebel House has some really, really great food and it's a great spot with a lot of character and heart. 

I've been here on a few dates and I have to say, it's a great spot! Lots of good homecooked-style food like meatloaf, mac and cheese, burgers, etc. 

My favourite part about eating here is the option to get half and half with your meal - as in half fries and half salad. I always want to get fries with my food but know i should get a salad, this way I get both! The last time I was there I ordered the mac and cheese with fries and salad (not exactly the healthiest meal) but it was soo good. You could taste the home made goodness with every bite! Brunch here is also great - the Rebellion Eggs (or eggs benny) are very, very good. 

The servers are also super friendly and this is obviously a place with a lot of regulars. They also have some great microbrew beers on tap and the coffee is always fresh and refills are constant! It's a great place to go for a bite if you're in the area."}
{"text":"This place has the BEST granola!!!! So so so so perfect. Try it. Also very friendly servers :)"}
{"text":"For the coziest of comfort food in the winter, and ice cold, local beer on the back patio in the summer, the Rebel House is a great place to meet friends all year round. My favourite menu items are the Mac & Cheese (gooey and delicious) and the Grilled Cheese (so tasty!). I enjoy the laid-back ambiance of an after-work crowd  - though on warm evenings it can be hard to snag a table."}
{"text":"My friends and I went here for some drinks, and were told that, if we weren't ordering food, that we'd have to sit at a bar. We wanted a table, so we agreed to order food. So we sit down and order 3 appetisers, one for each of us, and some drinks (which is what we really came for).

The woman we had serving us was really kind and helpful. But a male staffer said that we would have to move to the bar to free up the table once we finished our appetisers. Apparently, we hadn't ordered enough food to justify our occupation of a table. As not to inconvenience them further with our patronage, we paid our bill and went to the Firkin up the street (and grudgingly left a tip for the kind woman server although the tips get pooled meaning  the rude male server would get part of it).

Bumping customers from tables is such bad business that it was used a comedic gag in Fawlty Towers. You don't kick paying customers from tables because you aren't making as much money from them as you could if a hungry family of four was at their table.

If you must move people, you ask them professionaly like others have asked me to move a few times by coming up to the table and saying \"we're really sorry, but we have a large group who needs this table. Would it be OK if we could move you to another table? Yes? Thank you so much! Let us buy you a drink or a dessert. Again, we're so sorry and thank you so much!\""}
{"text":"I like the Rebel House. The beer is cold, the food is good. It's quite small inside and I don't recommend it for business meetings as eveyone will know your busines, but it's fine for lunch or for pints. The patio is great, but again it's small."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to The Rebel House in ages until a friend of mine suggested it for a brunch spot for her and I to enjoy a delicious breakfast and a great catch-up session.

My friend and I both ordered the Tavern Breakfast and it was INCREDIBLE!

For $10.50, you get a HUGE breakfast... two eggs (any style), with your choice of sausage or bacon, plus sauteed mushrooms, roast tomato, home baked beans, toast and kettle fries!

I LOVED this breakfast and found every element to be delicious (with the exception of omitting the beans from my plate upon ordering... I am not a baked bean person).

One big food shoutout goes to Rebel House's KETTLE FRIES! They are INCREDIBLE!


Since my brunch with my friend back in January, I visited The Rebel House for the second time in 2011 just yesterday.

Together with my sister, we both ordered grilled cheese and enjoyed a delicious lunch together.

The grilled cheese sandwich was amazing, partnered with salad and kettle fries.

To finish off our meal, we ordered the sweet and melt-in-your-mouth apple and peach crumble, which was soaked with whipped cream and vanilla sauce.

All I can say is this lovely little spot is great if you are looking for great food in the Yonge and Summerhill area!"}
{"text":"We come here pretty often and the food, atmosphere, and service consistently excellent! Some of our favs include the spinach apple salad, pork loin wrapped in bacon, and their wings!"}
{"text":"Though typically choked with Yuppies (and truly, given the neighbourhood, what would you expect), this place is a treat to get to when my friends ask me to meet them there.  It's a bit out of the way for me, so I don't get there often.  When I do, it always leaves me going \"I should get up  here more often\".  But then the bill comes.

The décor is rustic and cozy, with all kinds of nooks to find yourself in deep conversation over a pint or two.  The theme here is Canadiana and it seeps through every pore of the pub.  The beer list tends towards the Ontario and Canada microbrews.  The menu reads like a checklist of items that are in season locally.  The freshness of the ingredients, the care put into the menu, and the friendly staff make it for a good evening out.  Yeah, it's a bit pricey, but you get what you pay for.  Not a regular stop for me, but definitely a treat when it happens."}
{"text":"Joint sounds like a rocker's joint - but I like this pub:
 - great atmosphere - unpretentious and welcoming
 - good local beer selection
 - right by Rosedale subway station
 - nice backyard patio
 - I didn't eat here, but the food looked pretty solid

Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"I'm into cozy bar/pub vibes and The Rebel House wins in all areas: fairly priced food, selection of great local, national or international beers, and a warm environment.

On one occasion I simply enjoyed a few pints and conversation. Great.

On another outing I had the chance to enjoy a great pasta with healthy amounts of bacon, greens, peppers and bread to soak up the amazing sauce.

Both visits were welcomed by a warm staff and great customer service.

It's a bit of a tight squeeze, but I really do enjoy the upstairs dining area."}
{"text":"I consistently hang out in \"developing\" areas of the city...     

So the second I walked in this place I was like \"WOW.  Where are the googly-eyed vagrants and degenerate sketchbags?\"

They're not to be seen anywhere.   It's like there's this invisible sonic fence around this neighborhood that keeps them out.   

A whole new world.  (Don't you dare close your eyes!) 

It's a great place to be.   Incredibly comfortable vibe.  Microbrews on tap.  Delicious pricey pub food.   No crazy homeless people trying to attack you with a hammer.     The true north (end), strong and free."}
{"text":"Nice cozy atmosphere. I don't really have anything good or bad to say about this place.

I came here with two friends for some dinner and drinks. The food was rich and hearty, but not marvelous or anything to write home about. Good portion on the food and the drinks, but may I ask why the wine came in a plastic cafeteria cup?!

Ah, and it's worth noting the poutine is made with chips instead of fries. Strange, but still filling and covered with gravy-cheese goodness."}
{"text":"Nice lunch here on Sunday afternoon. Not too busy around 1:30PM. Tried the club sandwich with a side salad which was good (although would've preferred regular bacon over peameal). Service was friendly and beers were cold. A little pricey but would definitely come back here if I'm looking for something in Rosedale - especially on a sunny day to sit on the back patio!"}
{"text":"Not your average pub! Yes, there are kitchy decorations on the walls, but the great selection of beer and delicious food. The staff was knowledgable enough to answer all the questions that we threw at them about beer list and menu. 

We had their sausage plate which featured house-made apricot pheasant sausages at the time. My dinning partner had to fight me for the last pieces of sausage...I won, of course. :) Despite the weather, I decided on the lamb stew. The lamb was tender and sufficiently lamb tasting without being overwhelming. I used the very last bit of my cornbread to mop up the last of the stew, because it's impolite to lick the bowl when in public. BTW, the cornbread was so delicious that we ordered a second helping of just cornbread and devoured it even after we had finished our main course. My friend had the steak and potatoes, and asked for it well done. Cringe! I know, that is blasphemy! However, this will tell you the quality of the cooks and beef, even with the meat being well done, it was plenty juicy and well charred. I had to sneak more than a couple of pieces."}
{"text":"We walked in at probably the least busy time on a Monday afternoon. The bar had a few customers and all the seats were completely empty. We ordered our beers and proceeded to the table. Our waitress handed out the menus and some bread for the table. Although she never came to take our food order. I made a few eye contacts and one sign to call her. She nodded and kept using her phone that was charging by the bar. She clearly was ignoring us, or simply did not want the trouble to serve us any food cuz maybe she was too lazy or she simply didn't feel like it."}
{"text":"Craft beer? Check
Unique takes on classic pub foods? Check
Awesome patio? Check Check

The beer list compared to some of the newer craft beer places in the city but (a) rebel house is an institution (b) good variety and top quality picks (love me some Mad Tom IPA) and (c) the food is fantastic.

Try their \"many cheese\" grilled cheese (with or without peameal) and yummy buttery thick cut country bread.  Kettle chips are not crunchy or greasy - with just the right amount of salt.  

Mac and cheese is another winner! definitely not the cassarole your mom used to make!

Burgers (bison always on the menu but the lamb burger is worth switching to when its available) are huge!  Bring an appetite or share with a friend. Huge value for the money right there.  

The menu is quite extensive compared to Monks Table, Beer Bistro etc...  

Ambiance is intimate and homey and the staff are not just friendly but hilarious! You can tell the people that work there love their jobs. Most (if not all) have been there for years and years. 

This place is like that favorite sweatshirt or pair of jeans that you just cant part with. You keep wearing them even when they stretch out of shape and gets some holes. Its just super comfortable and always dependable.  A solid stand-by and long lasting favorite

A real hidden gem in the center of the city. And the perfect place to while away a lazy Friday afternoon (into the evening)."}
{"text":"This is a solid choice for patio dinning just north of Bloor. The drink I had tasted like concentrated lemon juice mixed with a shot of vodka and water; cocktails don't seem to be their strength. Food is decent - even quite good - on a sliding scale of pub grub and the like. Waitstaff are keen to keep things moving along but won't put up a fight if you keep ordering drinks after dinner.

The washrooms are a little bit terrifying here.The biggest drawback: you will need to contort your body into several awkward positions before you can fit into the teensy tiny stalls. The toilets aren't attached to the floor well so take it easy, eh?"}
{"text":"I chose this spot as a mid-town meetup to have a drink with some friends of old. The atmosphere was perfect, cozy and reminiscent of the true \"locals\" I interloped upon in the UK and Ireland. However I did find the staff dimmed the mood upon arrival. Off the bat, I was told my group of 3 couldn't be seated unless we were eating as well as drinking. Meanwhile the bartender was engaged in a passive aggressive conversation to a local patron that \"SOMEONE in this bar I am TOTALLY allergic to. As soon as they walked in I just KNEW...\" Ok then. Smashing. 

To be fair, the dining area is very small with only a handful of tables. Feeling obligated to order food, we decided on appetizers, to be promptly reprimanded that those are \"only.\" appetizers. So dessert then too, which seemed to calm the beast that was our server. After all this, the food was great and whoever made the vodka and coke made it to perfection. I wouldn't recommend this spot for any group (3+) its simply too small and for me, I don't like too many rules during my play hours."}
{"text":"The Rebel House was the second stop on our pub crawl last night.

When we arrived, they weren't expecting us but were nice enough to open the back patio for us.

I never made it upstairs but the main level is small and cozy.  The patio is quite large and covered by what we suspected is a parachute.  

We were taken care of well and I'd like to go back and check it out again."}
{"text":"Good pub food. A bit greasy. And that feeling you're going to stick to everything. Really nice patio."}
{"text":"I don't know what it is about this place. I love it, but i'm not sure why.

Is it the odd atmosphere, is it the memories i've had from coming here, or is it the food? Becuase the food isn't that amazing. But it's still pretty good.
I've had almost everything on their menu and i still can't get enough of their pennies (essentially deep friend cheese with sour cream and salsa).

It's what a pub should be like. It's warm and inviting. They even have pickled eggs and mushrooms in a jar ! the only thing is - sometimes the wait can be annoying."}
{"text":"I don't recommend this place for eating. Five of us went there for dinner, ordering five different things, and every single one of us was disappointed--except for the kettle fires, which were actually good."}
{"text":"VIBE 
Same chill laid back vibe.
Got to check out their patio and it's fantastic! It reminds me of a classic Canadian backyard with blonde wood tables and a Canadian flag on the back fence. Awesome. Service is relatively quick and good. 

WE ATE/DRANK
No Heineken here. Lots of local and organic brews. Hence the Mill Street Organic.
My Dining Companion and I had the jerk and BBQ chicken wings. 
The wings were well cooked but there was no flavour on either the jerk or BBQ. Disappointing. But the portion size was good. Also, no dipping sauce for the wings! Come on! 

OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK 
These wings are not rebellious."}
{"text":"I have been a regular here for the past ten years and the only time Im disappointed is when I can't get a seat. Best selection of beer that I know of and the daily specials are always good. I especially like the meatloaf which is on the regular menu. Staff are friendly and relaxed. Seating upstairs is nicer than downstairs."}
{"text":"Service was great- start off with that because being a server myself I find myself noticing certain attributes in particulars servers. The server here flung his pen at me, which jump-started an entire evening of 'I'm-sorrys' and guilt compliments. Through which I discovered that he was much more entertaining than my date. 

Vast beer selection. Varied and delightfully palate pleasing menu. Delicious peach blackberry crumble. And a back patio for your sunshine convenience!"}
{"text":"This is probably the most polite pub in the city.  The customers all look like people who would identify themselves as \"professional\" in their singles ads.

But I really like the Rebel House.  The tap list is one of the better ones in the city, featuring a wide variety of local craft brews.  The regular menu is always accompanied by an addendum with daily specials, and I always find it hard to settle on just one item.  Service is smart and friendly and the place looks nice, to boot.

While I used to go here at least once a month with friends, we had a weird run-in with a waiter and our attendance dropped off.  He's been gone awhile, so we should probably get back into the habit.  If they went back to making their cheese pennies with the old recipe, that might happen."}
{"text":"Rebel House is definitely a couple of rungs above bar food fare.  The service is more than adequate and friendly.  The game is always on the TV.  Make sure you sit on the back patio in the summer."}
{"text":"I love this place.  Great food, large portions, and in a nice part of town.  I especially like the meatloaf and the drunken mushrooms, corn bread, and pickled beats.

It's a small place, but very cozy.  I bet if you took this place back in time and placed it in 1700 London, it would not look out of place.

Beers and wine are good too."}
{"text":"Love the back patio, especially on a chilly night when the heaters are on. Staff are really friendly. Good beer selection. Mac n Cheese was delicious. I'll be back!!!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a friendly neigbhourhood pub with lots of different beer and a well above average pub menu this is a great place. Some of the food is even really good by any standard. The patio can get crazy hot on warm summer days. Love this place.  Have been there with the kids as well, but its not an ideal place given size"}
{"text":"I was told that this place has the best poutine in Toronto, so we had to try it out.  Turns out it's a great little gastropub with great beers and great food.  We ate out on the back patio, which on a nice summer day was a nice little escape under their colorful canopy.  The poutine was terrific!"}
{"text":"They seem to be short for space no matter when you go. They like to keep the tables for customer who buy food so if you're just drinking and/or getting light appetizers, you will be sat at the bar, which is especially cramped. 

Good local/organic beer selection. The K.L.B. Raspberry Wheat and Denison's Weissbier are quite good. Pints are pretty expensive but probably competitively priced for the neighbourhood.  

The decor and space is very charming."}
{"text":"Favourite local pub/restaurant! Great menu, thoughtfully prepared home cooked food and a great draft menu. If you get anything that comes with salad or chips, get half and half - or go ALL chips, you don't want to miss out. I love the little seating area in the back but there's also an upstairs if you have a few more people in your party."}
{"text":"LOVE this place.  Great atmosphere, drinks and food.  There are always good specials and the prices are decent!  The smoked pepper hummus is UNREAL, so good. The rebel wrap with blackened chicken and grilled cheese are delicious.  Great eats at this place every time. GOOD beer list."}
{"text":"Rebel House is probably my favourite neighbourhood pub in Toronto. We've been coming here for years. Usually for brunch (peameal grilled cheese) but often for dinner as well. I was here this weekend for a quick brunch. I had an eggs benedict with chopped cod salad instead of bacon. Sounds weird but it was really good. The eggs were perfectly poached and it came with a light salad on the side

The food is not cutting edge, but it's always just really solid. The beer list is really strong. The back patio is fantastic in the summer. The service is always great. Just a comfortable experience every time."}
{"text":"This place is the epitome of comfort food. Don't come here if you're allergic to everything in the world, or if you don't eat meat, or if you're trying to be healthy. Just don't. You'll walk in, see antlers on the walls and grease stains on napkins and you'll want to run out immediately. Which is that's fine by me because then there's more space for me to relax and eat some deliciously fattening food.

Inside is super cozy and warm, and the patio is a dream in the summer. They have great burgers and poutine, delicious wings and all sorts of potato variations. They have salads and stuff, which is useful if you want to feel a bit better about eating whole animals covered in grease.

I don't remember anything about the service, meaning it couldn't have been awful. I do remember wanting to split the bill and them having no problem with it.

As for the crowd...eh. I went one time while I was at school and had a free weekday, and the place had tons of strollers and trendy moms and hearing tidbits of their conversations made me want to get my tubes tied on the spot, but I can try to ignore them and just pay attention to the delicious food.

Oh yeah, and if you're looking for cheap eats, forget about it. The place isn't crazy expensive, but it's not cheap either. I'd say it's worth it, though."}
{"text":"Tip: ask for your kettle fries cooked a little more crispy and your meal will be perfect. 

A+ grilled cheese."}
{"text":"The Rebel House has nice cozy interior and looks inviting from the exterior. Other than this, I don't have many positive things to say about my last visit.

I was here with a friend on a Sunday afternoon, around 3pm - the place itself moderately busy. We started out in the patio area (which was covered by a rain tarp), and then moved inside to start our order. I had a club sandwich with kettle chips, both of which were mediocre. My friend had a soup/pasta combo - both of which she didn't enjoy. While we didn't enjoy the food - our biggest gripe was the service.

The place was not too busy, yet we had 3 different people serving us. When the server picked up our plates, she didn't ask why she her plate was hall-filled with her pasta. The server also rushed us with the bill, even though plenty of tables were still open. 

I suggested Rebel House as a place to go, because it is located in a nice neighborhood and I previously had a more enjoyable drinks experience here on patio in the summer. I don't intend on visiting The Rebel House in the future - would only go if I wanted to have a spur of the moment drinks with a group."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday night for dinner and drinks. Although they have 2 floors, we wanted to sit at the patio.... Glad we did!

Highs: great staff ( manager kept us laughing all night), relaxed atmosphere, amazing poutine (chicken gravy and fries that are thin like chips), beautiful patio set up- feels like you are under the big top circus tent, ooh and can't forget the pickled beets!!!

Lows: bar area cramped and grungy, food was \"meh\" (had Mac n cheese and it was extremely overcooked), bathrooms in the basement.

If you are looking for a low key place in a \"newly pretentious\" neighborhood, then head on over to The Rebel House."}
{"text":"First timer. Sat upstairs, was hankering for a hearty dish. Ordered the poutine, used orange cheese and type of wine gravy. Worst off, it is served in chips. Not fries. Bad experience, should be ashamed to call it a poutine."}
{"text":"Grabbed a bite there. We missed their breakfast coz we were a bit late. That was a bummer coz I heard their breakfast is good.
Had a burger. Was good. Enjoyed it. It is a nice, cozy little place. The server was very nice as well."}
