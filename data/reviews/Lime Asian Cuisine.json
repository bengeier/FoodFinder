{"text":"Excellent pan Asian food. I don't eat pork and this restaurant has a lot of options that I normally don't get at other Asian-fusion restaurants. Particularly, the chicken wonton soup is worth a try. Flavourful and not too salty. I like their Pad Thai and chicken Stay skewers."}
{"text":"I loved eating here - The ambiance was perfect for bringing a date. My business partner and I stopped in here, intrigued by the menu. I ordered a drink (With Grey Goose and Fresh Mango Juice) - it was breath taking. I savored each sip. We ordered the Dim Sum sampler - very tasty (worst part of the meal) - The shrimp one's steamed bun was overly gooey and ripped apart even when using the fingers. Still yummy. I ordered the a beef dish with coconut and curry (Not one of the actual curries) It was perfect - the rick was sticky and the perfect vessel for accompanying the sauce to my belly. My partner order something with the phoenix bowl - ate every last bite. Really and awesome experience (Arguably the bests of 24 dining experiences in Toronto)"}
{"text":"Love this place! Friendly staffs, nice ambience, and most of the food are so delicious. My favorites are their Thai iced tea, Curry Pad Thai, and the Spicy basil fried rice. I don't really like their stir fries though."}
{"text":"The place is really good. It's clean and looks very nice. It has a good selection and everyone can chose something. I tried their lunch special which included a soup, salad and Pad Thai. The food was good and hot. The only problem was that we needed to wait a bit longer than expected. Definitely recommend the place."}
{"text":"We went to Lime a couple of times in the past 2 weeks.  The first time I had the Bangkok tofu with vegetables.  It was cool to lukewarm in temperature, so I'm guessing they didn't microwave it long enough.  The flavour was okay but somewhat bland.  Salad was limp and lacklustre.  My coworker had the green curry vegetables lunch combo and said that her dish was sub-par relative to other Thai restaurants in the city and that the veggies were lacking.  

The second time we went I ordered the yellow curry vegetables and asked for  extra veggies.  Little did I know that they were going to charge an extra $3 for the $7.95 lunch combo.  For a curry bowl that is the size of a rice bowl, $3 for extra veggies in a dish that is supposed to have vegetables in it is pretty ludicrous.  It didn't help that there was no mention of it on the menu nor by the waitress.  Though Lime has a cool modern vibe with its green and white decor, they really need to work on the food and service.  I don't appreciate businesses that like to nickel-and-dime customers and be opaque about it.  If you're in the neighbourhood, go eat at Green Papaya or Mai Thai on Yonge instead."}
{"text":"I have lived in Midtown for four years now and this is by far my fave place to eat in the area.

That atmosphere here is beautiful. Its dressy/casual and is perfect for small groups or couple.

The staff are very helpful and friendly but not at all pushy. I have never once felt rushed here, it's the complete opposite. Sometimes you have to ask for the bill and not because the wait staff are not attentive but because they let you linger over drinks (mmmm jasmine tea) long after your meal. This is one of the reasons it's a great place to meet a friend for catch up!!

The food is fantastic and very reasonably priced. One person can easily have an app, main, dessert and non alcoholic drink for under 40 bucks. I typically get either the Lime Pad Thai, Phoenix Nests or Orange Beef. For an app,  their share platter of spring and fresh rolls,  fish cakes and satay is great or my fave the soft shell crab (if it's not sold out) is amazing.  Their coconut ice is a must for dessert.

There is a paid parking lot behind the building and there is usually always a spot. Its also only a short walk from Young/Eglington station.

I'm moving soon so I won't get to visit the Lime for much longer but thought I would everyone know it's a great place and if you live  in the Young/Eglington, support an awesome local spot!!!"}
{"text":"I took my boyfriend to Lime on a Saturday night date, which turned out to be very disappointing.

The edamame was served plain with no dipping sauce.  The server obligingly brought us soy sauce & sweet spring roll sauce upon request, but it just didn't do the trick.

The deep-fried vegetable spring rolls were fine, but the same as at any Asian restaurant.

I'm a vegetarian so I ordered a dish listed under Vegetable Delight, mistakenly thinking, by the price, that it was meant as a main course.  It was called Green on Green & described as ``stir-fried seasonal asian green (sic) in ginger and garlic sauce\" which implied a mixture of vegetables.  Instead it turned out to be simply a large plate of baby bok choy in a nondescript cornstarchy sauce, with only a hint of garlic & no discernable flavour of ginger.

When I expressed surprise to the server that there were no vegetables but bok choy, she explained that if I had wanted mixed vegetables I should have ordered a different dish.  She didn't offer to replace the dish or to have more vegies added, nor had she given me any warning as to exactly what it was I was ordering..  My boyfriend & I ate about a third of it before we were all bok choy-ed out.  To satisfy my hunger I ordered a serving of plain rice & topped it with some curry sauce from my b.f.'s dish.

He said that his softshell crab tasted \"dusty\" & \"stale\", & it had probably been frozen, perhaps for a long time.  I must say that the curry sauce it was served with was very tasty & very spicy--unfortunately, too hot for his taste.  It would help if the menu indicated how spicy each dish is.

With so many Asian restaurants to choose from in this city, I will not be returning to Lime."}
{"text":"The food was amazing, very creative menu. My favourite is the House fried rice with avocado. I've taken to making my own version at home when I cant have it there.  The atmosphere and decor is great, this would be a good date restaurant. The service was very friendly and quick. Good price and close to home. Can't ask for more than that."}
{"text":"Best Thai around.

I've had the payang and massaman curry, general Sao and the chili with cashews. All delicious. Even tastes great reheated."}
{"text":"Great food, classy ambience, decent prices.  Service is good to great depending on the night."}
{"text":"The service here was great. Food came out on time. The waitress was very friendly. The atmosphere of the place was really nice. I loved the Lime theme and the lighting and decorations. But the food sucked unfortunately.

I ordered the Malaysian chicken and it was extremely dry and rubbery."}
{"text":"The place is fairly new so the installations are clan and neat. Staff is very good and attend you promptly and happy. The starters are awesome tasty and well sized. Skewers and sampler dim sum was our preference that day. Our entry choice was from the wok, too salty for my personal tasting. Fresh juices are fresh and natural. Ambient is good and enjoyable for different ages. Noisy but nice."}
{"text":"My fianc√© and I went and shared the street-style veg pad Thai and glass noodles. Great price and a great portion sizes! Don't be put off by the expensive decor look it's really a great spot for Asian cuisine!"}
{"text":"My go to place for the lunch special. You get a salad, spring roll & meal for around $11.  The food is pretty good - although after I eat it I always feel tired (MSG?). I love their soup especially the chicken w/ tom yam broth ... it has really punchy flavour and loads of veggies. I enjoy their street style pad thai, mango chicken, fried rice, general tao, & thai cashew meals. The restaurant is very white with clean lines, zen-like and relaxing. The prices are great too! One server can be rude - but the others are polite/fast with your order."}
{"text":"We went for lunch around 11:30 so it was still pretty dead inside, I imagine it probably picks up and gets busier closer to 12:30. They have amazing lunch deals that range from 8.99 to 10.99 depending on what you get but it includes a soup and an entree.

The service was not that great. There was only one other table seated at the time but the server was still slow getting the drinks and taking our order. He would stand around even though there was no one else to serve.

The wonton soup was definitely a good way to start the lunch for something warm on such a cold day. The broth itself was flavourful without being too overwhelming and the meat wonton was good as well.

 Next was the pad thai with Spring rolls and baby greens salad. My co workers had told me that their portions were small prior to going but I decided to give it a try anyways. The pad thai was more than enough and I was definitely full after the meal. The dressing on the salad was a light vinaigrette dressing that packed a lot of punch. The spring roll was generous in size and definitely fresh. It was satisfying but it wasn't the best pad thai I've had.

The Green Chicken Curry was delicious.  It had a good amount to pour over the rice.  The curry itself had a good amount of coconut milk in it and it was a bit spicy (but not too spicy) and the vegetables and chicken was cooked well. The side salad was also very good - it was fresh and the citrusy dressing went well with the curry.

It's worth a try if you're looking for a lunch spot."}
{"text":"Tasty Coconut Chicken Soup, great portion sizes, beautiful ambience and style.. This place is clean and chic.  If you go there before the sun sets, you can watch how the room slowly transforms.  I watched it go from white to a pale green... not sure if it was intended but it's the little touches of the space that makes it a great atmosphere for lunch or dinner, metal chopsticks and white plates help showcase your meal, definately helps moisten the taste buds to the art of food you are too devour.  

One thing I didn't like when I went to the bathroom they forgot to put the seats down, it would be nice not to have to touch a toilet seat, then again it shows that they do clean the toilets so I guess that's nice to know.  all in all, until I try more of the menu they get a 5/5.. will update next time I attend.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Very average. Average food, average ambiance and a little less than average service. Washroom sink supplies only a dribble of water and no paper towels or machine for hand drying. Will not return."}
{"text":"Love the food here - it's some of the best pad thai in the city, in my opinion, and the price is right. Plus they use all-rice noodles (score!) and it's across the street from me, which helps my love of the place (you can't beat good food this close to home!).

The service, however, leaves something to be desired. I love the food, but they are soooo slow, so don't come here if you're in a rush. The staff is friendly and knowledgable, but getting their attention is impossible sometimes. I will say that they were right on the ball with helping me select gluten-friendly food items and knew a lot about the sauces they used and gluten intolerances. 

As I mentioned above, they use all-rice noodles here, and I've never had a problem with gluten poisoning even though there's lots of it floating around in the kitchen in crispy, battered, soy, and other sauce form :)"}
{"text":"Their pad Thai was good, came with a chicken skewer, salad and I love how it am with a small tray of peanut sauce. Service was good, quickly refilled outer drinks."}
{"text":"The food was just so bland!

I've been intrigued by this place for ages. The minimalism decor is lovely and gives the restaurant a crisp clean feel. It seems like the kind of place where the food is foremost. Unfortunately the food had almost no taste. We ordered the Thai Chili with Cashew and the Thai Spicy Lemongrass (recommended to us over another dish because the other dish lacked any flavour apparently...it must have tasted like water). 

The one great thing about this restaurant was the Thai Sweet and Sour Soup. It was quite sweet and quite sour and the tofu in it squirted at you bit into it in the most delectable way! (I feel pretentious just using that word). Anyway, the soup was great!

Unfortunately the rest of the food was a miss for us. Too bad since this restaurant is just around the corner for me."}
{"text":"I love Asian food in general, so I went with high hopes, but their lunch specials weren't that appealing. For the price, I didn't get what I expected at all. I will have to try their dinner menu, but not a good choice for lunch."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here the other day (weekday) for lunch. Although the place looked promising the food and service failed the first impression. Here's why:

Food:
We ordered the chicken curry with rice and the pad thai with chicken and tofu along with a hot and sour soup. The soup was thick and starchy, almost like chinese style sauce. It tasted almost exclusively of ground pepper. No good. The chicken seemed chewy and must have been made in the early morning or even the day before. Previously frozen, no doubt about it. The worst was the pad thai - there was simply nothing authentic on the plate and the dreaded KETCHUP SAUCE killed the already bland dish. There were 1 inch stems of raw green onions and a small amount of peanut granules off to the side next to a jungle of lettuce (!) leafs. What a mess. 

Service:
My dish came 5 minutes before my wife's (Restaurant was only 1/3 occupied). No apology for being late. Fail. The next table from ours faired no different.

Ambience: 
Nice actually, unlike everything else during our lunch visit. 

Price: 
Affordable...sort of.

Final thoughts:

Don't waste your time here unless you insist. There are far better picks in the neighborhood. And compared to other Thai places, this one 
is average...at best. Reviewed 2010/06/01"}
{"text":"Place never seems busy, but the food is good. Solid good. I've been here half a dozen times, and the beef is always tender and delicious."}
{"text":"I generally like this restaurant, but not for the food. Nothing is authentic and depending on what night you go it can be a little better or a little worse than Spring Rolls. Fair warning: The sauce on the pad thai is the sticky sweet gloopy kind. The curries are often watered down.

BUT...

The service is always efficient and friendly. Wines by the bottle are reasonably priced and the ambiance is actually very comfortable. The minimalistic white chairs and clever lighting make this a good place to check in for a Friday night dinner with a bottle of wine after a long week at work. You'll never wait long for your food and the servers will always treat you well. Someone earlier mentioned the service was slow...I've been here more than four times over the past few years and being a server myself, I have to say that I've never felt that service was lacking or slow in any way.

Tip: When the weather is rainy, sit in the front window and do some people watching. It's not a patio, but the generous front windows allow for an ample view of passersby."}
{"text":"Pros: friendly staff, clean and stylish decor and reasonable prices. 

I had the Penang beef curry and l did enjoy it, I got the mild spiciness and it was still fairly hot. I found the amount of rice given was very small for the amount of curry received so I had to order a second bowl. 

My friend ordered the tofu pad Thai and was very unimpressed with it, and I tried some of hers and agreed. The texture was rather slimy and the sauce wasn't particularly flavourful. 

Would probably return because of the price and they did have quite a large menu so it would be worth trying other items."}
{"text":"My vegetarian fianc√© and I (a meat eater) love Lime! We probably went a dozen times in the past year. They do tofu really well - so much flavour! The curries are always our favourites, but you can't really go wrong with any item on this menu (as far as we've tried, at least!)

Portion sizes are just perfect for me (not huge, so no leftovers), and the prices are very good."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our experience at Lime restaurant. We were a party of four dining on Saturday night, and all of us were impressed with our meals. I had the Malasian Grilled Chicken, and the presentation of this $13.95 dish was simply outstanding. Service was quick and attentive and the dining room is very well presented. We'll be back, soon!"}
{"text":"We used to come here a lot for lunch. The restaurant is nicely decorated and the service is great.

The food leaves a lot to be desired. The lunch specials are diverse and very inexpensive, but the food actually isn't very good. It used to be okay, but now it's pretty bland."}
{"text":"First review!


A very romantic and ambient setting, the music in the background makes it seem like you are somewhere else, and it's not loud so you can hear the other person talk. 

The food was just amazing, we started with dim sums for appetizers and they were so yum! I ordered the seafood special, I believe it had shrimp, calamari and scallops, and they were all fried. Just amazing! He ordered the chicken with mushrooms, also very good. Definitely recommend this place for a date, or even for a get together with your friends...not a place to be very loud though so maybe not a big birthday party or anything. Hope this helps :)"}
{"text":"THE FOOD- I went to Lime for lunch last week. I'd been craving Pad Thai for weeks, so ordered the chicken Pad Thai combo. The Tom Yum soup was flavorful but came to the table lukewarm. My friend ordered the General Tao's tofu fries off the dinner menu. They were interesting and had good flavour to them and I liked the matchsticks of cucumbers on them for contrast. The Pad Thai was disappointing, it was really just a pile of flavorless, oily rice noodles with a few pieces of dry chicken and fried tofu. Both the spring roll & salad were ok but nothing special.

THE SPACE- The space has a calm, crisp and airy vibe to it which I liked.

THE SERVICE- The servers were helpful with our requests however were sometimes hard to flag down despite the restaurant only being half full.

Overall don't plan to go back. There's too much reliably delicious Thai food in this city!"}
{"text":"Nice setting
Get the deep fried banana for dessert 
Veggie platter excellent
Many of the veggie dishes contain oyster sauce
Some difficulties explaining vegetarian restrictions."}
{"text":"If in search of a more authentic experience, Lime Asian Cuisine is a good place to start. They focus on re-creating traditional recipes but giving them a creative twist by introducing local ingredients to execute the exotic flavours. 

Portion size is generous--my friend was wowed by the size of the calamari (her: \"These are, like, big pieces of squid. You know how you can normally just put it in your mouth? I'm going to have to cut all this before it fits....\" Haha).  The degree of spiciness can be tailored to suit more conservative palettes. Even as a non-meat eater, the mango chicken in phoenix nest looked delicious. 

The d√©cor is clean and spare. Soft backlighting infuses the place with warmth while the rich flavours linger in the air."}
{"text":"Came here during lunch and was not displeased.
The lunch specials include a variety of dishes along with a side salad, spring roll, and soup.
I had the \"Street Style Pad Thai\" which is a tamarind and soy sauce blend instead of the tamarind and tomato (aka ketchup) version that is the standard Canadian version of pad thai.
It was good and being a lunch portion with the side dishes I was happy. Bonus points to the fact that they bring out proper chili paste, and not just a bottled hot sauce.

We fed 3 people for $41 post-tax pre-tip which we were happy with. 
We were in and out in less than 45 minutes, so from a service perspective it delivered what we needed it to. 

While I'm not going to rave and say this is the best thai food in the city, it seems like a reasonably safe bet in an area without many thai food alternatives. So 4 stars seems appropriate."}
{"text":"Hmm....not my favourite.  The place was nice with the decor and seating but I wouldn't rave about the food.

Food: 2/5, I got the classic pad Thai with vegetables.  It was just really sweet and not much veggies - a couple of small tofu pieces and one brocolli and few carrots. It did come with salad but I can see why since the salad bowl takes almost half of the plate.

Service: 2/5, not much other than bringing food.

Ambience: 3/5, nicely decorated but food must come first.

Price: 2/5, not sure if $15 person is worth it vs. Star King or Hosu on yonge.  I think I will return to Star King for pad Thai."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the whitest Asian cuisines I've ever been to. I thought this place would be really great, from seeing the nice sign and the clean interior AND seeing as it is run by asians. 

The service was quick, not particularly too friendly and the food came even quicker but I was not impressed. The ginger tea I ordered (I was feeling sick and ginger soothes a nauseous tummy #protip) came in an extremely small teapot, smaller than the actual cups of water we received. Also, most places offer free refills on tea because the tea bag is still inside & all they have to do is fill up hot water. However, it was strictly only steeped ginger tea and even though it was only about $2, I wasn't impressed. The coconut chicken soup was milky and tasty, but super oily.. I also ordered the fusion chicken mango salad, which was indeed tasty and tangy. My boyfriend ordered the pad thai with chicken, which he found to be extremely heavy. The food tastes as though a Caucasian person was dared to create an authentic asian meal only with the help of YouTube & without ever having tasted it themselves. Honestly felt like it was Thai express to me..But maybe it's because I expected too much.

Prices are not bad but the portions are pretty small for the most part. I wouldn't make a promise to come back here in the future."}
{"text":"Ok so 2 stars for food/drink but 5 stars for ambiance and service.

Let's get the bad out of the way first.  Ordered edamame and spicy crispy  tofu frites to start.  Well edamame you can't screw up so that was ok.   But there is nothing spicy or particularly tasty about the tofu frites.  Big fail.  

The drinks while ok are..tiny.  Not worth the price of about $7.50.

I chose the thai red curry with the jasmine rice and my friend has the mango chicken dish.  Both were ok, portion size was decent.  The prices for the food were surprisingly good, especially compared to drink prices

On to the good.  This place is deceptively large and looks so fancy! But it has a really nice laid back vibe.  All the servers are super friendly but in a genuine way.  Different servers would check in with us if we wanted anything else and always made sure our water was filled.  They do takeout as well as we saw several people come in to pick up orders so the food must be good but maybe we just chose wrong.

I will give this place another shot based on the service and all the people I saw picking up food."}
{"text":"Food was disappointing. Mostly tasteless stir-fry.

\"Steamed vermicelli\" on the side was more like boiled, way too soft, big fat noodles, not delicate, very soggy.

Not nearly as good as Spring Rolls which used to exist in this area."}
{"text":"Solid delivery Thai food....so far they're two for two--we ordered twice, we enjoyed everything twice. Also, both times our order arrived in 30 minutes or less (despite being told it would take an hour.)

After one too many horrible delivery orders from Spring Rolls (*shudder*) I think I've finally found my go-to Thai delivery place. (Note: Sorn Thai at Yonge & St Clements is also very good).

So far we've tried:

*Veg spring rolls - giant and delicious
*Lime's famous street-style pad thai - awesome 
*Lettuce wraps - huge, crispy lettuce leaves are packed separately; fill a leaf with some hoison sauce and a giant scoop of the minced chicken/veg/crispy rice concoction. Yum. Tip: ask for extra Hoisin.
*Spicy lemongrass chicken - nice
*Crispy orange beef - love it
*Coconut sticky rice - classic

Probably not 100% authentic Thai lol...but still.....all good baby!"}
{"text":"Love the food there! Got the chicken mango dish twice because it's so good. The waiters are really nice and the atmosphere makes you feel calm and relax."}
{"text":"I go there for a short selection of dishes that I love, the rest is mehh. Service is generally good though."}
{"text":"We were looking for somewhere close and easy for a New Year's Day dinner and decided it might be a good idea to finally give Lime Asian Cuisine a try.

They have a pretty extensive menu, but one of the Specials was the Thai Massaman Curry (\"lightly spiced with creamy coconut milk. a savory and very aromatic curry\") with flank steak, Thai Mango Salad (\"fresh mango, green apple, red onions, carrots, red peppers, fresh mints & ground cashew nuts\"), and Ginger Sticky Rice.

Everything arrived on a single plate and I'll admit the presentation was pretty impressive. (The Sticky Rice even came packed in a banana leaf.) But one bite told me that appearance isn't everything. The curry itself was mild to the point of tastelessness, while the meat was tough and chewy. (And making matters worse, I had asked for the dish extra spicy, but the waitress evidently took that to mean zero spice whatsoever.)

The salad and rice were fine, but that curry... What a disaster.

We also ordered a veggie version of their Classic Pad Thai (\"stir-fried rice noodles in tomato tamarind sauce with ground peanuts\") and this was just about the worst version of this dish I can recall eating. Bland and tasteless, the dish was overly sweet and was simply an incompetent variation on Pad Thai.

There are so many Thai joints in this neck of the woods it's frankly shocking that Lime has managed to stay open this long, if this is the overall calibre of their food."}
{"text":"I'm a frequent Lime diner, partly because I live around the corner and partly because the dollar value and flavour can't be beat within walking distance.

Decor: Don't be put off by the fancier looking exterior! It looks much more expensive than it really is. 

Price: Each dish is fairly average, $12-15. 

Meals: So far, I've tried the spicy eggplant, cold spring rolls, chicken spring rolls, all three pad thais (red, yellow, green), the pad thai, massamam curry, spicy orange beef (satay), the lemongrass chicken, the street noodle bowls, and most of the vegetable dishes. Needless to say, I'm a fan. I'll admit that it's perhaps not the most authentic flavouring as other reviewers have also said, but I find that the strong and delicious flavours more than makes up for it. And again, for a cheaper price point, I think it surpasses expectations. The curries are spicy, the vegetables are always really delicious, and the spicy eggplant is a great hearty dish even if you want a vegetarian option. The street noodle bowls are HUGE. You could definitely get away with sharing it, or taking half home for a meal later. They're stuffed with veggies, noodles, and the chicken/beef/tofu of your choice and it hits the spot every time. 

Service: Hit or miss. There's been a few busier evenings where I've had to flag down the waitress/waiter, but for the most part I've felt well attended to. There's also been a few instances where they've had to bring a second wait staff over to clarify whether something had oyster sauce (I'm allergic), but I'd rather get clarification than, you  know, die.

Ambience: Casual, trendy, and fun. I've come here with smaller groups, one on one, and with a picky family member - and I've yet to hear complaints. 


Overall, for the price, location, and warm flavourful dishes, Lime is one of my favourite midtown spots when my asian food craving hits."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Lime several times and I think they make the best Pad Thai in Toronto. The food is always fresh and tasty and service is very good. The mango salad is delicious."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.This place gives you a very calm and fresh feeling with the modern and simple decor. Th service was extremely friendly and welcoming, as well as helpful. It is ideal for a nice quiet dinner with friends, family or for a date. The way the plate the food is very pleasing so it's perfect for us yelpers or foodies to take pictures! This place offers vietnamese and thai dishes with a small modern twist to it. If you're looking for authentic... Then keep looking. 

What I Ordered:

Vietnamese chicken wonton soup: 
The soup base was good tasty and seasoned well but I wasn't a big fan of the chicken wonton. The filling was really rough and dry. The veggies were probably cooked separately and then put into the soup because the soup had no mushroom or bok-choy taste to it at all.

Street style Pad-thai with chicken skewers:
The chicken skewers were marinated and grilled to perfection. It was not dry which was kinda surprising. The pad thai was also seasoned well but the texture of the noodle was a little weird. But I love how it came with a mango salad and sauces on the side. 

Malaysian marinated Chicken: 
It's a piece of chicken breast that literally the size of my face on top of veggies and rice with sauces on the side. This chicken was also marinated very well and texture was very juicy and tender. I believe this chicken breast was also grilled. Definitely ordering again next time i drop by."}
{"text":"Lime Asian Cuisine is my new favourite place for Thai.  This little restaurant is a 10-minute walk east of Eglinton Station and is close the Dunfield Club, owned by Extreme Fitness.

The owners put a lot of thought into the interior, made to look very chic without being intimidating.  Cream-coloured vinyl seats, floor-to-ceiling glass front, wood decor - it feels almost like a lounge.  A plethora of wines line the walls behind the cashier's desk at the rear, so it wouldn't be a bad place for a date either!

The service was cordial but a little impersonal.  Janet's review of the service is rather harsh as it's no surprise when it comes to Chinese-run businesses, but I honestly believe that most of the staff here are just shy.  During my visit, a waiter accidentally spilled water on a nearby customer, but I was impressed with how well he handled the situation.  He offered some sort of compensation but the customer said that it was alright.  Nobody was upset and it was apparent that the couple would visit again in the future.

There are lots of vegetarian options here and the last page of the menu is devoted to the herbivore.  Some of the selections include basil eggplant and fried tofu and cashews.  The vegetarian appetizer - at $12.95 - is ginormous enough as an entree for an individual or a snack for three people.  The springs rolls are fresh and generously packed with vegetables, while the fried tofu and peanut sauce will have you asking for more.

My personal favourite was the tom yum soup (a small bowl costs $3.95) and hit the spot on a cold rainy night.  The Penang curry, complimented with ginger sticky rice, made my feet curl and was recommended as a chef's special.  The spices left my lips buzzing for a bit!

A great little spot that seems to be a secret to the locals. During the hour and a half I was here on a Sunday night, there were probably half a dozen people who came in for take-out!  Definitely coming back for more!"}
{"text":"Everytime I go to Lime it's always quick friendly service and the food is consistent and very tasty. Bring cash because it's cheaper. Recommend highly"}
{"text":"Lime is a fabulous restaurant with a very calm and welcoming environment as a result of friendly staff and tasteful decorations. The food is very reasonably priced and the dishes are fantastic. 

My experience: I am not normally an advocate of generally Tao chicken, but it's a staple for my boyfriend. He ordered a plate of it and my goodness, it was the best general Tao I have ever had. Certainly recommended and we will be back. 

While the atmosphere appears ritzy and expensive, when the bill came we were pleasantly surprised. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The tom khai soup was lukewarm and the bamboo and chicken plastic-y. The server forgot about our table of two, and our casual lunch ended up lasting about 2 hours. The curry was sickly sweet-- really odd. There is way too much selection in Toronto and even on Eglinton to ever come back here."}
{"text":"Food was FABULOUS
SERVICE WAS SH*T. understaffed, and reallly really slow with only one waitress working and the place was almost full. - maybe they underestimated a wed nite?! either way, i don't believe just bringing your food to the table counts as \"service\"
so back to the food! because nothing else can be said about the service -

AMAZING PANANG CURRY with ginger sticky rice -- yum
(the chicken was tender, that sauce was rich...)
Green Curry -- good -- 
Chicken Satay App -- good --
Mango Salad -- ok, a bit on the sour side, and portion's too big
Fried Banana w/ Vanilla ice cream -- goood.

great portion sizes with the entrees, awesome if you each order something if you go with someone and share.

we ordered some pretty standard stuff, since we went in search for yummy curry in the city.
and also because the menu is a bit confusing when you first glance at it, as in -- you're not sure which culture they're referencing with each dish, there are things like vietnamese style pho, and then there's malaysian style, thai style... etc. to cover the pan asian flavours -- but i guess they're trying to hit a broader market in toronto since it's pretty hard to find a JUST THAI food place in T.O. they are rare.
so with that being said,

one of the better places around to get come good thai style curry if you're not in a hurry or don't care about crappy service. :)"}
{"text":"The service was quick and friendly. The Thai curry was delicious. The presentation of the rice in banana leaves was very cute. You have to ask for it if you want it as it's not on the curry menu. Everything was quite good."}
{"text":"Love it! Its the best value for an Asian place in the neighbourhood. 20$pp (no drinks)

Ive been here a few times and it never fails. It has a very good ambience, good service and great food. Last time I went we were 5 people, ordered 6 entrees to share and coconut chicken soup. Everything was great! I highly recommend it"}
{"text":"This location is similar to the one on Yonge street and has the same menu. It's relatively accessible with no stairs, you just have to get through two doors at the entrance. The restaurant is well designed and modern looking. The service was good but not as good as the Yonge street location. I ordered the Beef Fusion: grilled satay beef tenderloin with mango salad. It was good and authentic, no iceberg lettuce here."}
{"text":"MY FAVOURITE Thai Place. Too bad I don't live closer. Peanut Chicken is amazing."}
{"text":"Your typical \"pan-asian\" cuisine that started with the Spring Rolls phenomenon.
Food quality and taste is not very exciting, but somewhat edible, while decor is bright, clean, and very modern.

We had:
- Edamame: 3/5 - edible but not salt
- Deep Fried Spring Roll: 4/5 - pretty good actually
- Gyoza: 3/5 - pretty bland
- Spicy Thai lemongrass chicken: 2/5 - taste like something that comes out of fake/white chinese food. not spicy, no lemon grass favour, lacks in meat, filled with peppers and onions. Rice is extra
- Pad Thai: 3/5 bland

Service was great. Price was on the expensive side ($11.95 for the chicken, extra $2 for the rice). Edible, but not recommended."}
{"text":"I mainly like this place because of its ambience and service. One of the girls is chatty and helpful and started recognizing us after our first visit. The food is hit and miss - sometimes good, sometimes average. I have never got bad food here, but sometimes get average food. One time the beans in the chicken dish were tasting very raw, but that is my worst experience with the food."}
{"text":"The service is terrible! I called for delivery the women on the phone was so rude! I asked about a dish and she suggested something else cause if I don't like THEY WON\"T TAKE IT BACK! Bad service all around won't go back!!"}
{"text":"This was definitely a Thai fusion. When massaman curry, pad see euw, pad kee mao, and Tom kha soup are absent a menu but there a tons of other options available makes it clear they are filling the menu with lots of other fusion options. We went for lunch and got the combos and I ordered the spicy basil pad thai. I've never had such a thing. While yummy, just wanted some of my traditional favs. The spring roll was my fav thing on the plate. Great filling to wrapper ratio. Noodles needed to be saucier and the salad was completely forgettable. Glad they had some unfiltered sake on hand. It was good. But nothing worth raving about."}
{"text":"Did a take out and it was alright. Not a big fan. Moderately priced. Convenient location."}
{"text":"It looks amazing. It smells amazing. It feels amazing, But damn the food is not so great. 

I was pleasantly surprised with how clean the restaurant is, especially since the area is mildly deserted and run down. The decor makes it seem like a VERY expensive restaurant, but most dishes are priced $10 - $20. Lunch specials even come with a small side or two.

I ordered the Chicken Asian Noodle Soup with Chicken and my friend ordered Beef Friend Rice.

The beef fried rice had very small portion of meat. It was kind of sad. Just slivers of beef amongst large piles of onions and scallions. There wasn't even that much rice. 

The noodles on the other hand were pretty standard. The noodles seemed to be the same noodles as that of Thai Express, but the broth is really something else. It's not very flavourful, but it did taste very clean. The dish came with a decent serving of chicken, but it tasted kind of off. Again, similar to the weird chunks you would get at Thai Express or Teriyaki Experience. This dish just tasted really bland and healthy... if that's the type of food you are going for... go for it?!

I also can't help but notice that all the vegetables in their dishes are really raw... Asian cuisine is supposed to involve cooked vegetables, but most of the onions, red peppers, even bok choy was really crunchy and not cooked through. It was not a pleasant taste.

I do have to give Lime credit for their excellent service though. The waitress was very patient with us, and frequently came to check up on us and pour us water.

Man, if this place had good food, it would honestly be perfect..."}
{"text":"Tasty asian cousine and luxurious interior.
Its close to my house and it was my replacement for spring rolls.
But I found a 5 mm long piece of metal in my meal and they still charged for my bowl of rice. (Not that money was a concern). Their nonchalant attitude wasn't helping. 
I could've hurt myself if I swallowed it.
It scares me and I will not be able to go here again. Such a shame."}
