{"text":"We were visiting from the US and after a week exploring Montreal and it's french cuisine by accident found this gem called Spanel. The chef and owner is very friendly and an amazing chef. Simply if you want the real french onion soup- go there, if you want gourmet food - go there. Everything we tried was made to perfection. The owner recommended a crepe with bacon, cheese, caremilized onions and green apple. If you are a food fanatic as us you'll be exstatic from the combination. Very clean place , also has a garden for the summer. Thank you for the real french food."}
{"text":"Found purely by accident, since then every Sunday I am in Montreal breakfast is there, great service by Audrey Hepburn lookalike, food is incredible, tasty, fresh, and they will mix and match. I usually go for the savory special. Again a great place for a lazy Sunday b'fast."}
{"text":"Having brunch with my beautiful wife at Spanel and enjoying their amazing crepes with fresh squeezed orange juice. Try the mile-end crepe. It's fantastic!"}
{"text":"One last stop before leaving Montreal, and I'm glad we did it! I had a delicious galette with Emanthal and caramelized apples. Next time we visit, we will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"First time using the Yelp app to find something that was \"healthy\" and very close to me for my lunch as I was in a hurry. Enter Spanel with great reviews and only 0.2 km away...I had heard of the place but didn't know they offered wraps for lunch which is exactly what I was craving. I got the chicken, pesto, spinach & goat cheese wrap and wow! I got to see the chef make my meal right in front of me which made me anxious to get back to the office to eat. Took me all off 4 minutes to finish my wrap! It was delicious and came with a fresh salad which satisfied what little hunger I had left. Happy I found this spot so close to work and can easily become a regular."}
{"text":"Very good crepes place. Good service. Authentic taste from Brittany. Just extended the menu in the last coupe of weeks."}
{"text":"Really wanted to like this spot. We tried it a second time after not feeling so well the first time. This time though, our waiter had absolutely no idea what to do. Unfortunate, cause the place is really cute looking and the concept seems nice. Coffees were cold, the water was absolutely gross. The food itself was passable. Way too much bacon on everything, kind of overcompensating for the lack of service maybe. Croissant was good. Both of us had a stomach ache afterwards. Overall, definitely won't be going back."}
{"text":"J'ai été le temps d'un café et puis j'y ai pris un muffin fait maison. Le service était vraiment bien j'ai adorée discuter le matin ça fait toujours du bien en se levant."}
{"text":"We walked in and were embraced with warm and delicious aromas. I ordered the Le petite italienne (goat cheese, arugula, prosciutto, & sundried tomatoes) and my husband ordered the Westmount (with duck confit, mushrooms, caramelized onions) They would have been perfect but they were so salty I couldn't finish mine. We both left disappointed. The salty flavour was from prosciutto ham and the duck and needed balancing with something else...I lived in Paris for 2 years and had some of the best galettes and crepes. Great ambience and good gluten free options but reduce the sodium content please! We'll give it another try for the crepes desserts."}
{"text":"The quality of ingredients used in their excellent galettes is admirable. My Savoyarde was stuffed with lardons, ratte potatoes and oozy raclette, and a companion's shredded duck and roast onions was full of savour (my thesaurus is overheating). Add nice service, gentle pricing and a funky interior and Spanel is an unqualified success."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast. Crepes to satisfy any taste. Try the caramelised apples and emmental. Better than you think!"}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant qui ouvre le soir l'été. Très belle terrasse à l'arrière dans un cadre féérique et intime. La nourriture est très délicieuse autant les galettes salées que les crêpes sucrées. La crêpe tatin est à tomber. J'avais déjà testé plusieurs crêperies à Montréal mais aussi en France, mais celle-ci sort du lot et est un véritable coup de coeur. Très belle expérience à recommander."}
{"text":"Awesome menu with many different favors. This great for the gluten free person. They flipped it the other way and created a small section in the menu for crepes WITH gluten as the exception. I had the Latin Quartier, a savory crepe with cheese, bacon, sausage and ham. It was enormous-enough for two. Coffee and tea are good quality as well."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed having lunch here. Quiet spot, staff are friendly and attentive. The brewed coffee is excellent - regretting that I didn't order any espresso. The savoury crepes come out crispy at the edges, soft and warm at the centre. The Mile End was so good - cheddar, mushrooms, spinach and egg. We also ordered an apple caramel sweet crepe to share, but think I enjoyed the savoury one more. Definitely coming back when next in Montreal."}
{"text":"Crepes were really good!!! Portions were larger than I expected which was a pleasant surprise. I would recommend this place to all my friends and will definitely bring out of town guests here for brunch, dessert, or even an afternoon tea/snack. Servers were also friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"Perfect spot for Sunday brunch with friends.  Lovely tree covered terrasse in the back, perfectly prepared buckwheat crepes, attentive service and good coffee. My Westmount crepe filled with roasted duck breast and potatoes fried in duck fat, carmelized onions - well, I was good for the day. Very delicious. My dining companions enjoyed the Ville Marie crepes filled with spinach, cheese and eggs. The croque monsieurs also good. Definitely will return."}
{"text":"Derrière un petit bar, il se trouve 3 grosses plaques de cuisines . Vous savez les plaques larges sur lesquelles on fait des crêpes...crêpes immenses à la française ? Voila c'est sa. Et le Chef, un monsieur que mon amie et moi trouvions bien jovial et en amour avec son art - cuisine tout sur ces plaques . Il y cuit les crêpes, les ufs, la viande, les légumes et il le fait seul et c'est bon ! 

Parlons toute de suite du plus important : À chaque bouchée de la  ''Crêpe galette'' , on sent une fraîcheur des ingrédients qui nous pousse un peu à fermer les yeux pour mieux goûter au plat. Lorsque cela arrive, on réalise très vite qu'on deviendra bien entendu une habitué des lieux même si on vit à l'opposé de la ville . ( Je le rajoute d'ailleurs a mes favoris )

Ensuite pour reprendre un peu les mots du restaurant , ces crêpes sont au sarrazin,  biologiques, sans-gluten et sans lactose  - Et laissez-moi vous dire que ceci se sent, d'un goût subtile , elles sont  BONNES ( un peu trop salées peut-être à cause du sarrazin mais néanmoins BONNES  ). Un autre élément unique a cet endroit est le nom que porte chaque plat . En effet chaque type de galettes porte un nom de quartier montréalais , par exemple moi j'ai pris le Mile-end  et mon amie elle,  a choisie Homa . Vous avez aussi  le Westmount avec du canard effiloché ,  le Saint Henri avec des pommes caramélisés ( MIAM ) et bien d'autres choix . La mienne était remplie de 3 de mes aliments favoris :  Champignons ,  épinard , ufs brouillés et fromage.  Simple mais délicieux et j'en rêve encore !

Les seuls points qui m'ont un peu dérangée étaient l'attente ou plutôt l'endroit ou on a dû attendre : À l'entrée étroite , à l'intérieur.  On était en sandwich entre les tables et le bar  - pouvant admirer juste sous notre nez les odeurs et le plats des autres - pas très amusant lorsqu'on est affamé  LOL . En outre, notre attente a aussi était un peu longue que ce soit pour se faire installer ou pour recevoir notre plat - Mais d'après moi , Spanel mise plus sur la Qualité de la nourriture que sur la rapidité du service. Et si je dois choisir, je vais avec la qualité avant tout. Je recommande donc fortement d'essayer ce resto .

D'autres points intéressant :

- Le resto se trouve pas si loin du marché Atwater et de boutiques style ''vintage '', parfait pour passer une belle journée ensoleillée à se promener.
- Ils indiquent justement,  qu'ils s'y s'approvisionnent pour des ingrédients frais et santé.
- Vous avez aussi le choix de prendre un simple brunch déjeuner classique avec oeuf, patates, viandes, fruits...ect 
- Last but definitely not least, n'oublions pas les fameuses crêpes sucrées notamment celle avec du caramel au beurre salé et crème fouetté #NoComment"}
{"text":"Great spot, terrific service. High quality ingredients and lots of choices. The savory crepes are huge and full of delicious flavors. They also made me a custom smoothie to take with me. Nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"J'aimerais bien y aller mais ils ne sont pas ouvert le soir. :-("}
{"text":"Très bons déjeuners, les crêpes sont excellentes, l'ambiance est bonne et la terrasse qui es situé dans le cour arrière est très biens."}
{"text":"De bonnes vraies crêpes à Montréal! Le chef est génial, aime ce qu'il fait et le partage  j'y retournerai sans hésiter."}
{"text":"Cozy place.
Food was good, but not excellent.
Service was really slow. We had to ask 3 times for clean glass of water. 
Good experience, but I do not think I am going to come back."}
{"text":"Amazing!! Delicious sweet and savory crepes!! Service was just as great as well as the environment."}
{"text":"I really loved the food and ambiance of this restaurant at my first visit. The only thing that kept it from being 5 stars was flaky service. My brunch mates had been here before and said it was unusual so I'm chalking it up to an off-day. 
The drip coffee is included in the price of the meal and you get a little mason jar of fruit along with your crepe. 
With a gluten-free, buckwheat-based crepe, I had The Italian which contained prosciutto, goat cheese, spinach, and sun-dried tomatoes. There was a balsamic glaze drizzled on top, which put it over the edge of deliciousness. Creamy, salty, a little sweet - it was amazing. The drip coffee came with a little carafe of steamed milk, which is a nice touch. I sat right by the terrace so I got a nice view, I could easily spend a few hours there just sipping coffee and relaxing."}
{"text":"Amazing Crepes Bretonnes, if you are seated at the bar, you will even see them cooking it for you."}
{"text":"I believe my actual quote was, \"I didn't know crêpes could be this good.\" 

And I know that sounds cheesy, but it's true. This is way beyond anything I've ever experienced as a crêpe, this side of Bretagne. I had the Mile End and it was perfect. Chock full of spinach and mushrooms and gooey with melted cheddar cheese.

My husband had a breakfast plate involving some delicious sausage and - of course, my test for every brunch spot - really good potatoes. And it came with a locally sourced croissant.

As with all places that get my 5-star seal of approval, it was the little touches that made the difference. The fruit salad is not some kind of throwaway garnish. It's an actual fruit salad, with perfectly ripe fruit. The kind you want to eat (the kind that is not two pieces of pale cantaloupe and a cube of watermelon). And the coffee was great as well.

The ambiance is awesome, although, on a hot summer day, you may end up waiting on a terrasse spot because it's just too hot inside. Know that. And know that it's worth the wait. I can't wait to come back for a cozy winter lunch indoors and sit right next to the steamy hot crêpe pans that are openly on display.

Oh, and the service was really good too. Usually when I walk in and see a bunch of early-twenty-somethings I get nervous, but they were super attentive and clearly well-trained by the management."}
{"text":"I don't like overselling places, but I can't find much wrong with this amazing place. 

When you first walk-in, it comes off as small or cozy. Luckily there is another room at the back, because this place is too good not to be popular. 

Purely by accident, my girlfriend and I stumbled across Spanel when looking for another restaurant for breakfast/brunch. We rolled the dice, walked in and fell in love. We sat at the bar area, which gives you a first-hand view of how their delicious crepes are made. Prepare to drool as you see these delicious creations come together right in front of you.

We went the savoury route, me having the \"Quartier Latin\" which is a crepe stuffed with various meats, emmental cheese and lots of love. My lovely girlfriend went for the \"West Mount\" which was made-up of duck confit, mushrooms and all sorts of awesome.

At first we thought the service was a bit slow, but after overhearing a conversation it turned out they were short-staffed that day. Still, as soon as the staff realized we were waiting to order and had been for a few minutes, they were more than helpful and punctual. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt on this one.

The details are what make a restaurant something special, and I think the warmed milk/cream they serve even with their brewed coffee is exactly that - a small detail that puts them one rung higher on the ladder than the competition. They have a full espresso and specialty coffee bar, too, if you're looking for something specific.

We didn't try the sweet crepes they offer that day, but I can tell you this: the next time I'm in Montreal I will be back and I will make a mockery of myself stuffing myself with crepes of all types."}
{"text":"Amazing crepes! Really nice set up at this restaurant where you can sit by the bar and watch all crepes being made from scratch. Gluten free and vegan options available - great for a Sunday brunch date."}
{"text":"Crepes, such a finicky repast to get right. Spanel does it right, and how. The quality of the food is top drawer. Bechamel sauce can be the downfall of many a dish but theirs was about as perfect as it gets. The chef is from Breton and brings an authentic touch that has been sorely lacking in Montreal. Finding Far Breton on the menu was an unexpected treat. The crèpes salées feature a mix of flours that it just what the dishes call for. A complete surprise was the side salad. He makes his vinagrette with a secret ingredient (I won't give it away-try to figure it out) and the salad is tossed with it just before service. It looked to be a bit much but it is incredibly light and allowed the flavour of the greens to come through. The real 'oh wow' moment though was the Crème de citron dessert crepe. He makes his own lemon cream and it is worth every penny and every delicious bite. This place is very new (only open 9 weeks as of November 9th) and they're mostly busy at noon and for brunch. They are looking to have more people in the evenings and hopefully they will be able to expand their evening menu beyond crepes to attract a wider clientele base.  At time of writing their wine list is North American (more surprises) but the prices are amazingly affordable. If you are in the mood for crepes I definitely recommend giving them a try."}
{"text":"We sat on the terrace for a weekday brunch. It was quiet and sunny. I ordered the La Petite Italie crêpe, which was fantastic. Each ingredient was individually delicious, particularly the chèvre, and overall the meal was very good. Coffee was pretty great, as well. Not particularly expensive, they could have charged more and it still would have easily been worth it. Would love to return someday!"}
{"text":"Lovely spot in Little Burgundy  serving a multitude of buckwheat crepes from sweet to savory, each named after a borough in Montreal. We sat on the terasse in the back of the restaurant providing plenty of greenery and umbrellas for shade, and away from the hustle of busy Notre Dame Street. 
I opted for the Little Burgundy crepe, chosen purely cause I couldn't decide from all the yummy choices and as hommage to the neighbourhood i was grubbing in; bacon, cheddar, spinach, apples and onions stuffed my perfectly made crepe  or rather \"galette\". Delicious and perfectly portioned, served with coffee and fruit for brunch. Washed it down with a kir breton, cider with crème de cassis, which was perfect! Overrall, an affordable and great spot for yummy brunch on busy Notre Dame Street."}
{"text":"I loved my first experience at Spanel so for my birthday lunch, I wanted to treat myself at Spanel.  My friend however, picked up the bill so that was a double treat :)  We both ordered the midi express served Monday to Friday 11am to 2pm; which was soup of the day, choice of VERDUN, ST-HENRI or VILLE-MARIE crepes. We both went for the St-Henri cause apples and Swiss cheese com'on!! It also comes with a small salad.  Because it was my bday, they gave me a small slice of this crepe-choco layered cake/pie?  Good thing it was a small slice cause between 2 people we just finished it as it was quite rich and chocolately.  This is officially my go-to crepe place.  Everything is done just right and the service is friendly."}
{"text":"Spanel was a wonderful place for an unexpected meal! We found it just walking by and decided to stop in. Everything on the menu looked great, I wanted to try it all! The crepes were delicious and the soup was fantastic as well. The chef (owner?) and waiter were wonderfully welcoming and accommodating. They even made a special meal for my friend who is a vegan, and she said it was delicious. I would definitely recommend this place to people looking for a fun meal in Montreal."}
{"text":"Probably the worst service I've ever had. We waited 15 minutes before anyone came to take our order. I had to get up from the table to ask for salt and pepper since no one came to check on us. There was hair in my fruit. The first order they gave me was completely wrong. The food was very average. F**k this place"}
{"text":"The best GLUTEN FREE crepes in town. Services is amazing. A really good place for a weekend brunch or a day off lunch:) 
Love everything about it!"}
{"text":"Wanted to go to Junior but realized that they are on summer holidays so ended up here.

The place is pretty spacious with seats at the bar, front dinning room, back dinning room and patio at the back. 

This space specializes in crepes ~ bucklewheat crepes. Tried the Griffintown & crepe Suzette. Both were alright.  The owner who works as a chef is also very nice.

Service is ok
Food is OK
Coffee is a bit burnt 

Nothing wow but can't complain it was bad either."}
{"text":"Cozy place with friendly service for filling, gluten-free-friendly buckwheat crepes (galettes) served with a nice little fruit salad."}
{"text":"The staff is great, super friendly  and the food is great. Being French I grew up with crepes and the ones in Spanel are good. The salty ones have nothing special, the combination are classic and good but the sweet ones a great, especially the salted caramel YUM ! If you like crepes go there, best place in Montreal for crepes !"}
{"text":"This place may have turned my boyfriend and I into crepe fanatics! I went all out with the duck confit crepe and have no regrets. We sat at the bar and loved the ambiance, watching the talented chef whip-up amazing crepe creations before our eyes. It shows (and you can taste) that every ingredient is high-quality and careful preparation goes into every dish.

The only drawback was that they seemed to be short staffed. We waited awhile to get served. Although, once the barista noticed us, we were well taken care of."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch. It was excellent. Buckwheat, egg, spinach, old cheddar crepe was hearty and cooked perfectly. The fruit was fresh and delicious. The free coffee and sample of their smoothie to start was a nice touch. The service was impeccable. The prices were reasonable (which seems to be uncommon in Montreal).

Definitely come here for brunch!"}
{"text":"Was very good, had no previous expectations. Was pleasantly surprised. I am not at all a crepe lover either, but the quality ingredients and cozy atmosphere was very nice. Will return."}
{"text":"J'adore. La pâte à crêpes est excellente, le jambon vraiment bon, le fromage aussi. Les crêpes desserts vraiment bien. J'aime tout chez Spanel. Sans parler de la jolie terrasse et des serveurs attentifs."}
{"text":"I wanted crepes while I was in Montreal and this place happened to be closest. They use a buckwheat batter that, honestly, scared me at first. I layered the Lille des seour which included spinach, avocado, salsa, egg, and probably something else. End game: it was goooood. I'd go back in a heart beat. Great service and friendly staff as well."}
{"text":"I was disappointed by the crepes at Spanel.  Even looking at the menu, I was worried that the food would be bland.  I knew I didn't want a sweet crepe, and I ended up ordering the Village - eggs, cheddar cheese, sausage and caramelized onions - thinking those ingredients would have good flavor.  It didn't.  I was expecting the egg to be made separately and put onto the crepe.  It was cooked into the crepe, making it the same consistency.  The caramelized onions were too sweet.  I sort of picked around mine, enjoying the crunchy edges, but overall, the flavor was boring and felt heavy and full of carbs.
We enjoyed sitting outside on their back patio.  The service was friendly, but it took forever for the food to come out.  I would not go back because the food is just OK."}
{"text":"I was craving for some crepes in Montreal and wanted to give this place a try. I decided to go out of my comfort zone and ordered the smoked salmon/arugula crepes. It's pretty good but I felt like I was eating some kind of salad instead of crepes. I am sure their other dishes are great and authentic as this place seems to be always packed. We did wait a long time for the food to come... overall, I think my dish was excellent except it wasn't what I had imagined it to be in my head."}
{"text":"Cozy little place to enjoy sweet or savoury crepes. Perfect if you're craving crepes but have an intolerance to gluten. Service is inconsistent; we've been twice so far and my first experience was really great - while my second makes me hesitate going back."}
{"text":"The buckwheat crepes are absolutely delicious. The portions are quite generous. The courtyard garden terrace provides a really cozy environment. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Très bonnes galettes de sarrazin, choix variés, ambiance agréable."}
{"text":"Spanel really is lovely.
A very familial little joint, the buckwheat crêpes are also fantastic. Granted, buckwheat isn't everyone's jam- if you're inclined towards crêpes of the purple-grey variety this is your spot. I was rather pleased with the brunch special which is one of the crêpes with a latte and a mimosa for $20. Right up my alley.

Major pluses: they take reservations if you're a bigger group and they'll gladly veganize most of the menu. The crêpes themselves are vegan so it's all about subbing the filling for something you can eat. Just make sure you mention that's what you're up to otherwise they'll butter the crêpes.

If I really had my morning game together I would definitely check out one of their morning specials."}
{"text":"Rien a dire de plus, une de mes places préférées. Le propriétaire est tres convivial et proches de ses clients. Cuisine délicieuse et fraîche en tout temps."}
