{"text":"One of the best restaurants in Dane county and certainly the best restaurant in Sun Prairie. Friendly staff, charming space, and extensive menu.  Respect for ingredients is paramount. Always a good choice."}
{"text":"As a pizza lover, Salvatore's Tomato Pies are unique and flavorful. We ordered the bacon and fig pizza which was the perfect melding of savory and sweet.  The menu offered a variety of choices, making it hard to decide what type of pie we wanted to order. The venue is pretty small, so it would be smart to order takeout on the busier nights or try and beat the dinner rush. Due to the small size of then venue it is a little loud when crowded. We are definitely planning to go back to try some of the other menu options!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in Madison. Doesn't make you sick like most other places. Love the fresh ingredients and so many cool variations of pizzas."}
{"text":"its ok. but costly. no whole wheat crust pizza pit better all rnd. glass nickle better too. pm"}
{"text":"Salvatore's tests a couple of life's basic aphorisms.  First - is it possible to have too much of a good thing?  Second - do one thing really well, then keep doing it.  Sal's wraps up my triumvirate of pizza reviews since moving to Wisconsin, and it takes the cake.  Or pie, as the case may be.  It happens to be within walking distance of our new house in Sun Prairie, hence our first test.  This is really a test of willpower.  This is good pizza.  This is really good pizza.  And it's a five minute walk.  At toddler speed.  We could eat there every night.  But we exercise willpower.  I hate exercise.  So the second test.  Sal's menu reveals it all.  You want lasagna?  You want subs?  You want linguini with clam sauce?  You want calzones?  Seek elsewhere.  Here you'll get pizza and you'll like it.  Oh yes, you will.  From the perfect bready, yeasty, not-too-thin, not-too-thick, woodfired, not a bit greasy crust, to the herby tomotoey saucy sauce (yes, I'm being redundant, but I'm short on adjectives today), to the simply delicious assortment of locally sourced, super-fresh and super-tasting toppings.  Our family is mostly non-meatarian, but that does not diminish the flavorsome fixings available at Sal's.  Starting to get the picture?  [Oh yeah, they do offer salads & other appetizers.  The salads are pretty fine too, especially when heirlooms are in season.]  My wife's been a huge fan of Chicago-style dripping cheesiness her whole life, but even she's come around to the artisanal perfection that Sal's embodies.  Pizza.  One size only (big).  Bring your appetite.  Or bring your friends.  Heck, bring both and knock yourself out.    It's a small space; maybe eight or ten tables?  Wait staff can get overwhelmed when the line begins to stretch out the door, but they'll always make things right.  And the beer selection's yummy (though I'm starting to realize that I've moved to a little slice of beer paradise, otherwise known as Wisconsin)."}
{"text":"I was thoroughly impressed when we came here with our bridal party the night before our wedding! We called ahead for a reservation and they had the table set up for us when we came in. And of course, the pizza is delicious.   I would definitely come again!"}
{"text":"I came to Sal's to share a pizza with my brother and sister, excited to try something wildly exciting and new (I'd seen the menu earlier, and I was really impressed with how imaginative and creative the pizzas were). My sister, though, always the unadventurous eater, wanted us to get the Forza: what seems to be a simple pie with pepperoni, Gouda, Ricotta, and tomatoes. I begrudgingly agreed to what I assumed would be an uneventful and boring pizza experience.   BOY, WAS I WRONG. The Forza, the absolute \"safest\" pizza we could find on the menu, was packed to the brim with flavor and quality. Deliciously sweet dollops of cheese perfectly balanced whole cloves of roasted garlic and juicy (but not too juicy!) tomatoes, making my taste buds practically break out in angelic song with every single bite. I will definitely be coming back here to try the creative and inspired masterpieces of culinary recipe that originally drew me to Sal's, like the Carbonara, the Fig and Bacon, and probably all the rest of the menu as well.   Also, the pizzas? They're absolutely gigantic, considering their low price and high quality. I had so many leftovers to eat and it was awesome. I love leftovers."}
{"text":"We've gotten take-out from this place a number of times and it is definitely our number 1 choice for pizza in Madison. My order is always ready 10-20 minutes from when I call and the staff who check me out have always been friendly. The only reason, at this point, that I would go to another pizza place is if Salvator's was closed.  We've ordered the Tomato Pie and a number of the specialty pizzas including the Carbonara, Fig and Bacon, and Forza.  I have never been disappointed with a pizza here.  The ingredients are all high quality and fresh and many of them are locally sourced.  While the price tag might seem a little high for a pizza, it is well worth it in my opinion as the quality outshines most, if not all, other pizza places in Madison that I have tried."}
{"text":"We ordered 3 different pies for the 4 of us and had about 1 pie left over. Great way to test the food our first time visit. The staff said 45min to 1 hr wait for a table but we could go to the Johnson public house next door if we ordered drinks there (root beer coke and chocolate  milk). Excellent pies we all commented no marinara sauce. Great combinations off their menu."}
{"text":"*disclaimer. I have yet to try the pizza. I have tried multiple varieties of the taco options and a couple desserts and they were 5 stars all the way. Great addition to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"This is, without question, the best pizza in the Madison area. Yes, you'll have to drive to Sun Prairie, and it will totally be worth it. They have in-house made mozzarella, amazing garlic bread, and the best pizza sauce I've had. The specialty pizzas all look amazing. Tonight we had the carbanara, and it was outstanding. It's a small place, but with charm (and it's clean). Good beer selection and wine (although it was pricey...but wine's pricey everywhere). Stop reading this and go there NOW."}
{"text":"Pizza topping combinations are excellent and the crust is thin and delicious. Well worth the visit!"}
{"text":"By far the best pizza I've ever had. Love the farmer john's pizza in sun prairie and the forza on east Johnson. Best part is the roasted whole cloves of garlic!"}
{"text":"My my. What have we here? The best pizza in the state? Probably. At least it's hard to imagine anything exceeding it. Hand-crafted, hand-tossed, beautifully baked. And that sauce! Just wow.   While the dimly lit dining room neither adds to nor detracts from the experience, that's OK--the 'zas are the main attraction. Fresh and local ingredients add complex textures. Whether you seek old-school minimalist or hipster gourmet pies, this place does them perfectly. My faith in pizza awesomeness is restored."}
{"text":"I wish this place was in Chicago!  Loved everything about this place!  Loved how little and homey it was.  Especially loved the pizza, the crust was nice and fluffy without being too much crust.  The toppings tasted fresh.  We ordered a large special pizza for the four of us and after tasting how delicious our pizza was, we decided to order another one :)  My only complaint about this place is that there is not one in Chicago!"}
{"text":"OH. MY. PIZZA.  I went with a friend one night and even though it was jam packed, we were seated right away.  Our server promptly greeted us and was very enthuastic.  We ordered a couple of beers and two pizzas: the Carbonara and the Forza.    And let me tell you... this was some of the best pizza that I have ever consumed.  The Carbonara has mozzarella, mushrooms, bacon, scallions, and three soft cooked eggs.  Sound gross? Well, shame on you! It was so delicious.  The egg yolks were an amazing addition to the pizza.    The Forza had gouda on it, which I think should be reason enough to visit Sal's and to try this pizza.  It was so savory and delicious.    I can't wait until I can go back and try more pizza.    Some people don't dig the space because it is very small and can be cramped when there are a lot of people eating, but honestly, I didn't care at all.  I was way too busy jamming pizza into my mouth to even notice that anyone else was in the room."}
{"text":"Best food in sun prairie hands down! And best lunch deal - $6 for two slices of pizza and a soda. Best workers, best restaurant!"}
{"text":"Ok. Maybe the best pizza I have ever had! Had the fig.  My favorite. Also had the jalape√±os and the carbonara. Can't go wrong with any. So good!"}
{"text":"I moved to Wisconsin two years ago. I have not been able to find a really good pie here. I have had pretty good ones. This far and away the best pizza in the state not just the Madison area."}
{"text":"Great pizza! They had a slight mix-up on our order, but were very appologetic and gave us a discount. Great service, and even greater pizza!"}
{"text":"Picked up a pizza from here. I'm from Chicago and have very high standards when it comes to pizza. This places, by far, has the best pizza I've had it Wisconsin."}
{"text":"Absolutely my favorite place in the neighborhood. Delicious food, cozy interior, innovative menu. Too bad there is not more seating space, but the smallness does keep it cozy."}
{"text":"This is a great place to go, seating is limited but worth the wait.  The Fat Uncle Tony is a great pie.  Would recommend to anyone who enjoys a meat lovers pizza."}
{"text":"This is what pizza should be.  It's a little bit more than the other pizza places in town but it is so much higher quality that it is hard to compare.  I only wish that they had lunch on the weekends."}
{"text":"Another pizza place to add to my list of favorites! Before coming to Madison I'd never dreamt that pizza could be this good. I have heard all about Salvatore's but I'd never tried it before, the Sun Prairie location is just too far out of the way for me. But the people there must have heard me (and other pizza-lovers like me!!), and so they open an outlet here. Thanks to my co-worker I got to know about their opening and off we went on their second day.   For being a new place they were pretty busy. It was a nice and cozy restaurant on the east side (about 7 or so tables with a small bar area). Ordered the popular Carbonara pizza and it didn't disappoint. Runny egg yolks (3 eggs!!) and smooth egg whites right on top of the pizza. With mushrooms and bacon. With all the eggs on the pizza the crust is still super crispy. Enjoyed every moment of it. The small pizza was enough to share between two people.   But we were greedy so we also had the bruchetta as the appetizer. Fresh house made mozzarella with dipping bread, roasted garlic and greens on the side. I love how light the cheese is, it goes really well with the pizza.   I am so excited about Salvatore's. Can't wait to be back again for more!!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in madison by far. Came here because of all the good yelp reviews, and was glad I did. Been back about three times, and my only advice is it can get very busy on Friday and Saturday nights. Probably would call ahead during those times. The wait will be worth it though if you do have to wait."}
{"text":"I just ate at Salvatore's for the first time, and I have to say the pizza here is amazing!!!  It's a really cute small place.  We went on a Saturday evening and had to wait about 15 minutes for a table.  Once we had a place though, service was quick and the best pizza I've had in Madison was delivered quickly.  The C3PO pizza will knock your socks off.  Worth the drive!"}
{"text":"Date Night for two!  $30 = pizza + bottle of wine + appetizer. It was delicious, we're both full, and it cost 30 bucks. OMG !"}
{"text":"My husband is always on the lookout for good pizza... We just moved here from the East Coast and we found it here... We tried a different pizza place and they even recommend Sal's. It is hands down the best pizza we have ever had."}
{"text":"Best pizza I've had in the four years I've lived in the Madison area."}
{"text":"This restaurant went from having some of the best gourmet pizza in a blah atmosphere to still having some of the best gourmet pizza in a vibrant and fun atmosphere. From the somewhat unusual pizza styles (my fave is the Fat Uncle Tony's) to some great appetizers like the fantastic calamari, and a bar staff knowledgeable about all the craft brews, it is still a great favorite of ours, enhanced even more so now in their fantastic, newly remodeled downtown historic building."}
{"text":"Would first like to say that your a little put back by the price of a pie yet after you've eaten, you have no regrets and find yourself coming back for something new and exciting. I can say I've tried them all and all quite delicious. My Fav is the Mediterranean. Oh Snap is that good.  Keep up the good work. Love you guys."}
{"text":"the last few times I've been here I've been disappointed. the pizza is rich and I would probably rather eat it over grampas, ians, roman candle, pizza brutta, or Greenbush bar, but at the same time I've had better pizza at the sun Prairie location. there was a lot of anticipation for this location to open, and they didn't seem quite ready for it. on one occasion, I ordered the forestiere, which reads on a menu like the single most delicious combination ever, but it was simply underwhelming. my guess is that the consistency in the kitchen is lacking. I've had bad service here too. I consider myself a pretty low maintenance diner, but the wait times were so bad I had to get the attention of other employees. and they're a little self indulgent. one time after we eat, the server checks in with us and asks almost rhetorically \"best pizza you ever ate?\"  Umm, no, not even remotely close."}
{"text":"Good food, bad service. Went and had a great $24 pizza. We ate half and they boxed the rest up for us. The next day we open it and there was 1 piece with a bite out of it and some crusts. Clearly they gave us someone elses box. When we called to ask for a refund or something bc it was their mistake, they said all they could do was maybe give us a coupon for half off an appetizer. I don't think thats enough to make up for $12 in pizza they didnt give us. We will not be going back."}
{"text":"Best pizza place around! Can't even compare with others! We've since moved to Dallas, TX and we still  think and speak of Salvatore's. We have found no place in Dallas that even comes close!"}
{"text":"The pizza was amazing! Thin crust, crunchy, with unique ingredients like figs and Gorgonzola cheese.. they use locally grown ingredients whenever possible, including The Underground Butcher's amazing sausages. Had a roasted vegetable appetizer plate that was insane! A great experience for sure! We've got a new favorite specialty pizza place!"}
{"text":"Dear Pat. Thank you for taking the time to respond. First let me say that I love your pizza, and I will be back for more. And you don't have to give it to me for free! I did appreciate your complimentary meal.  But your response proves the point I was trying to make.  Your staff knows you are having issues with your software system, yet didn't come back to let us know this for almost half an hour, and we didn't get pizza for almost another 20 minutes. I believe the purpose of your 2 slice lunch deal is to give your customers the opportunity to eat your great food in a reasonable amount of time.  I know the restaurant business is tough, and I want you to have success.  Hopefully comments like mine are just little reminders to always strive to do better next time.  Thanks, Jay."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. It's definitely the best pizza in Madison by a long shot Pizza Brutta is pretty dope, and to be fair to them, this is a very different pizza than what they serve, but Sal's just has some delicious flavor combinations on an amazing crust. In the neighborhood, Grampa's is similarly revived on Yelp, and maybe if you want to go somewhere a little conventionally 'nicer' that is where you should go, but Sal's is dope through and through,"}
{"text":"Sal's is amazing. They always use the best ingredients and it pays off.  Definitely the best pizza in Wisconsin.  The service is always friendly and attentive.  If you have to wait for a table, stay, it will be well worth it!"}
{"text":"Crust was great and hand-tossed.  Ingredients were fresh and delicious.  Small, but comfortable location.  Waitstaff were friendly and helpful.  Tremendous value!"}
{"text":"This might be the best pizza in Madison.   I'd never had Salvatore's before, and I have to say, it was delicious. We got the burrata appetizer and the Carbonara Pizza. Both were wonderful. The burrata was fresh and refreshing. Which was a good starter before the Carbonara. The pizza was rich and delicious. The egg on it was perfectly done, which is an accomplishment.  The beer list is great for such a small place. They have a lot of local crafts, as well as craft beers from other places in the Midwest (Three Floyds, Founders, ect.)    The only reason I can't quite give the place 5 stars yet is the atmosphere. It is a cramped place which is too bad because I'm sure it is only going to get busier. We had to wait 1 hour on a Tuesday (which turned out to be actually shorter than waits at other pizza places in town that night). That doesn't bother me as much, but the wait staff did seem a bit flustered with the bustle. My guess it is new restaurant jitters and that this place will be THE place soon."}
{"text":"Great menu, and growing.  Quality is usually great.  Occasionally burned crust, or bubbles in crust.  Rotate your za in the oven and take care of the bubbles.  Could have better wait service.  With a larger store and better location, they will be big.  Just needs to improve on the cooking of the product and the wait staff. The owner is awesome with customers!"}
{"text":"I found this place on Yelp. Surprisingly small, which isn't a bad thing.  Maybe 10 small tables at the most.  We got seated right away. Our waitress saw us fairly soon also.  We got the Bacon Cheese Bread as an appetizer and my husband enjoyed it.  It came with a side of sriracha and mixed greens.  Then what I was most excited about was our gluten free pizza! It's hard to find gluten free restaurants or anything gluten free at restaurants, let alone anything more than a salad.  It is an 11\" pizza, which, after ordering it, was plenty for the two of us to share.  But we aren't huge eaters... We ordered the \"Fat Uncle Tony\" which comes with pepperoni, sausage, and bacon.  Everything here is local and fresh! And you can really tell! So delicious!! I really appreciate that.  The only thing I didn't like was our waitress.  She wasn't friendly at all & wasn't very attentive.  We waited for our check for quite awhile...But that won't prevent me from coming back for some more delicious pizza!"}
{"text":"Outstanding pizza, friendly service, amazing flavor, and pretty light on the wallet all make this an instant favorite.  Newly opened and taking over where two other italian places left behind, Salvatore's has it's work cut out for itself in the small city of Sun Prairie with something like 10 other pizza places in town.  But it came right out of the gate swinging and crushed it with intense flavor and attention to detail.  I had the four different pizza - I mean, Tomato Pies - which I'll review below.  Outside of the toppings, they had the same fresh-made, soft, naturally sweet dough as their foundation.  The pies seem to be made in a wood oven or brick oven style that allows the crust to be just a tad crispy while the entire pizza remains light and soft through out.  Specific to types of pizza, I enjoyed the following  1) Fat Uncle Tony  | The Tomato Pie with Applewood smoked bacon, locally made sausage and Wisconsin cured pepperoni. -- This is basically your meat lovers style pizza.  Very basic in concept, you like meat; you eat this.  Not overly greasy, and most importantly, everything was so fresh and you could really pick out the individual meats in each bite rather than just chewing through a bunch of bland pork.  2) The Applewood Griffin  | Applewood smoked bacon, baby spinach, cherry and Roma tomatoes.  -- Huge pieces of bacon layered on top of fresh spinach and ripe tomatoes.  This was great; very light and very fresh  3) Bacon & Blue | Aged gorgonzola cheese, Applewood smoked bacon, fresh broccoli and mozzarella cheese. -- Oh my god was this fantastic.  Gorgonzola and bacon on this pair up really nicely.  The gorgonzola wasn't too overpowering and the bacon was cooked perfectly.  My only criticism here was the broccoli could've been a bit softer.  Just caught you off guard because the crust and the slice itself was all so soft. But otherwise great.  Last but not least, and my favorite so far,   4) House made Italian Sausage | Caramelized shallots, fire roasted sweet red peppers, and ch√®vre.  This was simply phenomenal.  The caramelized shallots and the sweet peppers complimented the soft chevre perfectly!  Honestly, if you aren't sure what to get, get this.   Overall, each pie and slice had a perfect balance of flavor.  No one ingredient took over the other which made each pie and bite equally delicious.  They are upfront about not putting too much cheese in their pies, and there didn't seem to be too much sauce from my experience either, but don't let this dissuade you.  This was actually a good thing.  You don't to worry about a mound of cheese covering all the fresh ingredients or having excess tomato sauce run off your piece.    The owner and chef (same person) came out just as we were finishing and was going around to each table thanking.  This is probably one of my favorite things for an owner/chef to do.  Get that instant, direct, feedback.  He was very thankful for us coming in and from our discussion has a lot of plans to grow.  Liquor license, delivery, and lunch service all in the works.    In the meantime, do yourself a favor and stop in, sit down, and see for yourself why Sun Prairie might have just gotten it's number one pizza place!"}
{"text":"Visited the new facility tonight. The new location is great! Although it was very busy, service was good considering how busy they were. Very nice hostess and waitress. We ordered a pizza and it was delicious, and they had one of my favorite beers on tap, Karben4,Fantasy Factory.   Great meal, good drink and pleasant service."}
{"text":"So I've never been to Italy so maybe my 5 star doesn't totally count but I've eaten at some pizza spots that serious foodies have said are some of the best in the country and this place stacks up.   There isn't a single misstep on the menu. I could go on and on but you should just go. I've heard the tacos are excellent as well but haven't ventured there yet.   The people working the counter can be a little hipstery-put-off-ish though. Only thing I would criticize. One dude looks like Zod (villian from superman) plus a man-bun and a helping of surliness that's unbecoming."}
{"text":"Top notch food, and excellent ingredients. By far the best pizza in the Madison area, and our go-to. The new digs look and feel great. Staff is always excellent, and much love for a full bar. Only one gripe: dance with the one that brought ya...where are the Fig and Bacon (specifically) and other pies that made you legendary? It's hard to drive to Madison when this place is less than 5 minutes from my door."}
{"text":"It seems to be a hit or miss. Sometimes the pizza is amazing and other times it's over-baked and dry. I wish it was more consistent!"}
{"text":"Great pizza, lots of options and even tacos if you like! Bacon and cheese bread is amazing. The Carbonara was great as well but didn't come with pizza sauce which we thought was a bit odd. Overall very good pizza."}
{"text":"Great American style pizza. I'd choose this over a chain any day. Fresh ingredients, great service, and a wide selection of beer. It was a fun atmosphere in the dining area also. Yum"}
{"text":"anybody that puts eggs on their pizza as much as these guys like to do, is a-okay in my back.  the appetizers are just as good as the pizza!"}
{"text":"Lots of continental and nouveau options on the menu, but we went for a more American-style mozzarella, sausage, mushroom, black olive and spinach. It did not rock our world we are disappointed to say. The crust was soggy and lifeless after 10 minutes in the box.  The sauce was thick, but the spices were by no means a secret recipe.  The whole milk mozzarella and the local sausage were not distinctive. On the isthmus with a well-staffed kitchen, trendy menu and decor (which you'll pay a little extra for)."}
{"text":"Delicious and yum.  Yumyumyum!  Yelp wants me to say more.   Yumyumyumyumyum!"}
{"text":"The best pizza in Madison, isn't in Madison.  Weirdly enough, it's in Sun Prairie.  It's really too bad Madison can't claim this one as it's own.  This will be a short review.  It's really really good.  I've never in my life been so excited to eat my pizza leftovers.    Here's my scoop---  They have a lot of specialty pizzas with quality toppings.  But my personal favorite was a basic pepperoni pizza.  When you go simple, you get to taste the awesomeness underneath.  It's all about the sauce!  Topped with whole-milk mozzarella and fresh basil."}
{"text":"Been meaning to write this ever since I noticed Yelp's insane bureaucracy forced Patrick and his team to start over with the new location. Both Sal's locations are great and the new location in Sun Prairie is a really nice spot. The food is always good and I appreciate the commitment to quality ingredients. As a bonus, I was especially impressed that the staff brought my kid some little toys to keep him occupied while we waited. Thanks!"}
{"text":"One of the reasons I moved to Madison WI, was because of  something I read once, that stated that this was the city with the most restaurants per capita. After a few meals I discovered, that yes, there is in fact a lot of restaurants here, but a very few of them are worth a damn, needless to say, they come and go quite often.Then enters Salvatore's Tomato Pies... In its small and simple setting, far away from the glory and arrogance of glass walls and sterile dinning rooms. Modest, honest. It blew my mind, my palate and if I dare to say with my very passionate latin heritage, my heart. I had forgotten that eating fresh innovative food could feel familiar and uncomplicated, and that, to be unique you don't need to reinvent the wheel, only to perfect it.   Pies...  Gourmet Pies to be precise is Patrick DePula's thing (besides other things like his magnificent Porchetta). Now many people have tried to give the good old pizza a \"twist\"; anywhere from high-end restaurants with their paper thin toppings, flavorless pizzas with unpronounceable archaic names, to the \"let's put everything on a pizza and sell it to hungry college students that would eat anything anyways\" place. What makes Sal's so extraordinary is the BOLD use and meld of amazing fresh ingredients, everything on the menu sounds familiar but when put together every bite tastes like uncharted territory: New, exciting, mysterious, then at the end of your expedition you will be exhilarated, satisfied, and most likely pleasantly full. But there is no magic trick here, you can see who and how your food is being made, on a busy night you can see people covered in flour from head to toe turning pizzas in the air, movement everywhere, conversations from happy patrons fill the air, the liveness of everything gives the experience only the more anticipation, I could probably use some more staple metaphors, to try to described their flavors, but flavors can only be experienced so, I will refrain from doing so and just ask you to go and taste for yourself. Remember this is neither a quiet small old fashioned mom and pop restaurant, nor a pretentious cutting edge venture, and for the best in both instances. It is simply Salvatore's tomato pies."}
{"text":"OUTSTANDING! While most local pizzerias seem content to compete for \"Best of Madison\". Salvatore's Tomato Pies are among the best I've had anywhere - and that includes: Chicago, New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Rome ... and New Jersey (Salvatore's home state). The use fresh, locally-sourced cheeses, meats, herbs and vegetables. They make their sauce from scratch every day. We can't wait to go back and work our way through the entire menu - including the Korean Fish Tacos."}
{"text":"So we went here based off the reviews and it was truly it was amazing! We decided to get the 16inch and do half/half carbanarra and forza! Service was great but the pizza was unbelievably amazing! Will definitely atop here when we are in Madison!"}
{"text":"Well...Salvatore's never ever disappoints! You must know by now that Chef Patrick dePula is going to be larger than life on the Madison food scene.   Chef DePula gets fresh...Jaques Pepin says that \" ordinary ingredients give you ordinary food.\" Well, Chef DePula only cooks and prepares food with extraordinary, fresh, farm to table ingredients. .. the result is a meal that even the pickiest chef would enjoy.   My time cooking professionally is on hold for abit but I'm still a pickier than picky Chef. I can be obnoxious at times when eating at restaurants because of my training and my absolute requirement that food be ALL WISCO...NO SYSCO.  Chef DePula never ever disappoints!!!  If you don't get just how good the food is at Salvatore's. ..you do not know good cuisine. Period."}
{"text":"Thank God, finally a pizza place in south central Wisconsin to write about!  Great atmosphere and even better food at a reasonable price.  The owner said they'll have an expanded menu including beer and wine beginning early November.  Check it out, highly recommended..."}
{"text":"Delicious! The staff was very kind and attentive. One girl was waiting on the entire patio area and was just fantastic! We had a 14 inch half with the jalape√±o pesto, and half with the fig and bacon. I liked the jalape√±o one better, just because it was very spicy. The fig one was also good. I definitely plan on taking friends here!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in Madison. The wait is always long, but it's worth it. The jalape√±o assessino is possibly the best pizza I've ever had. Hopefully it gets back on the regular menu."}
{"text":"Sooo Delicious! We had the house salad, which was a simple mixed greens with a mix of fresh organic vegetables, then a delicious pizza with the most delicious pepperoni, mushrooms and fresh basil, so good. Highly recommend. Friendly, cute little place."}
{"text":"Thanks Sal's for always accommodating the gf/df needs out there! You go above and beyond!"}
{"text":"So much love for Salvatore's! You can tell that they use good, whole, real ingredients from the bottom up.  The crust... Oh the crust!  The perfect balance of chew and crunch make this my favorite part of the pie.  Or, well, wait....no.  The cheese.  The whole milk, local cheese that beings a slightly salty, richness has to be my favorite.  That's it.  Hmmm......but how could I forget the sauce?  The fresh, bright sauce that is kissed with herbs that pirouettes across the surface of each pie like a graceful ballerina?  Surely that's the key component that makes Salvatore's a standout.   It's all 3.  This classic Tomato Pie is a beautiful because it is whole, it is real, and unfussy.  A beautiful medley that I have been known to meander to Sun Prairie for twice in one week.  The other pies are wonderful as well,  but I always, always order a classic Tomato Pie as well.    The staff is wonderful and the service is great.  Always a smile and a great suggestion for a new beer they have on house.  My only complaint?  No Chianti on the wine menu.  Every once in a while a glass of Ruffino Riserva would hit the spot."}
{"text":"Ordered out from here last night. This is our fifth time eating here. Have tried a different pizza each time. Last night had the carbonara. All of the pizza is fantastic. Last night tried the appetizer. Goat cheese, olives, roasted peppers, caramelized shallots. One of the best things I've eaten in a long time. The house salad is also great. Very fresh with delicious house made dressing. Definitely a fantastic addition to Sun Prairie and the entire Madison area."}
{"text":"I'm updating my (very) early review of one of my now favorite places to visit and order take-out. The owner (Patrick) gets that real food, real ingredients and quality over quantity is where it's at.   Having a commitment to fresh produce/ingredients has made all the difference. Their salads are inspired (as are their appetizers, main entrees and desserts). I'm just a salad and pizza gal who appreciates what they've done with the salad side of the equation... the pizza was always remarkable (as you'll see below).  They have also introduced a wine menu that is worth sticking around for another glass and another slice.   This place has an amazing thing going. I look forward to how they expand their menu and their atmosphere. Worth noting: there are few owners/operators who care about their place and their product as much as Patrick does. You can feel this about the place when you walk through the doors - each menu item is special. I love that.  Old review:  The food: There is a reason that the only thing on the menu (pretty much) is pizza. It is amazing. The crust is on the thinner side and has the perfect combo of crunchy and chewy. The sauce, which they swirl on the top is sweet and spicy. So good! We had the sausage pie and loved it. The dinner salad is enough to share. The toppings and dressing are dynamic. I was a little disappointed that some of the lettuce was old.   The environment: My dining companions, 3 and 4 year old sons, loved it too. Salvatore's set up is geared for kids. A play area, kid plates and coloring papers are great.   The booze: Tonight was their first with a liquor license. I look forward to trying their wine list when it debuts this weekend.   Overall: We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is the best pizza I have ever eaten. I can't say enough about it. The red sauce explodes with flavor. The dough has the perfect balance of chew and crustiness. The toppings are unbelievably fresh. The only downside is the location- please please please open another one on the west side!"}
{"text":"Probably the best pizza in Madison.  Awesome t-shirts.  Love the neighborhood."}
{"text":"We went with a family group of 13.  Reservations were flawless.  The 3 of the 5 pizzas were excellent tasting.  The 3 teen boys even said the pizza (Fat Tony) was the best they had ever tasting.  Our pizza (chix w onion/mushroom) unfortunately had very little chicken. In prior visits, we had not noticed the lack of chicken.   The 5th pizza was ordered with caramelized onions and they were left off.  Other then these two issues, the dinner was good."}
{"text":"Food is teriffic, however their customer service is lacking. What's more upsetting is they didn't follow thru with what they promised. Ordered $80 worth of food on Dec.17 for carryout. Assuming everything was given to me seeing I wasn't the one that ordered it, I was just the person picking up. Got home only to realize we weren't given the $11 Caesar salad. When I called to tell them, the hostess on the phone stated...oh yeah here it is. I simply asked to have them just remove that amount from my cc card, seeing I wasn't going to make the trek back out to pick it up as it was a recent snow storm.  She stated she couldn't remove it, but would send me  a gift card for the $11 instead. Here it is 2 weeks later and no gift card.  Can't rate them any higher based on the lack of follow thru."}
{"text":"Wrote a review 15 days ago regarding lack of follow thru when promised a reimbursement from my partial take out that I did not get. I am now updating my review as I recieved in the mail today my gift card. Thank you."}
{"text":"Went to Salvatore's because it was recommended.  Arrived at 6:00 and we were seated right away.  Our order was taken at 6:10. We ordered an appetizer and a 16\" three topping pizza.  We received our appetizer right away.    At 6:50 we were informed that our pizza would be right out and it would be free because of the delay.  At 7:10 we told them to put the pizza in a box when it was ready because we were leaving.  We left at 7:15 with the pizza.  When we arrived at home we discovered not only did the pizza have the wrong toppings but they were sparse and clumped in the middle.  The sauce tasted like tomato paste.  On a scale of 1-10 I would give the pizza a 4.    The appetizer was an herb and cheese bread and was very good.  However, that won't be enough to warrant a return visit!"}
{"text":"Insaaaaaaaaaanely INSANELY good pizza.  Skip the appetizers and have more pizza.  Salvatore has ruined me to all other pizza.  ME LOVE SALVATORE'S TOMATO PIES YUM YUM"}
{"text":"Amazing!  From the time we walked in to the time we left, we felt at home.  I will admit I'm a bit of a pizza snob, having lived in Italy for a bit.  The pizza here is just as good.  The ingredients are fresh and local.  The service was friendly and attentive.  Can't wait to become a regular!"}
{"text":"I was a little nervous. There was a A LOT of hype for this place. But it did not disappoint. We had the hot cheese injection and the underground meats pizzas. It's terrific that you can go half and half with the specialty pizzas, allowing for a broader tasting of the menu. Both were good but the cheese pizza was superb. Deserts and beer list also excellent."}
{"text":"Go here for the food not the service and definitely not the ambiance  I am hearing impaired and the acoustics here are the worst  I believe this restaurant would benefit greatly from outside seating. I did notice a lot of carry out customers and that is the best way to eat there pies at this time. We had a split pie. Half 3CPO and half Fat Uncle Tony's. The 3CPO is amazing, Fat Uncle Tony's has very good tomato sauce but I would not order again   I had a beer and my wife had water, we waited way to long for these items but noticed others around us who ordered appetizers were served very timely. Had to get waitress attention to get water refills. The appetizers did look delicious. Overall I will not be returning here"}
{"text":"Easily the best tomato pie (pizza) in the area.  The ingredients are varied, local and high quality.  We've had every pizza on the menu and quite a few of their crazier creations. They consistently fail to make a bad pizza. I don't even like goat cheese and they manage to make it good."}
{"text":"Great pizza!  I'm pretty traditional, so I always go with the tomato pie with sausage.  I've tried other fancier pizzas there, which were also fantastic, but I love my usual.  I've never eaten there (I only live a few minutes away) but everyone seems to be having a nice time when I stop in to pick up my pizza.  I very much appreciate that they source locally.  It adds a lot of expense for the restaurant, but the outcome of the food is so superior."}
{"text":"Finally got around to trying this place, and I did not regret it. It's a cozy joint with both indoor and outdoor seating. Service was very friendly and efficient. My husband and I ordered one of the larger pies. We got 1/2 pepperoni and half Forza, one of their specialty pies. Yum. Just yum. Everything about the pizza was perfect, from the warm and chewy crust to the super fresh sauce and toppings. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Have had just about every pizza on the menu. EVERY.SINGLE.ONE.is. DELICIOUS!!! I can't recommend them enough. Oven fired gourmet pizzas that have a GF crust-what a treat and never disappointed with the quality, taste, or service.  Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Still waiting after an hour. They told us about an hour. Thirty minutes past that time and still waiting. No clue how to handle a rush of business. If not seated soon. Will never be back. No plAce is worth it. More to come..... We waited far to long. The staff was always friendly. I believe they need some one to manage the tables with more experience. It is a great place and venue. Food  was excellent as well as the appetizer. The main course came quickly. Witch still begs the question as to why we had to wait so long. It seems they are great at food, but need to invest in someone who can manage the front of house."}
{"text":"First ... thanks Yelp reviewers .... I live on the near-west side of Madison and would never have found this pizza without you.  I am of the (kind of snarky) opinion that pizza has become a sort of sad regional affair.  And, if you have never had the chance to venture to New Jersey/New York to sample the original version of this truly humble pie baked in a 125 year old coal burning brick oven you have really missed something perfect and delectable.  On the other hand, you will never be disappointed by your local pizza joint or long for a slice of perfection 950 miles away.  But that distance may now have been cut and your chance may have arrived .....   I knew things were looking positive when I tugged a slice from the pie, began to fold the sides together and just the proper amount of sag occurred at the pointed last third of the slice.  For me, the most important thing that sets New Jersey/New York pizza apart from all others is the crust.   It is not shatteringly crispy.  It is not a bread laden square mass.  It is a smooth pliable roundish support, with just a suggestion of yeast, that can be torn between tooth and hand. And Salvatore's Pie did just that.  Having read the many Yelp reviews I went for the classic, a humble Tomato Pie.  I ordered carry out.  The pie was a large misshapen circle, as it should be.  The delicious sauce was smeared on in a circular pattern so that each bite had just enough to taste but not overwhelm.  And the cheese was hot, melted and stringy.  The whole thing was lightly sprinkled with julienned strips of fresh basil.  The balance was perfect.  The care for quality ingrediants obvious.  Knowing now that the basics are so right, I can hardly wait to try the more exotic and interesting toppings.  All I can say is thank you.  At long last there is a pie within Dane county that is worth making a trip.  Pricey? Not compared to an airline ticket!  Please, please do us all a favor and consider the south west side of lake Mendota, maybe Fitchburg or Verona, for your next location."}
{"text":"Salvatore's has never failed to impress. Every time I visit, my expectations are higher for the fabulous food and drinks, and every time Patrick and his staff exceed them. The new location is beautiful and worth the wait. I'll be coming back often."}
{"text":"We were looking for a great pizza after a Badger game and Salvatore's did not disappoint.  The pizza offerings were a mix of old standbys and clever topping pairings like a carbonara pizza.  The toppings were from local providers.  It is a small place with maybe 10 tables.  When the wait time exceeded the time we were told, they had a nice appetizer from the kitchen for those waiting, which I thought was a great touch.  If I am ever in the Madison area looking for a great pizza, Salvatore's is at the top of my list."}
{"text":"We were given the wrong pizza tonight when we went to get takeout in the middle of helping friends/family with a move.  Normally, getting the wrong thing when I order takeout is a huge bummer for me.  I'm a little particular about what I order, and I'm just annoyed when it's wrong because I was looking forward to whatever I thought I was getting.  But this time?  I did not even care!  The three pizzas we actually got (whatever they were!) were soooooo good.  The only tiny bummer is that one seemed to be some kind of white pizza.  It was delicious, but the sauce they used on their other pizzas was the Platonic ideal of pizza sauce so I kind of missed it on the third one.  But, still not really disappointed!  Because even the no-sauce one was phenomenal!  Hope whomever got our order was equally happy with the veggie no mushrooms we'd ordered!  :)"}
{"text":"Delicious! I had the gluten-free pizza crust and was impressed. Even my gluten-loving friend enjoyed the crust.  I would return in an instant for more pizza and wine and happily try all of the interesting variations."}
{"text":"Salvatores is absolutely excellent. I cannot even think up enough great words to describe how phenomenal the pies are. A favorite pie off the menu: Hot Cheese Injection. We have also tried many specials which are always wonderful. If you haven't stopped in, you're really missing out! I am always surprised this place gets by with only 10 or so tables."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza pies.  Great variety of ingredients.  Love the crisp crust.  Looking forward to coming back with the whole family.  Fun mix of diners; from families to high school prom groups."}
{"text":"Had their pepperoni and sausage pizza and was quite pleased with the flavor. The size was good and we had leftovers which is unusual for my wife and I since we tend to take care of pizzas!  The setting was very nice and the staff was helpful and prompt. Another member had the spaghetti and said the meatballs were amazing. I noticed that they don't mess around their meatballs are huge!!  Overall good place give it a try."}
{"text":"This place is an absolute gem. I have never been disappointed and I gladly made the trip to Sun Prairie for their pizza, even when I live in the middle of a food mecca on Willy Street. Even better now that they have a second location closer to me. Everything from the staff to the food is incredible. Always clean as well. Give small businesses a chance, guys!"}
{"text":"Their gluten free pizza is so good. The crust is so close to a crust with gluten that you wouldn't be able to tell the difference. We ordered the vegetarian pizza and it was so delicious. We also had the vegan vegetable antipasto and it was one of the best things I've eaten in a long time."}
{"text":"Excellent every time we visit. Must have the garlic bread. Also the pie of the day is always amazing and very creative."}
{"text":"This pizza is as good or better than any I've had. Super tasty and smart ingredient combinations. It blew me away!  Well done!!!"}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE Sal's pizza. It's the best,  not greasy but flavorful and unique options (at least to us). Our favorite is the Fat Uncle Tony or the Underground Meats, we also love to add their caramelized onions, they are just SOO yummy. We've been going to the Sun Prairie location since they opened, haven't tried Johnson St yet."}
{"text":"The pizza at this place is delicious! The sauce is so tasty and I love the extra swirl of it you get on most of the pizzas.   Also, the servers are very nice and helpful and it's just a cute, comfortable place to eat a great meal. Wish it was in Madison, but it's worth the trip to Sun Prairie!"}
{"text":"Easily the tastiest pizza in the city (though it is technically tomato pie, not pizza), Salvatore's elevates the eat-in experience with a few things that are elusive in Madison: excellent service & perfect tacos. Have tried pretty much everything on the menu. All is good & some items are spectacular. We love the carnitas tacos, & the carne asada tacos; the Forza pie is flawless; the antipasti is all gorgeous, fresh, & chockful of local veggies. Don't forget to get dessert- it is constantly changing and consistently scrumptious. Salvatore's is a special place, and the Sun Prairie location is also worth the trip for some of their unique pies, but it is also not a super splurge, and part of its appeal is the laidback and genuinely friendly attitude of everyone who works there. As my boyfriend said raptly this morning \"I would literally eat Salvatore's every night.\""}
{"text":"Delicious and local! Liked the low key ambiance and the staff was friendly. It was a little chilly inside though."}
{"text":"A bit pricy, but very good pies. Always fresh ingredients, and creative items on the menu. I like that they offer seasonal pies, a competitor to glass nickel, but this pizza doesn't leave you feeling heavy, like theirs does. #arugula4ever"}
{"text":"Best pizza I've had in a long time. Savory locally-sourced cheese, pea vines, sweet onions & cherry tomatoes. Really exceptional. The carne asada tacos were well done - not as amazing as the pizza, but very good. Good service overall, prices very reasonable."}
{"text":"Being a frequent traveler and pizza fan, I didn't see the big deal about this place. I tried their staple pizza along with the vegetarian one. It was ok. Their garlic cheese bread was awesome, and something I'd go back there for. I'll give the pizza another chance sometime soon but everyone else is raving about this place and I don't see it."}
{"text":"NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM.   Easily the best pizza of this type I've had in the Madison area.  Neapolitan pizza still has my heart, but I can definitely make some room for Sal's Jersey pies. The toppings are creative, seasonal and locally sourced.  Who knew how amazing salsify, bacon, smoked gouda and spinach could be?  Or meyer lemon, speck, mozzarella and arugula? Dang...even the salad and garlic bread are worth mentioning. We were indecisive (i wanted one of everything) and they were more than happy to do a half & half pizza.   Why are you all the way in Sun Prairie? Will you consider moving to Madison so I can eat your 'za every day."}
{"text":"One of the best pizza places I've been in a long time.  Creative pizzas with fresh ingredients.  Great service, excellent salad.  Definitely going to hit it up again"}
{"text":"I went to Sal's last weekend to celebrate my birthday and the experience lived up to the hype! When my wife and I arrived I was glad I didn't invite anyone else because this place is small/intimate.  We were told it would be 40 minutes so we went next door to Johnson Public House for a beer.  About 20 minutes into my imperial porter I got a call that the table was ready so I slammed the beer and headed back to Sal's buzzed and ready to eat!  We each got a small specialty pie. I did the forza,with ricotta, pepperoni, Calabrian chilis, and whole cloves of roasted garlic!  The flavor was big, the heat and sweet worked well with the ricotta, crust was buttery and the garlic was so good. This one may not be the best pick for first dates or vampires.  My wife went with the mapache with carnitas, poblano peppers, potatoes and some other ingredients that are escaping me. The flavors worked well and this one had a very nice level of heat.  They have a rotating tap list featuring local and out of state beers.  I went with the Boulder brewing shake porter on nitro which was essentially a liquid tootsie roll and I really enjoyed it.  Service was attentive and friendly and combined with the food made for an awesome birthday dinner!"}
{"text":"More than anything I want to love Sal's. yet almost every time, the East side location disappoints me to extreme levels. Their specialty pizzas are never a good idea. You'll end up disappointed with the lack of toppings. We've never been happy when ordering one from this location. Occasionally they'll lose your order, and when you arrive, you're forced to wait an additional 30-60 minutes. Their website is a joke if you're trying to find their menu or place an order. Over the years, I've had significantly more bad experiences (over a dozen) than good ones (four) from the East side location. Their food, on the rare occasion it's done right (see their weak-ass specials and other complaints) is quite good, but it's not nearly enough to make up for the rest of their BS. Just go to Ronan Candle and enjoy good pizza done right. Avoid this place as much as possible. You won't regret it, unlike orders placed here."}
{"text":"Sals has amazing pizza, service, and atmosphere. They had a speciality pie this weekend that included smoked white fish, Gouda, and apples. While it sounds strange, it came together beautifully! Our waiter was amazing, timely, and attentive. I hands down think this is the best pizza place in Madison. This is a must have!!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place - I did.  I like the concept of using fresh, local ingredients but think the execution is poor.  This isn't the best pizza I feel that I've had in the Madison area, and is far from it.  We ordered the one with sausage and mushrooms.  There was so little sauce on the pizza that we thought we were eating just cheese on a crust.  The sauce that was on it had no flavor.  There were barely any toppings as well.  For about $20, this was a very disappointing pizza, indeed.  The thin crust wasn't crisp and was instead a floppy mess.  Our three year old who normally loves most pizza, refused to eat more than one bite."}
{"text":"Fantastic pizza.   They have a good variety of menu items ranging from really basic pizzas to more interesting and creative options. They use top notch ingredients and you can really tell the difference. They are good enough to justify a trip to Sun Prairie all on their own.  The only complaint I have is that the location could be more spacious, but that doesn't really affect the quality of the food or anything like that."}
{"text":"I'm SO sad but I'm done with Salvatore's. I wrote a review after our first visit saying this place was lacking in the service department (severely) but had fantastic food. I still gave a 4 star review with the hopes to come back and leave a glowing 5 star review. On that first visit I had such high hopes and knew it was just an off day for them. I received an email from the owner asking me to send him an email and I did... it was returned as undeliverable. I then sent him a message on yelp and never heard back. I was a bit bummed but no big deal, I'm sure he's a super busy man! Fast forward to tonight... we went back with no hard feelings whatsoever. Our experience started out great with just beers at the bar. We stayed for quite some time and enjoyed drinks and delicious food. When we tried to close out things got ugly. We had a gift certificate that totaled more than our bill so we paid with that. We got the slip back with the amount (no line to add tip - it was just a final receipt) and no card with the remaining balance. We waited for SO long to get a card with our remaining balance. We also then had to give our credit card to have the bartender run a charge for $.01 just so we could tip. So, so underwhelming and disappointing."}
{"text":"We have been to Salvatore's twice now. We first tried it based on my brother's recommendation. Some of the best pizza we have had, definitely my wife's favorite. Only two slight drawbacks, I could go for a little more cheese on my cheese pizza  and it's a little pricey."}
{"text":"Salvatore's is a go in my book! We went during peak dinner times on a Friday, and had about a 30 min wait. It was too muggy for us to want to sit on the patio, but good to know that's an option. The place is quant, which only adds to the charm as long as you don't mind the wait.   My two friends and I shared the fig and bacon speciality pizza, with Gorgonzola and wine-poached fig. I've really only eaten fig newtons before, but it was unexpectedly delicious! Not too sweet either! The portion size was bigger then expected, and easily fed the three of us.   Our other vegan friend ordered the vegetarian tacos and was a little underwhelmed. I wouldn't go to a pizza place and not order pizza, but hey she seemed pretty satisfied. She commented that the carrots were too big to eat gracefully and it was super messy. Tasty, but not first-date material."}
{"text":"Favorite pizza in Madison. The specialty pizzas are all great, but my favorite is the Carbonara. Don't forget to create your own tomato pie (different than the specialty pizzas)."}
{"text":"The El Mapache Loco is the best pizza I've had in my life. We talked it over and over, and it's true: the best pizza I've had in my life. Thank you Salvatore's- we're so thrilled you moved in down the street!"}
{"text":"Mixed bag on this one. Lovely little place.  Not sure what they are trying to be, exactly. Part of their decor is a small, intimate charm due to the cozy place, their menu suggests they are trying to be eclectic with their variety of pizzas with an amazing mix of toppings, their crusts are fantastic!   I go there and they ask do you have a reservation? I called the other place mistakenly & said no I did not. I said party of 2 can u squeeze me in? The hostess got snippy w/ me & said 30-45 min wait. Ok I went to car to make a call. Come back 15 min later suddenly some people leave. She begins pushing tables together even my party of two could of been waited on. She had an attitude as she seated me & my son.  The waitress came and was very pleasant. Large selection of bottles beers to go w/ the variety of pizzas. After  bit my waitress suddenly boxed everything up and presented me with the bill. It was odd. No ... \"Can I get you something else? \"   Even though there were two large parties surrounding me & people seemed to be enjoying themselves, I got the impression by my waitresses actions and the hostess who occasionally glanced over at me that I was being hustled out of the restaurant. Ive never felt like that before.    I looked around at the 2 large groups ( parties) and all other patrons in the restaurant were couples and thought : They figure that they wont make any money on me & me son and thats why Im being rushed to leave. So, in conclusion Good pizza, service was fine but didnt care for the hostess with blond highlighted  hair. I guess Id be better treated if I was on a date. Cant say I want to return. I would try the downtown restaurant but not coming back to Sun Prairie cause Im not good enough for them. Just cant figure it out. Tuis is a pizza joint right? Not high society fine dining? Coulda fooled me!"}
{"text":"Wonderful food!  Creative menu.  Love the use of fresh and local ingredients!  We have never ordered anything here we do not like.  Very excited for them to move into a bigger location downtown.  Being Italian, I've longed to have a nice Italian restaurant in Sun Prairie!  Can't wait to see what else they ad to the menu!"}
{"text":"The BEST pizza in town! I love Sal's and I was so happy when they opened in Madison."}
{"text":"We had a pizza with just underground pepperonis and it was delicious!  The crust was perfectly chewy and crunchy, sauce was the perfect combination of sweet and tangy, and the cheese provides great texture and permeates the entire pizza with it's amazing flavor.  I love it when two local businesses team up to make a great product!  If you're in the Madison area, it's definitely worth the drive."}
{"text":"All I can say is wow! I did not expect this in sun prairie.   I just moved here and I have had pizza from all over the country and their fig and bacon is by far one of the best I have ever had anywhere--hands down!  You don't need to read anything else just come here and try it for yourself! It is amazing!!"}
{"text":"Ah this place is heaven. My husband and I went for dinner Sunday night. It was our first time there. I had been recommended by a coworker. Pretty small restaurant, but it's cozy. The little candles on the tables were a nice touch.  We got the pie known as \"fat uncle tony\"; which had sausage and bacon. Best. Pizza. Ever. Everything is fresh and just the right temperature. And the staff was super polite. We will most definitely go there again!"}
{"text":"The hubs and I went to Salvatore's for dinner on a Friday night after I finally decided that what I wanted was fig pizza.  We drove up to Sun Prairie because unfortunately they deliver up to 6 miles away and we live 8 miles away.  o.O  Apparently moving to a bigger city doesn't get you delivery privileges.  Lame.  The restaurant sits in a very unassuming strip mall next to a Check Advance in small town, Wisconsin.  Let's be honest, it's just kind of adorable.  It's very clear that it's a family run type deal due to the mothering nature of the head server and the young age of the others working behind the counter.  It's clear they were learning a lot about running a restaurant and soaking it all in.  We had to wait about 15 minutes for a table for 2, but they had a little waiting area with a bench and a childrens toy table, so that was cute.  Some other people waiting had drinks which was nice, I don't know how long they had been sitting there though.  Once we were seated we ordered off their beer list which was pretty extensive given the size of the restaurant.  There were several I was interested in, but ordered a standard wheat beer while the hubs got one of the Surly beers they had.  We placed our order for the fig, gorgonzola, and bacon pizza and we were off.  Although, ALL of their specialty pies looked awesome and if we hadn't come with the intention of eating the fig pizza, it probably would have taken us a long time to decide what to order.    Salvatores also serves tacos which is kind of strange, but I snooped on other peoples food, and they didn't look bad.  My only comment on my food snooping is that they have a heavy handed approach with their garnishes.  Many of them are flowers, and while they might have been edible, I don't think people actually want to eat flowers with their burrata or their tacos.  Call me crazy, but all garnishes should be edible and functional.  It just makes sense.    That aside, our pizza was very tasty.  My only comment on that is that the pizza is HUGE and so the toppings are very spread out.  I would prefer to get a bite of bacon AND fig in every bite.  This could easily be accomplished by doing things like cutting the fig into smaller pieces to sprinkle on top.  Same amount of figs, more surface area, BAM deliciousness in every bite!  And lastly, the temperature inside the restaurant was very warm.  I'm sure this has to do with having a kitchen very open to the dining room and hey, pizza ovens get super hot.  I get that.  But it was bordering on uncomfortable, especially in the humid heat of the day.  Maybe look into a better way to circulate air at least throughout the dining room.  TL;DR the pizza is great, the atmosphere is homey, PLEASE DELIVER TO MY HOUSE SO I CAN SATISFY CRAVINGS THE LAZY WAY!"}
{"text":"Omg!! This guy has some creative pizza!!! First time I tried it I was like: where have I lived for the past 37 years. I got nothing but positive things to say how tasty and creative the pizza is. Loved it, wish I can give it 10 stars"}
{"text":"Great food, Great new space, Great service and an owner who takes care of his employees! Stands up for them when nobody else will. Great local business to support! Would love to have another Salvatore's in Cottage Grove!"}
{"text":"We love to come to Sal's because it's a friendly and cozy place. Everything is carefully made with top quality ingredients. Great pizza options and antipasto boards for a salady craving."}
{"text":"Best pizza I've ever had. Yummy local ingredients. Pizza made with LOVE! Great service great atmosphere! My husband said they have the best sausage ever!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here, and I cannot wait to come back! What a unique experience, made even better by Underground Food's cured meats and Nessalla Kombucha. YUM. One pizza that really stuck out to me was a pie that had smoked trout and summer squash. Beautiful!!"}
{"text":"I an so excited to be the first to review this gem!!  For those of you not in the know, this is a branch of a restaurant in Sun Prairie of the same name, with a stellar rep. I have been looking forward to their branch opening in my hood for months, and they have lived up to the hype.  This did not feel like an opening weekend at all. D√©cor, food, and service all felt pretty much spot on. They have a great beer selection; I got a yummy sour ale from a brewery I was unfamiliar with (Funk Session 5), which tends to impress me. My boyfriend and I enjoyed our ales while waiting to be seated. The bar area is a little cramped, but I think they've done really well provided the space.  We had a house salad, with a pesto-y vinaigrette and tons of veggies (radishes, beets, cukes, mixed greens, etc.). Very fresh. Perfect start to a meal.  We ordered the Jalape√±o Asesino pizza. Omg. Fresh jalape√±os, chorizo, chicken, a kind of chimichurri-style sauce drizzled on top...super flavorful, and with that perfect level of heat that doesn't blow out your taste buds, but builds slowly on your tongue. Fab.  It's pretty dangerous how close I live to this place..."}
{"text":"Went to Salvatore's on a Friday night to check out the new place and it really looks nice! My daughter was a former employee and wanted to try their new menu. We had the Forza and Terrance's favorite pizzas, obviously very fresh ingredients and the tomatoes and caramelized onions were to die for!! Oh ya the Wisco old fashioneds were mighty tasty. Coming back to sample the expanded menu. Getting hungry writing, gotta go."}
{"text":"Awsoooooome would come back and this time will get the wife and the baby.  A very good place to hangout with your family"}
{"text":"LOVED this pizza place!  A friend of mine is a waitress here and has been telling me about it for a few months now.  We had no children so we decided to have a date night and try out Salvatore's!  It was delicious!  We had garlic bread for an appetizer - WOW!  So so so garlic-y - LOVED!    Then we built our own pizza - garlic with half mushroom and half pepperoni.  Absolutely fantastic!  I can't wait for left overs tomorrow!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in the area hands down. Pizza is a bit pricy but you get what you pay for.   I was delivered the wrong pizza but the driver drove quickly back to the pizzeria and got me the pizza I ordered. Awesome delivery service."}
{"text":"What a GREAT addition to Madison's near east side!  Even though the specialty pizzas get featured billing on the menu, and are pretty tasty, the more traditional pies - especially build your own - are spectacular because the tomato sauce is just amazing!  Everything about Salvatore's highlights locally sourced ingredients.  The crust is sturdy, crisp, and yummy.  I could make a meal of a plain pie - tomato sauce, mozzarella, Romano, basil.  Nothing else needed, although it's hard to resist adding from the long list of protein, veg, fruit, and cheese toppings.  The House salad features really good seasonal produce.  The only drawback:  the place is wicked loud.  Oh, and there are only a few tables, so be prepared to wait for one.  But the bottom line here is very, very good pizza, very good salad, very good, fresh, locally sourced food."}
{"text":"Salvatore's is HERE IN MADISON! Woohoo, the Yelp favorite pizza is here!! Let's cheer! No more driving to Sun Prairie for Salvatores!  I was surprised by the size of Salvatore's, maybe 8 tables or so, and the bar area is small. So, I was really thankful to visit on a weekday, when I didn't need to wait for seats, and food didn't take too long to arrive. If you're lost, it's right next to Johnson Public House, and have pizza board with skulls saying Wisco on them (So hipster :p)!  The menu has great selections - lots of appetizers, make your own pizza, specialty pizza and tacos!!! Pretty excited about all these things. Also, there's a good selection of beer and non-alcoholic drinks.   I loved the carbonara pizza - eggs, bacon, cheese. my FAVORITE THINGS. AND, how is it possible that ALL 3 eggs were RUNNY. Such an amazing creamy, rich flavor with runny yolks! The crust of the pizza is thin crust, though not italian thin, but has great chew to it. (P.S. the ~8\"/$14 pizza was so big, we had some leftovers; the leftovers were AMAZING. just heat them up in the oven. oooohhhhh good)  We also tried the bacon and cheese bread (even though it was similar to our pizza..), the sriracha sauce added some much flavor and depth! LOVE IT.   Definitely gonna be visiting very soon again! How about some delivery very soon??? Please? :D"}
{"text":"Such a great experience. Friendly staff! Food was top notch! Calamari came with a spicy dipping sauce which was delish. Pizza was PERFECTION!  We had a Forza and a Half Cheese/Half pepperoni and olive. I'm not usually the hugest fan of crust but let me tell you theirs is exceptional and not a spec went to waste."}
{"text":"I went here on a Friday night and the placed was packed! Service was very good considering we were told the original wait would be an hour and we got seated in 15 minutes! The classic tomato pie was delicious, and so was the farmer tomato pie. Clean place and fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"So, just had the WORST experience at Salvatore's. I was planning on meeting a friend here. So I came to have dinner because he has raved about the food, but because I said I would have someone join me....much later, they wouldn't even seat me. Policy is great, but when a customer who wants to be seated to SPEND MONEY, is denied. One questions their motive. Is it to provide a great culinary experience or just collect revenue per seat."}
{"text":"Awesome find on our way back to Chicago. We will definitely make our way back!  The pizza was fresh, light and absolutely delicious!  The crust was airy but not soggy. Someone else said the cheese/crust ratio was perfect. I didn't get it until I tried it. I agree!  I had a build your own with fig and sausage and it was the perfect sweet and savory blend.  My husband had the carbonara pizza and said it was like eating breakfast on his pizza.   We both really enjoyed our pizza! Glad I called ahead, seating is limited."}
{"text":"Stopped at Salvatore's just as the lunch special was coming to an end... Two slices and a soft drink for $6. I had a delicious veggie slice which included fresh corn. I cannot recall the name of the other two slices but all were very delicious. As we were eating a young man came out of the kitchen carrying a absolutely beautiful trio of fried tortilla topped with fresh golden tomatoes, lettuce and a healthy dollop of burrata. He was taking a picture of his creation. We chatted a bit. The kind hostess/ server offered me one of the treats. I accepted. The food tasted as good as it looked. What a wonderful surprise. Not something you would expect at a pizza joint but of course Salvatore's is not exactly a typical pizza joint. It is an artists studio."}
{"text":"If you love pizza and you've never been here.... you're not doing it right. Hands down, Salvatore's has the best Za in the Madison area, made with love and locally found ingredients. The location itself is small but eccentric and inviting (if dining in I'd recommend reservations). The waitstaff has never been anything but smiley and accommodating.  They do not have a bar, no, but they do have a selection of craft beers and wines. The all local ingredients, creative specials, and amazing crust are what makes this place the gem that it is. Also try the Neuske's Bacon Cheese Bread!"}
{"text":"Most importantly the pizza is awesome. I wouldn't call it tomato pie because it ain't square and it ain't thick, but that doesn't really matter. DO NOT come here during the dinner rush though. My ears were legitimately RINGING after leaving because of the ridiculous din in there, I really hope they get some acoustic help, otherwise I suggest carry-out."}
{"text":"4.5 stars. 5 stars for the food. 4 stars for the service.  Was in Sal's at about 7:30 PM on a Thursday night with my dad. The place was pretty empty which I was very surprised about. There were a few people who came in for takeout though so that made me feel better. It's a small space, but that doesn't detract from the place at all. It seems to fit nicely with the overall message of Sal's!  I would've given this place 5 stars had it not been for the just okay service. Our waitress was on her phone most of the night and while it didn't detract from her serving us, it's just not something I like to see. And the servers were all grouped by the register in front so you could always see what they were doing. And it always seemed they were on their phones. Maybe I'm being a little picky, but that's that.  Food was great! (As expected). I had had the Farmer John's Smoked Gouda before so opted for something different. It was awesome that you could split your pie in two and have a specialty on one side and a build your own on the other. I tried Terrence's Favorite per our servers recommendation, and my dad ordered pepperoni, sausage, onions and mushrooms on his half. Everything was super yummy! I would pay big bucks for that sauce and put it on everything. The crust was also perfect. Not soggy at all with just the right amount of crunch on the crust. I absolutely cannot wait to try my next pizza from Sal's! From what I've tasted, it's no surprise they're the best pizza in Madison!  Maybe just try and keep your servers off of their phones while they're working."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Madison. They use quality ingredients for the entire Pizza.  Have ordered from them multiple times and never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"I've visited Sal's twice and was extremely impressed on both visits. The pizza is delicious and the ingredients are fresh. The specials are always creative and enticing. The only downside is that the restaurant can get very loud."}
{"text":"We ate here tonight and it was the best pizza we've had in all of the Madison area.  We live in Black Earth and can't wait to hear more about the Verona location!!! I woukd give the pizza 5+ stars and the garlic bread was amazing as well."}
{"text":"Sun Prairie has a real gem in this place. Excellent service from the moment you walk in the door. Very busy, bustling atmosphere so it's great that they take reservations-you'll probably need one. They're known for their pizza but their appetizers are excellent as well. We had a melon salad with so many tiny, beautiful ingredients I had never seen or heard of before! We also enjoyed the grilled corn appetizer. Both starters perfectly embodied summer flavors but in completely opposite ways: one sweet and light, the other smokey and charred. I had the special pie which boasted a smoked tomato sauce and succulent, citrus shrimp that somehow remained plump and juicy after their stint in the pizza oven. My son had a gluten free pizza and he loved it. Oftentimes GF crusts can be soggy and unable to handle their toppings but this was sturdy and crisp but not like cardboard, as some GF crusts can be. He also remarked that he enjoyed the fresh basil scattered on the pizza. That final flourish is an example of what you can expect every plate from the kitchen at Sal's to be: an extremely well-thought out dish executed to perfection."}
{"text":"Had pizza(carbonara)and a salad. The salad was small and sad..  The food was ok but I have had better for the price. If your going to charge so much at least put some salad on the plate. I understand and appreciate the freshness. But not worth the wait and the services was poor. The prices are very high. Maybe spend the money on your staff. Probably will pass on a return to this place. Im sticking with Pizza Brutta better service and less cost for same quality pie."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best Being from the owners home town In New Jersey it was so nice to enjoy a real tomato pie since I moved to Minnesota. Can't wait to return but let me pay next time buddy."}
{"text":"I've heard nothing but good things about Salvatore's Tomato Pies from friends, family and (of course) the many Yelp reviews. So, tonight my husband and I made the drive out to Sun Prairie to check it out. It was early, yet the parking lot was full. Half of the restaurant was taken up with 2 large partties leaving only 3 small tables, which we had a 45 minutes wait for our turn to eat.  The service is fantastic and the pizza is good too. While I really wanted the Fig and Bacon pie, the hubby just isn't that adevnturous so we shared Terrence's Favorite with italian sausage, carmelized onions, roasted red peppers and goat cheese. It was very good, but I agree with one other reviewer... the toppings are a bit sparce.  If you choose to order soda it will come in a can with a glass of ice. I'm only noting this, because I prefer fountain soda when out to eat  The service is fantastic, the host, waitress and other staff were all very, very friendly! I'm looking forward to another visit (and trying the Fig and Bacon pie)"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, service, great pizza choices, apps, and drink choices. Margarita pretty good."}
{"text":"Madison's pizza scene has significantly improved over the past five years.   Salvatore's Tomato Pies is a driving force in the turnaround.   My wife and I visited the newer downtown location, rather than the original in Sun Prairie. The space is cozy, but we were seated right away even though we dropped in between 6:30 and 7:00 on a Saturday night (it was gorgeous outside on this day, so most of the city was probably outside at the Terrace already).   The beer list isn't overwhelming in size (6-8 taps), but has a nice mix of craft options that paired well with the menu items that we tried. On this day, I tried a unique Black Wheat (My Name is Joe) from 3 Sheeps that had a nice coffee flavor (4.5 out of 5).   We ordered the seasonal salad, which is currently the most beautiful thing I've ever eaten. The taste held up against the visual appeal with a mix of seabeans, arugula, pleasant ridge reserve, strawberries, snap peas. violas, baby rainbow carrots, squash blossom, strawberry vinaigrette.  Rather than build our own pie, we tried the Forestiere (description from Sal's menu: Thinly sliced onions, bacon lardons, cr√®me fraiche, Pleasant Ridge Reserve, fresh thyme and local mushrooms). The pizza was cooked perfectly, and held a crisp but chewy texture. The ingredients meshed very well together, and the cheese was so good that it stole the show from the bacon. Yes, the bacon rode shotgun, and it was very good bacon!  This is our new go-to place in Madison for great pizza, and one that we will undoubtedly share with family and friends for years to come with the goal of eating through the entire menu and trying as many of the seasonal specials as possible.

{"text":"Best pizza ever!!  Salvatore's has fantastic pizza, with the best crust I've ever had!  We shared three pizzas...chicken Florentine was good, my daughter had a goat cheese and roasted tomatoes pizza that was fabulous, and I had a ricotta cheese and roasted garlic that was to die for. Very reasonable bottles of wine. Very small place...make a reservation!!  Can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"I'll make this simple - the best place to get pizza in Madison. Only complaint I can think of is that there is typically a long wait, but it is totally worth it. If you do experience a long wait, walk over to JPH next door and enjoy a coffee before dinner!"}
{"text":"The best place in Sun Prairie for pizza.  I absolutely love the bar.  The bartenders are attentive and crafty with the cocktails.  They have rotating craft beer draft selections.  I've tried various pizza from  the menu, wood fired type pizza and fresh toppings. I can taste the difference with this pizza.  In my opinion it is worth the price of the pies which is a little more than some places in the area. Recommend highly!"}
{"text":"I finally decided to try Salvatore's after hearing so many great things about the place.  I called ahead (about 3pm) and asked for a pizza to be ready at 5:45pm for pick up. I was a little irritated to arrive and still had to wait about 7 minutes (which was making me late for an appointment).   I ordered Terrence's favorite.  I thought it was pretty tasty, I'm not typically a fan of sausage, but thought it had good flavor. I loved the goat cheese as a special touch. I enjoyed it, though wasn't blown away - I think I had higher expectations since I had heard so many great things.  I will order again as their pizzas are intriguing and would like to try others."}
{"text":"I know there have been a ton of reviews for this place but I'm adding my two cents worth anyway. Last week, chef Tory Miller (Graze/L'Etoile) invaded the kitchen at the renowned Salvatore's Tomato Pies in Sun Prairie to offer up a special 16 inch pie called \"The Red Dragon\". The event was a special fund-raiser for Sherman Middle School's Garden program. Now those who know me know that I don't typically like spicy foods, and I'm more of a traditionalist when it comes to pizza, so it will be a surprise to most of my friends that I pursued a pizza with Dragon in the name. However, the opportunity to try one of Chef Miller's creations was all the incentive I needed to push my boundaries.....and they were blown away! Luckily reservations had been made,  as shortly after our arrival the somewhat limited dining room was packed and had a waiting line. We ordered a nice bold red to accompany the anticipated hard-charging flavors of the pie and it worked perfectly. As predicted,  the creation lived up to its billing. It was smothered edge to edge with as many ingredients as I've ever seen packed onto a pie. (and I used to work at a pizza place in college, so that's saying something! ) Grilled bok choy, shredded carrots, kimchi, shredded kohlrabi,  pearl rice crackers, cucumber, gochujang sauce (which I believe is a Korean chili infused tomato sauce), pork bugog I (spicy sausage), cheese and eggs (yes...EGGS!) from Pleasant Ridge Farm, and several other ingredients that I can't remember.  The flavor assault began with the pie being placed on the tomato can pizza holder and the aroma giving us a hint of what was to come. That first bite was a burst of exploding flavors and the heat started up quickly. What was so special about the pie was that the various ingredients blended so well but each of them showcased itself at one time or another. One bite featured cucumber,  the next had a definite egg flavor,  that would be followed by the kimchi , and so on, until our stomachs held only enough room to enjoy the honey panacotta with macerated berries for dessert. (wonderful itself!) This fortuitously left two slices to take home and enjoy the experience all over again at a later time.  Salvatore's has become one of the premier pizza destinations in the Madison area due to its farm-to-table philosophy and its expertly crafted pies. Apparently bigger and better things are in store as our server told us they are hoping to find,  and move into, a new location that will better accommodate their growing legion of fans. With additional special events like this one, and their continual exploration of the pizza flavor frontier, it wouldn't surprise me at all if they had to expand again soon after. I'm looking forward to my next trip back!"}
{"text":"Were these the best pizzas I've had in Madison? Maybe, if \"best pizza\" equates to flavor explosions in your mouth, and a lot of them. The pizza toppings were creative but familiar, and the ingredients were fresh and local. I loved the nutty wheat crust, with crispy bottoms and a juicy middle.   Salvatore's, if anything, will impress you with good service and good business sense. Checks were split at the onset of order, all cards were taken, and because of our odd number of people and the way we wanted to split the pizza, our server suggested we do 16 cuts instead of the usual 8 -- genius!  Even better, I couldn't believe my eyes at the amount and quality of food we had, for the price. Plus, they have Sprite Zero.   It's a drive away from where I live, but all these things combined, it's worth the half hour trip in below zero temperatures and blowing snow."}
{"text":"This is the best pizza I've had in the Madison/Sun Prairie area.  Hands down.   When you walk in, it's a small dining room lacking in d√©cor.  There is a service counter in front of a beverage cooler and a kid's play area that is an eyesore, and the tables and chairs look cheap.  But, who cares when the pizza is this good?  The crostini appetizer they had the night I went was only so-so.  It was a gorgonzola and fig crostini, and the figs were poached in wine and drizzled with an overpowering balsamic glaze that was too much.  The gorgonzola was totally lost and there was not enough of it.  The bread was not that great either.  But the pizza is another story.     Salvatore's Tomato Pies gets the foundation of the pizza right with the crust, sauce and cheese, and adds wonderful, locally sourced ingredients as the toppings.  The crust is fabulous.  Thin, with just the right amount of chewiness and crispiness.  The sauce has a great balance of fresh tomato flavor and acidity and sweetness.  You can tell they use the best ingredients they can find.  They use local farm market ingredients when possible and get meats from Underground Food Collective.    If you can look past the cheap d√©cor and the somewhat spotty service, the pizza is well worth it.  Yes, it is a little bit pricy, but you get what you pay for.  This is high quality stuff - it ain't no Pizza Hut."}
{"text":"Ok, so, its been several years since I have been motivated to write a Yelp review, and this time I can't stop myself.  I even dreamed about what I would write overnight.    We finally found an excuse to go to Sal's after having heard about the place from several friends.  Truthfully, I really wasn't in the mood for pizza, but I was even less in the mood to make dinner myself - so, with my husband at the helm and his pizza-finding nose, we arrived at Sal's.    Upon walking into the place, my mood was not uplifted.  They had two parties already, leaving only one rather large round table for our family of 4 (including one in a highchair).  Fortunately, one of the two parties discovered that they didn't need one of their tables which opened up a slightly smaller round table for us.  Ughhh.  All I could think was that we were behind 2 enormous party tables and if I was grumpy from hunger, my 9-year-old was really going to do us in.  After a few moments of staring at the menu (and yes, ordering a glass of wine, which was not only good for me but was good for the rest of my family), I fixated on a golden and red beet (yes, BEET) and bacon (yes, BACON) pizza with smoked gouda and goat cheeses. I can't remember the rest of the ingredients, because the menu had me at beets and bacon.  My husband ordered the Fat Uncle Tony pizza (read: lotsa meat) and my daughter ordered the cheesy bread with bacon.  Despite the large tables ahead of us, dinner was out in no time and, well, then it was all over.  I can honestly say that despite my love of pizza and proclamations over the years as to what is the best pizza I've ever had - which includes several award winning pizza places, THIS IS THE BEST PIZZA I'VE EVER HAD.  Fortunately my husband and I could not agree on what pizza to order so we ordered two, which was VERY indulgent of us given that they are 16 inch pies, I'm soooooo glad.  I brought a few leftover pieces for lunch today, with the rest being saved for dinner tonight.   I could go on about the other menu items because there wasn't a thing on the menu that wasn't tempting and the service was extraordinary, especially considering that the server was overrun with parties, but all this seems completely unnecessary given the perfection of the pizza.       Here is my ONLY suggestion.  Get into a larger location in, say, downtown Madison, where access to this amazing pie can be opened up to the masses.  With little parking in the not-so-cute strip mall and even less table space inside Sal's, it easy to see how many would turn away before even getting in the door.  I challenge you to stick with it or even order to go (which is what I'll do next time just so I don't have to risk arriving too hungy to wait) - it will be worth it!"}
{"text":"Fellow Yelpers, Thank you!  Thank you! Thank you!   I found this place through this wonderful resource.  Mom lives on the far east side of Madison  so I thought I'd  to Sun Prarie.  I  wanted to find a good pizza joint. but  I didn't ......I found a GREAT pizza joint.  There were several of their specialty pizzas I wanted to try but Mom wanted a basic Pizza.  I can't wait to go back.  The quality of ingredients are exceptional and the food is best described as artisan crafted great pizza.    Will be back again and again!!"}
{"text":"Easily the best pizza I've had in the Madison area. I just wish it was located more downtown.  The pizzas are very large so bring a friend... Or many friends. They only serve one size. The toppings are fresh and local, from the cheese to the vegetables.   Call ahead and put your name on a list because seating is limited and this place is always packed."}
{"text":"About a week ago my wife and I stopped in.  I was told about this place at a Yelp event held at the Roman Candle.  The couple was split as to who had the best pizza pie.  I can see why.  The pizza was great!  The space appeared to be underutilized.  No full bar.  No taps.  That's the only reason I give them 4 out of 5 stars.  You won't be disappointed in the pizza.  Trust me!"}
{"text":"Amazing.  The absolute best pizza pie ever in my mouth.....got the veggie, the hunk of garlic, Carmelized onions,  mushrooms, yum"}
{"text":"Excellent pies with fresh ingredients. and a good choice of beers and wine. Family friendly."}
{"text":"Salvatore's is the best pizza place in Madison in my opinion. There are a lot of really good specials with unique ingredients and more standard pizzas are excellent as well."}
{"text":"Food here is great. All the ingredients are fresh, and it makes a huge difference. The restaurant itself is small, but still a great atmosphere. We do usually order to go since we are a bigger family.  Staff is always nice and the pizza is always hot and when we pick it up.  Price is higher than going with a chain  pizza place, but it is so much better."}
{"text":"I had the special whatever it was but it was good. I wouldn't say amazing but from all the reviews they must make some good pizzas it's just picking the right one. Had to wait a while too."}
{"text":"I love supporting local restaurants; the quality of the food is always fantastic, especially when they seem to take a real pride in the quality of their food. Salvatore's food really embodies that and it's a great place for pizza. I ate here on Friday with my husband after work. It was pretty busy, but we got in right before a crowd of people started lining up. We split a garlic bread appetizer which came with buttered sliced bread loaves and a roasted garlic puree served separately. You can do half-and-half orders on pizzas, so we ordered the The Applewood and Farmer John's smoked gouda. The Applewood has apple wood smoked bacon, spinach, and tomatoes and the Smoked Gouda pizza has smoked gouda, caramelized onion, tomatoes, garlic and bacon.  They were also sprinkled with fresh basil; the pizzas were fantastic. I'd highly recommend this place and will be going back again soon."}
{"text":"Great place for great food. Strongly recommend reservations, as it is always beyond busy. Service is usually outstanding, last time we went our server was lacking a bit.  Children's menu is beyond generous and reasonably priced.  The pizza is amazing, desserts are always a delicious treat.   Highly recommend giving it a try, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place has fantastic lunch and dinner specials.  Don't think that this place just has pizza...nonono.  It has fantastic appetizers like salad, burrata, vegetable antipasto and bread! Their main course can also be tacos and the tortillas are absolutely fresh. They also have small plate specials which could pass as a full meal. Last but not least, there's dessert. Always something different. Give them a try but if you come hungry or with friends you can try many wonderful tastes. Don't pass this up! Make a visit to this place a priority."}
{"text":"In my list of amazing pizzas I have ever had in my entire life this comes third. The first two are from New York, only the best pizza ever created. We had the Jalape√±o inferno, the carbonara and the forza. All three were amazing. I couldn't pick a favorite. The Jalape√±o Inferno was super spicy, the runny yolk in the Carbonara was delicious and I loved the garlic with the gouda. The atmosphere was relaxing and modern. The hostess and our waitress were extremely nice and accommodating. If you're visiting Madison you have to come here."}
{"text":"Simply the best pizza in the country. Everything is locally sourced. You can taste the freshness of everything including the cheese.  I have seen the chef at the farmers market several times. wow!! You cannot get better tasting pizza anywhere and a place that actually cares about their product and quality. Fig and bacon is my favorite. One bite and it will be paradigm shifting for you!"}
{"text":"Salvatore's pizza is hands down just the best pizza around.  I have tried many options--special pizzas as well as those with my own choice of toppings--at both the Sun Prairie and Madison locations on at least a dozen visits.  The consistency of Sal's pizzas is fabulous!  It means the repeat diner is highly unlikely to be disappointed.  Sometimes I order a salad, which has ranged from okay (in dead of winter) to great (in high local market season).  Other menu items tempt but I have not gotten past the pizza yet.  It is that good.    Service has always been pleasant.  The only critique I can offer is that neither location offers much in the way of atmosphere.  The Johnson St. location Is always crowded and pretty noisy while Sun Prairie has little charm (hopefully the new location will remedy the charm deficiency).  But the pleasure of really delicious pizza compensates for the lackluster atmosphere."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place for nearly a year now.  We came with a group of 5 and were worried by the size of the place if they would be able to accommodate, and they did, immediately.   Our server was very nice and apologetic as we ordered wine after wine that they did not have available at the moment. We finally settled on something he suggested that was available.  We ordered the burrata and bacon cheese bread for apps. The burrata came served with crostini, greens, cherry tomatoes and whole, roasted garlic cloves. It was amazing! The bacon cheese bread came with a spicy dipping sauce which was also very good.  We each ordered a different pizza, and all were delicious (chicken florentine, fat uncle Tony, forza, and two build you own). The crust is what really makes these pizzas. I rarely ever eat crust without it being soaked in garlic butter, but it was hard not to eat every last bite of each piece.  They need a larger place, though I suppose that might be some of the \"charm\". Pizza was great, but nothing beats Marcine's, and I'm still on the search for the super thin crust pizza."}
{"text":"First let me clarify the 5 star rating is for the food only.  The ambiance is pizza parlor all the way and does not do justice to the magic happening in the kitchen.  The pizza is absolutely one of the best pizzas I have eaten in my life, and that says a lot coming from someone who spent 20 years in the East coast pizza belt (NY,NJ,PA).  I never bother to eat the crust of a pizza....I ate the crust at Salvatore's because it was perfection.   The market vegetable plate, was presented with 3 spreads and a board of crisp fresh vegetables that was a gourmet delight in it self!  Even the carnivore agreed. Clearly Salvatore's is a testament to the bounty of delicious fresh food available in Wisconsin and the incredible creative talent in the kitchen.   I ate a slice cold the next day and it was really good, not at all cardboardy like most pies when cold, and then I re-heated the rest and it too was delicious.  That's the hallmark of a perfect pie.   Oh how I wish Salvatore's would move closer to a location in downtown Madison more fitting to the talent of the chef(s).  Wait, it is August!  time for the Perseids, wish, wish, wish"}
{"text":"I am a Chicago pizza fan (deep dish is ok but the tossed and thin crust pizza in Chicago is to die for).  I love the tastes at this place, the homemade pizza sauce is more savory than sweet, and the cheese...oh...so good (I prefer to add Gouda to my mix).  Still in love with the burrata and can't wait to try the new dishes.  The aesthetics of the place is beautiful and cozy."}
{"text":"I have lived in Madison for 12 years and have never found a better pizzeria. Every time I go here I get the same pizza, Goat Cheese and Bacon. It is SO flavorful and all the of the food is all farm to table and Patrick (the owner) personally knows all farmers that supply his ingredients. I recently moved to Saint Paul and all of their pizza is spicy and weird so when ever I visit Madison I make sure to go to Sal's."}
{"text":"Salvatore's is the best restaurant in Sun Prairie.  I love the organic ingredients and specialty pizza they make.  \"Terrence's Favorite\" pizza is my favorite too!  Note, the seating goes fast on the weekends."}
{"text":"Great place to get pizza!  I love their more \"gourmet\" combinations.  There is always something new to try.  Their attention to detail and the fact that they use local farm fresh ingredients is a plus.  If you have kids the kids pizza is huge!  You will definately have some left over for another lunch or midnight snack."}
{"text":"Whether you prefer traditional Italian pies or crave creative flavor combinations, Salvatore's has some drool-worthy masterpieces for you. I came here with my Valentine (on the night before the 14th) and was really impressed with the food and service.  Like others have mentioned, the place is small. Upon entering Salvatore's, you walk into a sparsely decorated space with a bar that seats four and a kitchen that extends further back. There was lots of energy at peak dinnertime as chefs prepared pizzas for customers dining in-house and those who ordered for pick-up. The hosts and servers were still extremely pleasurable amidst the chaos. Through a threshold to the left is the dining room, which is painted dark blue and has some romantic decor. I would totally go on another date here!  We ordered the burrata and house salads. Both were light and refreshing, and very large in size. The burrata could have easily satisfied at least four hungry Wisconsinites. The pizza is where I am left a little speechless (in terms of the phrase--because I actually have much to say about these pies). At Sal's when you order a 16\" pizza you can go halvsies on the flavors, which is great because all of their creations sound so good. We split ours between the Forza and El Mapache Loco. I prefer traditional pizzas with red sauce and Italian ingredients and the Forza is now my bar for pies in this category. The pepperoni and peppers packed a lot of flavor and spice. Dollops of ricotta provided a cooling effect and beautiful, smooth textural difference. The purple potatoes on the El Mapache Loco reminded both my man and I of breakfast. The chiles and adobo chicken made for a nice New Mexican take on a classic dish. Overall, the flavors weren't as powerful as the Forza, but I would definitely order it again and recommend it to anyone who wants to experience something new.  We ended up bringing leftovers home and yes, did have the El Mapache Loco for breakfast. Just put a fried egg on it! Can't wait to return and try more of their pizzas, traditional or otherwise!"}
{"text":"Having been here about a dozen times or more, I feel I can provide an informed review.  There are many things to like about the offerings from Salvatore's - beyond just their menu of tomato pies.  The daily pie specials are a favorite of mine, as they tend to be selections that combine newly available or seasonal ingredients in combination with some of the standards to create something completely unique.  Some of the most memorable have at times included roast duck, chorizo and a number of heirloom veggies.  Add to that a rotating array of daily specials for entrees (sandwiches, tacos, etc.) and salads, and you've got the makings for a \"new\" menu every time you venture in.  Those tacos are an item that makes it onto almost every order placed at Salvatore's - I especially like them as an 'appetizer' for carry out orders.  Be aware that they are a bit spicy, so those sensitive to the heat may find themselves uncomfortable with a bite.  I find them flavorful and perfectly spicy.  Desserts, while not fare I typically indulge in, are also a high point for my kids.  The rotating selection of house-made treats make my daughter look forward to each trip here.  I shouldn't write a review without mentioning the tomato pies - these are the primary draw for most customers here, and the offerings from the house are top-rate.  There's something for everyone - meaty, spicy, veggie, etc.  I prefer to mix things up and get each pie our table orders split half-and-half so we get a greater variety of flavors. You can also do a build-your-own, but Patrick and his crew seem to have done a great job refining the flavors of the local ingredients to take that decision out of your hands.  The most important part of the pies, to me, is the crust.  I simply DO NOT eat pizza crust because it is usually too doughy or hard as a rock.  The crust on these pies is something I look forward to eating - it is the ONLY restaurant that I eat the entire slice at.  It plays as big of a part in the flavor as do the other ingredients that are locally sourced.  Without it, I don't think I'd be as big a fan.  Lastly, the rotating craft beer selection is another reason for regular visits.  There is a wide array of styles and flavors to pair with your food.  I've read some reviews expressing concern over the price of the food.  If cost is a concern, I believe Little Caesars is just down the street.  You get what you pay for, and the combination of flavors Salvatore's offers while focusing on supporting local farmers for meats, cheeses and vegetables is second to none.  Follow them on facebook for daily updates on specials."}
{"text":"We returned this weekend to try the revamped menu. As usual, the offerings made the choice pleasantly difficult.   First, the new grapefruit margarita was superb - the well-thought-out ingredients make all of their cocktails a hidden gem (not just pizza), and this was no exception.  Sometimes the preparation of specialty drinks results in a longer than usual wait, but even on a busy Friday nite they were able to get us our thirst-quenchers in short order.  Our first course of the just-added falafel left nothing to be desired - texture and flavor are off the charts - this might be my new favorite appetizer at Sal's or any local eatery. The portion was right-sized for two or three, depending on how much pizza you intend on having.  Our entree was a single pie - half Woodsman and half El Toro.  Not only did it provide us with the opportunity to experience bites both with and without their scrumptious red sauce, but it covered the bases for vegetarians and meat-eaters alike.  I'm NOT one for crust - I almost always discard it in favor of more toppings-laden bites.  But not at Sal's - the crust is soft and airy with a thin crunch and flavor-enhancing char. Every bite is uniquely delicious.  Big thanks to Patrick and his crew for making each trip to Sal's an enjoyable dining experience without any pretentiousness. Their focus is on bringing local flavors to each patrons plate, and they succeed while doing this in a casual, family-friendly environment."}
{"text":"Good pizza, friendly staff.  They were really busy, but they never were always polite and apologized for being late with my pizza, but it wasn't even late I was just early."}
{"text":"This is a very solid pie!  I took their recommendation to get the Forza pie.  It was super tasty.  A great crust with just the right amount of chew.  A great cheese to crust ratio.  The roasted garlic was good, but a little too plentiful to me. For $15 this is a great deal.  I also got the house salad.   Nothing about this salad was out of the bag.  All fresh produce and had slices of rainbow carrots.  The most interesting thing was the cherry tomato.  There was a variety in there that had notes of citrus and pineapple.  It was a game changer for a salad.  Nice move!  Does anyone know what that tomato variety is?  I would agree with the reviews regarding space.  There are very few tables.  Even on a Tuesday night it was a 30 minute wait.    What did I learn today?  This is my new go to pizza next time I am in town."}
{"text":"Ordered from here numerous times in the past and it's always been very good. 4-4.5 stars I'd say. Been a while since I ordered though because the 16\" size is often just too big for my needs.  Today I saw a new 10\" option and ordered my favorite...Terrance's Favorite.  I don't know what it was but this pizza was a knockout!  The flavor was amazing!  Maybe some fresh farmers market tomatoes made their way into my pie?  It was simply the most perfect execution of a pizza (aka tomato pie) that I've ever had."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite pizza place in town.   1. I really enjoy the atmosphere here. Well lit, not too many tables, chill staff. There is often a wait in the evenings but plenty of spots around the area to get a quick drink while you wait. They also do some reservations now. 2. I love the pies. All of the ones I've tried so far really. They have a great crust. Really flavorful toppings. And the cheese....the cheese! So good. 3. Good selection of beers and wine. Bottles of wine are reasonably priced. The staff is also well equipped to suggest a good pairing with your pie.  As I'm writing this review I'm planning my next trip back already."}
{"text":"I could've given Sal's Tomato Pies this five-star review at any point since I started getting pizza from them, because the pizza is, hands-down, my favorite in town. Truth be told, however, I was particularly prompted by Lynne D.'s recent review. Everyone's entitled to their opinion, and I'm not trying to change Lynne's mind, but I have to say this is a pizza worth paying for if you value high-quality food that is locally sourced. The ingredients are head and shoulders above what you get from many other pizza places.   During the summer, I work at the Harmony Valley Farm farmer's market stand on the Square, and I'd be hard-pressed to think of a time I was working when Patrick didn't personally come shopping at the stand. What's even cooler is to, later that same day, see a picture posted on Twitter or Facebook of a featured pie that contains some of the very things I sold him that morning. That is farm to freaking table, right there.  What Sal's provides that I don't find from too many other pizza places is a thoughtfully and creatively conceived pie (the ingredient combos are consistently amazing) that's made from high-quality and local ingredients. If that latter part is valuable to you, you're not just buying a pizza. You're voting with your dollars in support of a business that shares your values. And, in this case, the hot slice of ethos is absolutely freaking delicious, every single time."}
{"text":"I have been to the Sal's in Madison a few times, but I was lucky enough to visit the original location in Sun Prairie with a friend last week. I had no doubt that my experience here would be just as amazing as my past visits to Sal's, and I was not disappointed!  We ordered the Farmer John's Smoked Gouda, half with no bacon (for yours truly). We were told when we ordered that they were out of caramelized onions, but when the pizza arrived, we were happily surprised to see that the chefs had cooked us up just for us. The pizza was incredible, as all Sal's pizzas are.  The cheese and the vegetables were cooked just right. The crust was incredible. It was everything I've ever wanted in a pizza. Every time I eat a Pizza at Sal's I think it's got to be the best pizza I've ever tried...and then I try a new one I like even better. Fantastic job, Sal's! I can't wait for you to move into your new, bigger, better location. I will be back often, I'm sure!"}
{"text":"My new favorite PIZZA.  Outstanding food and service.  The ingredients are all local sourced.  In fact the meats were so good we went to the store of the supplier for meats for tomorrow nights meal.  My wife says she adores the pizza and my son loved it.  Even though it is a 200 mile round trip I would gladly go again. We were in the area."}
{"text":"I love what they've done with this place. The decor is sweet in this small space. They have Nessalla kombucha on tap and the most unique pies you've ever known. Get there early, though, as the lines can be long.   Don't worry, your boring friends can still order \"normal\" pizza, but this is the place to branch out and try new flavors, like Nami Moon Farms red harissa chicken, spruce goad salami, za'atar, tzatziki sauce and oyster mushrooms or Ssamjang marinated Acadian red fish and shrimp, smoked Gouda, scallions, micro shingiku (chrysanthemum), basil and tobiko. Whaaat?? Seriously, I don't know how they think of these combinations, but they have something different every night, and often have fun tacos too. They also make interesting desserts. Last night's offering was rosemary shortbread, earl grey buttercream with orange curd. I'm not sure what this is, but I need more of it in my life (and my belly).  They post their daily pies on Facebook, but you don't even need to read that to decide to stop in. Walk in, say you want the special and go with it!"}
{"text":"When enjoying Salvatore ' s pizza for the first time I had to ask myself if it was the best THING I've ever eaten, because it was certainly the best pizza I've ever enjoyed. Though the specials are often amazing, the Farmer John's smoked gouda is always the go-to for me. Compounding the great food is the great works done in the community to advance healthy, local food consumption. Keep it up Sal's!"}
{"text":"Best pizza ever and it's so close to home for me!  They even have gluten free versions of all the favorites.  Authentic, thin crust with flavor to spare.  Our only wish is that it was open on Mondays."}
{"text":"It's amazing. Always order a 16\". If for some reason the featured pie isn't doing it for you; get the Forza. Nuff said."}
{"text":"Just had an excellent experience here!  The service was fantastic and the food was even better! We ordered the house salad (enough for at least three people) with the buttermilk dressing.  It was a perfect starter.  We ordered the C3PO pizza. Just amazing!  It was lovely to get a visit from the owner/chef.  I can't say enough good stuff about this place! This will be our new \"go to\" dinner out place. It's great to see local places supporting other local businesses."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness is this a stellar pie place! It was hard to choose off the menu, but my friend and I decided to split the veg starter plate and the fig pizza. We were in love with every bite.   Will definitely be back. Lovely outside seating for the summer, and that shop would be cozy in the winter months!"}
{"text":"Truly outstanding pizza! Best we've found in Madison! Our experience started with the best garlic bread we've ever had. The bread was crispy but not because they overbaked it! It was a garlic bread made from a country style loaf. The roasted garlic pate was excellent. Well done!   The pizza unfortunately came only in 16 inch size but that was no problem given how good it was! There was everything from standard toppings to very unique specialty pizzas. The ingredients could only be described as fresh, fresh, fresh. Crust has a crispy bottom but fluffy body. Very tasty, and very unique.   Good service, our waitress knocked herself out to make sure we were having a good experience. The owner, Salvatore, even came out to ask if we enjoyed our meal.   The negative was a small seating area, so it fills up fast during busy times, something I am sure he'll rectify over time. It might have been a little pricier than your standard pizza place but well worth the few extra bucks.   I'd highly recommend this place to anyone who is looking for some really good pizza, not just the standard stuff you get anywhere."}
{"text":"The pizza was good but it wasn't what my son was used to so he refused to eat it. Both of the pizzas came with extra sauce on top."}
{"text":"Very unique and tasty gluten free pizzas. Crust was good, but the toppings made the pizza."}
{"text":"This place deserves 5 stars for food. However, i went to eat in a hot day. No AC, no smoke extractor. Too bad you cannot really enjoy the food"}
{"text":"Not a big fan. I explained that I don't know the beer they have on hand and asked for a recommendation. I like light beer so the bartender gave me a Potosi beer that I couldn't choke down and left it behind. We had a 16\" tomato pie with mushroom, tomatoes and sausage. Very skimpy on the toppings. The sausage was the size of half a penny and maybe 3-4 per slice.  One hole cherry tomato per slice and it defiantly needed more mushrooms.  We were very disappointed as we heard others that wanted to try it. We definitely changed their minds and stay with the great pizza places in Madison.  The sauce was good but that was it.    I guess this makes it all better for poor food and drinks!  If you support your town you can be sub par.   Whoa! Thanks so much!  Potosi makes a pretty solid light pilsner that is well regarded.  Really sorry you \"couldn't choke it down\".   I mean, who says that? What did you want?  Miller light?  That's just not our thing.   That said...we're a family owned business and we work incredibly hard to do something different. To focus on local. We make our sausage from heritage hogs raised in the town of Dunn. Our tomatoes come from young  earth farm in Columbus. 70 percent of the ingredients we use to make from scratch food choices me from Wisconsin. I doubt your \"great pizza places of Madison\" do what we do.   Regardless, I get that we're not for everyone.  But you should be aware that there is a family behind Sal's.  We work hard.  17 hours today making it happen and making things from scratch   We try to do something different, something rooted in my own Italian American culture. And we give back an enormous amount to the community.  Your negative review, hurts small business. It really does. It enables careless chains to dominate.the market. I wish you'd think about that.  Just because you don't like what we do, you can tell that plenty of other people do.  And in the end , what really matter man? Doing good things? Supporting local causes? But if your negative review hurts my business perhaps it makes it so I can't do what I do anymore. I can't support school lunch programs, or food access issues, or my local farms.  Or the countless non profits we support.  For no other reason than YOU just don't like it.   Think about it.  The works is far bigger than your Yelp review. And honestly. It's ok that what we do isn't for you.  I simply ask that you think about it the impact of YOUR words. And how they effect others.   Patrick   Chef, father, husband, citizen and community supporter.  My advise is take care of business and then veering thing else will fall in place. My family had lived here for over 150 years and we to support local towns and businesses. That is still not an excuse for serving subpar food. Learn from it and make it better or get out of the kitchen."}
{"text":"We've spent some serious time traveling through Madison the last couple months and over and over again we heard about Salvatore's Tomato Pies.   And we're like \"okay,\" I hear you, but I live on the road and everybody everywhere recommends a place that has \"the best\" pizza anywhere. And I've learned that the \"the best pizza anywhere\" isn't everywhere, because it's actually in Madison. At Salvatore's Tomato Pies.   Really. Perhaps it's not at all relative that I spend most of my time in Chicago, but maybe it is. They have good pizza there and I've had a lot of it. But this place is \"MY FAVORITE PIZZA PLACE IN THE WORLD.\"  The flavors are focused. The crust is cared for and cooked perfectly. The combos are creative but not overly so. Classics taste better. \"Classics\" are redefined?   Temperature. So often overlooked. But not here. When the pizza hits the table it's at perfect eating temperature. No mouth scalding night ending sizzling runny cheese.   Many of us in humanity don't have the self control to wait for the pizza to cool and the cheese to set. It's a sensible thing to do, but how often do we go to a pizza place simply to be sensible? I appreciate and value that they take the time to let the cheese set and pizza cool before they place it in front of me. Thanks.   I believe a good beer list should be small,  thought out, deliberate and fresh. They have it nailed down. Never in my life would I imagine walking into a  non assuming pizza joint and having a Jolly Pumpkin Seasonal Ale while I wait for my food. Everyone was able to pick out a beer that they were excited about, and the decision process is made easy by having a thought out and limited beer menu.   Thanks.  Glad to have found my favorite pizza place in the whole wide wold.   Chris."}
{"text":"I finally got to eat here, and I can't wait to go back! The pizza was fantastic (we got the Mediterranean Pie with peppers, olives, feta, 'chokes, and prosciutto), the bottle of wine (chosen after consultation with the server) was perfect, and the atmosphere was as comfortable as can be.   The only thing I'd change is the noise level - the acoustics made it hard to hear my tablemates. But everything else, including the wonderfully easy parking, was killer."}
{"text":"Went a douple weeks ago....GREAT staff, food and service.  Well worth the time...THANK YOU!!"}
{"text":"We went here and it was pretty good.  The service was exceptional, the staff was outstanding and very good at suggesting  items that we may like . Wish they had beer on tap as it gets really pricey otherwise. we got one Pizza, an appetizer,and salads.  It was good. Don't know if we would go back, but I do want to try it a couple more times to try the different types of pizza that they have. But I will be ordering water next time is beer gets pretty expensive when you buy it by the bottle."}
{"text":"I've ordered from Sal's a handful of times, and they have never disappointed.  Delicious, locally sourced ingredients.  As they say, \"Wisco, not Sysco\"-love it!  I would definitely recommend this spot, and also the Fat Uncle Tony!"}
{"text":"Not really sure what all the hype is about. After reading such great reviews, my husband and I decided to try this place out. Being new to the area, we were hoping to find a good pizza place in the area, but ended up being pretty disappointed and doubt we will return.   The staff here was good. I appreciate friendly servers and attentive service. I was not impressed by the atmosphere, which was very small. We were seated at a tiny table, and I wasn't sure how our pizza, along with our drinks were going to even fit. I like a bit more table room. There were no decorations or frills whatsoever about this place, and it didn't put off the fun, warm vibe I was hoping for. I would say the pizza was average, at best. I didn't find anything special about the crust or the sauce, and the prices I found to be on the high side, so I was expecting more. I was hoping to find a good pizza place in the area for my family and I to frequent, but this fell quite short of our expectations and I doubt we will return."}
{"text":"No offense to Sun Prairie, but it's rare that the Madison suburb would attract me for food.  This pizza place was worth the drive.  As a Jersey girl, I was attracted to it based on a comment in the Isthmus that referred to it as serving Trenton, NJ style pizza.  I ordered pick up and it was ready when I arrived.  We ordered the Pesto/ prosciutto and the sausage pie.  Both were delicious.  The pesto one had great pesto flavor which was complemented nicely with the roasted garlic and prosciutto.  The sausage had a delicious tomato sauce, but was a little sparse on sausage.  Overall, it was really tasty pizza that is moderately priced (we got two at about $40 for three people and had more than a third for leftovers).  I'm looking forward to trying eating in sometime!"}
{"text":"Great pizza. Great service. This is the best pizza you'll find within 100 miles of Madison."}
{"text":"Simply the pest pizza within 100 miles of Sun Prairie. As an added bonus, the new location is beautiful and they expanded the menu and the seating, added a bar and added more staff. I loved Sal's before, and now it's the best restaurant in Sun Prairie with great food, ambiance and service."}
{"text":"Wonderful creative pizza, fresh ingredients and a friendly staff. Not your everyday pizza joint, you really need to try this place! I like that you can do half & half pizza one side the anchovy special the other side not."}
{"text":"sorry Sals for not providing an update sooner. That Sausage pizza with the goat cheese and roasted peppers is like pizza crack. We can't get enough. You guys rock"}
{"text":"I hadn't been to Sal's since they moved to their new building, so decided to give it a try. I made reservations for 6:30 this past Friday through their website. When we arrived, it was a -little- chaotic..we were told that \"people were still at our table\" and then the host began helping the people in line behind us...no invitation to wait at the bar, no estimate of how long we would have to wait. It felt really weird. So, we stood around for about 20 minutes waiting for our table to open up.  Once we got seated, we ordered drinks & the cheese bread. Nice selection of on-tap beer, I had a cherry cider that was awesome. The bread was fantastic, and unlike any cheese bread I've had before. We ordered the Forza pizza which was O-M-G good. Tons of flavor, but not too heavy, perfect. Our server was great - super friendly and on top of refills.   The food was so good that it made up for the reservation fiasco, but I'll likely just pick up my pizza next time."}
{"text":"Pros:  The pizza.  Definitely lives up to the hype.  Although I am a huge fan of tomato sauce, I actually preferred the non-red sauce pizza (of the two pizzas I tried).  Number 10 was the winner (hold the bacon).  Entire cloves of garlic, baked until buttery (in both taste and texture).   The second best part was that they let you do different pizzas on each half.  Even the specialty pies, even if they have different sauces. That helps justify the price in my mind.   Con:  The number of children running around the (small) restaurant. Many were unruly.  Considering this is very \"adult\" pizza, both in ingredients and price, it was pretty surprising.  But, you can get carry out, so that might have to be the workaround.  Not a reflection of the restaurant, just the parents who come here.  As other reviews said, have reservations or be prepared to wait.  They did allow those waiting to order drinks, but there is no bar or anything."}
{"text":"Always an excellent meal at Salvatore's. It is one of our \"go-to\" places to take people who are visiting us. Great, cozy atmosphere, diverse beer and wine list and, of course, amazing pizzas. We haven't had one we didn't like. When they brought back the jalapeno assasino for a weekend, we couldn't get enough."}
{"text":"Finally visited Salvatore's last night. The staff is friendly, food is amazing, and the establishment is clean, inviting and cozy. Best homemade fries I've ever tasted, hands down. The crust on the pizza is not greasy, light and chewy and perfect. Overall excellent food for reasonable prices in a great atmosphere. I will be returning!"}
{"text":"I checked out Salvatore's due to the recommendation from a friend.  I will address ambiance first. The Skrillex Pandora playlist on the Bose in Salvatore's doesn't really fit with the cozy/quaint atmosphere. And it doesn't really fit with the Italian food. I don't think it fit with anything. And I like Skrillex! There's just a time and place for dupstep/electronic music, and I don't think it's the dinner hour at a small, local Italian joint.  Our server said the house salad was big enough to split, so that's what we did. Indeed it was large, but parts were inedible. What were those extremely hard/chewy yellow-colored slices? I actually think those pieces were spaghetti squash peel sliced in a mandoline.  We ordered a half/half pizza to try two different pizzas from the menu. Both were tasty, very unique and quite different compared to your typical pizza. The goat cheese on the Terrence's Favorite pizza was yum!  All in all, my experience was a little odd, but it wasn't bad. I doubt I'll go back, but I encourage others to give it a shot since the pizzas are so different."}
{"text":"Based on a recommendation from a friend we decided to check out this place for dinner on a Saturday night. We made reservations online but got their early and were seated right away.  Our server brought out a small cup of goldfish crackers for my kid to munch on while we waited to order and then wait for our food. This is a great idea - keeps the kids from getting antsy. My kiddo loved it but would have liked some crayons and paper too (what can I say? She's hard to impress).  I ordered a Moscow mule with my meal. It was very smooth and not too lemony or gingery. We ordered a 16\" tomato pie with calabrese chili, Parmesan fries and a kids pizza with red onions.  The pizza was fabulous! The crust was not too thick not too thin. It was a perfect combo of dough sauce cheese and a little kick of chili at the end."}
{"text":"Yes I finally tried Salvatore's. I work in Sun Prairie and was getting tired of my Subway routine. I stopped here for lunch just to see if they had any lunch specials. They sure did, choose any two pieces of pizza and get a can of pop for $6.00. I thought what a deal. I had two different slices, the first one was the Underground Meats Peperone and Portobello, it was delicioso! The second one was the The Fat Uncle Tony. Both were awesome, the The Fat Uncle Tony was my favorite of the two though. The crust was better than Pizza Brutta, (gasp) yes you heard that right, better! I still love me some PB though.   If your in Sun Prairie you have to try Salvatore's Tomato Pies! 5 stars."}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza pie got glass nickel style cheese bread with the sauce added on top.. what's this B.S? at twice the price of crap cheese bread too jeez...Not impressed on any level actually pretty disappointed all around.the only way it could have been more disappointing was if it was cut into squares. Actually this pizza should be cut into squares as a warning to true pizza heads."}
{"text":"Ok - I am going to be the first admit that I am a bit of a hater.  I am very cautious about trying restaurants outside of Madison.  Is that terrible of me?  Yes.  Most of the time it is because I hate driving if I might get disappointed.  Turns out this place is just a short drive outside of Madison.  It is right on Main Street and easy to find.  Now let's get to the meat of it.  And yes, I mean the MEAT.  We decided to build our own pie.  Frabonni's italian sausage, pepperoni and green peppers.  Wow.  The meat was flavorful without being greasy.  The crust was thin without being too flimsy.  You need a fork and knife for bigger slices but it eventually gets manageable enough to eat with your hands.  The pizzas only come in one size to make everything easy.  The sauce is delicious and they know exactly how much to use.  I can not describe the pizza the way I would like and stay G-rated.  Let's just say I had a moment.   They are generous with the toppings, which impresses me.  Now, we went out on a limb and tried the trio of desserts.  Panna cotta on a bed of pistachios with honey, caramel gelato with strawberries and a chocolate chip cookie and a cannoli.  It was only $9 for 3 desserts!  It was a deal. It could have easily been split by one more person (it was myself and one other person).    Now overall, the price was a bit higher than I like for the pizza but you get what you pay for.  This definitely was not PIzza Hut.  The place is small, there are only 11 tables, but you do not feel cramped.  I loved it.  I want to go again.  As a girl who grew up in Chicago, I can say this is the best pizza I have had in Madison.    I think they have sufficiently invented addictive pizza."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! Food is all excellent and the staff is fun! Great date night place. Inside is small and intimate.  Their pizzas are very unique and interesting. Highly recommend the Forza."}
{"text":"What a fantastic little pizza joint! The atmosphere is cozy and the food is delicious. Fun fact: many of their ingredients (including their flour) is local! The meats are all from local places such as Underground Butcher. Also, their beer selection is fantastic. They're currently featuring a \"Rumpkin\" which is a 17% ABV rum-barrel aged pumpkin beer. Being a non-red-meat-eater, I LOVE the vegetarian pizza. Sal's definitely has a nice take on local and unique ingredients such as beet pesto. You can even get a white bean substitute instead of cheese!  I recommend the mapacho loco. The pizza is rich and a bit on the heavier side, but you can make your own. The staff is friendly as well! Definitely recommend Sal's!"}
{"text":"Favorite pizza hands down. I have tried quite a few of their special pizzas and loved them all. I am not one for plain cheese pizza, but their \"cheese pizza\" is olive oil, mozzarella/romano, the sauce, and fresh basil and it is the most amazing, perfect pizza flavor! They are doing the basics right and anything would be good on their pizza!"}
{"text":"Would eat here every day if that were possible.  The most flavorful and fresh tasting pizza you'll ever experience.  Locally sourced ingredients from area farmers as well as the local farmers market.  The Fig and Bacon is definitely my go to, but you can't go wrong with anything on the menu."}
{"text":"Yeah I loved the pizza.  We got one with sausage, mushrooms, roasted red peppers, and either mushrooms or onions (can't quite remember).  It was basically faultless.  Cheese, sauce, toppings, crust all earned perfect scores essentially.  There was a long wait for a table but it was Saturday, so no surprise.  I'm eager to return some day."}
{"text":"This place has awesome pizza.  We were wanting to try it for a long time and finally made it a point to stop there.  Man were we happy we did.  We had the bacon garlic cheese bread for an appitizer.  Out of this world.  Plated beautifully let me add.   Then we ordered a pizza which they had many options to choose from.  Specialty pizzas are now the big thing.  They allow you to do 1/2 & 1/2 so u can try multiple things.  No extra charge.  Great idea as a company to allow that.  We tried the CP30 and the Fat Uncle Tony.  I would tell you what all comes on it.but dont want to ruin the.surprise.  Out of this world.  Im from the Chicago area and take pizza seriously.  Since now living in WI there has been only two I reccomend.  This place is my new favorite and the other is in Baraboo called Gem City. The wait staff  I give 5 stars.  Very friendly and informative on explaining the menu and options.  Also I want to lastly point out that they have an amazing beer menu to choose from.  Dont be fooled by the location or small venue.  This place is a major contender in the pizza market.  This could be by far one of the best pizza's in all of the Madison area.  Keep up the good work.  Dont change a thing because you just gained another family as now new loyal pizza customers.  Go check this place out you won't be dissapointed! !!!!!!!!  I was told they will soon be relocating right down the road in Sun Prarie to the old La ToTeca resturant.  So bigger venue coming soon."}
{"text":"This was our first time visiting this new location.  I guess they moved locations a little over a year ago.  We live about 30 mins away, but we have never forgotten about the amazing pizza we had long ago.  Last visit was so amazing, it left us with such a wonderful impression we made it a point to come back.  I wish we had come sooner! When entering the place it has a modern hipster feel.  The place is a bit loud when full, but that didn't stop us from having a good time.  We were immediately greeted with hellos and seated by a smiling hostess.  Within minutes we had waters and our drink order was taken.  They had several great craft beers to choose from if you are a beer drinker, otherwise signature cocktails, wine or a full bar for selecting from.  This was during busy dinner time and with a buzzing full restaurant.  We asked a few questions, which the waitress was happy to answer for us.  We were now ready to order! We went with a specialty style 1/2 and 1/2 pizza so we could try some different options.  The Woodsman was an amazing Mushroom pizza with awesome fresh taste on one half and the other half was called the Forza!  This had Gouda cheese, garlic, tomatoes, goat cheese, uncured pepperoni and so much more.  This establishment probably cooks one of the best pizzas we have ever had in the state of Wisconsin. It is that good.  The crust is perfect!  My wife and I both said next time we would try the Fat Uncle Tony's meatlover's pizza.  We wish they served a Margarita pizza with a white sauce.... Prices were reasonable....  the place was clean, service was freindly, food came out fast, and best of all was fresh.  What more can you ask for!  Great job Salvatores!"}
{"text":"First time at Salvatore's and it did not disappoint. We shared the Herb n Cheese Bread with the added bacon and the bread was cooked perfect and I really like the addition of the smoked Gouda and garlic confit. My wife had the corn chowder small size and it was a substantial serving for a small. She really enjoyed the flavors and I was lucky to get one small sip.   We shared a 10\" Woodsman pizza and it was plenty for us and we even brought half home because we were so full. This was a very delicate pizza with very flavorful cheeses and mushrooms.   Definitely recommend and hope to go back soon to try some other pizzas and appetizers."}
{"text":"SO GOOD! We were looking for a place open for dinner on Easter. We found this place complete with a waitress wearing bunny ears and whiskers on her face. The house salad was full of fresh (and local) veggies with a perfect amount of dressing. We ordered the C3PO pizza. Full of great flavors. Definitely worth 5 stars and a repeat visit."}
{"text":"This is just the best pizza in Madison. I was cool on this place at first because the menu has a lot of weird stuff and is missing some Italian dishes you normally hope to see, but there's just no arguing with the quality and consistency of this pizza."}
{"text":"Salvatore's is not in our neighborhood but they were in the Madison City Tin, so we tried it.  I'm glad we did.  We built our own pie, which was the best we've had in Madison, but all the specialty pizzas we noticed around us (and here on Yelp) will keep us coming back to try something new.  Because it is a small restaurant, expect to wait but they are happy to text when your table is ready."}
{"text":"First time in Sun Prairie.  In town for the weekend from Green Bay for some AAU basketball.  Found this place on Yelp.  When I travel I like to dine at places I can't in Green Bay.   I would tell you this is a must have if you are ever in the area.  Their pie reminded me of Lombardi's in Manhattan which is one of my favorite joints.  Took my 14 yo old son and one of his team mates.  We had the 18\" Fat Uncle Tony pie with the antipasti as an appetizer.  Boys weren't crazy about the antipasti. Shocker, right?!  However, the pie didn't stand a chance.  I enjoyed the antipasti and would recommend it for the adults out there.  We also had the cannoli for desert.  Very delish as well.  I thought the prices were very reasonable considering the quality of food, atmosphere, and service.  I've certainly spent more on less worthy.  Bit of a lengthy wait on a Saturday night at around 7:00.  About 65 minutes. I would recommend calling ahead or a reservation if possible."}
{"text":"I've been to Sal's five times and have yet to be disappointed. I follow their Instagram pretty religiously and marvel over their seasonal specials. It might be a problem, but when you try Sal's, you'll understand.  I've started out with the burrata every single time and can't shake it. It's probably my favorite dish in Madison. Everything about it screams fresh. The cheese is homemade, and they pepper the plate with roasted garlic and seasonal goods. My favorite burrata plate had picked radishes and asparagus. Killer.  I've had a variety of pizzas there. The daily specials and the pies listed in the menu are always amazing, but I highly suggest building your own tomato pie. The sauce is out of this world, and most of their daily specials skimp on the red sauce to highlight seasonal ingredients. You can choose from traditional toppings like basil and roasted red peppers to quirkier ingredients like mango and figs. The meat and cheese selection is killer, and I'd recommend putting either the beet or japaleno pesto on yours. Both are unbelievable. In fact, this ENTIRE PLACE is unbelievable.  My only critique about Sal's is that it is way too small and the one time I ordered a taco, the fried alligator(!!!!!) was a little too greasy. I can't NOT give this place five stars, though. This is an irreplaceable spot in Madison."}
{"text":"Great pizza place in Madison!  The ingredients are fresh, and the sauce is amazing! We went with a tomato pie and A specialty pie, both delicious - but I am a bit partial to the tomato pie now.  Definitely one of the best pizza places in the Madison area - be sure to make reservations as this place is always busy."}
{"text":"Checked in at 5:20. 40 minute wait.  Hour later...no indication we will be seated any time soon.  Disappointed as I've recommended this restaurant many times and given gift cards.  Busy Friday.  Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Best Pizza I've had in Madison so far in 10 years living here. Eating here for the first time makes me realize I spend way too much time eating at Ian's, Glass Nickel, etc. and need to try out more places like Sal's and Grampa's in the future! A+ service and food (#1 and #2 specialty pizzas were to die for!) Be back soon!"}
{"text":"I concur with the many positive reviews here.   This restaurant has a great beer list and while the dining room is tiny, the pies are truly special.  I took one star off as I ordered the wrong pie -- got the vegetarian, which was better name goat/beet.  It was good, but not great.   However the veggie tacos were fabulous and the other pies I saw at other tables looked outstanding.  I would certainly not hesitate to go back, but I would not order the beet/goat again.   Also, very helpful waitstaff."}
{"text":"Wonderful pizza unlike any you'll find elsewhere in the Midwest. Some will say it's the crust and the toppings that make it what it is. I say it's in the sauce."}
{"text":"Came here with my sister after reading the yelp reviews and it was great. We started with bacon garlic bread and a small salad, which came with a spicy tomato dipping sauce. We got a half n half large pizza which was delicious, everything tasted really fresh. The server was also very knowledgeable and sweet!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in Madison (Greenbush is a close second). Try it, you will be happy!  Place is pretty small though, so pick-up is probably a better option in most cases."}
{"text":"I had the Jalape√±o Assissino and it was wonderful! My wife built her own with feta cheese...wow! To top it off we had kombucha...mmm. So good!"}
{"text":"Love the pies.  Great crust and always fresh, creative flavors...,, delicious.   Try the Fat Uncle Tony, the Tacos, and their salads.  All great!"}
{"text":"Yum, yum, yum!!!!! We had house salad - delicious mix of a variety of veggies, including black and beauty heart radishes, carrots, cukes, and zucchini. The dressing (basil-based, I think) was so good I had to admonish my son not to lick the plate! We had the pizza special of the day - awesome! My daughter got the carne asada taco - phenomenally flavored meat, and amazing salsa (a little hot).  The server was so nice - because we couldn't decide between the 2 delicious desserts - he offered to buy us one of them - how could we refuse? They were a coconut panna cotta and an amazing caramel bread pudding. Soooooo good!!!  And, the beer is cheap! We will be back - again & again...."}
{"text":"My husband and I have driven by Salvatore's a few times but never had stopped in. Driving by last week reminded us of it and after checking their reviews, we wanted to try it out. Sooooo happy we did! Delicious,  fresh and local ingredients.  Yummy pizza and the bacon cheese bread is aaawwwwsome!"}
{"text":"I don't think there is anything I can say about Sal's that hasn't already been said, except that it is so freaking good I want to cry like every time I go there. It's kind of embarrassing, but thankfully I always go with people who understand."}
{"text":"This unassuming little establishment hiding in Sun Prairie likely has the best Pizza in the entire Madison area. We had two amazing pies: one with figs and goat cheese, the other with pepperoni, sausage, and bacon. Both were amazing! A large salad was easily enough for 2 (though we had 4 along, including 2 kids, and thus it was fine for us too). Even the bread was ridiculously good (but not free). Don't forget to look on the back of the menu as a number of the specialty pizzas are listed there as well. Clearly, if you are ever near Sun Prairie, this is THE place to go!"}
{"text":"Forestiere was sublime, Vegetarian (daughter is vegetarian) was one of the best ever."}
{"text":"I enjoyed Salvatore's pies, but growing up on Chicago deep dish there's no way I could give them 5 stars. Out side of the great food, I absolutely love that they have a kids play area. It's such a great idea that kept the kids in our group of 9 busy and out of the way."}
{"text":"The fig and bacon pizza was fantastic. The careful blend of the meat, fruit and cheeses made each bite a little different, ranging from sweet to savory, but each better than the last. Also, as others have said before, the crust was great.   On the other hand, I was disappointed by my son's pepperoni and sausage. The tomato sauce tasted of vinegar and canning, and the toppings didn't have the same levels of flavor as those on the specialty pie. It almost feels like common pizza is treated as something not with the same effort."}
{"text":"This is the best pizza in Madison, hands down. The place is always busy, so call for a reservation. The only negative I have to share is that there really aren't any great vegetarian options on the menu. You can build your own pizza, of course, or have the meat removed from one of the specials (the Mediterranean without meat is great) of course, but it would be nice to see something special just for the non-meat eaters."}
{"text":"I had some of the best pizza I've ever had last night. No kidding. My hubbie and I decide to have our date night at Sal's Tomato Pies, and we were wowed!    The only negative was the wait. We arrived at prime-time, about 6:45...which means our wait was about 55 minutes. But luckily we scored a window seat, had a few beers, and people-watched. They also allow you to provide your phone number and you can leave and they will text you.   We ordered delicious garlic bread, and the Tangerine beer from Potosi. Both delicious. And then our pizza was the Carbonara with cheese, Nueske's bacon, a couple of cooked eggs, and arugula. Sounds a bit daring? Yes...but I highly recommend.    The place is tiny and be prepared to leave smelling like a wood-fire stone oven. The kitchen is visible and right there as you sit and walk into the restaurant.    The bar is also super small and has only 8-10 cramped stools. They have great beer on tap, and we were living the Pitosi beers. I wish their bar was a bit bigger.  I bet they do , too....as most people would leave and sit outside or go a different bar to wait.   But overall ,  we enjoyed our visit and our food, and we will be back soon."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to Salvatore's in about 2 years,  so I figured it was about time for snother visit. And it 100% still holds up to its super reputation.   First of all,  the place is pretty bumpin'. They have some pretty groovy red mood lighting and music playing over the stereo. It does seem to get pretty busy on a Friday night, which is probably actually the promising sign of a food restaurant. We didn't make a reservation in advance,  so for two people there was about a half hour wait. The wait staff were extremely friendly, if busy, and let us order drinks and hang out while waiting for a table.   The restaurant itself is pretty cozy and intimate. There is limited seating,  but you can easily order food to go.   For food, we ordered the cornfest special small plate, \"street corn, \" half-and-half Flammkuchen and Hot Cheese Injection pizza,  and the panna cotta dessert special. It was was all pretty fantastic. The corn is kind of difficult to eat delicately as a restaurant food,  but the chipotle seasoning and cotija cheese paired perfectly.   The pizza rocks. I love that you can get two different halves. The ricotta and peppers on the Cheese Injection Pizza go so well together, but the spice level isn't burn-your-face-off. The Flammkuchen, apart from just being fun to say,  has awesomely crispy baconand deliciously meaty oyster mushrooms. And roasted garlic. Who doesn't love roasted garlic? The one downside was that the crust was a little burnt.   The panna cotta was amazing and perfectly-made,  which is important because as a dessert it can go wrong sooooo easily.   Overall,  great experience. Love all the local ingredients and wide variety of craft beers. Definitely one of the best Sun Prairie restaurants."}
{"text":"Salvatore's is, in my opinion, the best food in Sun Prairie and the best pizza in the entire Madison area.  This is the main selling point.  They recently moved to a new location and I feel that it has brought some of the downtown Madison vibe to Sun Prairie.  This is a good thing as most of the eateries in SP are fast food, dive bars, or mom and pop diners.  So, Salvatore's is filling a really nice niche for this area.    However, I must say, I am disappointed in what was lost in the move.  This used to be a very family oriented restaurant with toys for kids to play with and they would even bring out little cups of goldfish for kids as they waited for their food.  All that is gone.  I will start the rest of this criticism with the qualification that we came in during diner rush on a Friday.  When we walked in, we were told it was a 35 min wait for our table.  We felt that wasn't too bad and decided to stay.  My 4 year old was extremely thirsty.  So, I went to the bar to ask for some water.  The first bartender said, \"Water?  Okay.\"  And then walked off and proceeded to help 4 other customers and ring out a tab and never came back.  I had to flag down the second bartender (thankfully there was one) to actually get service.  I made sure to let this one know up front that this was for my child this time.    Additionally, their waiting area consists of a 3x5 rug.  Where their used to be a few benches to sit on if needed, now there is standing room only.  They even have room for seating if they simply removed the table closest to the door or switched the front tables and the hightop behind the host desk.  These people sitting right by the door have to dine with everyone's butt in their face as it is.  I hardly think that is what they want when they go out for a nice meal.  When we were finally seated (closer to 40-45 minutes, rather than 35) we waited an additional 45-50 minutes for food and this was after we placed our order in immediately after sitting down.  I get that it was dinner rush but I can't help but feeling they perhaps didn't plan to have a large enough pizza oven for the amount of seating they have.  The food was delicious as always and I can't recommend this place enough for that reason alone.   I am also certain that going during the week would probably be great.  If I go on a weekend again, I'll probably just call in a carry out order..."}
{"text":"Have eaten in their new location three times.  These are amazing pizzas with local farm to table ingredients!   The acoustics in the back room are so loud you can't hear the people at your own table.  This last time our rating dropped.  We ordered a margarita that took forever & the waitress came back to say the bar only had one upgraded tequila left.  So we took that.  The waitress eventually checked back to see if we wanted another drink.  My husband said he would switch to a Captain and coke.  Guess what?  They were out of spiced rum.  So he ordered a stout beer off the menu.  You're not going to believe this--it was out.  My husband asked if they forgot to pay their liquor bills!!  He decided to finish our meal with water.  Bottom line--order your pizza to go or for delivery--that's what we will do from now on."}
{"text":"The pizza pies here are amazing and so delicious! Love the farm to table freshness and quality. If you haven't tried Sal's yet, it is well worth it. This place is very family friendly and I have been bringing my family here for years. My family's personal favorite is bacon and goat cheese on a pizza and although it sounds a little strange it tastes delicious!! They even have mini customizable pizzas for kids that are good for older kids too. We recently moved to Minnesota and Sals pizza is still the best we've ever had. You can even see the chefs spinning the pizza into the air and at one of their other locations they have some of the most wonderful calamari. I definitely recommend this place to any body who loves pizza!"}
{"text":"Amazing! Not often do you find unique pizzas but they have them. Service was excellent as well. They deserve their rating. Will go back."}
{"text":"Pizza off da chain. Break every chain here people.   Very cool location and great lighting. It is a little tight for sure so you want to get there at off-peak hours.   The service is very good and very friendly.   The ability to make your own pizza has been awesome and especially the fact that my wife and create half the pizza and I can create the other half and make one pizza we both love.   Even the non-pizza food we have eaten here has been very good. The drinks are also splendid!"}
{"text":"\"maybe we'll get the special tonight\", or, \"lies, slander, and assorted delusions: a collection of short essays by me and my girlfriend\".   sal's is hands down the best pizza in madison, and the carbonara is what i order every single time without fail (after i half-heartedly ask what the special is because sometimes i need that veneer of open-mindedness/adventurousness). the eggs are runny, the bacon is so satisfying, the crust is the perfect thickness/chewiness, and the crust-to-stuff ratio is on point. i'm not a big dessert person, but their flourless chocolate cake was a hit as well.   i feel like i'm not really adding anything new or special to the reviews here, but it has to be confirmed that the hype is real: the best pizza in madison, affordable, (what seems like) great and creative flavor combinations, and always friendly service (they were running behind on our pickup order once and offered us a free drink while we waited)."}
{"text":"Nice hip pizza joint. Great pizza (love their vegetarian pizza despite I am not vegetarian). Great service. Good selection of beers on tap. The seating is a bit tight and not comfortable though. Otherwise would be perfect."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating there, it was really delicious, and the pizza did not take very long to arrive to us. Ambiance was nice, wait staff were attentive.   We built our own pizza, but there were also tons of options available if you don't want to think too hard.  Plus: they serve cured meats from Underground Food Collective.   A bit pricier than other nice pizzerias in Dane County, but you also get what you pay for.   They are part of the Belly Card rewards system."}
{"text":"Great pizza and drinks. Funky and fun service. Trendy farm to table philosophy. Average decor, not much ambiance. I wish the place was bigger, could seat a few more people, and that it had a little more separation for waiting patrons. They could even benefit from a community table seating plan, imo.  Our second trip, a Friday night before 6, was the perfect time to get a table, because within 15 minutes they were packed with about an hour wait and over 15 people waiting to be seated. \"our audience\" as I like to say, because most sit and watch the diners eagerly waiting for the tables to vacate to be able to be seated. Obviously the sign of a popular place!  We were nicely asked to relocate from our table to another when it freed up, as a reservation came in that they had forgotten about, and our table was the only one that would work in conjunction with another that had recently been cleared for the group of 10. We gladly moved, the waitress was awesome with how she presented her situation and offered to buy a dessert for the inconvenience. It was really no problem, and didn't bother us at all. I was impressed with how she handled it.   I will be back for the delicious pizza and good service!"}
{"text":"We came here on a Thursday night and were pleasantly surprised.  We shared a house salad which was delicious.  The greens were super fresh and had some great dressing.  Onward we tried one of the daily special pizzas - I think it was the Farmer Joe - it was awesome.  This is truly some of the best and freshest pizza I have ever had.  They also have lots of craft beer from local breweries.  And to top it all off - our waitress was awesome too.  This is truly a gem hiding in a strip mall in Sun Prairie.  Go now.  Don't ever consider one of the pizza chains again!"}
{"text":"Stopped by on the second day they were open, but it already feels like they've been here forever! Decor is sparse but comfortable, they've got a respectable amount of beers on tap as well as in bottles, but let's get to the important part.  The pizza is darn good. I got the carbonara, one of my friends got the fig and gorgonzola, the other got a salad, and we all split the burrata appetizer. The burrata was definitely the stand out-so creamy and fresh! Paired with roasted garlic, toasty bread, and cucumbers, it was definitely worth it! My carbonara was also delicious. The eggs wre a bit more raw than I like, but I also don't usually go for runny eggs with brunch so I'm probably in the minority there. The bacon was awesome, and the arugala was a great touch! Tried the fig and gorgonzola, and it would be perfect for those who love the combo of savory and sweet. Not my jam, but I still enjoyed it regardless! Can't really comment on the salad other than it looked fresh, but why would you go for that when you could get pizza??  All in all, I know where I'm going now when I am craving an unique pizza in Madison!"}
{"text":"Do not call what they serve Pizza. I first thought it is funny to try to distinguish their product. but wait, When you try it you would understand. The fillings are so fresh you will look for the backyard garden they don't have. the dough for the \"Tomato Pie\" is diffrent in a good way.  We were lucky to stumble upon it as we were just crossing the city on own way back to the Twin Cities, MN"}
{"text":"So...a bit of a challenge in writing a balanced a review for Salvatore's, since the breadth of the experience was so wide.  Came on a Saturday evening around 7:45, and while the location was pretty full, it was definitely not slammed.  We were invited to wait at the bar (~10 minute estimation).  Table was actually ready in about 6-7 minutes, before we could even flag the bartender for beverages.  She appeared to be backed up with orders from the dining area and there were several customers at the bar waiting.  Nice seating area and atmosphere, but I concur with other reviewers that for the number of people in the restaurant it is extremely loud; it's hard to have a normal volume conversation even in the booths on the side of the dining area.  Waiter took our drink orders and disappeared; we had to flag him down after about 10 minutes to put in an app order, and he came back with our drinks shortly after.  Cheese bread was very good, nicely balanced and not overly loaded with cheese.  Between the table, a small pie, and a large pie.  Orders weren't flying out, but they were timely enough getting food out of the kitchen.  The figgie piggie was tasty, but very sweet with not quite enough salty to balance it out.  The meatballer was tasty and the crust is excellent.  Tomato sauce was OK but not out of this world.  Cocktails were very good.    The downside?  Had to flag down waitstaff at least three or four times with clearly empty water and cocktail glasses sitting at the table; at one point our waiter disappeared from the floor for at least 15 minutes and we ended up grabbing someone else.  Felt bad, but it was a LONG time that we were sitting there.  We probably would have had one or two more rounds of drinks at the table if someone had been around, and it wasn't the level of service that I'd expect at a local family place.    Overall the food was good enough that I'd come back, but the service and the noise would make me want to get takeout."}
{"text":"My family I love this pizza.  Our favorite is the Fat Uncle Tony but you can't go wrong with any of the pies."}
{"text":"GREAT PIZZA! Just wish they had a bigger dinning room. Had to take the pizza to go. The staff was very friendly though."}
{"text":"This is seriously the best pizza I have ever eaten - Jalapeno Assesino. Rich, flavorful, interesting, delicious! House salad really great too. And then there was the draught beer - Potosi Tangerine IPA, Heaven on Johnson St. I will definitely be back when I am back in town!"}
{"text":"I'm giving this place a 4 only because the girl behind the counter was rude when I first walked in. Having never been there before she wasn't helpful. Ordered the 2 slices and soda deal for 6 dollars. Great food and  great deal!"}
{"text":"When trying to think of things to say about Sal's that haven't been said already, it's very easy to avoid mentioning the pizza itself. So, i'll get that out of the way immediately: It's easily in the top 3 in Madison, if not #1. You only need to read the menu to know that you're going to get something good, as the concoctions and topping choices alone should tell you a lot about what you're going to get: Very fresh taste, and unique flavors. This alone obviously makes it worth a trip.  But like nearly every other restaurant in the world, Sal's is more than just one type of item, it's well, a restaurant. So how does it stack up there? I'd say decently, but not amazingly. When it comes to the space, it's definitely too small. Some would call it intimate, but i'd call it cramped. The only time there isn't a wait for a table is right when they open. While being a crowded place certainly helps the hype factor, it's a bit detracting from the experience. At the very least, they do allow take out, and you can order and eat at Johnson Public House, so that makes up for some of the space problems.  When it comes to their non-pizza offerings, I have mixed feelings. They're at the very least interesting, but not really for everyone. I've tried the burrata, and thought it was a good starter. I've also had the veggie tacos. Some people love these tacos it seems, but I was more \"eh\" on them. They definitely taste fresh, but they rely too much on the spice of the peppers to give it flavor. So to me, it turns out being kind of bland, and actually somewhat unpleasant. If you're into spice though, these may be for you!  So I think that Sal's do the pizza nearly perfectly, but they could tune up in a couple areas by tweaking some of the menu options. If they did that, then it would be a top-tier dining experience!"}
{"text":"Okay, so there aren't any hunched Italian grandmas manning the pizza ovens at Sal's, stretching dough with gnarled fingers and swirling it above their heads. But while I'm otherwise a stickler for authenticity, I really don't care in this instance. The sauce is bright and flavorful, and the toppings are the best conceived and executed of any pizza place in town. The beet pesto pizza can convert kale haters any day. I've eaten every pizza on the menu and none has disappointed even for a second. The only \"problem\" I've ever had at Sal's is the frustration of holding myself back from eating another slice out of sheer enthusiasm when I know it'll put me in food coma territory. Oh the agony! Beyond that, they have a good drink selection and everyone from the chefs to the waitstaff is friendly and courteous."}
{"text":"Best pizza I've ever had. Try them for lunch too, they have a quick two slices and a soda deal. My suggestion is order a little cup of sauce to dip the crusts into. Sal's is kid friendly with a play area for young children."}
{"text":"Salvatore's Tomato Pies is our hands down favorite pizza!  The basic tomato pie cannot be beat as the sauce is amazing!  I look forward to their daily facebook updates and specials as we have been able to try some amazing new flavor combinations.  We love to eat in the restaurant but use the delivery service often.  Top notch service!"}
{"text":"Savory pizzas with great flavor! I really liked their chile oil pizza, it had  the right amount of heat. I'm a vegetarian and this was the only choice, wish they had others. I also like how they take reservations so you can have a table when they're busy. I wish they had a bigger place in sun prairie with maybe a view, I would then maybe buy a bottle of wine and stay longer."}
{"text":"Really nice place, good for kids, good pizza. Different than most anywhere, not your traditional pizza. Good bread, good beer, good pizza, nice staff. About the only thing they could improve is make the place bigger."}
{"text":"Read a review about their new location and went here on a Saturday evening. It was a little over an hour wait, but each minute was worth it. The old fashioned's are made with Door County cherries and Wollersheim brandy. We had the scallops for an appetizer, great flavor!  Set on polenta with prosciutto, excellent! The pizza has such a great crust, and with all the fresh toppings, it is now one of my favorites."}
{"text":"I've only lived here for a few months, but I checked out Salvatore's after a few weeks.  After spending time in Italy, I'm always on the search for the real deal.  This place comes really close to authentic Italian pie, and I believe in the passion and intent of the owner, having seen his pies and how he sources his ingredients.  Loved the pizza Margherita, but I'd personally like to see more cheese.  Especially since there's sauce on top of the cheese.  The crust rivals what I had in Rome and Naples which is sayin' something though!  The crust is killer!  Can't wait to have the antipasti!  More patron control is needed, though.  Waited 30 minutes for my pie with kids literally banging and knocking pics completely off the wall.  If mom is too lazy to deal with it, I'm sorry, but the owners have to for the other patrons.  I nearly skipped a heart beat in the waiting chairs when the roaming brats lirtally sent a gallery wrapped artwork crashing to the floor behind me.  Mom, dad, WTF??  Seriously?  I don't care if you know the owners (seemed like they did), but, that's unacceptable behavior for your  kids!  If the parents can't control, the restaurant needs to intervene on behalf of other patrons.    But, food is great!  :-)"}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant when I visited my bf's family. We went there because some of the his friends recommended it, and Yelpers like it. We got the daily special pork belly white cheese pizza, and it was amazing even to New Yorkers. Too bad we didn't try the real tomato pie, because the restaurant closes on the Labor Day. Would definitely visit again when I'm in town!"}
{"text":"We've been looking forward to hitting this place as soon as they opened this Johnson Street location so decided to spend a date night with the hubby there last night.  Here's the scoop - cute little place, good atmosphere, friendly peeps.  Service sucked (at least our server did) - he was a low-talker, slow as shit and seemed like he wanted to be out back having a smoke more than being our waiter.  With all that aside, we started with the house salad which had a super interesting seasonal greens and veggie mix - much appreciated!  But the dressing was sad - a vinaigrette with very little flavor and pretty oily.  For $8 - we immediately regretted it.  The Carbonara pizza was our rebound - great crust, bacon, mushrooms, cooked eggs on top - super delish.  My husband also ordered tacos (which they're also oddly known for) but their carne asada was chewy and oddly flavored (soy sauce??).  Another $8 we wish we hadn't spent!  Overall - stick with the pizza!"}
{"text":"Enjoyable local pizza spot with a good beer menu as well.  Not your typical pie, but very good unique pizzas.  Certainly worth a visit if in the mood for pizza and in Madison (+ need a break from the bars)."}
{"text":"This pizza was good.  Real good.  If anything, I'd like to float this at around 4.5 stars.  I didn't get to explore much of the menu, but the pizza was solid all around.  Good flavor, good sauce/crust/cheese ratio.  Joins Via/Transfer in MKE as some of the better pizza places in Wisconsin."}
{"text":"I'll make this short and sweet - Sal's is the only restaurant I tell my friends to make the drive to Sun Prairie for.  I was here a while back with my mom, grandma, wife, and daughter.  We all had a wonderful meal.  A few highlights:  1) The calamari was huge and delicious. 2) The fig and bacon pie was as good as ever. 3) Surprisingly, the burger I had was cooked excellent.  It looks like it's off the menu now, but it was some sort of play on Jimi Hendrix.  The place fills up, so make a reservation if you can."}
{"text":"Oh my god this pizza. Sal's has a well-deserved reputation for having the best pies in Madison. The joint is jam packed pretty much every night of the week, and for good reason-- It's absolutely delicious. My table shared a fig gorgonzola pie and some thai chicken pie, with a burrata appetizer. All of it was well balanced, with fresh ingredients, seasoned nicely and it made me want to eat pizza for the rest of my natural life. In addition, they also serve taco specials. The special when I came in was some kind of scallop taco, which I reluctantly said no to, just because I was there to try to pies, but now I am full of regret. I'm sure it would have been the best taco ever. I'll be back soon!!"}
{"text":"I love their use of local ingredients.  They've got great staple 'za like tomato and Fat Uncle Tony, and interesting specialty pizzas.  In SP they are also expanding from pizzas- tacos look amazing!  Follow them on FB for pics of daily specials.   A few notes:  Pizza's only come in one size,  the SP location is a bit small, so they do a lot of carry out- but  we love that they deliver!    I'm glad they are doing so well they were able to expand to a second location- but I hate that we have to share them!"}
{"text":"Ok we still miss Tony's in De Forest but this is a good place to get  a solid pizza, not  your usual pizza toppings on every one and worth getting our of your box on toppings"}
{"text":"Salvatore's is a local pizza joint with a Tex-Mex twist. On a recent weeknight visit, I strolled in and found there was no wait for a table. I scanned the menu and the daily special (assortment of mushrooms), and opted to order El Mapache Loco.   The service from start to finish was impeccable. I was greeted upon arrival, promptly seated and given food and drink menus, and placed my order with ease. The pizza arrived steaming hot, with soft purple potatoes, blotches of queso fresco cheese, thinly shredded chicken and colorful peppers. Visually pleasing, the pizza condiments enhanced the flavor profile of what reminded me of a Pizza Time-style pizza (chewy crust).   Overall, the 12-inch pizza easily serves 2-3 people. I hope they consider selling slices to-go, and adding a beef option (I.e. carne asada, lengua). I'm looking forward to another visit to see what new flavor profiles they compile."}
{"text":"Easy: Best Pizza Around!  I found Sal's on Yelp searching for the best pie in the area. Took the short drive and was not disappointed.   The atmosphere was cozy and enjoyable. They had nice Italian music playing in the background and the lighting was perfect! I ordered a build your own Tomato Pie with 3 toppings, and could not have been happier with my experience.  It took roughly 20 minutes to get the pie, and was brought out piping hot on top of a large tomato can ready to start dishing out.   It was epically amazing in my mouth.  I have had so many pizza's over my time and this one rocked my taste buds. Great sauce, plenty of cheese and toppings. The best part, the crust!  The crust is usually my least favorite part, by the way, and this crust had the perfect crunch along with taste. I don't know how they made it taste so appetizing, but it was great.  You have to save room for dessert! I never do this, but made an exception based off the pictures I found on their website. A perfect end to a delightful pizza.   Perfect place for a date, family dinner, just because your hungry, whatever...  What are you waiting for! Stop reading this and head to Sal's tonight."}
{"text":"Can I have your attention please?  EVERYBODY GO HERE!  Why?  Because they have something for everyone.  After my initial review of Sal's, the owner Patrick left a message looking to make it right.  In a world where more and more businesses are all about putting out a mass cookie cutter product, customers be darned, Salvatore's breaks the mold.    In fact, Salvatore's is only one of two businesses in the greater Madison area in the last ten years who have genuinely reached out to me to make things right when something didn't turn out quite right.  That says a lot about their character and is always the hallmark of a great business.      Tonight we ordered the # 1 vegan style, and the # 8 regular.  The vegan pie was outstanding!   I haven't had any vegan pizza, anywhere nearly as good, and it is clear that other pizza establishments should be very jealous.  My dairy consuming, meat eating companions who had the Fat Uncle Tony were raving about it!    I know this review is now bordering on \"sounds like a paid sponsor\" territory, but I just get excited because I know when I got something good!    Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"This is the second Salvatore's I have been too and this pizza place is excellent.  One size pizza is enough for four adults. Maybe just a little more cost than average but easily worth the buck or two more. All fresh ingredients and a mouthful of flavors in every bite. JUST HEAVENLY!  You will come back again for seconds!"}
{"text":"First time here and was very impressed.  We had pizza, it was delicious with a mouthful of many flavors in every bite. One 16 inch pizza was enough for four adults. Pizza is made entirely from scratch with fresh ingredients,  WE HAD THE TERRENCE'S FAVORITE PIZZA,  we will be back!!!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! I ordered the pasta with shrimp, fat uncle tonys pizza, seared scallops, and chicken wings. Everything was wonderful except for the chicken wings--they were much too salty (and I love salty things). I had to have them take it back. Overall, if you want good pizza in suburbia Wisconsin, go to this place."}
{"text":"Such good pizza. Hailing from Chicagoland we have been limited to Pizza Hut since we moved to waunakee. We got the tomato pie (since my husband and kids are cheese pizza people) and I got the forza. The crust is perfect. I wish the forza had red sauce but that's just because I love red sauce (sure I could ask for some and I just stole some from the other pizza). The only thing I wish I knew is that you can make any specialty pizzas half and half. I would have def done 1/2 fig and bacon. Or carbonara. Or forestiere. Next time Sals. Next time."}
{"text":"For all of you who LOVE the pies at Sun Prairie, DON'T order your favorite pie at Sun Prairie, and here's why....   So we came here for the Farmer John's Smoked Gouda- something we tried at Sun Prairie. It wasn't on the menu, but I was dead set on getting it (it's delicious), so the staff pulled up the ingredient list, and did the best they could with what they had- warning me it was not going to be the same. I got home, and it wasn't the same, and  I was disappointed. I wrote a bad review.   So why the five stars? 1. They did the best they could to get me the pizza I ordered, and warmed me it wasn't going to be exactly the same (I didn't heed the warning, and that's on me).  2. The owner replied to my bad review! Whoa! Explaining that two locations do not carry the same ingredients, and therefore have different menus- each boasting their own specialty pies.  I was hoping that the downtown location was just another place to get Sun Prairie's fantastic pies. It's not, and I was disappointed. Kind of like being disappointed that France is not Rome. What I now realize is that the downtown location is a place to get a whole range of totally different fantastic pies. Much like realizing that France has something completely different to offer than Rome!   There are two places I am going to miss when I move out of Madison- Square Wine Co & Salvatore's Tomato Pies. One provides the best wine in the states, the other makes pizza better than anywhere in the world (yeah, I went there). Both have service that can't be beat."}
{"text":"Amazing crust, sauce, cheese, sausage and spinach. Highly recommended. Drove 30 minutes for this pizza and it was well worth it.   Very flavorful cheese & bacon bread.   Friendly staff, homey atmosphere- felt like a neighborhood mom & pop shop in Italy!"}
{"text":"Man the pizza here is good. I have been lucky to go here with people who wanted to split pizzas and try multiple flavors, so I've tried lots of their specialty pies. Before I start talking about the flavors, let me just say that the crust is awesome! It's chewy, and it might be sourdough although I'm not sure.  Forestiere is great if you're a fan of onions. This is kind of what I'd imagine the pizza form of french onion soup would taste like, but then they make it better with the addition of bacon.  Carbonara is my favorite. It's basically a breakfast pizza with bacon and runny egg. The fresh arugula provides a fresh, contrasting texture to the rest of the pizza. The scallions provide a subtly sweet herbiness to add complexity to the otherwise simple bacon, egg, and cheese flavor.  El Mapacho Loco is honestly not my favorite. There a lot of rich, spicy Mexican flavors provided by the chicken and variety of peppers, but the potatoes really ruin it for me. I usually like potatoes on a pizza, but the potatoes on this pizza are in chunks and make you feel like you're eating mashed potatoes.  Forza is great! This is such a great combination of acidic spiciness and fattiness from the pepperoni, tangy chili peppers, and smoked gouda mellowed out by smooth ricotta, warm roasted garlic, and robust tomatoes.  Additionally, I found myself unimpressed by the bacon cheese bread (and maybe I shouldn't expect to be impressed; it's just cheesy bread with bacon after all), but the salad greens it comes with are quite tasty.  Overall, I really liked the pizza here, but I still prefer Grampa's at the end of the day. While it's unfair to compare wood-fire style to New York(?) style pizza, the two pizzerias play a similar game when it comes to toppings, and, to me, Grampa's is a notch above."}
{"text":"Best pizza that I've had in Madison! They use local ingredients and everything is high quality.  They only serve 16in pizzas at this location but will allow you to do 1/2 & 1/2 even with the specialty pizzas. All of the specialty pizzas looked fantastic. We had the garlic bread to start out which is toasted baguette served with a garlic butter paste that is amazing! We went with 1/2 C3PO and 1/2 Bacon and Fig. Both were incredibly flavorful! You can also make your own pizzas if the specialty pizzas aren't up your alley. The restaurant itself is pretty small, only about 10 tables so I imagine dining in on a Friday or Saturday night would be difficult. We went at 7pm on a Sunday and were seated immediately. They have a good bottled beer selection. I will definitely be going back. The only complaint I have is that the music was a little loud making it hard to talk to my dining partner"}
{"text":"Salvatore's offers fantastic pizza at a small town venue. Salvatore's is easily the best pizza around Madison that we have had the opportunity to experience thus far. Please deliver further!  After hearing much about the legendary Salvatore's pizza from our fellow Yelpers my wife and I made the drive out to Sun Prairie to check it out. Upon arrival the parking lot and restaurant space were both very congested. We figured we wouldn't have to deal with a crowd by showing up a little later, but we were quite wrong indeed!  The space has very few tables and a sort of homey feeling to it, but I always felt slightly claustrophobic in the space with the tight walkways and the number of people milling about.   After a 20 minute wait or so we were seated by our host. The hostess and many of the servers appeared to be very young so Sal's is either employing family members or supporting local high school students. Overall, service was fairly attentive without being overly pushy.  We ended up ordering some beers and the bacon-fig pizza pie. Sadly, the beer list was bottle only. I really wish Sal's had some taps! The wine list was also a little strange for a pizza joint. The list is very well assembled, interesting, and diverse. It was the type of list that I would expect to see at a high end restaurant. As a result, many of the bottles were pricier than what I would want to order at a pizza joint. At the very least the \"by the glass\" options need to be more affordable. I would add some budget options for certain to this list.  The bacon fig pizza was fantastic, and I would definitely order it again. The ingredients went very well together. My only complaint was the toppings were sparse on this large pie. To fully enjoy this pizza I would prefer to see a smaller pie with the same amount of toppings or more toppings. I like having a taste of all the toppings in one bite.  Great overall experience, and we look forward to coming back for more bacony-figgy goodness."}
{"text":"The pizza is AMAZING. The crust is perfect, the toppings are delicious. My only complaint is the same as many others have mentioned (and the owner has replied that they are working on), and that is the lack of waiting space. We went on a busy Friday, and it is totally worth the 40 minute wait, I just wish there was someplace to do it besides standing in the doorway. The bar was full, and the hi top table had a birthday party at it. We felt like we were totally in the way of people coming in the door, but there was nowhere else to go. But again, worth it. Lots of cool decor to look at too while waiting (love the cut up doors on the wall!). Next time we will make a reservation. As a side note, don't be afraid of the garlic as a topping. They use whole cloves, which sounds way overpowering, but they are sweet and melt in your mouth with each bite. YUM!"}
{"text":"Stopped by Salvatores for dinner.  It's a small unassuming pizza place.  But the pizzas are amazing.  I'm not even a huge pizza guy.  But if This was in my city I think it would be my go to pizza joint.  Definitely come here if you like pizza."}
{"text":"For a pizza place in a strip mall who presents their pizza sitting on a tomato sauce can, this place is incredible.  Best kept secret in the Madison area.  The pizzas are creative and taste amazing!  Do not pass this place up if you are in the neighborhood.  I almost did based on first glance and I would have missed out on some of the best pizza I've ever had."}
{"text":"BURRATA!!! It's amazing but huge; a great appetizer to split among a group of friends.  The pizza was also delicious. They have a great locally sourced meat selection for proteins, but they also have white bean puree to sub for cheese if your vegan friend comes along.  Great place, good food and convenient location. So glad they added a location downtown!"}
{"text":"All-around fantastic. My husband and I stopped in around 6:30 last Saturday night and  were told to expect a 40-minute wait. We decided to wait next door at the Johnson Public House. I hardly had time to finish my glass of wine at JPH before we got the text that our table was ready, 15 minutes earlier than expected. We were lucky enough to have the best seats in the house: right by the window, but also in view of the very talented dough-tosser in the kitchen. We ordered the fig and bacon pizza (with kalamata olives instead of bacon on one half). It was fabulous. The gorgonzola perfectly complemented the figs and balsamic-red wine reduction. And the crust was perfectly crispy on the outside and fluffy soft within. The service was wonderful as well; our waiter was knowledgable and prompt and made us feel very welcome.   All in all it was a very special experience. I can't wait to go back this weekend and try the basic tomato pie. YUM."}
{"text":"Affordable fancy pizza that's made-to-order fresh. Reviews don't lie on this one, definitely a must-go in Madison. What seems like a limited menu actually has a variety of options and it was tough to decide! We took our waiters recommendations and none of them disappointed!   Here's our damage - Burrata: veggies and herbs super fresh, the soft cheese was so yummy and spread easy and the crostini was crunchy and warm  Carbonara: an egg on every piece - extra gold stars! Got the carbonara creaminess and savory flavor was right on target. Yum, my favorite.  Vegetarian: almost a polar opposite as the carbonara but just as delicious. Kale was crispy, the roasted beet pesto was fragrant, and it all came together really nicely. This side was less stable to pick up the slices but we didn't mind.  Panna Cotta: presentation was beautiful, fresh fruits and it was a nice consistency  Chocolate Cake: perfect pairings with the hazelnut ice cream, pistachios, and caramel sauce. Very yummy.  You're able to get 1/2 of each so that was really nice for a party of 2, even though we still had leftovers! They take a lot of pride in serving their best - our first pizza crust was too burnt - the waiter told us right away and we had to wait a little longer, but I liked the honesty. Definitely anticipating coming back :)"}
{"text":"After eating Sal's vegetarian pizza, I am an ethereal vestige of my former self because I literally died. Beet pesto and goat cheese? Heinous! Delicious! It killed me!   But the vegetarian tacos were pretty regular and they ran out of some of the red wines.   I care not. This pizza is bomb."}
{"text":"Came in for a late dinner and had the house salad (good local greens in November!) and the fig and bacon pizza pie. It was fabulous! Not a fancy joint but the food is first rate! Great microbrews on tap too!"}
{"text":"It's taken three years, but we've FINALLY found good pizza in Madison! This place builds their pizza a little backwards, with cheese under the sauce (check out the pics). Nonetheless, it is DELICIOUS! Good crust, too, but could use something to dip it in. First time in my life that I've had mango on pizza. Twas great. A little loud and definitely a family place, with about a dozen tables or so. Would definitely come back - and that's my first time saying that about a pizza place in Madison."}
{"text":"Salvatore's is hands down the best pizza in/around the Madison area! The ingredients are always fresh and usually sourced locally and their appetizers and small plates are also very tasty. I really enjoy how they mix different toppings to get optimal flavor in every bite.   I also like the quaint, smaller atmosphere of their restaurant. If you haven't heard of Sal's there is a good chance you might drive right by it.   I have yet to try their new downtown location but I can imagine it is just as good as their original SP location. I have told many many people about Salvatore's and anyone who has tried them has been just as impressed. Highly Recommend!!"}
{"text":"Let's face it the pizza is divine. I've heard that it's Jersey style pizza, but I never had pizza out there so I can't compare.  I suggest getting the fat uncle tony or any pizza with the classic red sauce. The white sauce pizzas are good, but I don't think they're as good as the classic. The flavor in the white sauce pizza isn't all there, at least compared to the red sauce.   The crust is perfect, I could eat it plain. Nice and flaky on the outside and warm and soft on the inside. It's very fresh and doesn't taste like the cardboard crust you get from fast food chains. The tomato sauce is something else and that little touch of basil makes it that much better. It's very fresh and tastes like tomato. You can still taste the acidity in the tomato and it doesn't seem like it's processed and sitting on a shelf for a year before it gets used.   The pies are bit expensive, but they are 16 ish inches. For the flavor, I'd pay for them again and again. Expect to pay $20-$25 for a pie, depending on what toppings you get. A pizza that size can easily serve three, but I think four people would be pushing it.   I always take friends and family here and everyone agrees that the pies are great. DON'T EVER CHANGE!! AND DON'T EVER MOVE AWAY!! This place is a rare breed that we don't encounter as much as we should. It's a shame that restaurants sacrifice quality and use cheap ingredients to save a few bucks. This place does not. This is a mom and pop shop that got it right. Glad to have a place like this in the area!! If you want to be cheap go to Pizza Hut. If you want to taste what real pizza should taste like, come here!"}
{"text":"This place truly deserves every one of it's stars.. fantasticly great pizza... nice people.. speedy delivery (although it might lose a quarter star over it's slightly high prices, but hey you gots to pay for quality)"}
{"text":"The pizza is amazing. We stopped in when they opened on a Sunday and the restaurant filled within 10 minutes. I cannot wait until we dine there again. They have other food but the pizza was so amazing I might have to go 3 or 4 times before I try anything else. This is literally the best pizza I have ever tasted. A close 2nd is a Neapolitan place in Sheboygan, WI. AMAZING PIZZA!"}
{"text":"This place is definitely my favorite pizza joint in Madison. The Fig and Bacon is crazy good! They  also have a good beer selection and very reasonable prices. If the don't have seating you can eat next door at JPH as well.    Protip - Order one small pizza per person. You might have leftovers but they're just as good!"}
{"text":"I guess I'm one of the few ones who didn't have a 5 star experience here. Don't get me wrong, the pizza itself is quite nice and I really like their interpretations and choice of toppings!!   BUT for the price they charge, it surely doesn't impress you to that level. I'd be more impressed if say the pizza's were around $15 range, but for well over $20 per pizza they better be that darn good. And these weren't.  Still, I love the folks there and how well they treat you!"}
{"text":"The day Salvatore's announced their expansion to include a location on East Johnson Street I was beyond delighted. Prior to this new location, Sun Prairie was quite the hike for pizza but completely worth it.  Sal's pies satisfy a wide range of tastes, and are quite adventurous depending on your pizza personality. For those not as daring, you can always build your own! My favorite specialty pies have been the Forza, the Carbonara, and particularly the Forestiere.    The space on E Johnson is very very small, so if you have an option to do pickup I would highly recommend it. As a bonus, the takeout boxes are able to be converted into 4 cardboard plates which makes it a great choice to order then head over to one of the local parks!"}
{"text":"Very few things will get me to drive a half hour.  Half hour of my life, never to be returned, right? In this case, getting to Salvatore's is a pilgrimage, so it's worth it.  Many of the pizzas have a tomato sauce swirl so you get some bits that are more tomato-y for a nice contrast, and the sauce is tastes fresh and bright.  Terrence's Favorite pie is awesome, and features caramelized shallots (not onions, shallots! fancy!) , sausage, roast peppers, and chevre.   Their daily specials have a tremendous amount of variety, both in pizza and entree options.  Everywhere you look at the menu you see a special link to an area food producer, and a huge emphasis on house made products.  Get out there and eat!  Even if you have to take the pizza 30 minutes or so, it's still good that day....breakfast....lunch....dinner....second dinner...yeah, it's good."}
{"text":"Yep, this is the best pizza in the area.   I was a little hesitant (why would I go all the way to Sun Prairie for a restaurant...?), but Sal's didn't disappoint. The service was friendly, music was great, and the pizza was incredible. It's hard to find a nice thick crust that isn't too fluffy or too chewy...this had the perfect consistency. I could eat a whole pie of just the crust...  Get fig, bacon, and goat cheese as your toppings. You won't regret it.  Also, you can pay using the restaurant's iPhone with Square. My friends and I were in a rush and the waiter came up to each of us individually to swipe our cards & sign as we were finishing our food, which was super easy & convenient.  I'll be back to try more than the pizza!"}
{"text":"Love this place -without pretense and BS their food is top chops - may be the best pizza ever had but the cheesy bread with bacon is perhaps most wonderful thing ever eaten. I could just call and ask for food,  go 20 minutes later & pick it up and be quite happy with whatever they presented -----  GOOD"}
{"text":"3.5 stars  My friend and I got half vegetarian and half fig and bacon. We were a huge fan of the vegetarian, but not so much the fig and bacon. We loved the flavors of the beet pesto and the roasted kale which gave the pizza some nice texture. The fig and bacon pizza wasn't bad, but it lacked some flavor and the pizza ended up being too chewy and hard. I think it needed some greens or citrus to tie the sweet and salty combo. Definitely would recommend the vegetarian pizza.   We also ordered the tiramisu which came out frozen like an ice cream cake (but without ice cream). I've always had delicate and spongy tiramisu so we were confused when it came out frozen. My friend and waited 10-15 minutes for it to defrost so it tasted a little better. I would be down to come back and give some of their other pies a try."}
{"text":"We had the balsamic infused fig and bacon pizza. Pure Genius. This is casual  and intimate with a friendly staff and a flour covered owner right on site getting his hands in the pizza dough. The prices are a little high but it is really good."}
{"text":"I was in Sun Prairie the other day and stopped into Salvatore's after seeing their delicious photos on Facebook, and I noticed they were a Badger Barter member, so I was able to use Barter Bucks to pay for my lunch.  I had two pieces of pizza with smoked gouda, thick cut bacon hunks, tomatoes that tasted like they were freshly picked out of the garden, heirloom garlic.  Yummy McYummerton.  Perfect blend of sweet decilious cheese and salty bacon.  All for $6 and you get soda!"}
{"text":"Best pizza EVER!  I will always recommend this place when people ask for the best pizza in Madison."}
{"text":"Favorite pizza place in Madison, easily. Not only does it taste delicious, but almost all the pizzas are easily customizable to fit my vegetarian diet. I think it's a smidge overpriced and just wish they had a bar."}
{"text":"as an italian who is hard-pressed to find great italian food in madison and sun prairie, i had super high expectations for salvatore's just based on the name alone.  we ate in the restaurant on a friday night and were the only ones there.  the take-out seemed pretty busy though.  both the servers that helped us were super nice.  the two pizzas we ordered took a long time - but it was ok.  the salad for two was awesome, even though the mixed greens were slightly wilted.  the bread didn't come out until after the pizzas but it was fantastic.   we ordered a plain style pizza and the bacon and blue.  the reason i'm giving a painful 3 star review is because the sauce on the pizzas was so incredibly bad that neither my husband nor i could eat more than a slice each.  we even took the pizza home, thinking it might be better cold, but unfortunately we ended up throwing away both of the pies.  the tomato sauce tasted like someone emptied a whole bottle of dry, dusty oregano into it.  it was so heavy on the herbs - and not in a fresh way.  unfortunately the gorgonzola pizza also came smothered in the same marinara.  i was surprised - was not expecting that flavor combo.  i think this pizza could have been great without the sauce or with an olive oil/parm substitute.  the broccoli was crunchy bordering on raw but that complaint is so minimal compared to how wretched the tomato sauce was.  it made everything inedible.  so many people have glowing reviews that i'm thinking (hoping) maybe we just came in on an off night or the business is too new and still working out the kinks.  it will be awhile before i try it again but i would go back in a heartbeat for that homemade bread with sesame seeds.  *we visited the restaurant in december and i wrote this review in january"}
{"text":"This is one of the best of three pizza places that I've been to in the last 10 years.  Great authentic Italian pizza."}
{"text":"Winner winner, pizza dinner!  I would 100% recommend a stop into Sal's. This place scores very high in deliciousness and creativity. Also, the staff seemed just as excited to be serving me pizza as I was to eat it.  As I write this, I am enjoying a leftover slice. And yes, it's just as good the next day.  What I tried: Burratta: fancy soft cheese with slices of tomato and peach which you reassemble on wonderfully crisp crostinis. Carbonarra: I've said it before, and I'll say it again, I'm a sucker for a soft cooked egg. Fig and Bacon: the figs are poached in wine and give a nice sweet kick to an otherwise savory pizza. Loved the contrasting flavors. Mario Batali would be proud."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza! I'm so glad to have a place like this so close. We almost always get the original tomato pie because it's the best. The garlic bread with garlic pur√©e is the best garlic bread I've ever had. It's a cozy place with great service."}
{"text":"It's taken me so long to write this review because I'm not sure I can find the words.  I've been in Madison for about 10 years now and have eaten so many places, and Sal's is, without a doubt, the best there is.  This is why my boyfriend and I have been upwards of 50 times and we try to make it once every week or two.  Before Sal's, I never considered myself a pizza fanatic.  But what Sal's does is so beyond what I used to know of pizza.  Every component is perfect.  The chewy yet crispy crust, the heavenly tomato sauce, and the host of perfectly balanced creative ingredients make every bite an experience you'll never want to end.  Eating here is like floating on a fresh mozzarella cloud in pizza heaven and it's raining state-of-the-art pepperoni.  Just, I'll stop being weird and just go here.  Also, when you go, don't limit yourself to pizza.  The appetizers and specials are phenomenal as well.  This chef knows what's up and these people can cook!  But in case you're wondering, the Forza is our favorite."}
{"text":"Amazing food, cute atmosphere, and friendly staff! I will definitely go back but might order pick up instead of dining in. It's a very small restaurant and we were seated practically touching elbows to the tables on either side of us which was a little weird. Still loved the food though!"}
{"text":"Great Pizza!  Thin crust, perfectly charred. Interesting toppings. Next time we'll try the entrees. Apple tart dessert was simple and phenomenal. Nice wait staff. A plus!!"}
{"text":"I started hearing the praises of Sal's from a local food writer years ago. However, living on the far west side and Sal's being in Sun Prairie made my getting there a challenge. Sixty miles roundtrip for a pie seemed a bit ridiculous. In hindsight, I may have been wrong.   After spending an afternoon working in Sun Prairie I decided to stop at Sal's on my way to hang out on the east side. I went with the Farmer John's Smoked Gouda, sans mushrooms. That crust. That bacon. It's just so ridiculously good, with all the components working perfectly together.   The Farmer John's is delicious, but rich. Definitely not an everyday choice, but something to look forward to every now and again."}
{"text":"I hosted a private event with Sal's last week and in doing so, had a chance to scarf a piece of their signature Tomato Pie while running around. I ended up back at the shop two days later because I couldn't stop thinking about it.  Their humble pie looks beautiful but packs a punch you wouldn't expect from such a simple dish. The crust is perfect and chewy. The cheese is flavorful and plentiful without that stringy, will choke you if you swallow funny consistency. And then, topping it all in a beautiful swirl, there is the sauce. Bow down, y'all. The sauce is so fresh and flavorful that you'll give a side eye to canned sauces from here on out. Making things from local ingredients truly makes a difference - you're not going to find something that tastes this good without getting local.  To sum up, I asked if \"pizza marriage\" was legal after my first slice - I think I could be happy with this beauty for the rest of my life."}
{"text":"Love the food and the new space, but the noise level causes the bartenders to talk to each other rather than focus on the customers. I had to go to great lengths to get the bartenders attention. I also told her so. I hope they start to focus on the customers more, if that means turning down the music they should make that happen."}
{"text":"One of two locations, Salvatore's Tomato Pies is an intimate space located right next to Johnson Public House. All ingredients are fresh, and you can definitely tell. The service is approachable and efficient.   Important note: If you are lucky enough to beat the rush, definitely sit outside. I can all but guarantee that due to their popularity and square footage, Salvatore's will always be loud and crowded, but I think that adds to their Italian experience.   Overall, the menu is affordable (~$14 for an elaborate yet small pizza that can easily feed two), the beverage list is vast and the location is superb. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"\"Finally\" would be the right word. It's \"finally\" for those who went to its other location, and it's \"finally\" for me, as I have been looking for a pizza to call my own in Madison for almost two years now. But it also isn't \"finally\" in that Sal's needs to get on a west side location ASAP.  I'm not into the California-style pizza with the garden on top, but their \"tomato pie\" (regular pie) is a keeper. It's closer to a margarita in how the cheese sits next to the sauce, and that's the real winner: the flavorful sauce. The tomato pie is very well balanced, much less greasy than Glass Nickel's and much lighter on the cheese (around the same price, not a \"cheap\" pie). I will still be back again and again.  Went on a Friday night and it was absolutely packed. Hard-to-get-in-and-out-of-the-door packed. Lots of sad people are going to be waiting outside in the cold this winter as there isn't enough waiting room. Lucky for Sal's, I have a great remedy: open a west side location."}
{"text":"We drove twenty miles to get here and try the pie, but I would not do it again. A philly area native, I was excited for the Trenton based authenticity.   I am sure they use the freshest of local ingredients, but if ingredients were all it took, everyone would be a gourmet chef. I can't even say it's the best pizza in Madison, and we tried two different pies. Not bad but not worth a trek to get here. Should have stopped when I got to Cafe La Belitalia."}
{"text":"So... After sharing a little disappointment with a local pizza house favorite, a very cool and local yelpster stepped in and made a few other alternative pie house recommendations here In the madison area.  The only unfortunate part was that the pizza house he recommended was up in the sun Prairie area. After a few months traveling back-and-forth to Madison, I was able to talk one of my colleagues and a traveling out to Sun Prairie with me this past Wednesday evening. He pulled up and looked at the facility and Merv quite pleased - it's certain look like it contains all the elements for a great pizza house. You walked in and we are greeted by an extremely friendly server named McKenzie - cute too!  She was extremely informative on how they used a lot of farm to table ingredients for their pizzas... Going over much of the menu with us. Faring having a similar experience as we did at the Greenbush with that local bacon being overly smoky and taking over the flavor of the pizza... We elected to go with a traditional pie.   This is by far the best pizza I have had in Madison to date. It still blows my mind that for a state that has some of the best cheese in the country a good pizza is very hard to come by. Perhaps it's just that we are currently in an Epicurean social dilemma were most pizzas have to be doctored up with salads, fruits and odd proteins. Salvatori's pizza pie however nailed it. The crust was excellent, the ingredients were delicious and the sauce was really tasty. Speaking of sauce... I noticed it was on top - clearly a little East Coast emphasis, More specifically New Jersey.   Of course after finding this location, a bit of depression set in knowing that this place was about 45 to 50 minutes from my hotel where I stay in Madison. McKenzie, our extremely cute and informative server delightfully shared with us that they are opening up a new location downtown!!    Thank you Matt for reaching out and sharing this little nugget with me - it's excellent pizza and I'd highly recommend it to anyone who's traveling in the far north east side of Madison!"}
{"text":"This is honestly worth driving across town through rush hour traffic for. That's what I did today at least. We got there at around 4.30 on a Friday afternoon, drove through Madison on the beltline, then through downtown. What can I say, I'd do anything for their pizza!   Their pizza selections are so wonderfully creative, and you can taste how fresh and delightfully chewy their dough is. We shared the special small plate of the day (three cheese ravioli, with oyster mushrooms, amazing sauce and balsamic). For the pizza, my boyfriend and I each ordered a 12 inch pizza, the Forestiere, and the Jalape√±o Assesino. We have extremely large appetites and have previously each finished a 12 inch before, but this time, we had to take two slices home (pizza for breakfast!!).   The Forestiere was SO GOOD. Wonderfully creamy, cheesy, bacon-ey - it's like the pizza of my dreams. The Jalape√±o Assesino was also extremely good, albeit very spicy! It's spicy in the way that you can still taste all the flavors of the toppings, but definitely not for novice spice eaters!   We left the restaurant already dreaming about the food, and we've been raving about it all night! Service is really good, our waiter was friendly and very down to earth.   Note: get here early, it's a small-ish restaurant and I'm sure it fills up fast. Parking is also limited to street parking, and there are limited spots outside the restaurant. Should be plenty of spaces in the side streets within a couple of blocks though."}
{"text":"This is probably some of the best pizza I've ever had. We got the tomato pie pizza. The sauce!!! THE SAUCE! The crust!!!! The CRUST!!! So good! My sister ordered a gluten free pizza and she said it was the best GF pizza crust she's had."}
{"text":"We went during peak dinner hours on a Wednesday night. We were seated promptly, we received great service throughout our visit, our food came to us quickly, and it tasted AMAZING.  I'd highly recommend getting fried eggs on your pizza. It was surprisingly awesome!"}
{"text":"Sal's gives me the perfect excuse to go to Sun Prairie.   I have been here three times as of this review and I will just add to the other reviewers and say this place is just great!  Not normally a pizza person but I gave this place a chance and I'm so happy that I did.  On my first visit I had the C3PO which was amazing!  Second was the Red Dragon on a guest chef night by Tory Miller; this may probably be the best pizza I have ever had.  On the third visit I had My Fat Uncle Tony (I believe that was the name).  Either way, that was great too!    I love that they have different specials every time I'm there.  The toppings are very fresh and the staff is always so friendly.  I am so happy to have found this place though I am hoping for a Madison location soon!"}
{"text":"What can I say about this place that has not been said already??  Well, I was here for Valentines Day so I was able to experience a slightly different menu than they typically had.  From what I understood reservations were needed so we made sure to make them to ensure that we got a table.  Our Valentines day visit was actually my first visit to this particular location.  When we arrived we got parking right in front.  We were addressed right away and seated right away.  Our server was extremely professional and went through the special menu for the day.  The experience that they created was as though we were in a fine dining establishment.  It was nice to feel that level of service from a pizza joint.   I have since been here a few more times since then and have had a pleasant experience each time.  We all know that the pizza is beyond but the service is just a great!  I am alway happy when I have the chance to bring someone new here because I know that they will be blown away!"}
{"text":"My husband says it's the best pizza he has ever had.  This is high praise.  Eat here.  Waitstaff was great, beer was great, pizza was great, even the playlist was great.    It's simple--if you have not been here...go!"}
{"text":"I will build a little rock shrine in my backyard and place a tiny pizza statue in it because, dear Lord, I am grateful for Salvatore's.   A group of friends and I went to Salvatore's last Saturday night. We arrived early for dinner (5:30) because we didn't want to chance any waiting in line. I have to admit that I am not particularly hungry at 5:30 and I was concerned that I wouldn't really enjoy myself. HA! As soon as we walked in, my stomach made a hideously loud, Pavlovian response-type growling noise.   We started our dinner with the Burrata, which is their house-made mozzarella served with crisp bread and strawberries. (I'm busy fashioning a Burrata statue to sit next to my pizza statue)  We followed that with the salad of the day which was lovingly coated with a miraculous pineapple vinaigrette. Sigh. And sigh again because I want more of it now. All of it!  Oh my gawd, the pizza. We chose the Tomato Pie and Terrence's Favorite. It's my favorite, too, Terrence. Actually, the Tomato Pie is also my favorite. I have a sneaking suspicion that everything I eat here will be my favorite. So, the sauce. The sauce is fresh tomato-y and not acidic or sweet or overly herby. It's the perfect sauce. It also did not give me indigestion, which while gross to mention in a public forum, is super important to me for the obvious reasons. The hand-tossed crust is the perfect thickness to chewiness to crunchiness ratio.   Also, I managed to stuff in some dessert which, that night, was a honey custard. (yep, honey custard statue). DELICIOUS. I use the word delicious because I lack the vocabulary to express how much I was grooving on my honey custard. Plus, it was served in a mini mason jar which is always my favorite custard vessel.   I'm always trying to marry food but this time I have drawn up the papers and booked the venue. I LOVE YOU SALVATORE'S."}
{"text":"You know how you hear so much about a place being great, that you can't help but be disappointed when you finally try it? Yeah, well that did not happen at Sal's.   Perfect crust. Sauce so delicious I could eat a gallon of it with a spoon. Fresh mozz with just a hint of smokiness. Sweet Italian sausage that doesn't leave a pool of grease behind. Tomatoes so fresh you wonder where they got them. Just enough fresh basil on the pies to accent the flavors without overpowering. Friendly staff, and we got there just in time to avoid a wait.   Sun Prairie seems so far from Verona, but this place is totally worth the trip."}
{"text":"Oh yes please - I love this place! My fav pizza is the mapache loco, but I've never had bad pizza here. Hey have great specialty pizzas too. Very small inside; it's always crowded when I'm here. Good beer list, and although I always get pizza, one of these days I'm going to try their tacos. I mean seriously pizza AND tacos?!?!"}
{"text":"When I moved to Madison I was shocked at how truly awful the downtown pizza was. Ian's, Pizza de Roma, and Glass Nickel are all bland, uninspiring options. Then I discovered places like Pizza Brutta and Porta Alba that made high quality pizza. Unfortunately, this was \"authentic Italian pizza,\" which I like, but which doesn't really do it for me-- the kind of place where people praise them for not putting too many toppings on the pie. I was still on the lookout for a place where the pizza was decadent and cheesy but also high quality.   Then we moved to the east side and I found two places that fit the bill: Grampa's and Sal's.   Sal's makes a fantastic pizza. My go-to option is the Forza: ricotta cheese, pepperoni, roasted garlic, and chilis (I get it without the tomatoes).  It's everything I could possibly ask for: salty, greasy, decadent and creamy. I'd give them 6 stars for that pizza alone.   I'm less of a fan of their standard options-- too much sauce, not enough cheese, and I thought that the forestiere (sp?) was disappointing-- a little one note.   Other small complaints: -no delivery and not always easy to park  -the space is small and poorly ventilated  - it's a little pricy.   Nonetheless, this easily gets 4 stars-- 4.5 really-- based on the Forza alone. Nice job, Sal's.   Edit: I had a chance to try a few new pies at an event this week. After one bite of the jalape√±o assadero (sp?) I knew I'd be coming back soon. Soon turned out to be the next night. This pizza turned out to be even better than the Forza. The key here is the combination of chorizo AND carnitas. They blend perfectly with the spicy jalape√±o pesto. If it were just chorizo the pizza would be salty and one-note, but the carnitas gives it a nice earthy undertone. This place makes two of the best pizzas I've ever had. If that doesn't deserve five stars, I don't know what does."}
{"text":"Patrick and the crew at Salvatore's are the bee's knees. They have rockin' local partners like Harmony Valley Farm, Underground Meats, Farmer John's cheese, NessAlla Kombucha, Palms Mushroom Cellars, Flyte Family Farm, Ale Asylum, Cargo Coffee and the list goes on and on... The philosophy of using only super-fresh ingredients (\"Wisco not Sysco\") makes for BOMB pizza.   The crust alone will bring you to tears. Add the amazing toppings in cool combinations (Wine Poached Fig and Bacon? Fresh Italian Sausage, caramelized shallots, house roasted sweet red peppers, and goat cheese?) and you've got yourself a damn fine pizza pie. Practice the shoveling motion of arm to mouth before you get there so as not to waste any time devouring it."}
{"text":"PROS: Tasty, crispy tomato pies (pizza) CONS: Limited veggie selections  Solid flavors, large portions, decent prices, casual atmosphere. You can request a large tomato pie with different toppings on each half to satisfy two people's tastes... or eat a whole pie all by yourself! Not many veggie creations on the menu, but you can always build your own!"}
{"text":"\"YAAAAAAAAAAASSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!\" -my reaction upon hearing Salvatore's was opening on E Johnson  But seriously, Salvatore's will forever change how you think about pizza. Their slogan of \"All Wisco, no Sysco\" and their commitment to using only local ingredients sets them apart from the competition.   The dining room is very small, so if you have your heart set on eating there, be prepared to wait 30-45 min on a busy night. Alternatively, you could get carry-out, which tastes just as great. Johnson Public House apparently lets people eat pizza in their space (presumably with the purchase of a coffee or other beverage; I think they have beer too) which is probably the better option.  If you get a large pizza, you have the option of doing 2 flavors on one pie. The Fig & Bacon and El Mapache Loco were real winners. To be fair, bacon goes great with everything, and fig on a pizza is not as crazy as it seems. The Mapache had adobo chicken, roasted poblanos, potatoes, and queso fresco on it, and was definitely my favorite (and also because our waitress told us that Mapache Loco means 'crazy raccoon' in Spanish).  Next time you are thinking about ordering from Domino's, slap yourself in the face and go to Salvatore's instead. You're welcome."}
{"text":"Have you every had one of those experiences where everything at a restaurant truly was excellent? Well, that was Salvatore's. They take their menu to a whole new level.   First there was the salad. I end up eating a huge amount of greens in the course the year, and that's fine. But it's a pretty rare day when I'm eating a salad and think to myself that the lettuce is just delicious. The salad also came with interesting vegetables -- like slices of purple carrots and speckled string beans (I HATE string beans by the way, but gladly ate these).   After talking with the waiter I realized that they had just come back from the farmer's market with everything. A lot of food here either comes directly from the farmer's market or from the farm itself, and it makes a big difference.     Then there is the beer: a very nice mix of small, craft breweries.  Then there is the pizza. If you are looking for just peperoni, this is not your place. I'm really up for creative pizzas, and Salvatore's doesn't disappoint. When there are too many things that look good on the menu and you can't make up your mind, then you are in a good place.   I ended up with the Fig and Bacon (Cabernet poached mission figs, with gorgonzola cheese,  balsamic red wine reduction, and bacon). Excellent!   Easily could have also gone for:   Forestiere (Thinly sliced onions, bacon lardons, cr√®me fraiche, Pleasant Ridge Reserve,  fresh thyme and local mushrooms)   or  Vegetarian (Roasted beet pesto, kale, goat cheese, parsley, red wine reduction)   I'll just have to come back and try the others!"}
{"text":"This is one of those rare places where the vegan and the carnivore are both happy. On my pizza, fig, goat cheese, grilled onion, and of course, bacon. Mr. vegan had it a little differently and he had cauliflower puree sauce on his personal pizza. Also, highly recommended, get one of the salads and split it. Again both the vegan and the carnivore can be happy this way. There are fresh seasonal ingredients in the salads like ground cherries! This is rare and special. Blow off the chains and check out this great spot. It is well worth a little Drive off of I-90 to get to Sun Prairie in Wisconsin. Gas up at Costco and go here to have dinner."}
{"text":"Great pizza. Only dined in once usually we just get carry out. Their $12 Tuesday special is a hit in our house. Haven't had anything bad. The service wasn't great when we went in and it's usually packed so carry out is the way to go if you're just looking to get some delicious pizza."}
{"text":"Their vegan pizza is out of this world.  By far, the best vegan pizza option in town.  Love this place!"}
{"text":"Does it get better than Sal's??  Fresh ingredients, creative pies, worth the money and the drive!"}
{"text":"Just had the \"Uncle\" Fat Tony pizza-fabulous! Great sauce, great crust, super toppings! Meant to have two slices, had four! Hats off to \"Sal\""}
{"text":"Best pizza I can remember eating, ever. Great atmosphere as well, perfect crust and great toppings, including the pesto."}
{"text":"Best pizza of my life, cheerful and friendly service, and a bright atmosphere. I couldn't ask for more!"}
{"text":"Drove to Sun Prairie last night for dinner at Sal's.  Never knew this place existed before receiving a CityTin for Christmas.  What a great way to start our culinary adventure.    First impression from the parking lot was a little bleak.  It looked like we were about to enter a dentist office, but once inside our view changed.  The smallish dining area was cozy, warmly lit and surprisingly child friendly.  We were welcomed and seated immediately.  Our service throughout dinner was stellar.  The food.  We decided to try one of their rotolos and it did not disappoint.  They are basically pizza dough biscuits topped with prosciutto, smoked provolone, spinach, and their house pesto.  I will say that for their size they are not $6 amazing, but really good.  For the main course we ordered a half and half specialty.  1/2 Fat Uncle Tony.  1/2 Farmer John's Smoked Gouda.  We were really impressed.  The sauce is one of the best that I've ever had and the crust is delicious.  I know that I'll go back because there are still 8 specialty pies that I haven't tried.  If they're half as good as what we had last night, it will be well worth the drive."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and even better food! This is by far my favorite pizza place in the Madison area."}
{"text":"Go the extra mile!  No, literally, please.  For the last year you've been delivering to our home in the Castleton Crossing neighborhood.  Tonight the gentleman on the phone informed us we live a mile outside your delivery zone.  Yes, we are 6.1 miles from your establishment.  Please go the extra mile, for all us neighbors to the north who love your pizza."}
{"text":"The pizza here is really good.  Fresh ingredients, creative.  The acoustics are awful.  It is so noisy!  Add some acoustic panels & it will crest a more enjoyable environment where we can hear each other talk."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best pizza on the planet. If ordering it for delivery, they are shockingly fast. My family and I will honestly eat pizza from just about anywhere, but Salvitore's is special and in a league of its own. It really is a unique experience, and mind you that we're talking about pizza!"}
{"text":"This place truly defines what a family pizza place should be like.  They use fresh ingredients and make a damn good pizza.  To start with we got the garlic bread which was unlike anything I have ever had before.  It comes with a sauce and a salad, both blew me away.  For the pizza we spit it half spicy cheese and half a veg.  It was awesome.  Even the crust and dough that they use has a particular flavor that remided me of the pizza we had in NYC.  The best thing was you could tell that the ingredients were fresh with basil, tomatoes, and sauce that was nothing like I have had in the past.    If we are ever in the area we will definitely be back.  They also have a good beer and wine section."}
{"text":"Great & creative pizza, a very tasty specialty salad of shaved brussels sprouts and goat cheese plus some Jolly Pumpkin sours is a potent combination. The salad we ordered was the daily special so I can't speak as to its availability when you visit. We ordered the Forza pizza which came with excellent sausage, cherry tomatoes, and garlic. I felt like the ricotta probably took it into too rich territory but that's a pretty minor complaint.  Protip: you can get pizzas split into two flavors so you can try more stuff."}
{"text":"This pizza is so good! I grew up in NY and am pretty snobby about pizza, but Sals passes my test. It has the crust consistency and slice size* of what I would consider \"real\" pizza with the flavors and unique ingredients of a more gourmet spot.  The carbonara pie is out of this world. I tried a bite of my friends' jalape√±o pizza and it was also great. I can't wait to try more pies and do take out!   *if you can't fold it, it's not pizza. Sorry."}
{"text":"Was recommended by a friend. The pizzas are ok but you pay twice as much as you should for them. I understand that it's trying to give you something nicer than your average pizza chain, but it was sadly underwhelming."}
{"text":"The charcuterie board was different. I would put the vegetables in a bowl because I didn't like the pickled flavor imposed on the cheese.  I probably wouldn't order it again.    We ordered the Forza pie which was excellent.  The blend of flavors made it easy to destroy the whole pie.  I would definitely order it again.  Our friends are big fans of the Woodsman.  We will be back."}
{"text":"For my first review I gave them a 5 star because of the nice pizza but they lost a star because the garlic bread was over cooked. Well, it's Monday, I asked everyone what they wanted and  Salvatore's Tomato Pies was the overwhelming selection. We just went to place our order and,...they're closed on Monday's! So they loose another star. I guess people don't need to eat on Mondays! I'm sure they will state it's so they can spend time with their families. I work in a service industry and have people working 24/7 so that doesn't go far with me. I'll still be back, but not on a Monday.Third update, down another star. 2 Stars now...I went to pick up a pizza to go, paid for it with a credit card, they ran it through a new fancy touch screen POS system and then she pretty much stuck the machine in my face and said, \" here you go, just add your tip and you'll be set\". I'm not sure about you but tip is optional, and when its to go tips are either 3-5%, or none as they didn't really provide much of a service. The machine gave me 3 clear options, 18%, 20% or 25%. I'm thinking I could have some how worked out how to enter a lower tip but was in a hurry with a hot pizza. Next time I'll have to bring cash with the correct amount, plus a smaller tip amount."}
{"text":"So.... Sal's was already one of my favorite pizza places (ie, my husband and I travel OUT of Madison into the original location, which is in Sun Prairie.... Which says a lot!), but I just found out they ALSO serve tacos now! I know what you might be thinking: a restaurant should stick with what they're good at.  I just tried their Carnitas Taco and their \"taco of the day,\" and I am SO IMPRESSED!  This chef really knows what they're doing!  Love Salvatore's even more.    If you haven't tried this place yet: you're missing out!"}
{"text":"We had an amazing dinner last week at Salvatore's! Nice place to walk to, or even drive to, located in charming downtown Sun Prairie on Main Street. Amazing food, pizza, service, drinks, beer, and atmosphere. Do yourself a favor and have dinner at Salvatores's soon!  \"The Diet Starts Tomorrow\" Stout is awesome!"}
{"text":"The best pizza in Madison! The entire staff is helpful and passionate about the cause! The carbonara is delicious and I anxiously await the weekend specials. I find that any other pizza pails in comparison. Can you pay an Uber to deliver??"}
{"text":"Awesome pizza in a nice cozy house-restaurant! While they call them tomato pies, they're very similar to the pizza you're used to, so don't let that scare you from trying out this place.  The place is fairly small so it may be easy to miss, but you'll generally see a pretty crowded front patio-like area. In total, I would estimate about 7-8 tables inside with 4-6 smaller tables outside. For how popular this place is, that's certainly not enough. I noticed a lot of people get pizzas here for take out, which is probably a good idea if you're not a fan of waiting and it's a weekend night.   Now on to the food: given that multiple people have told me that this is the BEST pizza in Madison, I was SLIGHTLY disappointed. Now that's not to say that Sal's was not good - it's excellent pizza. They do price the pizza at a higher amount than most people are used to for pizza, but I think it's worth it to try some of their more unique specialty pizzas. I really enjoyed the Forza! The crust was perfectly flavorful, and the toppings tasted fresh and well-cooked.   I would recommend this place if you're a pizza lover for sure! I'm sure I'll be back here, and perhaps after trying other popular places (like Pizza Brutta), I'll see which one truly deserves to be crowned the \"best pizza in Madison\"."}
{"text":"I've been to Salvatore's three times now. The first time was in Sun Prairie, and the last two times have been at their new Madison location.  I've never been as excited about Salvatore's as many are. In Sun Prairie, I found the place very dark and very smoky. Strangely, the poor ventilation issue seems to also be affecting their Madison location. The windows are coated in steam and it's smoky inside. Not quite as dark as the Sun Prairie location, but the black walls are sure trying their hardest to fight the light from the big storefront windows. Just kind of gloomy. The decor overall leaves something to be desired at the new location. It seems like an afterthought, nothing really goes together.   The pizza is delicious. Not Grampa's-level delicious, but they do have an amazing sauce recipe. On my first visit to the new location, I had the Forza pizza, which had whole cloves of roasted garlic on it, and it was so, so good. Unfortunately, the after effects for my stomach were so, so not good.  In light of that, on my most recent visit I tried the fish tacos, and my dining companion had the veggie version. The light, doubled corn tortillas were done very well, but the fish tacos themselves were almost inedibly hot (as in spicy hot). The pickled veggies were a mixed bag of good and not so good. The pickled brussels sprouts were so good, almost addictive. We also ordered the white bean hummus and veggies appetizer. It was served with hard, dry, tasteless slices of baguette, and the same pickled veggies. The hummus had zero flavoring, as though they had just opened a can of beans and threw them in the blender and called it good. Not so good, as it turns out.  The unfortunate stomach issues happened again after this last visit. Not sure what's up with that. We also had a waiter with a bit of a 'tude, which is always fun. Asked several times for water, and when he finally brought it, he only brought one glass, I said \"can we both have one, please?\" And he snapped, \"well, why didn't you say so?\" Or words to that effect. Charming chap. I see that they are currently looking for waitstaff, so maybe this is the best they are able to get right now, for some reason.  I'll give it some time, and try it again. I really, really want to like it more than I do now. The tap beer list is nice, the menu is varied and creative, and I love the location."}
{"text":"Get the burrata if not that hungry for pizza. They are one of the best. I took mine to go.  Also the place had an aroma of pizza being baked....when the powdery flour touches the fire. The aroma itself will draw you to the menu!! I'll surely come here on my next visit to beautiful Sun Prairie."}
{"text":"Amazing pizzas and spaghetti! Service was great too and the wine selection was fantastic. We will make this a regular spot from now on!"}
{"text":"Here's looking at you, Sal.  Don't let the unassuming suburban strip mall storefront in Sun Prairie deter you, chef Patrick DePula artisan's approach takes the humble pizza pie to a whole new level.    I was introduced to Salvatore's at a recent Yelp Big Bite event and we really hit it off.  Sal swept me off my feet with the rich tomato sauce, the gourmet quality, locally sourced toppings and that oh-so chewy crust.  So I decided it was time to take our relationship to the next level.  Yes, it was time to introduce Sal to the rest of the family.  They are not an easy bunch to please with everyone liking different pizza toppings, so this fateful meeting would determine our destiny together.  Sal started things out on the right foot.  Our server welcomed us once we were seated and walked us through the menu.  She was knowledgeable about the wine list and helped my wife and I with our selections.  The girls ordered bottles of Hubert's lemonade (surprisingly balanced, not too tart, not too sweet) and my son ordered his fave, Sprecher's cream soda.  For the appetizer, we selected the Wisconsin meat and cheese board.  The family wasn't a fan of the goat salami (that meant more for me - yay), but the rest of the tray was a hit.  The Saucisson Sec from Underground Meats paired up perfectly with both the Hook's 5 year old cheddar and the Satori Espresso BellaVitano.  So Sal made it through the preliminaries, but what about the main event?  Will the family embrace my new flame with the same passion???  We ordered two 16\" pies with 3 different combinations.  The favorite was the Terrence's Favorite (fresh Italian sausage, caramelized shallots, house roasted sweet red peppers and goat cheese).  We enjoyed the contrast between the sweetness of the shallots and the pungency of the goat cheese.  It is a combination that we will order again.  The pepperoni and feta pie also was enjoyed.  The slightly sweet feta was dolloped on the pie paired well with the sauce and contrasted nicely with the salty pepperoni.  The one combination that didn't work as well was the roasted red pepper and feta combo.  The sauce just overwhelmed the other toppings.  While it's a great sauce (a wonderful balance of savory, sweetness and acidity with a definite herbal backbone), I would have the kitchen hold back a little on the sauce to make for a more balanced bite between toppings, sauce and crust.  (This, along with the noisiness of the dining room, tilted the rating to four stars.)  The real star of the night was the crust.  It was the Helen of Troy of crusts - its golden hue could launch a thousand ships.  The crust has both bite and chew, a hint of natural sweetness and SERIOUS flavor.  Unlike many large pizzas that are doughy in the middle and too crunchy along the outer edge, this pizza was perfectly baked.  The ultimate test, not one of the kids left any crust behind like is usually the case with lesser pizzas.  After polishing off a couple of refreshing cappuccino gelatos for dessert, our server packed up the leftovers, and called it a night.  As for me and Sal, well, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship."}
{"text":"Chef Patrick DePula artisan's approach takes the humble pizza pie to a whole new level.    I was introduced to Salvatore's in 2013 that the epic Yelp Big Bite month long series of events and we really hit it off.

Yes, it was time to introduce Sal to the rest of the family.    They are not an easy bunch to please with everyone liking different pizza toppings, so this fateful meeting would determine our destiny together.  Needless to say, it was mutual love at first sight and Sal's quickly became part of the family, plying us with an endless parade of locally-sourced foods expertly prepared by his crack kitchen staff.  Not to be outdone, the service staff at Sal's is always on top of their game, deftly explaining the day's specials and providing insights those decision-adverse members of our dining group.    The pizzas served by Salvatore's are consistently among the Madison area's best.   The standard pies feature a robust tomato sauce that puts the diner in a state of tomato nirvana.  The cheeses used by Sal's are locally sourced from Farmer's market superstar John Dougherty (his cheese curds are to die for) and Grande Cheese of Fond du Lac.  The quality of the artisan topping is top notch as well, including pepperone from Underground Meats, organic produce from Harmony Farms and other seasonal ingredients from local farms and purveyors (Pro tip: morel season is a mystical time to visit Sal's).  The crust is transcendent, I like to call it the Helen of Troy of crusts - its golden hue could launch a thousand ships.  The crust has both bite and chew, a hint of natural sweetness and SERIOUS flavor.  Unlike many large pizzas that are doughy in the middle and too crunchy along the outer edge, this pizza was perfectly baked.  The ultimate test, not one of the kids left any crust behind like is usually the case with lesser pizzas.  Not in the mood for pizza, fret not, gentle reader.  Sal's also bring it A-game to an tantalizing array of entr√©e options, including an amazing short rib ragu, a stellar NY Strip and a superb Arctic Char.  A kid's menu providers child-pleasing options like spaghetti & meatballs and grilled cheese sandwiches.  And the homemade burrata is a can't miss option on the appetizer menu.  Sal's is now rocking local diners its splendid new digs in downtown Sun Prairie location, so the dining experience is as easy on the eyes as the photogenic food."}
{"text":"Tried this place once before and it was pretty good, perhaps a touch salty for my taste, but I blame myself for the excess topping I ordered.  Last night my wife and I needed a quick pick up before we left town but couldn't decide pizza or tacos. Why not both! Anyway, I arrived to pick it up and eat street mis quoted me and I was 30 mins early, but on a time crunch. They, without hesitation expedited my order, despite being busy and knocked it out in 10 mins. On top of that, the food was A+. Thank you guys for the food and service."}
{"text":"Eight words...make a reservation and don't show up late.  But more to the point, the food is good but not out of this world.  We ordered the Figgie Piggie and the Meatballer pizzas. Both were very tasty but we've definitely had better. The service was another story. We almost got up and left because we sat for 15 minutes (after waiting for 40 minutes in the bar) and not one person acknowledged us. We finally had to flag someone down to get served. Since we were celebrating a birthday, it was really a fun-killing experience overall. The hostess was less than friendly as well. We left with the impression that they believe they're better than they really are. Spend your hard earned cash elsewhere."}
{"text":"Suggestions: Go early or get take out  Always order the bacon cheese bread  Go halfsies to avoid having to choose one pizza (Farmer John and Fat Uncle Tony is my favorite combo)  Order a beer"}
{"text":"Ridiculously good pizza with unique ingredients. Went with the larger size with half as the day's special (carnitas, pineapple, poblano, queso fresco) and half Forestiere (bacon, creme fraiche, melted Pleasant Ridge Reserve). Skipped the bacon cheese bread this time - it's a favorite from the Sun Prairie menu that's included at Johnson Street.   Visited early - 5 PM on a Saturday to avoid the wait. The dining space was a little loud."}
{"text":"The pinnacle of my Madison Pizza experience. Once my wife and I discovered Salvatore's that became our go to Pizza joint until we moved to Santa Cruz, CA.   Typical pick-up order experience. Place order, head over early, order a beer to drink at the bar wait for the pizza to finish. Hang out for a bit. Front staff is super friendly and chill. Helpful & courteous. Choose a 6 pack to-go (not sure if they are still doing this, but they were when I was there), grab the Za and go!    My wife and I dined in a couple times, quaint dining area. Enjoyable. When it is nice outside they will get the tables going out on the sidewalk.   The gluten free crust is amazing, don't let this crust pass you by, topped with the works, deluxe style, always. Their sausage, pepperoni, veggies, are all extremely high quality. The pizza is enough for two to share.   Morel mushroom pizza is, well, the best pizza I've ever had in my life. I will miss that pizza, a lot.  Thanks for the great memories. :)"}
{"text":"Yup.  um. Where do I even start.  I first went to get their gluten free pizza.  Not bad at all for being gluten free.  Then I brought my pizza-nazi parents.  My dad ordered the pizza with the fried egg.  A big no-no in my mom's book but it was so right!  Ooooey and gooey in all the right places.  My mom got the mediterranean pizza and she said she will fly from WA just to get this pizza.  Well, it could have been the garlic spread for the garlic bread that helped her make that decision but none the less, the food is amazing.  Now, everytime I bring up Sun Prairie or Salvatore's, my parents immediately get irritated.  It is just as dangerous now that they have one opening up closer to downtown.    Their pizzas are a genius mix of flavors, most of which I would not have thought of.  Their daily specials are borderline artistic and push the envelope in creativity.  They post their daily specials on facebook and even the pictures make me drool.  Yup. go.  Just go. Now."}
{"text":"This place is a mixed bag, but overall good. Please make a reservation here if you can before you show up. I think we went on a weeknight and it was a 45 min wait. It's a little inconvenient, but it just shows how popular the place is!  The food is good, but I'm not blown away by it. This is not my favorite pizza place. It's also slightly more expensive than it's worth in my opinion. It does have a vegetarian / vegan option, which always rocks in my book!! Plus the option isn't Diaya, which I personally hate. Although there are awesome vegan cheese options out there that they could try.  Our service at the bar wasn't amazing. We usually avoid eating at the bar wherever we go. I'm sure the table service is way better. The bar was packed, so I'm sure that's why the service wasn't as great.  The location is super cute and very hipster. It's perfect for an evening out for a couple or the whole family. Plus you can visit all the local shops nearby!!"}
{"text":"After falling into a rut with ordering the Forestiere; (thinly sliced onions, bacon lardons, creme' fraiche, Pleasant Ridge Reserve, fresh thyme, local mushroom); and after missing the delectable Valentine's Day Dinner, tonight....we decided to break the cycle..... And order a HALF Forestiere, and half Vegetarian (Roasted Beer Pesto, Kale, Goat Cheese and Red Wine Reduction).  Hey...It's a start!  But when you find a diamond you don't keep looking for coal, right?  Chef Beth is amazing!!  You've gotta try this place... Also I'm Sun Prairie in a larger scale."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Visiting my sister in Sun Prarie means we usually head to Madison for all sorts of deliciousness, but not this time!  Salvatore's has apparently been open during my previous visits but has moved down the street and completely renovated the space. It feels awesome when you walk in the door with floor to ceiling windows facing main street, beautiful wood walls, the glow of the pizza oven in the back and a nice bar.  We took my monster (18 month nephew) on a Saturday night, yes ee are brave idiots. The hostess greeted us either a container of goldfish crackers and a friendly smile witht the promise of a high chair added to the end of our four top table. Lots of cozy booths, a great place for an evening out with friends or a casual date.  Now let's get to it. The pizza was AWESOME! They let you split the pie down the middle, so we tried the classic tomato pie, the Fat Uncle Tony, and the Figgie Piggie. All worth repeating! The crust on these pies is so good and not one you will leave on your plate.  The staff was wonderful and we will be back!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and both times it has been exceptional. The owner was so accommodating of my son's food allergies. He personally responded to a Yelp message within an hour. They food is delicious, the drinks are divine, and the atmosphere is fun. I can't say enough good things."}
{"text":"A real gem in a more than oversaturated pizza market. And while I have tried a few of the offerings that I just did not care for, it remains that the base ingredients are still excellent (crust, sauce, cheese's) and it is more than apparent that the staff is very passionate and attentive to the success of this restaurant."}
{"text":"I was only in town for a few nights and wanted to sample everything I could.  So glad I stopped at Salvatore's... they did not disappoint!"}
{"text":"Best in town.   Za-tis-all!  Ok, ok... I'll continue.  1. Start with salad. Say what? Salad. Boooooring. Nope not here. Greens combine with seasonal veggies and a zippy little vinaigrette that had more flavor that most roughage I've eaten around these parts. The size was perfect for three people to share without filling us up too much before pounding pizza.   2. We grabbed garlic bread too and all agreed that for garlic bread, it was pretty bomb. I mean, bread/garlic/butter could be uber lame right? Nope.   3. You can do a half and half, so yay for that! We did half of their special that night which I won't describe because you'll be pissed when you go and they no longer have it and half of the spek and arugula. Suffice it to say, it doesn't matter what you order (in my opinion) because the toppings are incredible, the dough/sauce/protein ratio is perfect and I could easily have polished off more than I did if it weren't for my little issue with lactose.   There you have it. 1-2-3! Oh, and because the place is small, head over around 7:30 when it seems most in Sun Prairie (even on the Friday I went) are back at home."}
{"text":"The best pizza in Sun Prairie. Love that they use fresh, local ingredients. I also enjoy that they are daring and try new things."}
{"text":"Not sure how to start this review off so I'll just get right to it. This is the best damn pizza I've had in a long time! Say what! Yes the BEST! Why say you... The crust is off the chain. Not to thin, not to thick and cooked to a brilliant crispness that is nothing short of perfection.   I've said it several times, I am a pizza whore and I mess with all types of pies. Salvatore's though will forever hold a special spot in my heart for truly amazing pizza. I need this in my life and I'm so happy we have friends in Madison because they are the perfect excuse for us making the jaunt to come and get the goods at Salvatore's!   We had two pizzas. Yes two and we were freaking stuffed!    The first was a game changer. The Carbonara which is Farmer John's Colby Caliente, mozzarella, mushrooms, bacon, scallions, 3 organic soft cooked eggs, finished with fresh arugula. Verdict: 5 stars! The eggs were runny and I have never had or heard of a pizza like this so just amazing!  The second and my personal favorite was the Forestiere which has thinly sliced onions, bacon lardons, cr√®me fraiche, Pleasant Ridge Reserve,fresh thyme and local mushrooms. Verdict: My FAVORITE! Lot's of flavor and just oh so satisfying.   I wish there was one in Milwaukee. It's so worth the drive though!"}
{"text":"Sooooo. This place is delicious, no doubt. You can't really go wrong here. Ingredients are fresh. Pizza dough is perfection. Perfectly between thick and thin and perfect doughyness. I heard the table next to us compliment on the gluten free dough, too. We got the bacon cheese bread as the app, which was yummy. Large chunks of thick, crisp bacon. We also got a large half carbonara, half Forza. Forza, while good was pretty tomato-y and had whole pieces of garlic. It would be super good if that's your thing. These pizzas aren't very saucy, but it doesn't make it seem dry tho.   Place is also kinda small, so expect to wait.   They also have happy hour 20% off bill from like 4-5p and 8-10p I think.."}
{"text":"The food was amazing!  It was a little on the pricey side until you taste the freshness of everything and it makes it worth what you're paying.  The service could use improvement.  Our server only stopped by towards the end."}
{"text":"Sal's is by no means a convenient place for us to go (30-40 min drive each way), but I am very happy to report that it is worth the trip.   The place is small but still seats a decent amount of people. We loved the food and the service, and the Square checkout is great. Email receipts = no more purse clutter and more trees!  We ordered the Farmer's market vegetable antipasto and a pizza that was half Terrence's favorite (red bell pepper, sausage, caramelized shallots, mozzarella, goat cheese) and half Fat Uncle Tony (sausage, pepperoni, Nueske's smoked bacon). I was super impressed by the size of the antipasto as well as the variety of veggies on the large wood board it came on! There was a sampling of greens, pickled veggies, garlic scapes, housemade crostini and a delicious white bean puree that tasted just like my favorite cannellini bean soup. The pizza was unique and really excellent. The sauce was swirled on the pizza (see other people's pictures), and that helped showcase the toppings in a way that having sauce under the cheese cannot. My favorite was the Terrence's, the caramelized shallots and goat cheese really hit the spot for me. That being said, the Fat Uncle Tony was also really tasty. I especially liked the smokiness from the bacon.  Our waitress was super nice and very helpful, and she checked on us often even though they were pretty busy while we were there. We really enjoyed our visit and look forward to returning to Sun Prairie to explore more of Sal's menu!"}
{"text":"Excellent pies!!! My favorites are 4 and 6. Every time we go the ingredients are super fresh and yummy. The crust is always cooked to perfection, just the perfect combination of soft and crunch. Also, the burrata is to die for!! I just wish they were a little bigger because the wait can sometimes be a little long. Totally worth it though! Best pizza in madison no doubt."}
{"text":"Simply the best pizza in the Madison area. I love goat cheese. I mean love it! Terrence's Favorite is dynamite. The entire menu is just delicious. Located downtown in a cool older building that offers fantastic eats in a city that has few truly great options."}
{"text":"Madison has had a bit of a mini pizza renaissance within the past few years. In spite of not really being a \"pizza town,\" we now have a solid number of pretty excellent pizza places.     Salvatore's is probably now my favorite pizza in town. As an east coast expat I have a soft spot for NY style pizza, and there's no good NY style pizza in Madison. While Salvatore's is a little different from NY style, that's no bad thing at all. I really love their crust, which has just the right thickness and balance of crunch to chew.  Their ingredients are top notch, and there's always a cool special.    I work near downtown and live on the southwest side.  I like Salvatore's so much that I'll drive into downtown after work to take a pizza back home, a good 10 miles and 20 minutes away.  I just warm it back up a little in my oven and it's good to go.    I actually wrote a post about them on a car blog I write for, and Patrick, the owner, saw it because he's also a car guy. He hooked me up with some free fish tacos the next time I came in.  Score one for the internet!  The only bad thing I can say about Salvatore's is I liked them on facebook and now their delicious photos keep showing up in my news feed tempting me to buy more pizza."}
{"text":"The best pizza I've had in Madison (and several other cities).   We got a pizza to-go after having dinner at a place nearby. Even though we'd just eaten dinner, we couldn't stay away from the pizza here. It was fantastic.  The end."}
{"text":"Fantastic pizzas... er, they're actually Tomato Pies. Slightly different than pizza (sauce goes on top) but still hits that itch. The red sauce doesn't come on all of them, but the one I had did, and it was ridiculously delicious. Being on top also gave me a chance to savor the flavor.   Great, friendly service, too. They had our appetizers out faster than we could even go pee!"}
{"text":"Don't get the hype.  Solid pizza, quality ingredients but ultimately doesn't come together into anything special.  Also thought quantity of toppings was a little chintzy for prices charged - got sausage and maybe got a quarter link total on half a 16\" pizza?  Hope for better from one of the highest rated pizza spots in town."}
{"text":"Cool little place off downtown. Staff was friendly and helpful picking out a pizza. Unique take of various flavors. We had the Forza and a fig and bacon pizza. Both were great in their own way. The Forza was my favorite."}
{"text":"Moving to a new city, it was a priority to find a new pizza place that lived up to what I was used to.  I'm happy to say this Salvatore's surpassed my expectations.  Our visit started off pretty rocky. We were asked to wait ~30 minutes.  In that time, we watched as five tables were cleaned and readied.  Our wait ended up being around 45 minutes and the table we ended up at was ready 20 minutes before we were seated.  To be honest, I was about to leave when they finally called us.  There really should be better communication in the front of the house.  However, I am glad that I stayed.  We started with the deep fried meatballs and they were excellent.  Hard to go wrong with deep frying.  Our server was very energetic and friendly.  She helped us decide on a combo pizza, half Forza and half Fat Uncle Tony.  The Fat Uncle Tony was really good. It showed off the quality of the meats very well.  The Forza was amazing!  The way the flavors all formed together is something I can't fully described.  We actually got hungrier as we ate it and wanted more when we were done.  I'm not a big fan of most Italian desserts, so I'm going to gloss over what we had so as not to detract from them.  I will say that they were made well.  With the great service, excellent appetizer and amazing pizza, we will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"One of the best pizzas I've ever had. Love that they use locally sourced cheeses and heritage pigs for their pork products.  The quality of the ingredients shine through in the superb flavor of the pizza."}
{"text":"As a student, I don't get to leave campus often to explore good pizza options. Not that Ian's, Pizza Roma, Lotsa, etc. are not alright but they're made for college kids with little to no options. I saw reviews for Salvatore's and decided it was worth the trip. This place did not disappoint at all. Best pizza in Madison I've had thus far. We had the special. A pizza with shrimp confused me at first , but as soon as I ate, all the flavored  worked together so well. Amazing. Great service . Great vibes for a small, home-y, local pizza place. I cannot wait to go back. I will go on comparing every pizza in Madison to this place . Thank you!"}
{"text":"Made our own pizza and it was fantastic. Jalape√±o pesto is very good and not something I've seen before. Garlic bread was really good too, came with a garlic butter that was awesome. Small pizza is probably big enough for 2"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to check this place out for a while so I took advantage of a two day stint in Sun Prairie to see if it lived up to the hype.   + Nice interior - Bar stools are super uncomfortable + Half-price 10-inch pizzas at the bar for happy hour - Staff didn't know about happy hour + Market pizza was delicious - Figgie Piggie was a little too salty, the blue cheese overpowered the other flavors + Calamari was a HUGE portion  + Grapefruit margarita was delicious. Rest of the cocktail menu looked great.  Two pizzas, calamari, a cocktail, and two beers came to $50 (with the happy hour special) and we took half of it home. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Sometimes I wish that I could buy a candle that smells like this place, but then I'd probably eat the candle.  This place is still the best. I think it always will be. I must warn you, though, once you taste their pies they will ruin all other pizza for you. Chicago won't live up to it. New York won't live up to it.   A lot of people view pizza as something that you order for take out or delivery during the week because you had a busy day, or you don't know what you want for dinner. They view it as a quick and easy option. I feel like Sal's is out to change that thought.   THE best? Yes. Go."}
{"text":"As a Chicagoan spoiled by our pizza, I was skeptical, especially because the place is tiny, which made me mistake it for a hole in the wall. I'm glad I didn't walk away! The pizza was absolutely delicious! The toppings were fresh, and interestingly, they place the cheese under the sauce. I found this made it not as messy to eat. The almond panna cotta with strawberries had a light consistency and was superb. I suggest arriving early, because there will definitely be a wait. I'll certainly be back the next time I'm in Madison!"}
{"text":"Yes, y'all, the rumors are true. This place is great. Each time I've gone with my favorite -- the most basic you can get, with tomato sauce, cheese, and basil, because that's the first way to judge quality. So excellent!"}
{"text":"We just moved to Sun Prairie and are making it our mission to try all of the pizza places in town. But after trying Salvatore's, I'm not sure I can go anywhere else!  We only got one pizza - the Farmer John's Smoked Gouda special (with organic heirloom tomatoes from Emerald meadow farm, Farmer John's smoked gouda, local Portobello mushrooms, caramelized onions, heirloom garlic, and Jordandal bacon) - and an order of smoky cheese bread.  OH MY GOSH. This was hands down the BEST pizza I have ever had. I loved the portobello mushrooms and caramelized onions on top. My husband and I were fighting each other for the leftovers the next day!  It's a little pricey, but it was SO WORTH IT."}
{"text":"WOW!!!  I have searched my adulthood for the perfect pizza.  Who would have thought I would find it in Sun Prairie.  Everything is local and fresh.  Terrance's Favorite is the my pizza of choice.  Their lunches are great also.  The bread they use for sandwiches is amazing and the meat can't be described.  I swear it tastes like WI.  Many times Rhonda and I have swapped meals because we wanted to try both dishes.  I hope with them growing so fast that they don't lose their uniqueness and quality."}
{"text":"We still love Sal's and will continue to go there for dinner, but I wanted to update my review after a particularly bad lunch we had there last week.  It seems that while Sal's is a great dinner spot, it is not great for lunch.    We arrived for a later lunch around 1:00 and found only one other customer in the place.  We were told to sit wherever we wanted, and a server came and brought us menus fairly quickly, but then did not return for quite a while.  When he finally returned, he muttered something about not wanting to \"rush\" us, but it was clear he'd forgotten to come back to the table.    My husband and I both ordered the same thing- 2 slices (1 of the daily special, one of the veggie pizza). Eventually a different server showed up at our table and handed my husband the correct food, but handed me a plate with one slice of pizza. I told her I'd ordered two slices, then repeated my order to her. She got all flustered, took my plate away to talk to someone in the kitchen, then returned with the one slice and told me \"you can just have this while we work on the other one.\" A few minutes later, she brings out another slice of the daily special and not the veggie, which was what I'd originally ordered (and repeated). I just gave up and ate it, since by that time, my husband was already done eating and I didn't care to wait for ANOTHER slice.  The worst part was that the pizza itself was not good.  It had clearly just been pre-cooked and re-heated (I get that's probably standard for a by-the-slice lunchtime kind of thing) so the crust was dry and stale and the toppings were only lukewarm. And while the descriptions of both kinds we'd ordered implied a lot of hearty toppings, all 4 slices we had were pretty bare. The daily special (which we ended up with three slices of between the two of us) was supposed to have chicken on it- not a single one of the pieces had any chicken on them.  We both walked out still hungry- which is something I NEVER thought could happen there! But that's what happens when your pizza is almost bare of toppings.  So overall the service was absolutely terrible and the pizza was awful. Had that been our first visit to Sal's, there's no way we'd ever go back. Luckily we know they can do better, but we certainly won't make the mistake of going for lunch ever again."}
{"text":"1st time trying this place! Absolutely FANTASTIC!  Best pizza and service! The ingredients are super fresh and delish! My husband and I will be back for sure! We actually sat down and waited about 15 min at another local Sun Prairie pizza place down the street and got sick of not being helped so we walked out! Glad we went here instead! We were greeted by a bubbly, helpful waitress and had our drinks within a few minutes! This is how it's done people!"}
{"text":"My FAVORITE place to get pizza delivered from. I normally just build a classic tomato pie so I can add my own toppings. This way you can customize it for anyone with various food restrictions. They have gluten free crusts and vegan options -- I haven't tried the vegan bean puree, but definitely will soon! The crust is delicious, ingredients are fresh and overall it's affordable. It doesn't take look long to get the pizza delivered, we live in an apartment and they bring it right to our door. Also a plus -- their boxes turn into plates! :)"}
{"text":"Salvatore's Tomato Pies deserves a thorough review and I will come back to leave one very soon but for now let me just summarize. The space is small and it will almost certainly be crowded and loud. Service in such a confined space is a huge challenge and while we had a few hiccups (like our pizzas accidentally being served to another table) I'd say overall it was very friendly and competent. The food is OUTSTANDING!!! Really everything we ordered was at least very good and in some cases truly excellent. The food is the reason to visit Salvatore's and it is certainly reason enough to go!"}
{"text":"As a former employee, I think it speaks volumes that this is still my favorite pizza place EVER! Being behind the scenes gave me an even greater appreciation for how hard the owner works to provide quality, local food and support the community. The food has always been dynamite and even in a rush when things may (rarely) go a little awry, the kitchen and front-of-house staff work to do anything they can to make your experience a pleasure. I feel so lucky to have a place like this nearby! Thank you all for your hard work and dedication to your craft!"}
{"text":"Fantastic neopolitan style pizza! The sauce is amazing, and the crust is made perfectly. Very friendly service as well. The only thing I wish they had was a little more space. Otherwise, great place!"}
{"text":"OMG. This pizza is AMAZING. I honestly don't think I've had better pizza anywhere else. The crust is to die for...I don't know what the secret is (the dough recipe? the oven? magical pizza elves?) and I don't care as long as they keep making it so I can put it my mouth...nom nom nom. They don't take reservations and it can get busy on a weekend evening but you can put in your name and sit at their (very tiny) \"bar\" for a drink or head next door to Johnson Public House and they will call when your table is ready. Oh, and I have to give one suggestion to Salvatore's on behalf of my husband, please put olive oil on the table so he can dip the delicious crust in it."}
{"text":"Question. Are the hipsters of Madison born in dairy barns? Apparently so as two tables of ten total were screaming at the top of their lungs. It sounded as if the Badgers and Spartans were in overtime and the Big Ten title was on the line.  The food was good. Price was fair."}
{"text":"Been to this location twice in the recent past, once dining in and the other for carry out. Both times I got the Fat Uncle Tony which was nothing short of fantastic. I would recommend dining in as the take out didn't have the same ring to it, however it's was hotter than a SOB in this place with the ovens roaring. Gave 4 instead of 5 solely for being uncomfortable inside while dining. Highly recommend the pies from here otherwise!"}
{"text":"been here several times since my first review, and it has become our goto spot! Love everything about it... service always great, food fresh and spectacular... tried our first dessert last trip...............YUMMMMMM! Anyone who does not try this restaurant is missing out!!"}
{"text":"This is not only a step above the previous location, it's basically out of the atmosphere. The interior is gorgeous. The staff's weird checkered shirt uniform (or maybe it was an ugly gray?) was deeply upsetting to me, but they were all very pleasant so, it apparently didn't bother them too much. But it is ugly and so not in line with how trendy everything else is here. Anyway, pizza is just as delicious as it was at the previous location. And the expanded menu is full of items that are almost compelling enough to prevent me from ordering pizza, but not quite. I will always order the pizza. I will never be able to tell you what the burgers taste like. I have had a few appetizers though, and they were delicious. The bar serves up some wonderful cocktails and a great tap beer selection. They make a mean margarita, and you would be doing yourself a favor to try one. If Madison didn't have a Sal's location I would regularly make the schlep out to Sun Prairie to eat here."}
{"text":"Salvatore's is really one of the best pizza places in the Madison- if not the best. We ordered delivery when the location first opened in Sun Prairie. The Fat Uncle Tony was large enough for two of us to share and to still have a little leftover.  We tried to order a pizza a few months later, but we are technically outside of the delivery zone. They were more flexible when they first opened on the radius (to be expected). I'm sure we will try Salvatore's again, but do like the convenience of a delivery option for pizza. I guess we will be heading to the restaurant or ordering for pickup. The prices are a little higher for Salvatore's Pies compared to other pizza places, but that is because of the quality of the pizza.  If you're looking to try a really good pizza place I definitely recommend that you try Salvatore's. They also have a location in Madison. If you are in their delivery radius that's even better!"}
{"text":"Savatore's is still our favorite pizza place in the area. Hands down the best.   We stick with the Fat Uncle Tony. Enough for two to share with some left over. Fresh, local ingredients. We have both eaten in the restaurant and done pickup and delivery. We now live in Sun Prairie and thankfully are in their delivery area.   They get busy, so it used to be an issue calling to place and order. But, now they have a new online system that we will have to try. And, the new location is great.  But realize, that your dining options are limited in Sun Prairie. Plus, this place has a great reputation. So, if you are just showing up for dinner you may have a wait. :)"}
{"text":"Best pizza I have ever had.  Hand tossed crust and fresh toppings with an awesome sauce.  Their local mixed greens salad is also something you should try."}
{"text":"Arrived at a busy time. Host told us that it would be about a half hour to 45 minutes. We were seated in 12 minutes in a table by floor to ceiling windows. We had the crispy pork belly as an appetizer and it was just okay. My companion's pizza pie arrived about 10 minutes before my entree. Because of this mis-timing, I got a piece of the sausage and mushroom delight. The crust was perfect, the sauce was robust and the sausage was incredible. My short rib ragu arrived and kept me from another piece of pie. The ragu was rich and delightful. Because of the mis-timed meals, we were offered a complimentary dessert. We had the apple upside down tart and a hazelnut cake. Both were delectable.  Some minor service issues but the food is gourmet. Thanks, Patrick and staff for a great dining experience."}
{"text":"As you scroll through the reviews for Sal's and you encounter one that is less than 4 stars then that review is wrong. Plain and simple.   Seriously some of the best pizza you will ever eat. Anywhere."}
{"text":"I have eaten pizza from Sal's twice and both times I thought it was awesome. The first time, I had the Carbonara and it was absolutely amazing. I needed to go back before moving away, so I returned and tried the special, which included short rib, roasted garlic, cherry tomatoes and onion. It was also delicious, although the Carbonara still reigns as my favorite. The first time I did carry-out; this time, we ate at the restaurant, seated outside. Don't let the nondescript storefront (literally there isn't a sign) fool you - this is some awesome pizza."}
{"text":"Outstanding food and great value! Definitely the best pizza in town! So far we've had the Carbonara Specialty Pie YUM! the eggs on that thing were to-die-for. We've also tried the fish tacos, I usually don't like spicy but these were really well prepared, and carnitas, also delicious. All ingredients taste fresh and I love that they're local. We really needed a place with high quality food at a reasonable price on the East Side and this is it, we will be back often!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic! I have never been disappointed by their imaginative, high quality pizzas. I've only done carry out and they are always fresh and delicious. Having lived in New York City for 3 years, my pizza bar is pretty high and Salvatore's is at the top!  I love their pizza with the bacon on it!"}
{"text":"Waits can be little long(weekends) plan accordingly! We were visiting Madison and heard of this place and we were in the area so planned on stopping here. The Pizzas we ordered were: 1. Featured Pizza without Bacon and 2. Make your own pizza with eggs, smoked Gouda, basil - WOW! My first time eating pizza with eggs and this was awesome!   They do have a decent collection of craft, local beers."}
{"text":"Thanks, Nathan, for making what started out as a nasty day, MUCH better!!  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in Madison. It's the go to place for me and my partner. I wouldn't recommend eating in the restaurant, though, as the temperature is inhospitable. They more than make up for this, however, by delivering to JPH next door where you don't feel like you too are in a pizza oven."}
{"text":"Be sure to call ahead for a reservation. We went with four people, ordered an appetizer, a small pie, and a large pie. It was basically the correct amount of food, and we wound up taking two slices of the small pizza home. The atmosphere was not great since we spent the whole meal shouting at each other to be heard. The waiting area was too cramped and smiley from the smiley pizza oven. Plus it's a small and cramped eating area. Service was very nice but slow. It was at least five minutes before they brought water to our table and took our order, and food came out slowly.  The food was excellent. The burrata appetizer was not great. The vegetables for topping the bread were incredibly fresh, but the ingredients didn't seem to come together well. I think it might have been better if the mozzarella was more flavorful or at least more salty. We ordered the large Carbonara pie without bacon. The crust was delicious and the cheese was outstanding. We all agreed it was a bit too peppery. The daily special pizza was excellent. One of our party was really disappointed, though, that neither pizza had tomato sauce, so beware when you order.  Best pizzas in Madison."}
{"text":"This pizza was AMAZING!! There was a little bit of a wait, and my mother had to ask to get a seat a bit faster because of her being diabetic, they were so kind and willing to help.  The server was really kind, explained all the ingredients down to where they came from, and suggested his favorite. We had two pizzas, both were delicious. I feel like it was the first time I have had a REAL pizza. The mozzarella is to die for! Only complaint: They aren't open Mondays :)"}
{"text":"Best pizza hands down.  I don't think the pricing is out of hand.  Home delivery can take up to 45 minutes in my experience."}
{"text":"Pros: Pizza is AMAZING. We got the Carbonara pizza with the egg on it and it was fabulous. Our eggs were cooked more than what previous reviewers reported, we had no runny yolk at all. Would have been nice. We'll give it another try next time. Service was also good, nice and quick and full explanations of everything. As first time visitors we didn't feel overwhelmed. Menu was also nice and diverse but not too huge like some pizza places that offer way too much (pasta, pizza, sandwiches, wings, etc...).  Cons: I got the fish tacos and they just were not good. Had no idea they were be SO spicy and they were drenched in some kind of sauce. The fish was also pretty fishy. We will just stick to the pizza next time. We sat inside, but it's cramped and gets REALLY loud once it is full. So next time we will opt to sit outside, where even the roar of passing cars is more tolerable. No parking, so you'll need to find a spot on the street.  Overall: We will still definitely come back, but for special occasions or if we're nearby. Really sad they cancelled their Verona location plans, as that's where we live and downtown is about 30 minutes away on a good day."}
{"text":"You might think that locally sourced high quality ingredients are overrated. You would be wrong. The pies here practically melt in your mouth. You must try. Worth every extra penny."}
{"text":"Drove up to Salvatore's from Illinois. Being a Jersey girl and brief Trentonian I have to say I absolutely loved it! We ordered the pepperoni and portobello to go and dove into the sausage, onion and goats cheese..... Omg yummmmm! My mom and I both agreed the sauce was delicious. I have absolutely nothing negative to say. Everything was fresh, delicious and plentiful:)... The salad is large but a great starter and heck you just share:)...the staff were friendly and knowledgable and this place was doing some good carry out business on a cold Thursday night. Sun Prarie you are sooooo lucky!!!"}
{"text":"We went before the SP Homecoming game...we were told we'd have to wait 25 mins for a table...only waited like 10 at the most.  Husband got the special, baked cod with fingerling potatoes...it was awesome!!  I got a dinner salad and it was so incredible and fresh  I will be ordering this again!!   I am so proud that they are in Sun Prairie and love the fact that they use all local ingredients.  Boys had the usual Tomato Pie and it was perfect as always!!"}
{"text":"If you haven't ate here you're not living.  Don't consider it pizza.  It's 5 star dinning."}
{"text":"First (and foremost):  sublime pizza.   Crust outstanding.  Toppings innovative, nicely proportioned, and the blends of flavors that result are truly inspired.  The Forestiere was genius: the cr√®me fraiche took on the flavors of the mushrooms, herb, onion, and bacon lardons and was a smooth, subtle masterpiece.  So delicate, but such perfect, satisfying flavor.  The Forza seems like a familiar tomato/pepperoni/cheese at first bite, but then the accents come through - - and the peppery heat comes on.  I thought the ricotta was the only miss (too plain and dominant), but still a great slice.  The Fig & Bacon was, well, interesting (though our least fave).  You get a burst of sweet from the fig, you get a punch of blue from the gorgonzola - - it's like a prize fight of flavors more than a blend, and the bacon almost gets lost!  But what a treat up and down, and the recommended Barbera di Asti,  though pricey, was fab.  Speaking of pricey,  the real curious thing about the Salvatores on E. Johnson in Madison (not complaining - - it's just curious),  is the contrast between some serious price aspects (completely worth it - - monstrously good pizza & wine) and the spartan \"dining room\".  When we got there at 530pm (given, it was close to zero outside) the place was a cold - - and the tables are just plain spartan.  Once the room filled up (and the food came) it seemed warmer (and when the tables are covered in pizzas, it seems less spartan!)  but the odd coat and even hat was still evident.  You might not want to go to Salvatores for the atmosphere and decor, but that is not why you go there.   The specials all sounded spectacular too, but we went with the regular menu.  I'm going back real soon to try the Pizza Carbonara."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! The pizzas here were amazing. Try the fig and bacon, you will not be disappointed. Prices are reasonable as well."}
{"text":"Long wait, and jostled by a few elbows in the small entryway, but in the end it was worth it. The pizza and salad were both wonderful. We had the carbonara (without the ham) and it was delicious. The atmosphere was homey and I didn't mind the crowded dining room (once we had a table)."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza. The Tomato pie was great and the fig and bacon pizza , even though it sounds weird was really really good. Worth a try. Very friendly staff as well."}
{"text":"Went here a few weeks ago because I've heard such great things but our experience was one of the worst. We got in and ordered our food, we ate and it was decent. When we went to pay we were told that the credit card machine was down. I would not of chosen to eat here if I knew that the machine was broken, I don't know why they wouldn't of informed us of this when we walked in?? Since we didn't have any cash, we were forced to wait until the machine was fixed (about 30 minutes) when we FINALLY got the check, we got no discount or any type of sincere apology, I was appalled! I had to wait 30 minutes for something YOU should of informed me of, it was your fault and I deserved at least something to fix it. This restaurant was definitely not worth the hype to me and I will not be returning because of this experience."}
{"text":"These guys make a really fantastic tomato pie. The cheese is buttery and has a great texture. The sauce drizzled on top is delicate without any acidity or too much sweetness. Their dining room has a great atmosphere. It is cool while the staff is very family friendly. They have cute stuff to keep the kids busy when you sit down. Chocolate milk comes in a kids cup with a lid. Took my in laws here amd they loved it! Which reminds me the beer selection was great too!"}
{"text":"I haven't even tried the pizza, but I saw it and drooled!  I had the daily special salad . . . the buratta and bread with oil.  It's not just bread with oil, its in the preparation.  Infused olive oil and grilled sliced bread covered in grated parmesan.   The staff was kind and knowledgable."}
{"text":"This review is based on multiple take out orders, all of which have been delicious.  Please do yourself a favor and order the forza pizza.  It's the best pizza in Madison, hands down.  The house salad is also always good--fresh market veggies and house made dressing.  I have never been disappointed!"}
{"text":"Fantastic pizza and friendly service. I LOVE how they send home leftovers in a cardboard container instead of the horrid styrofoam!  Yay Sal's!!"}
{"text":"Color me impressed like the rest.  I'd been meaning to go to Salvatore's forever but just never made the pilgrimage.  Then my wife started reading me this terribly obnoxious review from the unconsidered section which was met with one of the best responses I've ever read from the owner of a restaurant.  That was enough for me, the mystery of this place had to be known.  Went on a Friday night, small joint in a very relaxed neighborhood downtown and it was packed to the gills.  Fantastic cozy atmosphere, and a nice warm reprieve from Wisconsin's brutal cold.  There was a 45 minute wait and it was already 7:30, but the host said he could take our number and text us if we wanted to get drinks at the Public House next door (since their bar area was pretty full).  It was a nice gesture, so we followed his advice and got to try two places in one evening.  The Public House was a pretty comfortable coffee shop with good beer and a nice way to pass the time before our table was ready.  All said and done we finally put in our first order around 9:00 after getting a table, which at most other places would irk me a bit, but all was redeemed.  When our bacon and cheese bread appetizer came out, with Siracha dip, hoo baby.  Absolutely delicious.    But then.  THE PIZZA.  I was extremely skeptical going to Salvatore's because I really don't know how you can separate yourself in the pizza world, but apparently you can.  Like others mentioned, local ingredients and an attention to detail are all the difference.  Both pies were unbelievable, divine morsels freshly prepared for your happy zone.  Where I thought I would leave hungry instead I left with a full to-go box and a half a beer, falling asleep dreaming of the next day where I would be able to eat the succulent leftovers.  Prices are awesome for downtown, $13-15 for the 12\" pies and $23-25 for 16\".  We both felt that 2 people could easily just share a 16\", so don't let your eyes be bigger than your head unless you want those oh-so-sweet leftovers.  I had the Forza for my pizza and my wife had a sausage, pep, mushroom, both amazing.  Don't be like me and wait an eternity to go here.  Quite possibly the best pizza in Madison"}
{"text":"Great pizza!  We got the bacon and cheese bread and a 12 inch fat uncle Tony's pizza.  Emma was an excellent waitress!  Highly recommend if you're re looking for a good pizza joint!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice, today being the second time. The first time I got my food to go because the place was so packed, so I cannot comment on the service that day.  The food, to go, from first visit:  Had the number four pizza, um, tomato pie. It was really good. Reminded me of what my family got in upstate New York as a child. Every topping had great taste and stood out well. The sauce was amazing! Perfect sweet/savory blend that did not overwhelm the rest of the pie but made it one of a kind. They even made the swirl on top like I remember from childhood. I was so excited to find a really good pizza place having just moved here ...and then there was today:  The food and service, because they were impacted by each-other tonight:  Took us about 10 minutes to get a table. Since we did not even come close to getting  one last time, I had a feeling something would be different...  So it was around 20 minutes before any waitress showed up to greet us. Hmmmm okay...  Then we order the following... -Garlic bread: this was done well. Nice crispy outside, tender inside, roasted garlic spread was a nice change. Micro greens provided were refreshing to the palate between bites. - House salad: I loved the variety of veggies they had. I wish they chopped up some of the veggies which they used a mandolin on though. Many of the veggies lost their flavor potential due to being sliced so thin. And large cucumber is difficult to eat like a lady when it is sliced thinly into large round pieces, and your butter knife isn't cutting it (literally and figuratively). The vinaigrette was really good. They did a nice job balancing the oil/vinegar ratio and seasoned  it well.  -And the \"Tomato pie\": number 11, plus we added sausage, since I loved the not oily/ great flavor from it in the first pie I had. It took a really long time for the pizza, actually I will call this cheese bread, to come out. It was placed on our table and the waitress walked away quickly. First thing I notice, NO tomato sauce swirl. Awww, my heart broke just a smidgen. Then I took a bite...okay wait a minute, did I actually go to the wrong place ***checking maps app for my bookmark, no it is the same place I thought I was coming to*** There is no tomato sauce on my pizza at all! Seriously, this place with \"tomato pie\" in the name, and no tomato sauce....***twilight zone music cues*** So I pull up the menu on my phone, after lifting the cheese to verify I had not just missed the sauce, and I find no notation pertaining to the yummy sauce I remember being there before. So I open Yelp and read reviews...okay no mention of tomato pies without tomato sauce...  Now my dilemma. It was like 7ish when we came, now close to 8, and I am eating cheese bread for dinner...bad carb bad! Not worth it. Must not eat until I get side of sauce so at least the flavor will somehow justify my evil carb fest. ***cue crickets chirping, for a long time, long enough to have my piping hot cheese bread thing turn cold, and Reggae turns to 90s rock on the radio*** after what felt like an eternity while what daylight was left went away and darkness took over the sky, I see a hand reach for my empty tea and hear a, \"let me get you a refill\" and then crap, she's gone before I can speak to, or see her.  She brings the refill and notes that my husband has stopped eating at 1/2 piece, and me at one bite, so she asks if we want a box. I felt like a drama queen about to burst when I reply, \"no, but may I please have some tomato sauce?\"  She brings the sauce and I put some on my piece I had started when the food was hot. I manage to stuff down 2 cold slices of cheese bread thing with tomato sauce slopped on it, and we manage to pay and leave.  Holy crap, it is like 9:30 and I ate tomato/pie/cheesebread/pizza whatever that was like 15 minutes ago, and I snarled it down. It will be a late night for me tonight!  And it was not even busy today compared to last time. I had so much hope for this \"tomato pie\" restaurant, now I just don't know if I want to come back...  And why did I eat it? Should have stopped at the salad.  In all seriousness, I would have given the real tomato pie I took to go last time 5 stars, and I do not give anything 5, so if you want a real tomato pie, ask them which pies have the tomato sauce on them and eat while it is hot, you will love it. Hopefully after this book, I will remember to ask case I do come back, before I order."}
{"text":"A wonderful discovery in Madison . The staff was engaged and personable - andrew made very informed beer and pizza recommendations and did not dissuade form our inclination  to  order the carbonara pizza which was a fabulous . Thankfully he   recommend  the bacon bread - which was fabulous as well."}
{"text":"Best pizzas ever! My favorite is farmer johns! Thin crust pizza. They use local ingredients which I love. The inside is very industrial looking, not something you would expect out of Sun Prairie."}
{"text":"This is hands down the BEST PIZZA IN MADISON! I had been to the Sun Prairie location before and had the pizza so I knew to expect excellence and wasn't disappointed. Every time I have been to this location it has been PACKED.   There are a few downsides to this location however. There is never any seating due to the fairly small space. So you are better off ordering your pizza and picking it up, unless you don't mind waiting for seating. I guess the positive to the small space is that it always makes the restaurant look busy. (which it is)  Another thing to keep in mind is that the menu is different from the Sun Prairie location, so if you have a favorite pizza at that location, you may not be able to get it at this location.   Regardless of the things I mentioned above this is hands down the best pizza in madison and I highly recommend you go and try their pizza. Either location won't disappoint!"}
{"text":"Simply the best place for pizza. Terrance's Favorite and the Fig & Gorganzola are our favorites. Never been disappointed with anything I've had from here."}
{"text":"I have tried the Fat Uncle Tony, Tomato Pie, and the Alfredo Sausage and all are great pies!  Whenever we have vistors we order from here to show off the awesome pies coming out of Sun Prairie!"}
{"text":"My husband and I live in Sun Prairie and frequently visit Sal's. The quality of food is always fantastic and the service is great. Our favorites are the Farmer John's Smoked Gouda pizza and the Burrata appetizer. But we highly recommend trying any of the pizzas!!"}
{"text":"I am from the Chicago area and am particular about pizza. This pizza is so good that it may just now be my new favorite."}
{"text":"We were so excited to try this place. We had a group of 4 and ordered two large pizzas. It was a lot of food. They were able to split our pie so we could have two specialty pizzas on one pizza. That way we were able to try a variety. The ingredient were very fresh and delicious. The service was very good. We did make a reservation but we still had to wait. They also close kind of early. We were the last people they were serving for the night and we got their last pie. We are excited to try the Madison location."}
{"text":"$$$worth every penny$$$$$  Margate, NJ in the house fool. Nice to see some solid east cost pizza up here in the north woods. Made me miss the Atlantic!"}
{"text":"I loved their pizza. Now it's a hip trendy bar for millennials. Way overpriced as well. I used to live in Margate, NJ and it was dope having actual pizza up here but I'm not spending $60 everytime I want a couple pizza's. Used to be a big fat 5 star-nice treat every now and then. Not any more.."}
{"text":"After hearing all the hoopla about this place I was excited to finally be able to get a table and try the pie! The place is eclectic-pizza kitchen cum hipster basement makeout pad-the staff all 8 of them on a rainy Thursday evening were too cool to really be engaged in our dining experience but did stop by to use really big words like suffice and container when asking us about what to do with our left over pizza. The garlic bread was tasty enough but odd shaped shards of toasted bread served with a green salad and compote of garlic confit was trying way too hard to impress. The pizza (lg) arrived after we debated if it would be enough for four big men and a dissertation from sir waiter about hunger and the size of our appetites and can report it is indeed enough to serve 4! It looked tasty enough, halves of cherry tomatoes, pads of ricotta and pieces of slightly charred pepperoni but upon biting in, the bottom crust was burnt to an almost black crust on about 3/4 of the pie even though the top wasn't browned at all. We forged through a few bites each and wondered if the bearded beau serving us would ever return to the table. When we flagged him away from the obnoxious giggle fest he and a female server were having while rolling silverware on the other side of the seating area we flipped the remaining blackened pieces of pie over and of course were immediately told that's how it's supposed to be! To which I replied \"Oh??? burnt? \" I've been in the pizza business since I was 15, my grandfather owned a pizza house and I've eaten pizza around the world including outdoor wood fired pies in Naples! This was burnt and the soot and bitter residue on our tongues could attest to that. The waiter made some inaudible comment and took the pie away assuring us that the new one would be pushed ahead of all the rest (there was only one other table)  after about 15 minutes a new bubbly one was delivered, the bottom crust a perfect brown and surprisingly the rest of the ingredients flavors were actually present when not masked by the charcoal crust! I'm not sure what the pizza was supposed to have on it since I didn't really pay much attention to the ordering but thought it lacked salt and the tomatoes were tasteless and a bit hard even after roasting- I don't recall a sauce of any kind on the pie and found the smoked Gouda and ricotta a creamy yet bland alternative to mozzarella. I sprinkled the Parmesan on liberally hoping to kick up the melt-fest a bit but overall left with a Menza-menza impression of your pie Salvatore- whoever you may be!"}
{"text":"This place is great! We went on a Friday night about 6:00 with a party of 5 and waited about 30 minutes. The dining area is very small, but worth the wait. We ended up creating our own since my family is not the most adventurous, but I would definitely return to try the specialty pizzas at another time. One pizza we created was sausage, roasted red peppers and black olives and the other was pepperoni, bacon and green pepper. Everyone thought it was great pizza! It has a thin crust with the end being chewy. The best part for me is I am not a huge fan of pizza sauce, but theirs is delicious. Most of the time it is applied too heavily for my taste, and is bitter. Not theirs! It is just very tasty and I am thrilled to have found a place that I like the sauce. They have a nice wine and beer selection also. They seem to do a big carryout business and they also direct people next door to the Public House to wait until their pizza is ready. Wish they were closer so I could carry out."}
{"text":"What a cool place!! I had heard so much about this place and just hadn't been in yet.. Finally made it last night. Chef Week featuring Tory Miller (He beat Bobby Flay!) was underway and the menu had been transformed into a special Japanese inspired selection. They had their original pies available too for the less adventurous.   My party of 5 ended up getting A LOT of food. The portions weren't huge so it was fun to order several and everyone tried everything.   Our reservation wasn't until 8:15, so unfortunately when we got there several of the special items had been sold out. We were still able to find PLENTY though to leave us all with full bellies.   We tried: Agedashi Tofu: Not as firm as I would have liked it to be, a little bland Dandan Pizza: The absolute BEST thing on the menu. SO GOOD.  Ddeokbokki Gnocchi: Also very good. The meatballs were incredible!  Japanese \"Wafu\" style carbonara: Very earthy flavor with shiitake mushrooms Karaage Style friend chicken: FANTASTIC. Good ol' fried chicken!  Cocnut Rice cake dessert: Super delish and perfect to share.   We ALSO ordered a Fat Uncle Tony pizza off the regular pie menu. It was super delicious! Big chunks of meats and a perfect tomato sauce.   I can't wait to come back and try more!"}
{"text":"Unbelievable pizza! The sauce is excellent as is the crust. The fat uncle Tonys is probably our favorite but we enjoy their non-traditional ones as well. They also have the best gluten free crust . Service can be slow on busy nights but the pizza is so good that it doesn't bother you."}
{"text":"The house salad was great, and the garlic was one of top ten appetizers I've enjoyed. The two time I ate pizza there it was great. The turkey sandwich I had when I went it for lunch was also just as good.   But they had only one person on the floor for lunch. The place was rightfully rushed but the service was slow. It took almost 15 minutes for our sodas to get to our table. But that is considering that they do have 11 tables in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Pizza was never one of my go-to craveables until I lived for a while in NJ.  Moving to Wisconsin put pizza in the background once more.    Then I went to Salvatore's.  The crust is perfectly chewy, with the bottom crisp.  The freshness of the tomatoes shines through in the flavorful? sauce, and simply good cheese and basil tops off a perfect pizza.  I came for the tomato pie, but now my curiosity is piqued by the rest of the menu for future trips.  Locally sourced ingredients and good service (Thanks, Nikki!) combined with perfect execution and presentation means I'll be back."}
{"text":"Hubby went & picked up pizza here last Saturday night.  We got the Carbonara, and the fig & bacon. Both were excellent, but the fig was over the top delicious! Can't wait to try some of their others!!"}
{"text":"Worth the wait it's been over a year since I last had pizza, but this place looked worth breaking my diet for! I love the focus on local foods! Total worth supporting! Well, I dove straight in and burned the roof of my mouth, but that did not even slow me down, haha one of the best pizzas I have ever had! The veggie one was my favorite!!"}
{"text":"In a strip mall, just before you come into Sun Prairie from the south, there's a Pizza place on the right. Go there! Take out if you must but go there.  S.U. and I had heard good things and, mid week, made the trek. No crowds on a Wednesday, Great friendly service and a menu full of specials. Now, I'm ordinarily a double anchovies on a simple pie guy but, we went for the smoked gouda, bacon, caramelized onions and tomato special. Out of this world. On top of that several good beers on tap and a decent wine list! The reasonably priced Spanish Garnacha (Grenache, north of the border), was excellent. For some unknown reason, we were offered a 20% discount on the wine (we accepted) and that made the bottle even more reasonable!!  I should also mention the salad, tossed in a bowl before serving and beautifully presented.  5 stars! As good as it gets!"}
