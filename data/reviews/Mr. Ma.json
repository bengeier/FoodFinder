{"text":"The concierge in our hotel sent us here and it was so good we went a second time. It is accessable underground or from the street, and is an vast attractive space. The service was excellent, and friendly, and the food was delicious each time we visited. It is a bit pricy, but nice restaurants in Montreal are pricey. The food arrived piping hot, and the menu had so many choices it is hard to decide what to have. The portions are quite large. If you are looking for good Chinese food, this is the one to try."}
{"text":"We came to this place following the suggestion of Chinese government officials. We figured if they recommended it, it had to be not only good, but also authentic. We were not at all disappointed. This place is amazing! We had the chef's tasting menu, as we usually do when trying a new restaurant. It had lots of delicious seafood, some of their famous peanut butter dumplings (wow!), amongst other delicious dishes. In the end, the chef was kind enough to come to our table and talk to us, which was a very nice touch! Excellent evening!"}
{"text":"What to say about Mr Ma, on the plus side it is one of the classiest Chinese restaurant in Montreal especially since Piment Rouge has closed and well located downtown in PVM. The menu is pretty much your typical Chinese american restaurant (aka not super authentic) and I could probably say it is the best general Tao chicken in town if that's what you're into. I do mean it, the pieces are quite large with real juicy chicken and lightly breaded so will not give you a stomach ache but it will cost you 30$ after tax and tip"}
{"text":"Quite disappointing. Went for a business lunch and got this watery fish that was bland tasting.  The service however was good and the appetizers weren't too bad."}
{"text":"Went again for dinner tonight.  Had the lamb with scallions, crispy duck, eggplant and rice.  Consistently great food and service.  Found out that the dessert buffet is only Fridays and Saturdays though!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious Chinese food tucked away inside a shopping complex. I was shocked that around 6pm this place was completely empty - was worried it was closed - but a cheerful employee quickly made it clear it was just a very slow night!

Everything was delicious, and the place has a wonderful atmosphere. Great for a date or a night out with friends. Prices are a little high, but food is worth it for sure."}
{"text":"Malheureusement meme si la nourriture avait l air d être bonne, j'ai eu mal au ventre toute l'après-midi après avoir mangé leur General Tao. Mon ami a commandé le même plat et a eu mal au ventre également..."}
{"text":"A bit pricey....
I was in a hurry for lunch time, so I decided to go to Mr Ma, for take out.

A very nice lady greeted me and directed me to a gentleman who told me that the dumplings I wanted for take out would take 5 minutes.

Then after a short wait (I already was astonished that they had such fast made dumplings), he showed up with a very cute white bag with an impeccable made bowl of 8 dumplings in a sauce, a ustensils bag (no chopsticks) and a fortune cookie. 

All this for the price of 12$ canadian dollars, tip included....

As I said the taste was clearly a good MSG \"american\" chinese flavored ready made dumplings, and the sauce was a sweet/mildly spiced one.

It tasted good, even if it clearly was not the more \"traditional\" hand made dumplings like I've already had, for a much lesser price and in a greater quantity elsewhere.

As for the place it looked   very cozy, well decorated with asian items. This place is ideal for the busy luncheons of the people at Place Ville-Marie.
There is an extensive menu that will not be object of my review, since I haven't tried it."}
{"text":"Overall: It's good but quite expensive!

This is a chinese restaurant with a small menu with more traditionnal meal that are well done. It's more 3.5/5 because it's really well done, however, i don't understand why I should pay 21.95$ for a meal that's making lot of money if sold at 10$. I feel you're paying for the location and cleaniness of the restaurant. The service is quite fast and even though I was attending a Retirement party with a large group.

It's quite good too; General Tao, instead of using cheap chicken part, you clearly felt it was chicken breast and even chicken filet which is good. But I wasn't that impress, the small menu and the concept let me quite unmove or I shall say, unattracted on the idea of chinese restaurant with small amount of choice. Even if small menu means more control over quality, I don't feel it was worth the price.

heineken 9$
21.95$ for General Tao (approx 6-7 ounces of general tao + dry rice) hmm kinda give me the chill!"}
{"text":"The ambiance was calm, serene. The staff were attentive. The food had tons of flavor. The price was higher than most in the area but you also have beautiful decor and decorative plates/etc. We had a great time and enjoyed the food."}
{"text":"Family took me to Mr. Ma's and it was exceptional. Really good chinese and very delicious. My family goes there a lot since they conduct business nearby so they frequent it all the time. Everything on the menu is delicious."}
{"text":"So good we ate here twice. Best dumplings ever had outside of Hong Kong-- with huge chunks of chicken and delicate wrappers. Other fab starters-- the vegetables in lettuce wrappers and roast pork loin. Don't event bother with the main courses."}
{"text":"We were turned onto this place by my sista on a previous trip to Montreal.  We originally wanted to check out a more \"authentic\" Chinese resto but didn't feel like trekking from our hotel over to Chinatown so instead we hopped on Le Metro over to the Eaton Centre and strolled the underground over to Place Ville Marie.  
Mr. Ma is in bldg 1 and can't be missed from the inside our out.  The restaurant is expansive but it is always quiet when we visit.  I would like to take away 1 star because they only have one highchair which was already in use, but the food is just too good.
I stuck with what I know, General Tao and DW had the Spicy Orange Chicken.  Both meals were some of the best tasting, juiciest chicken we have ever had.  Mr. Ma is a little stingy on the sauce but super tasty none the less.  One meal could easily feed two people, in fact we had quite a bit of food left over which we enjoyed back at the hotel the next day.
Most people complain that it is a little pricey.  This is some of the best Chinese food that I have had in North America so I'm certainly not going to complain about paying a few extra Canadian $$.  What else are you going to do with that pocket full of toonies? Stop being cheap and take your significant other out for some unforgettable Chinese food!"}
