{"text":"My boyfriend was craving a French Dip.  I didn't want to go to Arby's, I wanted to get him a really good fresh sandwich.  When I brought him the food from Tavern, he was blown away.  Absolutely loved it!!! I think we found another favorite spot.  Reasonable pricing, took less than 20min and the amount was great and flavor fantastic.  We will be back!!"}
{"text":"It's one of our favorite local spots. The owner and all of the staff are very friendly, and we have always had great service. Our favorite night is Thursday Steak night! Can't beat the deal.Good tavern fare and the price is right."}
{"text":"Service is really good and their prices are more than reasonable, but the food was not great. Burgers were squished and the nachos look like they had Manwich dumped all over fhem."}
{"text":"Their salads are amazing!  Went here often at lunch when I worked nearby and always made it back to work on time."}
{"text":"I am happy to report that this local tavern has new owners.  The former owners have left town and hopefully aren't terrifying diners with their culinary catastrophes.    New owners are nice and have made a more kid friendly menu that my 9 year old enjoys.  They are working on adult menu changes but the items I have tried have been quite good.    I have not dined at the dinner hour.  My three recent experiences were all at lunch.  Glad to have a local place I want to support again."}
{"text":"I work in Hudson about 2 minutes away from Tavern of Stow and love coming here on occasion during my lunch break. The service is incredibly quick and the gyro salad is very fresh and tasty. Looking forward to trying this place out for dinner one night- they have many weekly specials to choose from."}
{"text":"Waitress super nice - However the food made us sick (garlic fries) not sure if it was old oil but I felt bloated all night - and my wife vomited. ;( too bad"}
{"text":"We have been regulars here since they opened. My kids love coming here because of the food. Kid menu is VERY kid and budget friendly. Food is always good and come out hot!  The wait staff is awesome. Usually get the same person...  I try to order whatever they have as the special, but I always ask the price first. They offer really great food/ appetizer specials on the weekends. Food is prepared fresh and they use good ingredients.   Small dining area but I can't remember ever having to wait. Bar drinks are a very good and have a great selection of craft beers.  One if my favorite places in the Stow/Hudson area!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner and had the date night 2 for $20 deal of Italian entrees with an appetizer and 2 salads. We had the fried provolone wedges which were very tasty. Side salads were good as well. We ordered linguine with meatballs and the zucchini lasagna. Both were very good. Sauce is a little on the sweet side but still good. Staff was very friendly and accommodating. Definitely a nice atmosphere. We were thanked by management on our way out. Overall rating this as a very good experience. We will return."}
{"text":"Our first experience was very good! The food was good....not great but good. The pizzas are very good as was the wedge salad. I have to agree with others that said to splurge on the parmesan fries. They have home made chips but most of them were not completely done and were a little soggy and the ribs a little dry. The beer selection is good and our service was Outstanding. Overall worth going back."}
{"text":"This past weekend my wife and I went to the Tavern again, and I must say that the food was simply DELICIOUS.  I have no idea what the food or the servers were like before this young couple took over, but if the service and food stays as good in the future: I hope this couple stays in business for a long, long, time.  We took home a doggy box of some of the chicken, and instead of eating it the next day we waited another day.  At a normal restaurant the chicken would probably have been dried out or tough.  Not so with this chicken. Just as tender as the first day and able to cut it with a fork. The owners are really nice folks and they can count on seeing us the future when were in the area."}
{"text":"Not sure what is worse, the service or the food. Bad food is one thing, could be a choice in taste. The horrible service is at a level of neglect I've rarely seen. Save your money and go anywhere else"}
{"text":"Ordered lunch there for take out and it was pretty good. I got wings and zucchini spears. The wing were stellar and I will not hesitate to get them again, Zucchini, not so much. They forgot or do not season them at all. The breading was bland and falling off, and the spears were huge, and pretty unwieldy. Some garlic powder would have been a great addition, or even an Italian no salt blend if they are going for not salting them..but it's bar food! Who expects it to be low sodium? I'll try them again, but will be passing on that one item.  The honey mustard wings were tender, and moist and very tasty indeed."}
{"text":"Not bad.  Service was very good.  Wings were good, but spicy garlic was lacking the spice.  Philly Cheese steak was good, coleslaw was creamy, not to vinegary.  Decor was plain, but I'd try it again."}
{"text":"My husband and I frequent this place often. We love the rib special (half slab of ribs plus a side) for $8.99 on Saturday nights. I enjoyed lunch there today with a friend and had the French Dip sandwich with coleslaw ($8.49), along with their Friday drink special ($4.00). I should have waited a few more hours to get that rib special!"}
{"text":"I invited a few friends to meet here for taco Tuesday before a movie. It's a cute little place, and it seemed there were many regulars. I was greeted promptly and my drink order taken quickly. I decided to order an appetizer while waiting for my friends to arrive. After trying to get ANYONE'S attention for 30 minutes I gave up.  The four of us ended up ordering the tacos. They were bland and not even worth the $1.25 each.  I would have spent more money here if I had been given even decent service. This was disappointing."}
{"text":"I love this place! I often stop in with my mom and we usually end up getting the same thing every time. Extremely nice female owner, she stops and chats with us and has our order down. Love getting chips even if a few aren't completely done... However, I'm rating a 4 because one day I switched it up and got chicken tenders.. I honestly went home with a bad stomach ache.. They tasted kind of rubbery.. It was debatably equivalent to mcdonalds chicken.. However everything else is great! Not very busy on week days, so quick service!"}
{"text":"The food is ok... the service was cold.  We stopped by for a late lunch / early dinner.  The small pizza was small and a little gummy... but not too greasy.  We had burgers.... I was half finished when the waiter took my plate while I was eating a bite.  There were only 3 other parties in the restaurant... we weren't there long.  We were stunned that we were being given the bum's rush... the burgers were ok... but we sure won't be back."}
{"text":"Stopped in because we live nearby. Thursday pizza and wings special was good. $5 for 10 wings or a 4 slice pizza. Wings were great! We had sweet and spicy and Cajun. Beer selection could be better, but would come in again."}
{"text":"This place is REALLY good.   There's the standard pub fare, and all that I've tried is delicious - particularly the buffalo chicken wrap and fries. My husband loves the Rueben, and has enjoyed the burgers as well. There's also plenty of Italian classics, and they're all great, too. The breadsticks are unbelievable.   Service is always good, and one thing I actually love - the place is never empty. At the same time, we've never had a long wait if at all for seating. Lastly, it's priced very well! My husband and I can grab takeout for under $20 for the both of us, easily. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Awesome awesome Monday night Burger night is the best the wings are phenomenal everything here is good"}
{"text":"First time here.  Stopped in for dinner, seated right away on a Saturday night.  For a bar, the menu was fine: burgers, sandwiches, a few entrees and dinner specials.  We each got a burger; I had the Western with onion rings and BBQ sauce, my wife had one with blue cheese.  Both were very good, cooked to the medium rare we asked for, tasted like they came off a grill.  I got fries with mine, my wife got chips - both were fine; the fries were those breaded kind that taste more like tater totes.  With a beer and a drink it was $24, not bad at all.  Waitress was very pleasant, and even brought my wife some pickles when she asked for them.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"We're regulars. Great place for a quick and cheap bite to eat and drinks. The Tavern of Stow has a hometown-bar feel, with a very friendly staff. Pretty much everything on the menu is worth trying. Burgers and wings are delicious. It's at the end of a shopping mall, so there aren't many other options around it. If you're heading through town, definitely give this place a try."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend despite your many negative reviews and was amazed!!! So good that it is my new place between Akron and Kent. I will stop any and every time i get hungry nearby!!!! Cheap good martinis great calamari and wonderful specials every night.  Don't listen to the naysayers But treat yourself to something special!"}
{"text":"**NEW OWNERSHIP** Don't let the 3 Yelp stars scare you, things have changed.   My wife and I had a gift certificate to use, so figured we'd give the place another shot. And we came to find out that it's been under new ownership since May, and it shows.   First of all, they did some redecorating, and it looks really nice. New paint and some different wall decor did the place good.  Our service was outstanding. All of the hostesses, waiters and waitresses were phenomenal. They have so much pride in the place now. What really sold us on the changes was the fact that the new owner came over, checked on us, and introduced himself. That's always a good touch. He and his wife couldn't have been nicer.  The French Onion soup was $3.50 and was splendid.   My wife got a turkey club and it was loaded with meat and the bacon was super crispy, just the way it should be. She even loved the vegetable medley that came as a side.  I got a gyro and it was good, and I got the Cajun fries for only a .50 cent up-charge, which was certainly worth it. The star of my meal was the side of ranch they gave me to dip my fries in. It's homemade and was freaking delicious. Apparently almost everything there is now homemade. They even brought some barbecue sauce for us to try that they make back in the kitchen.  They have kept a lot of the specials that have always been part of The Tavern of Stow. Honestly, that was really all I liked about the place before. I got a $1.25 taco, well, just because, I dunno, it's Tuesday, why not? It was just an everyday taco, but for $1.25 it did the trick."}
{"text":"My sister lives in Stow and we always used to order take out from this place on lazy Sunday nights in. We'd just get a bunch of food and split it all, usually some really bad for you but SO good food like fried pickles, onion rings, pizza, bugers, etc. The food is excellent there, it's making me hungry for it just writing this. My sister usually goes in and picks it up, she said the owners are super nice and the inside of the restaurant is cute. We've never actually eaten inside, lol, we just get the takeout and sit around in our PJ's being lazy. Either way, this place has good food, whether you're looking to go out and experience a tavern-y atmosphere or sit around and chow down with your sibling at home... give the Tavern of Stow a try."}
{"text":"I was not impressed at all which is very disappointing because I recently moved to the area and would like a nice little go to place that is close. The servers treated us like we were a burden and they where to busy to take care of us. There was 4 servers and only maybe 6 tables with an average of 4 people. The food tasted generic and like they cooked it in the microwave and took forever to get. The server even said to another one after she sat us that she hoped no one else came on (I'm sure we weren't supposed to hear this) and that was at 7 pm on a Friday. So.......we won't be going back sorry for the bad review."}
{"text":"5 stars!! We had fast and friendly service.  Our server, Jessica, provided a perfect recommendation of an IPA to compliment the fish and chips. Food was great! They are under new management - definitely worth a visit!!"}
{"text":"Good draft selection. Specials every night (Monday burgers, Tuesday tacos, etc.). Great service!"}
{"text":"Ordered the homemade meatball sub for lunch for take out.  When i got back to the office, I opened the container and there were 3 meatballs on a piece of bread with some cheese and maybe, maybe some sauce.   So dry.  Still hoping for a tasty meatball - Nope.  Like someone poured cups of sugar into it.  Too sweet.  Had a co-worker try and he agreed. Bad.  I called the restaurant and they explained that their meatballs are a family recipe and a little on the sweet side.  Wow.  I have no idea who would continue to eat these generation after generation."}
{"text":"Great time at the tavern of stow for St. Patrick's Day. Best Reuben I have ever had! Smithwicks Red Ale and Fries to finish it out. Great atmosphere as well. Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"Food is sub par. Server had better things to do than wait tables. We wont be back."}
{"text":"A great bang for your buck! And , for all of you French Dip fanatics out there- finally a place that makes them correctly!!! Although the bar area is small & the lemonade was like drinking a glass of straight lemon juice, I really liked this cute little tavern.  It's nice & quiet but not awkward quiet and clean. Our waitress was nice & attentive and the food came out fast & hot."}
{"text":"I love the Tavern of Stow, it's not much to look at but the staff is always warm and welcoming and the food is good. Everything is reasonably priced with a well socked bar. If your looking to get some quality bar food with a personal \"mom & pop\" feel you can't go wrong with The Tavern of Stow."}
{"text":"This will be my \"go to\" place for a quick lunch from now on!! Had the Bacon & Bleu Cheese burger. Fantastic! Fresh off the grill not formed and frozen! Spend the extra 59 cents and get the garlic parmesan fries and some ranch to dip them in. Yum! Kids meals are $3.99 and include a side and drink. Will definitely be back and try the Reuben!!"}
{"text":"One of our favorite local places.  The food is really good and the staff are always friendly and anxious to please.   Great martini list with lots of selections.  One of my favorites is the \"Buckeye\" martini which is a chocolate peanut butter martini.  Their tavern pizzas are really good too..I like the mediterranian with feta, kalamata olives, artichoke hearts and tomato!   Look out for their weekly specials like \"dollar taco night\".   Really clean, cute place."}
{"text":"My wife and I tried tavern of stow for the first time yesterday and had a great experience. We sat in the bar area and the bartender/server was very fast and attentive. Pretty good selection of drafts and a large menu. Our appetizer and both our meals were very good. For the most part the food it is what you would expect at a bar/tavern but is very good. A wide selection so everyone can find something. We liked it enough that we order take out today. The bar area is a little small, but overall a great place. We will be going back again."}
{"text":"I really like this place! I had the Stow Strawberry Salad with grilled chicken and it was awesome! It's definitely not somewhere I would go on a date, however it's perfect if you are looking for a decent lunch instead of hitting up a fast food joint."}
{"text":"From the outside this place looks like a dark, dank bar, so we were hesitant going in. But now after going there twice, it's become one of our go-to nearby quick bite to eat kind of places. It's more diner than bar.  The hand breaded mozzarella appetizer is really good and different than most mozzarella sticks. Very melty and soft as opposed to chewy and stringy, and just looking at the breading you can tell these are made here and not shipped frozen in a bag.  I got the Reuben, which is hard to screw up, but also rare to have an amazing one. This one was better than average, but not amazing.   The garlic parmesan fries are a must every time I come here.  The only criticism I have is that if you want to seat people, please put a sign up at the entrance saying  \"please wait to be seated.\" When we came in, no one was near the entrance, no one acknowledged us, and since we didn't see a sign and it's kind of a bar, we just sat ourselves. When a waiter greeted us at the table she seemed annoyed that we sat ourselves. Minus one star for that.   Overall, I'd recommend giving this place a try, it's better than it looks from the outside."}
{"text":"The Italian passed down recipes get me every time.  We had EXCELLENT service from all the servers, especially Jessica.  Their kids menu is the best, not to mention the special kids drinks!  Gummy worm drinks and red fish drink!!  Kids can't wait to go back.  Excellent home made white French dressing!  Yum!  My husband loved the wings. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Mediocre experience, pleasant server, average food--cooked twice, thus, overdone. (It came out so fast, it had to be reheated). Not my usual length of review as there was not much to write home about.  \"Homemade\" chips were cooked long ago. The fish was a little heavy on the batter and over cooked--one piece was so rock solid heavy, if dropped, it would have busted my toe!  The coleslaw was fresh and tasty but meager in quantity. Probably won't return."}
{"text":"Visited the Tavern and found a diverse menu. The Monday night special included any burger and side combination for only $5.99. The burger was large and tasty and the fries much better than what I normally find in places like this. I would like to explore some of the other menu options. I found the staff welcoming and sincerely interested in wanting my party to have had an enjoyable dining experience. The prices were moderate and the food freshly prepared....all in all a nice place to share a meal with friends or family."}
{"text":"I enjoy this place a little more each time I visit. My only two critiques: my wings needed more sauce on them, plus they tasted a little dry. Second, the bar area is kind of small, so don't plan on meeting a bunch of friends at the bar.  Other than that, the food is good. The service is nice and professional. Plus there's plenty of parking.  **UPDATE**  I've ordered the wings a couple more times since my previous review and they tasted great! Hats off to the chef for cooking them properly.  Again, this is a fun little bar to hang out at and watch an Indians game with strangers. You'll probablyend up making new friends by the end of the evening."}
{"text":"VERY DISAPPOINTING  We live in the area and have come here for years. Unfortunately it's under New Ownership and it's gone downhill drastically!  We decided to try it again tonight for the fish dinner... Complete disaster.  The fish was soggy, we never got the coleslaw, and the fries were bland.  The French onion soup was so-so.  They weren't very busy however it took 50 min to bring one bowl of soup and a fish dinner.  The waiter was clueless and never checked in on us. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY!!!!!"}
