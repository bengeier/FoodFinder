{"text":"Good place to chill. Service is not great. Overall recommend."}
{"text":"We went there for a party a few months back with about 30 people. Overall it's a charming little place but don't got there in a group as it's too small.  The food was ok and the service was ok as well.  Nothing was I've got to write home about but pleasant enough and priced well as well. A little too lax behind the counter and playing around rather than serving but not enough to throw the whole night off either.  I'll go back but it's not at the top of my list either."}
{"text":"Nous sommes arrivé vers 1h et ils étais fermé, je sais que certains endroit qui n'ont pas de clientèles vont choisir de fermer plus tôt, donc je suis un peu déçu d'y voir l'affichage \"ouvert\" et qu'ils étaient en réalité fermés... J'aime quand même cette endroit, par contre je vais savoir que je doit arriver plus tôt  la prochaine fois."}
{"text":"We came here on a Saturday night around 8 PM and being summer and all, everyone was outside on their open terrace enjoying the work of a DJ and eating at their tables with an assortment of provided shishas. At some point a belly dancer came and have a nice show. The ambiance was very enjoyable and charming.

I went with their shish-taouk that came with a side-salad and garlic dip. The shish-taouk was tender and flavorful, I wanted more! The garlic dip was perfect as well. I also enjoyed the side fries.

The price-tag was good as well. The only reason I can't give my visit 5 stars is that the service was pretty slow albeit friendly. When I left after waiting to pay for nearly 20+ minutes , I understood why. They were having fun chatting and playing around inside near the kitchen. Oh well.

I'd definitely come again."}
