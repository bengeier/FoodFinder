{"text":"Another one of my favorites in the Burgh. Kaya has been around for quite a while and it used to be a refueling stop for me on Christmas Eve before diving in with the shopping masses on Penn Avenue.

Their specialty, tropas, tropical tapas, were here way before Ibiza and all of the other tapas bars in town caught on with the idea of serving little dishes. Although, the tropas menu has been substantially reduced from Kaya's glory days, there are still some tasty treats on the menu. 

The tuna tataki (or whatever it's called) - sashimi tuna, seaweed, sesame seed, all chopped up and marinated in a soy-based sauce, served cold and with some crackers is great. I also like the conch fritters; and the tofu cracklins - deep fried tofu served with a sweet, chipotle sauce (a little too sweet and not spicy enough for me - nowhere near the heat of mapo doufu - but it is good nevertheless).

I have never tried any of their main dishes...so I can't comment on them. It's usually 3-4 tropas between me and the mrs."}
{"text":"I stopped by Kaya in my search for an amazing burger in Pittsburgh (spoiler: Winghart's won by a mile).  The Kaya burger looked unique and delicious, so I set out across town to try one.

Maybe it was the beef (which did arrive cooked perfectly), or maybe it was just that the kaya sauce just didn't jive with the fried egg, pickles, and avocado.  Whatever it was, while I enjoyed the burger (great bun, and delicious fries), it didn't WOW me like I had hoped it would.

The interior is super cute, and the service was good though the kitchen was slow.  That gave me more time to drink, which is always fine, though Kaya's bar was a little on the light side for worthwhile beers.

3.5 stars, rounded down, but I will without question be stopping by Kaya next time I'm through Pittsburgh to try some of their other menu items.  I expect great things."}
{"text":"Kaya's atmosphere gives off a good vibe whether inside or outside while enjoying your food. The Fried Chicken sandwich with Habanero Honey Mustard is a must try cuz it will leave you wishing you had just one more bite."}
{"text":"A group of six of us went on a Thursday afternoon around 2pm for a quick lunch.  The food was great- lots of interesting menu items at great price points for a nice lunch, BUT (and it's a big but) the service was very poor.  Keep in mind there were about 3 other tables of 2-4 seated while we were there... It took about 15 minutes to get our waters filled and another 10 to have our actual waitress approach the table.  Our food arrived and was great.  I got the pulled pork with bananas and the chipotle tomato soup.  Everyone in our group loved their food.  But again, when we waited for the check, it took a good 20 minutes after we were finished for it to come, and another 10 to get our bills back to sign.  

If I was to rate the restaurant on food alone I would give it a 4 star rating, but over an hour and a half for sandwiches when the place was empty?  That's ridiculous.  I would hate to see what the service is like when the place is full!  Final verdict:  It is a great place to go if you have no plans afterwards or have anywhere that you need to be.  Great food, bad service."}
{"text":"I ate here recently and was fairly underwhelmed.  I had the black bean quesadilla with pineapple.  It was bland and not very flavorful.  I could have gotten a better quesadilla at mad mex.  I was disappointed, as others have raved about this place. Even the guacamole appetizer was a bit bland."}
{"text":"Kaya has great food and a fun atmosphere. It has an active bar and a sort of celebratory vibe, which made it nice for a birthday dinner.

It's vegetarian-friendly, and we've had some very interesting veggie and fish dishes in two visits. I particularly recommend the fish tacos--delicious and reasonably priced.

Other favorites are halibut ceviche and gazpacho. All three dishes taste authentic--well, my version of that anyway. The tacos and ceviche would be right at home in CA. 

The fish tacos are really the star though. The spicy creme fraiche sauce on the tacos was so tasty that we went home and tried to imitate it. The taco is a fresh wheat tortilla, an avocado slice, lightly battered fish, cole slaw dressed with lime, and a pink spicy creme fraiche sauce. It all works perfectly together. The acidity of the cole slaw is just perfect. I can't rave about these tacos enough (and I really love tacos).

I also really like the homemade sweet potato chips.

They also have a good variety of wine, beer, and mixed drinks. The mojitos are very good.

Portions are smallish, which I like. I was able to eat my appetizer and 2 of the 3 fish tacos. I really appreciate not having my plate loaded with rice and beans. More stuff I like, no stuff I don't.

I suggest having reservations--we didn't the first time and we waited a while.

They also have a once a month prix fixe vegetarian dinner that we are going to try. It's pricey ($35, with $20 or so extra for wine pairing), but it's really hard to get high quality vegetarian food in a restaurant so we are going to try it.

Incidentally, we liked the fish tacos so much that we made our own version at home (also delicious, but not as perfect). It's rare that a restaurant inspires me to directly copy one of their dishes."}
{"text":"A group of 9 went to Kaya last Thursday for a birthday. It was surprisingly not that crowded, but we were seated comfortably inside.  I tasted a lot of the drinks/food but I'll try to keep it to a minimum.

The service, first off, was awesome. Our waitress was awesome. Maybe it was because it was a slow night, but she voluntarily split our checks (never seen that happen with a party so large). +10 stars right there.

Our first round of drinks took a decently long time to come, but making 9 drinks takes time, so I understand. I got a Mojito. I think it was one of the first made, cause it tasted watered down. Some people got Dark & Stormys which were quite good. I don't know what type of ginger beer they use, but it was ridiculously ginger-y (a good thing). I also had a Troegs Nectar Nut Ale which was quite strong but a good dinner beer.

Now for the food. I should've listened to everyone and just ordered the fish tacos. Let me tell you now. If you visit Kaya for the first time, order the fish tacos; they are incredible. I, unfortunately, ordered the pork belly tacos. I'm a fan of pork and pork fat, but these were unbelievably fatty. It had to have been 70% fat and 30% meat. Some bites were pure fat, and it wasn't crispy bacon fat. It was gooey, gross (for me) fat. Luckily, someone couldn't finish all their fish tacos, so I traded for one of those (again, get the fish tacos). My GF got the veggie green curry which was surprisingly good. With the added shrimp, it would be an excellent meal for me (meat-a-tarian here). Three of us split the Mussels for an appetizer. I've only had mussels at Point Bruges, but I liked the Point Bruges mussels much more. The sauce at Kaya was great, but the texture of the mussels was not as good.

No one ate dessert. I would've given it 5 stars have I ordered the fish tacos, but the pork belly tacos were very disappointing."}
{"text":"Passing through and found this GEM!! Our group showed up on a Sunday 30 minutes from closing and we were all welcomed and taken care of with some of the best service I've experienced in quite a while. To top that...the FOOD was truly AMAZING and the atmosphere really was nice. Word that springs to mind is FLAVOR :) Try anything on the menu...you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Went to Kaya with my dad before a Pirates game, as it is one of our favorites, and it did not disappoint. We had the same waiter we have had the past few times we have eaten there over the past 3 years and the service was as good as ever. We ordered a FEAST. The waiter had several \"courses\" brought out to us so we could pace ourselves (and have space on the table). We first got the Fundido and the Yuca Bean Dip. Both were fantastic. The fundido was creamy with a good spice and little bit of sweet from the onions with a great cheesy flavor. The yuca dip was a perfect spicy, bean compilation that always has been good. Next, we got the crab cakes and calamari which were both good. The crab cakes had a refreshing salsa on top that balanced the heaviness of the cake well. The calamari also had good zest, as well as fried jalapenos which are always a plus. Next, we got our conch hush puppies and the jerk wings. The jerk wings are possibly my favorite with a great crunch, delicious lime sauce, and tender chicken. The conch hush puppies were good as well but they were filling especially towards the end of the huge meal. They were also surprisingly spicy. The final thing we got was a fried chicken sandwich that we took to go since we had to go to PNC Park. It was delicious (better than chik-fil-a and I love those sandwiches). It was perfectly crunchy with a bit of spice and tender chicken. Perfect meal."}
{"text":"Solid 4 stars, could be more after additional planned visits.

No tables available at 5 on a Sunday but the seats at the bar were comfortable and the bartender's service impeccable. When we left at 6:30 there were people standing and waiting. Closing time is at 9 so dinner reservations must be earlier than the usual.

The Caribbean vibe is unobtrusive but more of a bright rather than boring surrounding and typical of Big Burrito ambiance. The value is better than some of the other Big Burrito restaurants.

The appetizers - chips and salsa were veered to the island side with house? fried (over- fried to almost bitter actually) potatoes? taro? very thin with a chunky fruit salsa with a few bits of jalapeno that read more like a fruit salad than a sauce. The watermelon gazpacho was tasty and simple, almost clear, and not too sweet. The lentil bean beignets were delicious with a green curry sauce that was white in color like ranch and more sweet than I expect green curry sauce to be. The beignets were spicy and though fried not greasy. Easily my favorite and the most unique item ordered and the spice level delivered. The pork quesadilla was super though served with an odd sauce that reminded me strangely of hollandaise and on a soft flour tortilla from Reyna's (local Mexican market in the Strip). The burger combination was a good safe choice if you like the toppings of nicely peppered bacon, sunny-side egg, avocado, cheese and I'd leave off the special mayonnaise sauce.

The seared tuna was perfectly done. The spice level was lower than I expected. While there is a bit of spice the overall tone seems to be geared towards a more conservative palate in contrast the menu reads as more spicy than it is."}
{"text":"My go to order.. Grapefruit basil margarita, lobster tacos and Kaya chips .. Kaya doesnot disappoint!! Great atmosphere, plenty of parking, and you can make a reservation on Open Table! What's not to love :)"}
{"text":"Beers, brunch, and bloodys. Best happy hour in Pittsburgh, if you haven't already heard. Great tap selection, with some higher priced exclusive specials that rotate regularly. Also great wine and extremely tasty cocktail selection, all still included in that amazing happy hour deal. Really good food options as well, and a tasty hangover brunch +bloody mary made my 23rd birthday morning quite lovely. The monthly vegetarian dinner is what initially brought me to Kaya, which is amazing, but Kaya has so much more to offer than just that. I adore the veggie Kaya burgers and seriously try the cucumber vodka infused bloody mary!"}
{"text":"You can get a free meal on your birthday if you sign up for it beforehand. It's been hit or miss the few times I've gone. But whenever they've had the Kaya Fest the food is always sooo much better and tastier than what they usually serve in the resturant so just go to that!"}
{"text":"I have long heard about this place and when the opportunity to go there presented itself I was eager to go.

First impression of the restaurant was the host (or manager even) who hurriedly told us it would be an hour and half wait for a table inside since we didn't have a reservation...  I was confused though because as I looked around the dining room it looked to be only about 40% occupied.

We opted to be seated outside and our table was basically on top of Smallman St ...

The menu looked exciting and we ordered sangria, so things looked on the up and up. But... when we started eating all of our food was sort of just \"alright\" and very one note.

Don't know if I'll go back."}
{"text":"This place is the best Carribean food I had in Pittsburgh. We had the Jamaican Jerk Wings and loved it!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in pittsburgh.
The bold flavors really shine through on all of the dishes.
The ambience was right up my alley.  The frinks are flavorful, strong, and well thougt out.  Any bar that squeezes fresh fruit for their drinks is ok in my book.

The brunch here is probably the shining star.  I am not a \"chicken and waffle\" person, rather an eggs and bacon.  After seeing a waittress walk by with the dish, I had no choice but to order it.  This is one of the best things I have ever put in my mouth.  The waffle was nice and crispy, and the chicken was exploding with flavor.  I just cannot say enough about how happy this dish made me."}
{"text":"I'm from the DC area- and my husband and I do brunch. A lot. This place was so fantastic, I actually created a yelp account just to leave a review (then got distracted and never left it). My husband and I were in town visiting his family and originally planned to go to Pamela's diner but there was a 45 minute wait. So we walked down the strip and stumbled upon this place. Boy am I glad we did. At first, I was apprehensive because there was only 1 other table with patrons but my group and I were starving so we just went with it. I ordered the crab omelet and I can't remember what everyone else ordered because I was too wrapped up in the orgasm that was on my plate. Seriously, it was that good. I would probably never pair a crab omelet with bacon and grilled pineapple on the side, but oh my word the combination was amazing. We had a larger party of 8 and our server was really attentive. I can't even believe how not busy it was on a Sunday morning. Pamela's had a 3-page wait list and this place was empty! Unbelievable. 

When we were headed out, I asked if I could speak with the manager to thank her for such a lovely experience and she was very gracious. I now can't wait to visit the area again, this place is an absolute must. One of the best brunches I've had, ever."}
{"text":"This is one of those places I keep trying because everyone keeps recommending it. It is adequate, nothing more. I can't think of a single dish I would recommend, and I've tried probably 10. Nor would I wave you off of any dishes. It is the very definition of \"okay.\"

The bar has a deep selection. The happy hour is a good value, and the place can get jumping then. It's got a dimly lit atmosphere perfect for an intimate conversation, although the crowd noise can get a little loud at peak times."}
{"text":"The food and drinks are terrible.  We ordered tropical guacamole and it was watery and full of pineapples,  I'm not sure avocados were even involved in that situation... We had the poke tostadas, which nearly made me sick and I LOVE raw fish.  These were recommended by our waitress,  who charged us full price for them even though we hated them and didn't eat them.  We arrived during happy,  which would have been lovely if our drinks didn't taste like straight tequila.   And everything was extremely salty.  The restaurant has a nice intimate atmosphere,  but lacks the culinary talent and service to make it worthwhile."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner on Sunday...food was excellant.  After reading reviews everyone should know by now the Pork Quesadillas are spicy but only on the tongue and the pork is so tender.  Crispy fish tacos were very flavorful.  Nice experience overall and a definite treat!  Will be back."}
{"text":"My first trip to Kaya was out of sheer Monday night dinner desperation.  Having found that our first two restaurant choices were closed, my boyfriend and I headed aimlessly toward the Strip District.  We were both getting pretty hungry and frustrated at this point (our fault...should have used the mobile Yelp app to look up restaurant hours!).  We'd both heard good things about Kaya, so we decided to give it a shot.

We arrived right in time for Happy Hour (5-7pm, Monday thru Friday).  I promptly ordered a pomegranate martini...good flavor, but I found it to be a little weak.  My boyfriend and I were able to grab two seats at the bar, so we decided to order our food there as opposed to waiting 30-45 mins for a table.  I went with the Jamaican Green Curry Vegetables, while my boyfriend ordered the Fish Tacos.  By this time, the Happy Hour crowd had begun to clear out, and our food arrived quickly.

I really enjoyed my Jamaican green curry.  It had a much different flavor than the green curry I typically order at Thai restaurants, but was very tasty.  It was served with some fluffy saffron rice.  The bf loved his crispy fish tacos, which was great because the portion size was large.  I tried a bite myself and had a bit of food envy.  Next time!

I found Kaya to be my favorite of the Big Burrito restaurants that I've been to.  I can't wait to go back and sample a few more items from the menu.  Although my boyfriend and I had been tired and frustrated when we first walked in the door, we found that our mood had been greatly improved by our overall experience here.  Thanks Kaya!"}
{"text":"Disappointing - service was very slow, the food was unexceptional.  I think we got the \"B\" team on Sunday."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in Pittsburgh. Amazing corn lentil beignets, black bean dip for appetizers. Love the Jamaican curry too."}
{"text":"The fish tacos were probably the best we have ever eaten!  I am not a big fan of European style seating, but because we arrived early, we didn't have anyone at the tables next to us.  Our server, Chas was excellent.  He was extremely knowledgeable about the menu and very willing to help us find the perfect beer to go with our meal.  Being residents of the Northwest, we are used to good microbreweries."}
{"text":"First off, Kaya's happy hour is great. All wine, beer, and cocktails are half off. I just love their cocktails. These specials run from 5 to 7 pm, Monday through Friday. 
The food is reasonably priced, with a few exceptions. I have enjoyed the lentil-corn beignets, the Yucatan Bean dip, and the mussels for appetizers. The jerk chicken wings were startlingly spicy, which was a welcome change from other establishments' jerked chicken. I also love their chips. For entrees, the Paella, flank steak and Cuban sandwich were all good. However, on one occasion, a dining companion ordered the Green Curry Vegetables. I had a taste, and we both agreed it was bland. The shrimp he ordered were also a bit undercooked. This would be my lone \"bad experience\" at Kaya. The staff also remedied the problem. 

Service is usually friendly and casual. They were kind enough to serve my fiance the calamari free of sauce, with no questions or eyebrow raises. 

We usually get a table outside when the weather is good, as the inside is well-decorated but dark. I will be scheduling another visit to Kaya soon. If it were in a more central location to me, I would go there all the time."}
{"text":"With a cheerful and friendly ambiance, Kaya is a great place to try some jerk swordfish or conch fritters. The prices aren't too steep for the amount of food you get, but compared to some of the other Big Burrito restaurants, like Casbah, it lacks in flavor."}
{"text":"The food is so good! A friend who lives in the area took me here last week. I live in Los Angeles and wasn't sure how a fish taco in Pittsburgh would be, but it was great! We actually split two entrees (fish tacos and the burger) and both were delicious. They even divided everything up for us in the kitchen and put one egg each on our burger halves, along with a generous serving of fries on each plate. I am definitely going back to Kaya the next time I visit Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"Wow, what a great restaurant.  I live in Manhattan, so naturally I never thought I'd be raving about a restaurant in Pittsburgh.  Veg paella was out of this world. Only $10, which wouldn't cover the tip on an equivalent meal in NYC.  Outstanding service (but I came at an off hour). Indoor and outdoor seating were equally popular.  Large selection of vegetarian entrees.  No complaints."}
{"text":"Favorite spot in Pittsburgh. If you are looking for excellent service, wonderfully flavored/spiced dishes and KILLER cocktails and wine list, this is your go to restaurant!"}
{"text":"When visiting Pittsburgh earlier this month we were searching for a place to get a small, quick lunch on a sit-down restaurant.  Since we were \"sight-seeing\" Steeltown's \"Strip\" we decided to try Kaya.  The restaurant looked decent.  First, the service was inadequate fromt he first moment.  Our waitress was a bit rude, walked away in the middle of our order of drinks and then did not come back with even the ice water until 15 mins later.  We ordered a fried appetizer (a take on an Indian dish of which name I don't recall), and it was ok tasting....something a TGIF could pull off.  My husband ordered a seared tuna salad I believe and I got the jerk chicken salad.  His dish was on the bland side but edible.  My jerk chicken salad was a far cry from anything edible.  The chicken was so salty, had so much dry herbs and pepper that all I tasted was salted herbs and then fire from the pepper.  The dressing on the greens underneath the chicken was bitter and the mango salad that came on the side was not at all fresh.  I was starving so I managed to eat a third of it but then had to stop because it was beginning to really make me gag. I obviously refused the spacey waitress' offer to get the rest of the meal wrapped up.  If you like boring food trying to pass for something exotic then this is your place.  One other thing I can say is that the problem with service was not only a problem for us.  A couple sitting near us got up and left after not even getting menus for the first 15 or 20 mins and another family had to actually get up from the table to go get the waitress on the other side of the restaurant.  This was not a busy Sat so I doubt that lapses in service like this can be blamed on a busy hour.  In general our food experience in Pittsburgh was just bad.  I do hope that the city has more to offer than what we had the displeasure of trying."}
{"text":"I stopped in for 2 beers as I had eaten a late lunch so this review is for that only.

pros:  interesting and unique atmosphere including decor and music,,, diverse yet not a overwhelming selection of drafts and liquor.

lows:  quite simply rude, curt and unacceptable service from the 2 bartenders (lets call them the \"richard cabezas\" to keep with the theme)  Ask them a question and get a one word answer unless they were correcting me about something and that was combined with an eye roll.

Just didn't feel welcomed and  comfortable which is super rare for me anymore and lets just say I WILL NOT be returning."}
{"text":"This place was my first experience with pittsburgh food and I havent eaten anything so unique and delicious in town! Food is exquisite you cant go wrong with anything on this menu! LOOOOVE the drinks equally!!!
My favs
-Jerk wings with cilantro cream 
- Mussels 
- Kaya burger with sweet potato fries! yummmmmmmm!
- fish tacos.
Theyre just different in an awesome way!"}
{"text":"I LOVE KAYA!

Making a reservation is best, because they can get busy. Seating is a bit cramped, and you're very very close to the people beside you.

But the food is to die for. I always get the jerk pulled pork quesadilla. It's amazing and always cooked perfectly. The staff seems very friendly and attentive as well. 

Be prepared to spend a bit on dinner, but it's absolutely worth it and the food quality matches the prices."}
{"text":"Was asked to review this for fiancee.   She went there with friends for drinks on a this evening (Sunday) and waited about 20 minutes to be served at bar (bar was not busy) before finally giving up.  Was walking out of place and made a mention of this to the doorman who said thanks, have a nice day, and f*** off.  Nice manners"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times, and ordered different vegetarian options. I love the food. They do a great job of blending different flavors together to create a cohesive taste. The wait staff seems pretty nice, my waiter was able to get the kitchen to make me something that was normally on the Lunch menu for Brunch. 

I would defiantly recommend it."}
{"text":"Easter Brunch! The food was amazing!! The vibe was great! Most definitely can't wait to go back for round 2!"}
{"text":"Kaya is located on the strip in Pittsburgh, Pa. If you are looking to try something new, then this is worth a visit. Its a miss of vegetarian, and Caribbean food that is wonderful. The spices,  flavor and variety are yummy. We had the fish tacos. It is a must try! We also had jerk chicken wings that were simply amazing. My husband had the sweet and spicy ribs and did not like it. It was REALLY sweet. Wait staff was very friendly and prompt. The atmosphere is dark, and very loud. It was also very hot and I'm not sure if they had AC or if it just didn't feel like it with a crowded restaurant. Food price was also reasonable. You're probably looking at $12-20 per person. Menu was also very simple and not more than 30 options (i believe so). Limited choice but a variety."}
{"text":"I have tried Kaya on two different occasions and was disappointed in the service and food each time. The first time I sat at the bar, the second at a table. Both times the staff were unfriendly and the second, actually rude. Kaya has a pretty large menu, though I was disappointed by all 3 meals I tried (a few different tacos and the hush puppies). Ambiance is OK. The location in the Strip is great but I wouldn't return unless the menu has changed and no other alternatives are available. For perspective: I love eating local, nutrious food, trying new food, and ambiance. I travel domestically quite a bit and eat out a few times a week."}
{"text":"Food and drink are 4.5 stars. Very good, not super over-priced (check out the happy hour for half priced cocktails!). 

Service is 2 star. In the two times I visited, once the service was pushy and the other time it was extremely slow. They could have been having an off night, but it bothered me that the waitress pretended as though everything wasn't slow instead of simply acknowledging it and offering a quick apology. They weren't particularly busy either, so the fact that we were not well attended was a bit irritating."}
{"text":"I went here based on Pittsburgh Magazine's Top 25 Restaurants.  Guess what?  Kaya is not in the top 25.  They are a bar with decent bar food.  Like Mad Mex.  Their \"specialty dish\" the Conch Fritters is battered conch fried to hell in trans fat.  Yummie!!!  I think I gained 5 pounds from that alone.  A better version of their fish tacos can be purchased for 50% less at the Penn Avenue Fish Company a few blocks away.

Did you ever notice that all of Big Burrito's restaurants (aside from the Mad Mex chain) get in the Top 25 every year.  With Kaya being in it that makes me question the \"purity\" of the list."}
{"text":"LOVE this place! Delicious Caribbean food, beautiful decor and lovely service. Must try their Kaya Burger (vegetarian or meat), tacos, paella, and desserts! The waitress made my birthday very special :)"}
{"text":"Underwhelmed.  Went here a little while back with a friend visiting from out of town.  Our overall impression?  Non-memorable food, and mildly tacky decor led to a \"meh\" type experience.

We started with the chips and mango salsa.  This was pretty good; their chips are made in-house and were tasty.  My friend enjoyed the salsa more than I did, which could be because I didn't expect the mango-tomatillo to be quite so sweet.  Could definitely appreciate their fresh ingredients.

Sangria was super-sour.  To mitigate this, our server suggested simple syrup, and brought some for us to mix in as we saw fit.  Take this as you may.  

On to entrees:  Friend got the jerk pulled pork quesadilla which was soggy and over-stuffed with pork (i.e. the cheese-to-pork ratio was definitely off).  Although she consumed far less than half of it, she had no desire to pack the rest, and left it to soak in its own juices a bit further.

I ordered the chicken breast with confit enchiladas.  While the chicken was good, it wasn't anything I'd make a special trip for again.  The confit enchiladas, however, were memorable - in a bad way.  They were over-cooked, tasting like re-microwaved taquitos.  Not even taquitos that were good to begin with, prior to the round 2 reheating.  Yikes.  The outer shell was also quite oily/greasy in appearance and in taste.  In essence, could have done without the enchiladas.

The barstools with hanging faux leather palm tree leaves gave my friend the sense that were in a cheap Caribbean hotel's lobby.  Yikes again.

Maybe a bit harsh, but Kaya, you just weren't my fav."}
{"text":"The fact that this place does a vegetarian Wednesday every month makes them ok in my books! The food never disappoints! I also love sitting outside in the summer."}
{"text":"I've ate here once and i thought the food was pretty good. i really liked the fact they had multiple vegetarian options and was a big fan of the lentil and corn beignets."}
{"text":"I love this place.

I started off with the homemade chips and mango salsa. It's got a little heat to it so be prepared for some spice but a great appetizer to share with the group can certainly serve a group of four people easily. Love the acidity as well great balance  to the spice.

I then had the caulk corn chowder which was absolutely amazing. The portion was definitely a bowl and could've been split between two people. But makes great leftovers for lunch tomorrow. My wife had the spicy tortilla soup. But no it was not that spicy. The server even suggested bringing a standard sour cream as well as their other specialty cilantro sour cream.

I had the paella with seafood. This is just a great dish all around. No complaints at all by me. In the shrimp was cooked to perfection. Again the portion was huge.

My wife had the fish tacos. And it came with three very large tacos. Again a great portion size for the price.

Our server was also awesome she checked in at the right times and always knew exactly what to say. 

Great meal at a great price, and it never seems to disappoint.

By this point we were so stuffed didn't even have room for the desert.

Oh yeah I forgot about the two glasses of wine."}
{"text":"Honestly this is the overall best food I've ever had in my life service is great food I so damn good everything about it it's great has a bar it's maintained and big honestly you have to come here no doubts best restaurant ever"}
{"text":"went for lunch and maybe it's what I ordered, but it was just ok for me. Nothing out of the ordinary or anything that really WOWed me. The place was clean and the servers good, though"}
{"text":"Have been to kaya several times. They consistently offer great service, but the food is the highlight of visiting kaya. The mussels are the best in the city. Everything I tried has been excellent.  They also offer a great happy hour from 5 to 7, half off of all drinks, which includes a nice selection of beers, wine, and top shelf liquors."}
{"text":"I took some business associates to Kaya for dinner.  It is a fun place and we shares a number of small plates.  The wings are really spicy and a couple of the guests had difficulty with them, but I thought they were delicious.  I also liked the savory beignets.  We enjoyed almost all of the dishes.  This is a fun place to eat and drink in a cool part of Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Cannot recommend this place enough! Great, interesting, unique food and very manageable prices. The bartender was kind enough to custom make a drink for me: ginger beer and lemonade, and the Dark & Stormy rum cocktail for my husband was excellent. I had a lunch combo of corn and conch chowder, green salad with lime cilantro vinaigrette and jerk pulled pork quesadilla with cucumber aioli, while he had the crunchy fish tacos with the same salad. Just incredible, delicious food."}
{"text":"I love Kaya.  This place just exudes a fun and friendly atmosphere, and is the only place I know of where you can order Tapas in Pittsburgh.  They're all delicious, and if you've never tried alligator you can do that here too."}
{"text":"Sweet potatoes fries are the BEST! Perfect combination of salty and sweet with the perfect crunch! We have the Chi a burger and the steak sandwich, everything was delicious we were stuffed but kept eating just because the food was so good!"}
{"text":"Been to Kaya twice now. Both times was not disappointed!
The tofu and lettuce wraps are a mainstay, along with the lentil and corn beignets. I'd like to try some of the more adventurous cocktails on a future trip.
Always go for the Kaya Chips when ordering a quac or salsa. They are just the right degree of salty.
Kaya is a good choice for a flavorful dinner in Pittsburgh's Strip District. Recommended."}
{"text":"Been here several times for happy hour with people from out of town. During that time the drinks are very reasonably priced, so that you'll end up pretty happy. They all tend to be tropical and interesting, not your usual cocktails. 

I can only recomend for this purpose, although i have heard that the food is not bad, either. Will have to test that!"}
{"text":"Came for brunch - had the Soy Sausage Benedict and Crab Omelete. Both were really good, especially the benedict which was made with Corn Bread instead of an English Muffin. Was awesome!"}
{"text":"I've been here once, in 2012, and the prices were great, the service was even better, the cocktails were well made, and the jamaican green curry was the best food i've had in pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Kaya has great, exotic food. They offer a unique array of dishes and some of the best desserts I've ever had. They're vegetarian friendly. The staff is always very helpful and nice. If they're busy, you can get the full menu at the bar, which is a plus. Although it is a bit expensive, it is worth it for a nice evening out to celebrate!"}
{"text":"Hidden gem in the strip district! A very unique and fun menu! Friendly and informative staff. Go with an open mind and palate and you wont go away unhappy! Try brunch for something different than your usual egg and pancake options."}
{"text":"Been here a few times. Tried several dishes. The food is nothing special. Dont know why people rave about this place. However, Kaya has the best Mojito's in town! Go for happy hour. Half price. 

Kaya you get three stars for your Rockin Mojito's. :-)"}
{"text":"We had a night out without our little one and wanted to try a new place with unique food, so after checking out some reviews, we ended up choosing Kaya. We made reservations for 9pm on a Friday night, and the place still had a lot of diners. One other person noted how close the tables were, and we agree. We were only a foot or two from a couple on their 1st or 2nd date (and were totally amused by their conversations which you couldn't help but overhear due to our proximity), but it also helped to scope out what other people were ordering. All the food looked pretty good.

We ordered the jerk wings and we would absolutely order those again. Very flavorful, hot & fresh, and juicy. The dipping sauce was a welcome change from ranch or blue cheese. For entrees, I had the seared tuna (I think the  most expensive item on the menu) with very flavorful lime-y black beans, another creamy green sauce, and what seemed to be fried plantains. He had the crispy fish tacos, and we both cleaned our plates.

For dessert, we ordered the chocolate chip banana bread pudding, and it was pretty tasty. We have a hard time passing up bread pudding when it's on the menu, even when we're full!

The drinks were interesting. I hadn't ever had a frozen mojito, and I tried their mango version. I don't think I'd get it again, but his rum ginger drink was good.

We would definitely come back and try this again."}
{"text":"i  love their food its the best.  They Always have excellent customer service and never late their bar is fun and great i love their drink especially. Nice place to go out to and have a few drinks and relax."}
{"text":"In the Burgh for business and needed a place for dinner in the strip.   I hadn't been to Kaya in 6+ years since I moved away.   Service - fast,  friendly and helpful with tips from the waitress.   Food was delicious - I recommend the chips with bean dip salsa and the vegetable paella. 

Price -  under $80 for 3 grown men with 2 apps and 3 entrees. 

I'll be going back again next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"This place was really wonderful. Ate here for the first time today and will definitely be back. I had the Cuban with sweet potato fries and a salad (THAT SALAD) and couldn't even finish I was so full. My friend got the Kaya burger and it was HUGE! It looked delicious and I will definitely be trying that the next time I go back.

The restaurant has a great atmosphere and everyone I talked to was very friendly. I wish I had caught the name of our waitress today because she was awesome! (Waitress, we talked about my scarf from Thailand. You were great!)"}
{"text":"Great cuban food and drinks. Try the fish tacos, pulled pork, mojitos, and pineapple salsa. Nice atmosphere and bar as well."}
{"text":"Visited Kaya a while ago on a trip to Pittsburgh with my bf. We had such a great experience. The food was to die for and the service we received was excellent. The host was very accommodating especially since we made a mistake and came to our reservation an hour early! I will definitely make another trip to Kaya the next time I'm in Pittsburgh. 
Oh yeah... did I mention how strong our drinks were ;-)"}
{"text":"I really like this place!  Fresh ingredients and cool, unique dishes.  Adventurous eaters come hither!  But I must admit I have been there several times (at least 3) but most recent was about 4 months ago.  And unfortunately it is tough to recall exatly what was ordered.  I know I know...if I don't remember exactly it must not have been that good.  No!! Just tough to recall all the details!  I do know my date and I started with the Conch Fritters.  Quite good...fried yummies.  I had a salad with pomegranate, pepitas and greens and scallops (I think!!).  I really enjoyed them (honestly).  My date had the Halibut special which was wrapped in plantains.  He is not soo adventurous but he did enjoy his meal.  Great service too...owner/manager (?)/ hostess is very friendly and adds to the relaxed atmosphere.  Next time I am there I will be sure to Yelp sooner!"}
{"text":"great food and atmosphere. i always have a good meal here and recently discovered they have brunch as well."}
{"text":"Great crowd, great interactions with the staff, really great drinks, and really really great food. Kaya makes for a terrific night out. Possibly the best fish tacos in town."}
{"text":"This is a great new unique restaurant that has a good blend of Caribbean food. I recommend getting the fried avocado tacos for entree and the lentil and corn benignets as well as the mango salsa."}
{"text":"Great Food, Great Happy Hour, Great Sunday Brunch

Best Fish Taco's in Pittsburgh hands down"}
{"text":"Great little place. Had the curry green veggies which was great. HUGE portions. My gf had a burger and it was too big for a mouth to fit around but very good. Sweet potato fries were also top notch."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant multiple times. They serve really good food! All my coworkers loved this place as well.  I have tried the mussels, cuban sandwitch and jerked wings and they are super delicious! The drinks were great as well."}
{"text":"This meal was delicious. We got conch hush puppies for an appetizer and I got crispy fish tacos for the main meal. It was my husband's first meal out at a restaurant since he had major abdominal surgery so this was a very big deal. He got a Cuban sandwich which he said was acceptable (we are Cuban sandwich SNOBS so not to be mistaken, this is a compliment!) and my mom got a vegetarian burger. Everything was absolutely delicious. Wait staff was awesome, very nice. Great place!"}
{"text":"One of my FAVORITE restaurants in Pittsburgh! The rainbow salad is amazing, as is the grilled veggie salad - the fish tacos are delicious and big enough to share, EXCELLENT craft cocktails, great service, nice people. LOVE this place. VERY busy on the weekends, be prepared!"}
{"text":"Best fish tacos I've ever had -  and that's coming from a California native. Excellent food and the jerk wings were great too."}
{"text":"We went on a Sunday night around 7 pm and sat at the bar. The service was prompt, friendly and knowledgeable. They have 18 beers on tap and a great variety of other drinks as well.  We started with the Yucatan Hot Bean Dip served with house made chips which was excellent, spicy but with a nice flavor u could actually taste. We had the Tropical Paella as an entree and it was delicious! The portions are big enough to share or take home for leftovers which were even better the next day! If your in Pittsburgh you need to add Kaya to your list of dining experiences."}
{"text":"A little pricey for the quality of food I got, but over-all a positive experience. The dining area is a bit cramped, but the atmosphere is pleasant. Try the black bean dip!"}
{"text":"Really really great service.  Diverse menu.  Apps are excellent especially the calamari  which features some interesting use of lime.  Nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"it was ok: i don't get the hype.  the drinks were good (basil grapefruit!) but our server had to be constantly reminded for basic items (silverware, i received my second drink 30 seconds ahead of our bill).  the food was good and/but i'm not sure why it has the ultra high reviews.  It was a good meal/good time but nothing spectacular....i'd go back if i was in the area."}
{"text":"I was hesitant to go here at first as I had little interest in Caribbean cuisine. I'm so glad my friends convinced me to go. Banh Mi Tacos and Green Curry vegetables are my go to. Both have rich and unique flavor. Their drink menu is awesome. Staff is super friendly and helpful when it comes to trying new menu items."}
{"text":"As appetizer, I tried the mango guacamole. You can definitely taste the mango in it. I'm a huge fan of mangoes so I enjoyed it but my friends disagreed because they would've liked more guac for the price we paid. The chips to guac ratio was also uneven. Way too little chips! For the entree, I got fish tacos. It was okay, but the fish was a little too crispy for my liking. I have to say though, I absolutely loved their white sangria. Drinks are half off during happy hour on weekdays 4:30-6:30pm as well! 

One thing that ticked me off during my visit was the nonchalant servers. I know Kaya has the whole laid-back beach vibe going on, but that doesn't mean that the servers should behave that way too. We were in a rush, and whenever we asked our server for the check, refill, to-go boxes, he would respond with a \"Okay, I'll get that for you in a second\" and skip along to do something else first. It gets pretty frustrating the third time he says that. A little sense of urgency would be nice. 

I've heard great things about Kaya from other people, but sadly I can't say the same. It didn't live up to my expectations and there's nothing phenomenal about the food or service."}
{"text":"Loved the fish tacos and mojitos. Make reservations! Great atmosphere and the waitress was very knowledgable about the menu! Will be going back soon."}
{"text":"I get take-out here on occasion for the whole office at lunch time. Good reviews all around from my co-workers. They have a lot of great, unique sauces and dressings that won't bore you. Steer clear of the beignets - they're nothing like the real deal down in good 'ol New Orleans (they aren't supposed to be, though). I really like the tomato avacado sandwich and the jamaican wings. The side salad has some good garlicky sauce. One day...I went to pick up an order and the bartender was awesomely engaging. He could tell I was having a rough one because I looked REAL frazzled. And guess what he did! He gave me a little Jacky on tha house and cheered me right up! I tipped said bartender with a 2-dollar bill. Bet he's never gotten that before. Thanks Kaya, I'll be back soon. Sincerely, Dea"}
{"text":"I am going to start my review by saying that we went for a late lunch. Therefore, we had no crowds, and good prices.

It's rare that you go to a restaurant and like not only everything on your plate, but on your dining guests' plates as well (yes, I snuck a taste of everybody's). I got the fish tacos, which were quite good. Also on the table was a burger served with sweet potato fries (delicious), and another sandwich choice. Everybody was happy, the atmosphere was fun, and conveniently located for some shopping on the strip. A great choice."}
{"text":"After the longest happy hour ever we took a stroll to the strip district to find some eats. We decided on KAYA. It's a pretty neat place no tables so we took a seat at the bar. The bartender was terrific I started with the smoke&ginger cocktail. Man ole man was that tasty. I want to give a shout out to who's ever in charge of the music in this place it was great had us moving in our seats! We ordered the mango salsa and chips which was tasty. For my entree I ordered the jerk chicken thighs and pinto beans. It was so so so flavorful and spicy but the slices of avocado mellowed out the spice. The   thighs were juicy and fallen off the bone. I would absolutely recommend this place"}
{"text":"I absolutely love coming to KAYA.  The food is amazing! AMAZING!!! And they have a nice Beer selection on draft.  Id suggest making reservations if you're going to be eating dinner there any evening or lunch on the weekend. 

I've been there perhaps ten times now and the food and service are solid 10s."}
{"text":"Great service and very delicious food! A good variety and full of flavor ! The mojito was was amazing i could taste how fresh the mint was! Very pleased! Sweet and spicy ribs were great as well"}
{"text":"I kinda went in with low expectations and was pleasantly surprised. You see when we were entering the restaurant, a number of young men in track suits were leaving. 

The decor was surprisingly not as tacky as I imagined it would be and the service at the bar was very good. We did have to wait longer for our reservation. It was a laid back atmosphere with excellent service. 

As far as food goes, I would lean toward the seafood dishes and getting a number of small plates. They are also excellent about splitting entrees for you. Of the small plates, I particularly like the tuna poke. The enchiladas are just okay, but their dipping sauce is very good. The lamb and cockles were very good. Eastern Shore Sea Scallops, Mussels and Littleneck clams was excellent. Crispy duck breast, creamy cornmeal grits, charred mustard greens, chili gastrique was good, but I found the sauce a bit on the salty side. Portions are quite generous. 

As far as desserts, the creme brulee was the best. The bread pudding okay, but a bit too egg-y. The chocolate cake was meh. The texture was too dense and dry. I think they need to soak the cake in rum. 

Wine selection was a bit disappointing. I would have like to see some South African wines considering that this is a African / Carribean fusion theme restaurant. Though I had a glass of the Carmenere and it was quite good. 

Overall, I was quite pleased with the place. It would be nice for a date. It is a bit spendy on a grad student salary. It came to approximately $200 for the 4 of us with a couple drinks each, tax + tip."}
{"text":"When we walked into Kaya, we thought the place was fairly small until we were shown our table and we got a better idea of the size of the place. I thought there could have been more lighting since it was almost difficult to read my menu(and I prefer darker rooms).

We started with some Kaya chips and Yucatan Hot Bean Dip, then some fried chicken tacos. The chips were a treat and the bean dip was almost like chili, which I enjoyed. It had a spicy kick, but I didn't think it was that hot. The fried chicken tacos were absolutely delicious.

I ordered the Kaya Burger for my meal and was pleasantly surprised with it. The egg made for a great burger and the Kaya sauce was extremely tasty. I expected the avacado and bacon to stand out, but there was a blend of flavors instead, which was great. I was surprised by how small the burger looked when I got it, the the burger patty was very thick and I was stuffed when I finished. I was also able to try some jerked chicken from a colleague's plate and it was exquisite. Not only was the flavor out of this world, it was very juicy."}
{"text":"I enjoyed this restaurant, food was great but the restaurant itself was kind of small.  We had brunch, and I had tropical guacamole and mahi mahi fish tacos with salad. My girlfriends had Jamaican jerk wings, tempura avocado tacos and some type of beignets. We also had a pitcher of white sangria. As I said, good was all great'"}
{"text":"Time and again, Kaya remains one of my favorite places to grab a meal. This weekend, I went back for a brunch with a couple girlfriends -- and everyone agreed about its collective deliciousness. 

The brunch started with a basic mimosa -- don't let the pulp scare you away (if that kind of thing scares you away from OJ, as it usually does for me); this drink is incredibly refreshing. I had the eggs benedict (sans cornbread, since the server/chef confirmed it is NOT gluten-free... bummer). The smoked salmon and hollandaise sauce was perfection together. And holy plate of grilled pineapple! What a nice complement to the meal. 

I love my old standbys in this city, and this Caribbean-inspired cafe endures at the top of the list.

Five, brunchin' big stars, Kaya!"}
{"text":"Finally had the pleasure of trying Kaya! Food was wonderful! Staff were all very nice! Portions were large for the price! Great little place with great flavor!"}
{"text":"Last ate here about 15 years ago. Loved the vibe and menu. Decided to return with my wife. Started with the calamari and they were deliciously sweet and spicy. My wife ordered the fish tacos. They were large and very fresh but covered in a little too much creme freche.  I had the green curry with shrimp. I did not care for this at all. It was too oniony and too citrussy. Coffee was superb. Dessert was lava cake with vanilla ice cream. This was very good.
I must have ordered the wrong thing.  The green curry does not taste like it's Thai counterpart. But the vibe is so good I will have to return. I will order the cuban sandwich, Paella or jerked chicken when next time."}
{"text":"Kaya in the strip district is about as solid as it gets for dining in Pittsburgh. This restaurant has excellent food, exceptionally friendly staff & waiters, and a good beer selection. The food is always top quality and the right temperature. I love this place."}
{"text":"Kaya continues to impress. Been there for the third time now, always getting something different. This last trip was with a large group (family) so we were able to feast on several of the appetizers plus shared tastes of what each person ordered. I went with the Alligator and Pork Tacos with a side of street corn. I stuck with beer for the evening but the Sangria got rave reviews by those who indulged. Highly recommend Kaya as a Date Spot or for a large group."}
{"text":"Drinks were amazing! Food was blah (chips were absolutely tasteless). Ambiance was chill and hip. I would return for drinks with friends."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch without a reservation and the hostess accommodated us without a problem. The server was friendly and knew about the items we asked about. Ambiance was eclectic from the wall hangings to the tribal sculpture and avoided the bright mix of colors you often find in Caribbean restaurants. But in the end its about the food... Attractive - Fresh - Terrific ! 

Conch hush puppies had some heat, the pulled pork with fried bananas was fun with flavor and texture, the vegetable curry dish had hints of curry and allowed the saffron and other flavors to shine. My only complaint was we didn't leave room for dessert."}
{"text":"Best place we've been to in a while. Great service. Great food.  Try the black bean dip."}
{"text":"I went to Kaya for my birthday, using my Big Burrito free meal for signing up to their email list.  I was not disappointed in the food at all.  As a starter, we ordered their jerk wings with cilantro cream sauce as a base.  They were some of the best wings that I have ever had.  They were extremely juicy but still very crisp on the outside.  You receive 10 wings in the order for $10, which is probably one of the better values on their menu.  

For my entree I ordered the tropical Paella.  My girlfriend ordered the grilled flank steak.  Both portions were plentiful and delicious.  The only reason why I am knocking the rating down to a 4 is because our waiter gave us bowls and plates on the side and they weren't completely clean.  Other than that, this review would be 5 stars."}
{"text":"This place is great. Makes a joke of Monterey bay. For less than half the price get twice the meal. Try the porgy."}
{"text":"I remembered my friends and I went there 2 months ago. We three ordered three main courses and one chips. Portion was very generous. I had avocado tacos, average. Paella and steak was good."}
{"text":"Leaving Yelp's Weeniefest at Franktuary a couple weeks ago, my wife and I slid over to Kaya in the Strip.

Due to Valentine's day the previous week, there was still some overflow in the weekend --- it was Sunday Night, and the hostess told us she was booked.  We could eat at the bar, if there was room.......after the nice gentleman moved, there was just enough for the two of us.

Kaya is on the small side, with a limited number of tables, and a long bar.  The bar seats a good 10-12 people, so my experience might not be so isolated.  They have (18) different beers on tap.

The place is more modern and Caribbean in both flavor and decoration.
 
Service was fine at the bar, if maybe a little cold.

We had both Lentil & Corn Beignets in green curry and the chips with mango/tomatillo salsa.  The beignets were very good, although there was a strong floral content in the curry sauce.  The first thing that popped into my head was that it tasted like I was sucking on a glade plugin. While that was mostly just the first impression, I felt the need to post it.  It's strong.

The mango tomatillo salsa and chips is a real winner, even at $7.

We had both the fish tacos and paella.  The fish tacos were great...... and paella was fantastic!  It had chicken, shrimp, mussels, scallops, chorizo sausage, brown rice al la jambalaya, and finished with pineapple.  Great balance, the sweetness of the pineapple was nice against the rest of the savory ingredients.

Overall great experience, and we'll definitely go back again soon!"}
{"text":"My sister and I went here for lunch, and we found it to be incredibly mediocre, and it definitely did not live up to the hype. The food was ok, but over-priced for things that we didn't really like. We were in Pittsburgh for only a few days, and I really regret that we wasted one of our meals on Kaya.

We started with the beignets. I thought they were good, my sister did not. I ordered the fish tacos, which were ok. Unfortunately, they were smothered in over-sauced slaw that completely overwhelmed the taste of the fish. My sister had the rainbow salad which was the same thing: way too many tastes, drowning out any enjoyment of the flavors. I think the food would be much better if they focused on highlighting quality ingredients. 

This place wasn't terrible, but neither of us particularly enjoyed our food and we don't plan on coming back."}
{"text":"Very overpriced for what you get. I had the skirt steak which was stringy and tough. I've had much better meals at mad mex. Our server was extremely impersonal and we were rushed out. Will not return."}
{"text":"Eleven probably gets my vote as the best of Big Burrito, but Kaya is a close second. Any time my wife and I need a place to go for a date night, they always fit the bill.

Drinks are always reasonable and we've always had incredibly friendly service, but it always comes down to the food here.

Quite frankly, I haven't had something off of their menu that I didn't like. Of course the fried chicken night is amazing - not the best I've ever had but certainly the best in the Burgh. Specifically love when they have coconut rice as a side. The pita with hot sauce is fantastic as well.

I regularly order the Jamaican jerk wings with the cilantro sour cream, the kaya burger, the skirt steak, lobster tacos, or the black bean dip - not all at once obviously.

I've only made it to dessert once or twice, wasn't big on their ice cream as it was more ice than cream.

The 5 stars is for consistency and overall food quality."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Get the black bean dip."}
{"text":"Came across this restaurant trying to make a quick reservation on open table. I definitely suggest making a reservation because this place seems to get pretty busy over the weekends. Initially they sat my party outside and we moved inside once our food came. Outdoor seating was okay, not much of a view or ambiance compared to the inside of the restaurant. I ordered the poke appetizer for dinner which was very good and the perfect amount for me. The menu had a couple vegetarian-friendly dishes too that looked good! The food was a little overpriced given the location and quantity but the menu is unique enough for me to try it again."}
{"text":"Another excellent Big Burrito Eatery but this time island fusion. All the fish dishes are super."}
{"text":"Another great modern twist on ethnic and trendy.  Service is pretty good-- the waiter was nice and the manager kept coming by to check up on things. There is a bar up front where you can order a margarita and just hang out, and table service in the back. Make sure you try the plaintain appetizer-- very tasty.

What I didn't like was the dim lighting.  It works fine in most restaurants, but this place was wayy too dark.  Wish I could've seen my food better. (It was my first time trying Carribean)."}
{"text":"In my attempts to try places that serve vegan food, I found Kaya, and was extremely impressed. Their vegetable paella has thus far been one of my favorite meals to try. The service was great, the atmosphere was calming, and the food was so tasty. My drink was a little strong, I had the pomegranate mai tai, but it wasl very good."}
{"text":"Excellent Paella with chicken, shrimp, mussels, scallops and pineapple.  Excellent service and a nice bourbon list."}
{"text":"Underwhelming. We got the chicken and waffles and the waffles tasted like eggos waffles from the freezer and the chicken was wayyyyy too dry. Fish tacos were okay but fish was also too dry. Would be not returning."}
{"text":"One of top 3 sandwiches we have ever had!  Do yourself a favor and get the Cuban.... If not definitely ask for the chipotle aioli!!  Great vibe for a great Memorial Day weekend out on the patio!!"}
{"text":"I went in a group on a Saturday night. We ordered cocktails - I ordered the passionfruit margarita which was good. The service was excellent and our hostess was very helpful. We ordered three appetizers- tropical guacamole, corn beignets and jerk chicken wings. The jerk chicken wings were spicy and pretty different and good from regular wings. As suggested by our hostess, we ordered two entrees to share: shrimp and chicken paella and tempura tacos. Overall the food was awesome. To top it up, we had the chocolate lava cake for dessert! I'd definitely recommend coming here."}
{"text":"We had just arrived to Pittsburgh and looking to grab a bite and relax afterimage ride. Really nice decor and great bar. Place was really crowed but service was great. Ordered small plates. Black bean dip and tuna tacos also lobster tacos. All were delicious.  Entree ordered salmon and was very happy. Really great piece of fish. We also ordered hanger steak and fish tacos. All excellent. The paella was not that good. A little disappointed since everything else was so good. We were so full couldn't do dessert. So I would say very good meal but a bit pricey for what we ordered.  Would go back for tacos and a drink at bar."}
{"text":"Great drinks and good food. Was super packed. My favorite drink is the caipirinha. Theirs was ok. Suitable. I've had better in other words. The food was great. I honestly can't remember what we ate but obviously no complaints there."}
{"text":"I loved our meal at Kaya. The Dark and Stormy cocktail was a great way to start. The Tropical Payaya and Rainbow Salad w/ crispy tofu were ordered by several in our party, which they raved about. I had the Tempura Avacado Mani Mi Tacos and they were delicious. The molten lava cake and chocolate banana bread desserts were amazing. Would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I had high hopes for Kaya, as people seem to really like this place. On top of that, I've had some great Caribbean food in the past. Not here, however. 

If there are ever fish tacos on a menu, I order them. So I've had my fair share of tacos. The wait was long, and we began to wonder if they had forgotten about our orders. We were finally served. Even on a hungry stomach, I found the tacos to be tasteless. At $17, I was a bit shocked.

None of us were very impressed with our dishes, or the waiter, who was neglectful and curt.

There are some great restaurants in Pittsburgh, but Kaya isn't one of them."}
{"text":"It's not until the birthday dinner that I started regretting purchasing all the big burrito gift cards over the holidays. I frequent here with vegetarian friends thanks to their vegie friendly menu that actually taste really delicious, and they offer a monthly vegetarian prix fixe dinner. Unfortunately it did not last long, disappointed twice, in a row. There's this Sunday brunch in mid January that ended up with sadly dressed frisee salad taste nothing but oily albeit produce being fresh. Their infamous tofu taco came up with jalepeno sauce so powerful that the heat just burnt every other taste bud off. 
Then, we returned for a birthday dinner last Tuesday for a vegetarian friend. I am glad the food picked up their normal deliciousness, however, the service was quite a let down. Our server, took the only one drink order and just walked away not bothering asking the rest of the table. On a Tuesday night, pre-dinner time, with the dining place half full, I should've warned myself just stand clear from the service. Not surprisingly, the entire dining time, you gotta just live with it. Two out of the three appetizers came out missing core ingredients. The crab cakes, good on themselves, did not cry too hard for the mango aioli that probably left out weeping somewhere in the back of the kitchen. Mahi mahi came as almost disguised bacalao (salted dry cod), you got it, and of course fried plantain was just another redundancy from the menu. My friend got the fried avocado taco with jalepeno peppers on top while asked specifically for no heat. Again the server came up with the clever 'at least they are still within eye sight', call it professional! 
At the end of the day, it was absolutely another delicious dinner at kaya, minus the minor imperfections. I will probably still be back, but definitely will skim the menu without looking into too much details, because you know, redundancy."}
{"text":"This place Is amazing. The flavors in the food are so robust and delicious!!! I loved every bite. Conch fritters were good but the steak coconut stir fry is the absolute best!!!! Fantastic! We left them searched for the best bread pudding in Pittsburgh only to find Kaya was rated number one! Should have stayed for dessert! Love this place out of everywhere I've ever been !!!! Just wish it was more romantic and quant! Very close to other tables and hard to hear... wouldn't go if looking for quiet and romantic!"}
{"text":"I love coming to Kaya, but it has never been quite as good as the first time.

We went yesterday and they appear to either have a new chef since we were here last summer or whoever does lunch does things a big differently.

The corn and lentil beignets looked mostly like battled fritters of whole corn kernels which is not how I remember them.

I ordered two entrees because I was worried by favorite dish might disappoint and I wanted to try something new and not reget it. So, to hedge my bets, I got both my favorite Jamaican Green Curry and a new item, Seasonal Vegetable Paella. Both were good, but the JGC is better. I wasn't wowed like I was the first time, but it was still very good."}
{"text":"I came here on a Sunday night during my weekend trip to Pittsburgh. It had come recommended by a friend. It's a Caribbean and South American fusion themed restaurant.

The restaurant is aesthetically pleasing and inviting. The restaurant opens up to a seemingly well-stocked bar with recessed lighting under the counter-top illuminating bar stools resembling congo drums. The physical space is small, yet warm and intimate. Kaya would likely make a perfect happy hour and possibly date venue. Their outdoor seating is also nice on a nice warm day and allows you to take in the Strip district while enjoying your meal. Ambiance - (4/5)

The food was a mixed bag. I ordered the Jamaican Jerk wings appetizer and they were tasty. 10 wings for $9. The Jerk seasoning had a nice kick to it and it was perfectly balanced with a palate cooling cilantro cream sauce. They were juicy and well cooked. I would most definitely order these again.

However, I ordered the fish tacos based on the rave reviews on Yelp and was disappointed. The portions are large and for $17, you would expect them to be. The plate came with 3 corn tortillas with generous portions of fried tilapia and coleslaw. I am talking about Cheesecake Factory-sized portions. To be honest, the taste was also not too far off from the Cheesecake Factory's either. Not bad, but definitely not great. I think the huge mounds of coleslaw and the thousand island dressing they called \"spicy crème fraîche\" threw me off. The tilapia and corn tortillas are the true stars of the dish, but they are only masked amongst these other ingredients. Sometimes less is more and I feel like if Kaya eased up on the sauce and slaw, then the dish would benefit overall. The option of getting 2 tacos for reduced price may also be a good idea. 
Food - (3.5/5)

Their drink menu is extensive with 12 different mixed drinks and 18 beers on draft. In addition, they host a happy hour Monday through Friday from 5 to 7 pm where draft beers and cocktails are half-off. That's quite the deal and if I lived in Pittsburgh, I would probably be a regular.
Drinks - (4/5)

The service was okay. Our waitress was polite, but appeared very disinterested. Maybe it was an off day or a case of the Sundays. The drinks and appetizers came out quickly, but it took another 25-30 minutes before we got our entrées. 
Service -  (3/5)

All in all, I still had a positive dining experience at Kaya. If i'm ever back  in town, I would not hesitate to return. However, I was disappointed with the fish tacos and for this reason I will have to give them a 3.5/5 rating. 
Overall - (3.5/5)"}
{"text":"I don't like fried chicken, but Kaya Thursday night fried chicken is incredible. Flavorful, crunchy, perfectly cooked, tender meat. Sides and sauce change weekly. This is just a perk to their already beautiful menu."}
{"text":"We heard that this place can get pretty busy, so we made a reservation for a table outside.  There was only one group waiting for a table when we got there, so the reservation may not have been necessary.

We were starving after a long day in the heat.  I wanted to try everything on their menu, but we narrowed out it down to 3 dishes between the 2 of us.  We shared the 3 salads (a spicy eggplant salad, a spiced chickpea hummus and quinoa served with grilled tortillas), the jamaican jerk wings (with cilantro cream sauce) and the fish tacos.  Of the 3 dishes, the wings were my favourite.  Not only were they gigantic, they were actually moist and the sauce was very tasty.  The salads were also delicious and I enjoyed the variety.  The fish tacos were a little bland, so the cilantro cream sauce from the wings dish came in handy.

I also tried the Kaya Juice, which is a combination of mango, guava, cranberry and pineapple juices.  Great concoction!

We ordered way too much food for the 2 of us.  We struggled to finish, but the waiter wouldn't let us give up.  Luckily, Kaya is located in the Strip district and we were able to go for a long stroll after dinner."}
{"text":"Context: sat at the bar and ordered food. 

Honestly, it was okay. The food was mediocre; the drink recommendation was mediocre (bourbon, neat, fan here) for rum.  Given the rating and recommendation I guess I expected a bit more on the food. 

I had the Cuban sandwich, and a hole in the wall in southwest Miami was far, far better in comparison, so it lacked in salt and flavor I expected. 

The ambiance is mediocre, and I would bring clients to other locations other than this, and I'm from out of town. Service was \"meh\" as well.  

I gave a 3 because it was good, just not of the caliber than that everyone else places this."}
{"text":"Maybe my expectations were a little high, but I left Kaya a bit disappointed.  I'm sure the gloomy, slushy weather didn't help, but the restaurant seemed a bit too dim.  The decor was fine, the music was pretty good, and our server was very friendly.

The food was just a little mediocre.  We started with the mango & tomatillo salsa - very chunky and not bad at all, but the Kaya chips were a bit dry and some tasted a little burnt.  As my entree, I chose one of the todo en uno options - a smaller sandwich + 2 sides - with the pressed manchego and idiazabel sandwich, and the spicy slaw and the sweet potato fries as my sides.  The bread for the sandwich was a bit dry, the cheeses were a bit bland, there was a bit too much arugula and the plantain chips on the sandwich had no plantain-y flavor.  The slaw was also very dry and the only spice I tasted was pepper.  The sweet potato fries were very good though.  Boyfriend had the pressed serrano ham & manchego sandwich, which he also said was a bit bland.  We shared the creme brulee for dessert, which was not bad.  The bill came to about $36 before tip.

As we were eating dessert, we heard a couple at the next table rave about the Kaya burger, so I may have to try that next time.  I'm also curious about their vegetarian prix fixe dinners - an amuse bouche, 3 courses, and dessert for $39 with plenty of vegan options.  They also have a chocolate & rum Valentine's dinner coming up.

Overall - not very impressed the first time, but willing to come back and try something else."}
{"text":"We had lunch here on a Saturday and had a fantastic experience. The beer selection is vast and exotic. We all were able to try some new beers that didn't disappoint. But the food is the real star. All of the sandwiches we had were to die for. It was a unique culinary experience and I can't wait to return! They were also really accommodating for the 1 year old we had with us."}
{"text":"We took a chance on Kaya as a laid back place for our anniversary brunch while we explored the Strip. We were pleasantly surprised at all they had to offer! Being vegetarian, we can sometimes be limited in what is offered, although fish is something we will eat on occasion. The restaurant itself was nice with unique decor, however it felt a bit small and cramped where we were sitting. 

The menu had a lot to offer with a variety of choices. I ordered the eggs Benedict with salmon and my partner opted for the huevos rancheros. We also ordered the Kaya chips appetizer, which included potato and sweet potato chips and mango salsa. This was great and I recommend everyone try it! The eggs Benedict with smoked salmon was good, however it wasn't quite what I expected. I'm really weird about my eggs and they felt a little underdone to me, but that is just personal opinion. The flavors were amazing and if this is a dish you normally enjoy, I highly recommend. The huevos rancheros were AMAZING. I was disappointed I didn't get those as well they were so good. They even offered a vegan sausage option that was out of this world. Definitely recommend trying it even if you aren't vegan!

Overall really nice place for brunch, looking forward to trying some dinner items in the future!"}
{"text":"The food here is absolutely incredible and very reasonably priced. The shrimp po boy is absolutely to die for! My fiancé got a Bloody Mary and loved it too. We'll definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"If you're in Pittsburgh, you have to try Kaya! Their food is absolutely amazing and their menu is original. They also have a great brunch on Sunday."}
{"text":"I love Caribbean food and could not wait to try this place out.  This restaurant is in the middle of the Strip, offers an outdoor seating area, and a great unique menu with a touch of Pittsburgh flare. I recommending going for happy hour and think they have one of the best deals in the burgh-1/2 all drinks-that is draft and bottled beer, wine, mixed drinks, specialty drinks-the only exception is the pitchers of sangria. Their red sangria is delicious and always my first drink! They also have a nice list of beers.  The space is small and I recommend making reservations if going for dinner.  Some of
my favorite starters are the Kaya chips with mango salsa-this salsa is so delicious and the tofu cracklings- lettuce wraps with tofu and the Chipotle BBQ sauce adds a great flavor.    Lots of seafood on the menu but if you are not a seafood person like me I go with the pulled pork quesadillas for my entrée."}
{"text":"At Kaya, it's more like a happy happy happy hour with strong tasty drinks and delicious munchies.

I'm a big fan of the frozen mango mojito and the grapefruit basil margarita.  Soooo yummy.  During happy hour with 1/2 off drinks, it's a pretty awesome deal.

Their spicy bean dip is also pretty delicious.  The first time I came to Kaya, the chips that came with the dip were a little too hard, but the second time I came back they had the kinks worked out and the chips were perfect.

(Thanks Rachel C. for recommending this place!)"}
{"text":"My partner and I went here for our 2nd anniversary.  It was my first time, and her second.  It was a nice choice for an early dinner (6pm).  We sat outside, and since the restaurant was located on a side street in the Strip District, it was quiet and relaxing.  She ordered the calamari as an appetizer, and me the bean dip.  We ate every crumb of both!  For our entrée, we both had the avocado tacos.  Those were so-so.  I've made breaded and fried avocado before (there's might have been baked), and there's wasn't as good.  The tacos were topped with crunchy carrots and cabbage (possibly - not remembering so much now), with a drizzle of hot sauce.  Very fresh ingredients, but, eh.  Presentation was nice, but I think the dish could've used maybe a cilantro cream sauce or something to kick it up a notch.  The beer selection was pretty spot on, which I appreciated it.  We didn't get to try any of their yummy-sounding mixed drinks.  Maybe next time.  I would definitely go here again."}
{"text":"I don't know why this pops up when I type 'Jamaican Food' into the search field.  I guess because of the 'jerk' wings?  I've been here twice and and I have ordered those wings both times.  On neither of those occasions would I have called those wings jerk and on only one were the wings even good.  On that second visit, what I got were some unseasoned chicken wings fried hard as shit.  So the waitress brought us some sauce, I shudder to think what kind of jerk sauce it actually was.

I do recall having some soup that was ok, but seriously,  the classification of this place as Caribbean is a stretch.  And the lack of consistency is a problem that I've had with so many Pittsburgh spots that it doesn't seem fair to dock them for it, hence, three stars."}
{"text":"Cozy 'n' groovy little Caribbean restaurant/bar right on the strip. The decor is simple and understately elegant while the bartenders and cocktail selection, superb!

The food is Caribbean with leanings toward Jamaica, so expect menu items such as jerked chicken, sweet plantains, cornbreads, cajun style remoulades (piquant sauce made with mayo, pickles, capers, herbs, etc.), fish served with citrus gastriques (thick sauces made via a reduction of vinegar or wine, sugar & fruit, served with seafood to add a fruit flavor to the dish)  and loads of other yummy yummies!!

Aside from the food and drink, this is a great place to catchup with old friends from school or take family visiting from overseas! 5 Stars!!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh.  A cozy atmosphere and delicious food - perfect for date nights!  I got the avocado bahn mi tacos, and they are possibly the best tacos I have ever had- the tempura veggies inside are delicious.  My date loved the Cuban sandwich.  Additionally, the Kaya juice is a perfect blend of fruits - it makes you feel like you are at tropical resort! Thanks for the great time!"}
{"text":"They have some really good stuff here.  I've been here twice and both times had the Nashville Hot Chicken Sandwich.  As you can imagine this sandwich was really HOT and full of flavor.

If you like HOT and spicy food this place is for you!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite Pittsburgh spots. Great food , fantastic vegetarian options. My go to place."}
{"text":"I had a great brunch this past weekend at Kaya. I went with another friend and we used our $10 off coupons from the Big Burrito group (if you sign up for their mailing list they mail you coupons at the end of the year to use at any of their restaurants through Jan. 31st). 
We started out with the Yucatan hot bean dip which is served with Kaya's house-made chips. Always delicious and never disappoints. 
For my meal I ordered the burrito. It was a little spicier than I expected but still very good. Also a very large portion which left me feeling very satisfied at the end of our meal. 
Out of all the Big Burrito restaurants, Kaya is at the top of my list with its unique menu items and laid back atmosphere. Great place for a meal with friends/ family or for a date night out. The restaurant itself is not very big so I suggest making a reservation. 
It is also in a great location - perfect for strolling through and shopping in the Strip after brunch. 
Be sure to check it out sometime."}
{"text":"Came here for my friend's 21st birthday dinner with a group of 6 people. The atmosphere didn't seem too crowded for a prime dinner time or during happy hour time (5:30-6:30pm). But the service was pretty slow throughout our dining. It took a while for our food to get ordered as well as be brought to us. Also we brought a cake to eat there after the dinner portion and asked if they could store it for us in their kitchen so we assumed that it'd be refrigerated at least - but when the cake was brought out, it was lukewarm and definitely was not refrigerated. I thought it was a basic rule to know that something like this should be refrigerated but was disappointed that it wasn't. Also we mentioned it was our friend's birthday, but there was nothing in particular that was done for her birthday? Seemed kind of like there wasn't anything special that Kaya does for birthdays, for example singing happy birthday or having some of the workers gather to sing? Also the person refilling the water came too frequently that it was almost disturbing our dinner. And lastly, when we got our checks, they gave it to us with the customer copy on top when the merchant copy should be on top. Maybe these are petty things I'm reviewing about but I think these are also basic restaurant manners. I would give the service a 3/5. 

We shared the Jerked Pork & Plantain Nachos appetizer. The plantain chips were really good but I would say that the flavors were not consistent throughout. For my dinner entree I ordered the flank steak cemita, which was a sandwich with sliced pieces of steak, romaine lettuce, avocado, tomato, cilantro, pickled red onion, Oaxaca cheese, black bean and chipotle aioli. I got a side of sweet potato fries to go with that. The cemita was actually very good. All the flavors blended very well together. I didn't feel that it was seasoned too salty or too bland. Overall was very pleased with my entree order. I would give the food a 4/5. 

Not sure if I would come here again any time soon just because it is more of a high-end restaurant that college students would not be able to afford very often."}
{"text":"Great Caribbean food here! We got the rainbow salad, fish taco and jasmine chicken wings. The food here were tasty though I am not sure if they were authentic Caribbean."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to come here for months, and finally went tonight for a friend's birthday. It did not disappoint. Highlights: A festive hip vibe without being over-the-top; happy hour drink deals (half price on all drinks); very tasty guacamole; and huge portions of delicious and unique-tasting food. I had the Jamaican green curry with shrimp, and can't wait to eat the leftovers for lunch tomorrow. My meal was a bit pricey ($21), but given that it really was two FULL portions (three more moderate portions), I feel like I got my money's worth. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Had to wait 30 more minutes for the phoned in pick up order after I arrived at the restaurant 20 minutes after my call. Unacceptable for a burger and a salad."}
{"text":"My first visit to Kaya was amazing! I definitely recommend this place if you're ever in the strip. Both the service and food/drinks were on point."}
{"text":"At the top of my favorites in Pittsburgh.  Everything I have tried is excellent, Prepared well, seasoned well. Favorites would be the Jamaican jerked wings and Cuban sandwich.  Best I have ever had.  Doesn't seat a lot of people, so expect wait at mealtimes. Hosted a group for us and had the table laid out with all types of appetizers; humus, salsas, etc."}
{"text":"This was our first stop on after arriving in Pittsburgh and it was a good choice. Good service, vibe & ambiance, and food. 

We had conch fritters a a starter, very flavorful. For drinks we had the bear trap and poco picante, both good. 

We ordered the Pork quesadilla and Nashville hot chicken sandwich, with waffle fries and the petite salad. Everything was good. 

I was apprehensive about this place but the food turned out to be good! The fritters were done so well, great flavor and I'd recommend those."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Kaya twice both times during happy hour. Happy hour happens Monday thru Friday 4:30-6:30pm, and its half off all single-serve drinks. The first time I stuck with a glass of wine which was wonderful. This most recent time, I got a glass of Pinot Noir and the Tiki #7 which was a fruit blend; it was delicious! Also, I tried the tropical guacamole which I'm not a fan of only because I don't like mango. However, I got the fried chicken sandwich with waffle fries and found it to be very good. While I wish I had more flavor and less spice in the chicken, it was still super crispy and tasty. The waffle fries were amazing especially with the cucumber cream sauce. I highly recommend the fried chicken in whatever fashion you get it. 

The vibe of this place is really chill with dimmed lights after 5pm. Tables and bar are parallel to one another. Oh, and the napkins/towelettes in the bathrooms are amazing! They're thick and super soft. Yea, I couldn't leave them out of this review."}
{"text":"This place is sooo good! I don't really come down to this part of town a lot but I was meeting a friend for lunch and this is what he recommended! The atmosphere is so cool and relaxed here! They had a pretty large drinks menu and I found a beer that I liked! I ordered the crispy fish tacos (which was always recommended from my friend) and I'm so glad I did! I never order fish when I go out to eat, but it was a Friday in Lent, so I figured I'd go for it. It was topped with a cabbage slaw, avocado, and this creamy sauce that had the perfect amount of spice. It also came with a side salad that I could have substituted with fries. I will definitely come back here and try something else off of the menu!"}
{"text":"I've been to this place a few times since I've lived in Pittsburgh and I've always had a pretty good experience. It's located in one of the coolest streets in the Strict District and decorated really nicely with a lot of potential.  In my opinion, I think that the food (and drink) items are overpriced for the portions and quality, but it is a good place to go for a happy hour. I forget what the exact deal is, but I think that both drinks and appetizers are fairly cheap. To be honest, I wouldn't recommend a cocktails and sit-down meal here, but visit to enjoy the happy hour deals."}
{"text":"I've gone to Kaya a few times, once with family, once with a friend and once with a terrible excuse of a boyfriend who tried to break up with me over dinner.

Overall, the food is pretty great. The guacamole has mango in it which gives a really interesting taste. The ambiance is awesome, food is great and the wait staff is always very friendly. Would highly recommend for any type of gathering - family, friends, or break ups over guac."}
{"text":"Three words: Fried Chicken Thursdays.  I would go to Kaya any day of the week, as the entire menu is great, but it's the divinely battered and fried pieces of bird that appear every Thursday (and only on Thursdays) that are usually the reason for me travelling to the Strip.  The batter is perfectly seasoned and always crispy.  The meat is juicy and tender. Paired with Reyna's tortillas and the side and sauce of the week, the fried chicken never disappoints.  I'm also a huge fan of the conch fritters and the black bean dip.  While it is chicken that usually draws me to Kaya, vegetarians have plenty of excellent options.  This was my favorite place in the city when I was a vegetarian.

The cocktails are also good and the bar is a great place to sit.  I've been a fan of every bartender I've ever had at Kaya.  Absolutely worth a visit for anyone with any palette.  If you go on Thursdays or a weekend, be sure to make a reservation."}
{"text":"Wow! This place is fabulous. I was in Pittsburgh for a week and an old school friend recommended this spot. This was by far the best meal we experienced. Everything we had was so tasty, so many great flavors. Bland is definitely not in the vocabulary of this place. I had the Paella, my daughter had a Cuban sandwich, her friend had the Jerk pulled pork Quesadilla. Everything was so tasty. The pork was pretty spicy though, but so good we kept eating it. The Paella is highly recommended and could be shared for two. If I were to go to Pittsburgh again, this would be my first stop."}
{"text":"Kaya is one of those places that I've always wanted to try, yet every time I tried to go, it would be super packed and I'd have to walk right back out. Finally after walking in again for the zillionth time on a Sunday afternoon, the bar was empty! 

The hubby ordered the Cuban and I, of course, got the Chicken and Waffle. I am a sucker for chicken and waffles; it's hard for me to ever get anything else when there's chicken and waffles on the menu. So the food tasted exactly as I had imagined their food to taste like: rich, bold, flavorful, and oh so yummy. However, I felt the food was a bit too rich after a while. Halfway through the meal, it left me craving something fresh. Despite this, I absolutely loved Kaya's take on the chicken and waffle. The chicken had a spicy batter and the dish was topped with green onions and bacon, which added a little extra punch of flavor and differing textures to add some contrast to the dish. The Cuban was a simple sandwich, but it was done right. The bread was toasted to the perfect level of crispiness.

With brunch being this good, I am looking forward to coming back and trying out dinner!"}
{"text":"Particularly bad food in a neighborhood that sells good food. Weird unseasoned fish tacos and bitter plaintain chips. Yuck. I would not return."}
{"text":"Kaya is a good restaurant for authentic Caribbean food. I've had their brunch and regular dinner menu and nothing I've had has been mediocre. Highly suggest getting the black bean dip or jerk wings as an appetizer. Extensive drink menu. My only gripe with this place is the employees are a little less than friendly. On several occasions I've encountered moody bartenders and hosts who seem less than happy to see someone walking through the door."}
{"text":"What a wonderful restaurant for daring vegetarians. Cheesecake made from squash, who would have thunk it. Awesome! Ate here 3 times during a 5 day visit to Pittsburgh. Nuff said."}
{"text":"I happen to enjoy Kaya quite a bit.  The lunch is always good. The dinner is always good.  The drinks are superb.  It's a little pricey for what it is but if I have a few bucks to burn I don't mind.
The waiters and waitresses are always helpful and kind.  There used to be a GREAT bartender there named Davin/David but he's moved to greener pastures I believe.  
It's got a great spot in the strip, parking is usually pretty easy to find, and they have some lovely outdoor seats. 
Good stop for happy hour as well.  Who doesn't want a cool refreshing drink after a long day?"}
{"text":"Chas is a great waiter, ask for him! I went to kaya for dinner and it was absolutely great! The salmon was awesome as was the wings! I will definitely come back over and over. The drinks are really great as well, strong and yummy !!"}
{"text":"Exceptional experience.  We were visiting Pittsburgh for the first time and were in the mood for ethnic food.  We found Kaya on Yelp and our hotel concierge raved about it when we mentioned where we planned to dine.  Loved it so much the first night that we immediately booked brunch reservations for 2 days later.  Over the course of the 2 meals we had the Rainbow Salad, Flank Steak Stir Fry, veggie omelet, chilaquiles, and a dark and stormy cocktail.  All tasted extremely fresh and were exquisitely prepared.  Our servers Adrienne and Michael we're personable, knowledgeable, and skilled.  Great atmosphere.  Will come back again next time we visit the city."}
{"text":"I can't count the number of times I've been to Kaya, and it has never once disappointed. It has an eclectic and fun atmosphere, but isn't too loud to be able to have conversation with dining companions. The owner is always there and likes to walk around and make sure everyone is doing well. They have wonderful drinks and amazing food. I always get the Yucatan Hot Bean Dip to start, which comes with some lovely chips made in-house from yuca (I believe it's yuca but it might be another root vegetable). We recently discovered they have a fantastic Vegetarian Prie Fixe dinner the third Wednesday of each month and though it's on the pricier side (something like $40/person without wine pairings), it is scrumptious and we go every month. I couldn't recommend Kaya more highly and will certainly be headed there again soon!"}
{"text":"Kaya is my favorite lunch and dinner spot in the Strip district. I love the Caribbean vibe in the place. My favorite items to get on the menu are the fish tacos and sweet potato fries. The mojitos are really good, too."}
{"text":"Great selection of food, considering Pittsburgh doesn't have much of a Caribbean food selection. I had the chips and guac, and the plantain nachos. A lot of cilantro, but the pulled pork and plantain chips were a great combination. The drinks are very good, a little on the pricier side, but I had them during happy hour. Would probably go back."}
{"text":"Cool looking place, fun music. Nice vibes. Hmm... weird customer service though? I'll get back to that later. Anyways..

Ordered the LOCO MOCO ($11) off of their July Featured Island Cuisine (Hawaii), which I think might've been a mistake. My friends thought it was good but I thought it tasted way too peppery?! It contained pineapples, hamburger steak, coconut rice, onion gravy, scallions, Fresnos, and cilantro. If you've had bibimbap before, it was basically a Hawaiian bibimbap.  But it was just a blend of flavors that just didn't taste THAT good together. For my drink, I ordered their WHITE SANGRIA, it was alright, maybe should have tried their regular sangria instead.
Oh yeah, do not get their TAKO POKE bowl, holy moly that thing was small and I felt bad for my friend who got it, especially for $14.

Customer service. Slow. But then they would fill the waters too often, and when they brought the food to us, the way the servers talked to each other was so.. weird?? They gave each other some attitude and I felt a little uncomfortable sitting there. It was also my birthday and they didn't refrigerate the cake my friends brought. (NO CAKE FEE if you were wondering! Not sure if you wanna bring your cake though, hopefully it doesn't melt..) When we got our checks, the customer copy was on top when we were paying (what?). Well. At least they lit the candle we provided for our room-temp cake, lol. 

I read an old review where it said they used to charge if you wanted to make a reservation, which wasn't true in our case so don't worry about that.

For a big Burrito Restaurant Group place, I'm pretty disappointed. Not really around my price point for a college student. I signed up for their emails awhile ago but didn't get a free meal to use that day but oh well. Someone would have to really try to convince me to come here again."}
{"text":"Simply amazing.   The skirt steak is just perfect.  Two in our party ordered medium well.  I thought no way, it's going to come out dry and tough.  Wrong!!!  They pulled it off almost as tender and juicy as my med rare.  The chimichuri  that came with was really tasty.  I personally didn't like the coconut dumplings but everyone else did.  Thanks for taking me back once again with a perfect skirt steak."}
{"text":"Just a quick review on Kaya. I met there with my book group (we had made a reservation in advance) and we were a group of about 12. Happy hour beer prices were great, and my waitress even stopped by to ask if I wanted another drink before happy hour was over.   I always love that!  The interior is beautiful as well.I ended up getting the Avocado and Tomato Torta, which was excellent. My only complaint about it (& others complained about this with their burgers) was that the thing was just too big to pick up and take a bite out of. Trying to cut it and eat it was kind of difficult too. They also had some really awesome sweet potato fries. Visiting the website I found this:
 \"On the third Wednesday of each month, Kaya presents a seasonal vegetarian prix fixe dinner. The menus emphasize flavor and variety, presenting familiar foods in exciting ways, and making exotic foods delightfully accessible. Menu items are also available a la carte.\"
Because of that, I took this from a 4 star to a 5 star review because as a vegetarian, this is hugely appealing to me and makes me want to go there again!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for dinner before going to a show at Altar Bar. We had been trying to find somewhere good in the Strip that was open on Mondays. We decided on Kaya after finding out about their great happy hour. And oh my is it great! All single serve alcoholic beverages are half off from 4:30-6:30. That includes cocktails and even spirits. My husband got an $18 glass or Blanton's for $9! I had (multiple) grapefruit basil margaritas. I loved it! 

Our server was wonderful. She had lots of food and drink suggestions. I ordered the fish tacos after she mentioned they were their most popular menu item. My husband had the steak sandwich...I can't remember the name of it but he loved it. The fish tacos were the best fish tacos I've had. The sauce and slaw on them are so flavorful. I was full after eating two but ate all three because they were delicious.

If you're looking to have a nice night out I recommend coming here! Even if you're just looking for a good happy hour, the drinks are priced so well you can definitely get a small plate or two. We will certainly be back soon."}
{"text":"We've had the good fortune of eating 5 star meals around the world. The Kamayan dinner at Kaya was one of them. This was our second visit to Kaya in 2 years, though the first for the Kamayan dinner Loved it!"}
{"text":"Wow. Yum. One of the better meals I have had in the long time! 

I went here for dinner on a monday night and the place was still lively! I actually ran into some friends.  So apparently I really like Caribbean food which is a nice surprise! This isn't a huge stretch given I love zesty seafood. 

We started with the scallops.  The portion was small (only two) but the eggplant \"salad\" underneath was delish. I had the tuna which was the high point! Sometimes I can get overwhelmed with all of the sauces, rubs, creams but this dish did it right! Tuna, black beans, potato fitters... yum! 

Pros: lively ambiance, delicious food, interesting menu, strong dark n stormy's, attentive service. 

Cons: Might be become a bit pricey if you are drinking and eating. 

Overall: Will definately be back! I have heard great things about their happy hour!"}
{"text":"I've been to Kaya twice, and my first experience was definitely better than the second - however the food both times was INCREDIBLE. The hostess the second time was rude and wouldn't really speak to us, but our server was very kind and helpful. The happy hour is fabulous (almost all drinks half off!) and the food is so good. Amazing sweet potato fries and the chorizo queso app is a must. So many menu items I want to try, so I'll definitely be back! Get there early, it gets packed in the evening."}
{"text":"I'm not really sure how I feel about Kaya. The food was good, but the service was not great. Our table was WAY wobbly, but the drinks were amazing (and they gave us a redo when the table wobbled too hard and spilled ours). The decor was nice, but the place is way too cramped (I elbowed the lady next to me at least twice). 

Food:
Conch hush puppies: I have had better in Florida, but not around here... They were ok, but a little too fried and oily

Hot bean dip- this is always amazing

field green salad- Meh

Tuna taco- ok, not bad really, but they weren't great"}
{"text":"I wish there were half stars because I would really give them a 3.5. Went here for dinner yesterday. We got the chorizo queso fundido dip for an app. It was really good. Our only complaint was it then took a good 40 min for our entree to come after that. A lot of people around us that came in well after us had received their entrees before us. Not sure what was going on because we didn't order intense entrees. My husband got the green curry vegetables and I ordered the fish tacos. Both were good. No complaints besides the fact that it took forever to get our entree."}
{"text":"Yum, yum, yum, YUM... What more is there to say?!? Last review, we only had appetizers, and my review is updated to cover entrees.

I had the Caribbean Flank Steak Stir Fry, and it was pretty much fabulous. The coconut rice was delicious. Seriously, delicious. The bigger pieces of steak were cooked to about medium rare and were a delight! The rest of the steak was good too, but not as amazing as the bigger pieces. It wasn't as spicy as they said it may be, and I added hot sauce, as I love spicy food. It was a toss up between Pickapeppa Sauce and Busha Brown's Pukka Sauce to put on the Stir Fry. The former was a more smoky chipotle sauce and the latter was a spicy sauce with good flavor, both tasty on the Flank Steak Stir Fry. My husband had the Jerked Pulled Pork Quesadillas with waffle fries as a side. He thought the fries were amazing and the quesadillas were good, not amazing. I would agree that the waffle fries were pretty much amazing! Crunchy and delicious. 

I thought overall it was pretty delicious!"}
{"text":"We went for the vegetarian night price fixe. Every course was delicious, from the watermelon gazpacho to the grilled kale and so on. My only complaint was that we asked for them to alter the dessert, which was a choice between chocolate brownie a la mode and a chocolate-lined taco, and they just brought us a scoop of vanilla and a scoop of raspberry on a plate. For that kind of money, I think they could've made more effort, as it was two desserts (my husband and me) so why one plate? And couldn't there have been a substitution? Plus our Mon Aimee chocolate, which was also part of the price fixe dinner, was a tiny chunk. I think the kitchen must've gotten confused and thought they were serving one person. That was my only sore point. If they had been more accommodating and hospitable about the desserts, I would've given them more stars. I still recommended Kaya to friends who visited Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"In the past, I've had inconsistent service at Kaya. But in the past few months I was willing to try again and things have been really solid! We were able to get a table tonight despite not having reservations and the place being packed for happy hour, because they were kind enough to squeeze us in. The food, meanwhile, has always been great. The tomato torta this time of year is by far my favorite light dinner - generous slices of heirloom tomato with two big zucchini and goat cheese pancakes? Melt in your mouth summertime goodness."}
{"text":"This restaurant has outdoor seating and we sat outside. To start we ordered the tuna tartare which was ok, it could use some seasoning. I had the roast chicken with rice, beans, avocado and tomato salad. It was good but it was nothing special, since it wasn't as flavorful as I thought it would be."}
{"text":"I went here to partake in their Fried Chicken Thursday. You get an entire half a chicken fried with old school pasta salad, a vinegary coleslaw and a stack of fresh tortilla straight from Reyna's Foods down the block.
We started off with the Yucatan Bean Dip appetizer. If you've ever had the bean dip at Mad Mex you'll recognize it. It's beany, slightly salty and a little spicy. Very flavorful.

I have to say, the chicken is a little steep at 15 dollars a plate but I thought it was amazing. The chicken was delicious and browned nicely and the ranch-style dip they give you is a really good with accompaniment. I love being able to pick apart the chicken and put it in the tortilla and make myself a little taco. I'm a huge fan of Mexican food so blending southern cuisine with the containment system of a Mexican tortilla is great.
I hate coleslaw, especially mayo-based. If it is a vinegar based slaw I tend to like it a wee bit more. The coleslaw I had at Kaya was so good I ate all of it. It had little bits of pepper in it, a huge vinegary kick and a spiciness that I think came from ginger.

The pasta salad was like what your grandma would make. The chef at Kaya really must like the sourness of vinegar, however, because it's really evident in this dish as well. Luckily, I love that in food. I could see a lot of people being overwhelmed by it.

The only complaint was when my girlfriend ordered a Mojito. When it came I took a sip and thought it was pretty bad. It mostly tasted like alcohol and the ripped mint floating inside overwhelmed it to the point where you couldn't taste the mint anymore so much as the leafy flavor underneath. I did not care for it at all.

I definitely want to check out what Kaya has on their actual menu. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Oh Kaya.  Your drinks are good, the food looks ok, but the atmosphere just doesn't quite feel right.  We were there for Happy Hour and you could tell something wasn't quite right.  The place felt overstaffed and to a certain point you could cut the tension between the employees with a spoon.

I had the Atwater Java Vanilla Porter and it was rather delicious, maybe if anything there was almost too much smoothness.  I then tried the Rum Runner which didn't really have all the flavors listed on the menu.  Their Dark & Stormy was the best drink out of the three.

I plan on returning, I want to sit down at a table and try the food.  But for Happy Hour ... I'll check out a different locale."}
{"text":"This place was seriously one of the best meals I have ever had.  My major complaint is that even though we did have a reservation, we still ended up waiting for almost half an hour for our table to be ready for us.  We waited at the bar and had a couple mojitos and it was just fine. 

Once seated, though I was not sure where to go with the menu, our server was incredibly helpful.  Honestly, our waitress was so nice, and definitely part of what made my experience at Kaya so great.  She wholeheartedly recommended the paella, and I wholeheartedly accepted her recommendation.  This dish is a mix of pretty much everything but it is SO GOOD, and the portion is HUGE.  I was a bit embarrassed that when I finished, it barely looked like I made a dent in the dish, and unfortunately I was unable to take the leftovers with me, but I left as a very satisfied customer."}
{"text":"Note to readers: this review is of the Sunday Brunch menu and cocktails, the bartender Joe who I want to tell stuff, and the conch hushpuppies in particular.  

Oh, brunch.  That meal of the week where you can justify literally drinking vodka for breakfast.  So Hemingway.  While we're on the subject, Kaya has different vodka infusion options for your bloody mary pleasures.  They have a cucumber vodka, a cilantro vodka, a red pepper vodka and a......jalepeno one?  Don't quote me on that I just forget the last one.  I asked for half cucumber and half cilantro and then ended up drinking Ned's red pepper one because I liked his better and he conveniently thought the same about mine.  

The conch hush puppies are really really good.  I love appetizers (especially at 11 in the morning) that make you go \"oooooooo\" (shudder spicy shudder) \"mmmmm\".  If you can wrap your head around that.  They give you some slivered onions and peppers on the side with a lime.  I made a little salsa on my plate and ate it all together and it was pretty wonderful.  The pork eggs benedict were just a touch too sweet for me and lacking in salt but that's more of a personal problem.  Ned's huevos rancheros were so, so good but then he ruined it with chorizo.  Blegh!  

I'm going to have to come back for another meal to see about the rest of the menu and then we'll talk about that missing star.  

Service was impeccable and WHILE we're on the subject, Joe, who mostly took care of us (though Nate did too and he also did a great job) is going to San Francisco tomorrow (Thursday) and I wanted to tell him in writing to A) check out my Best of California list of reviews here on yelp because they're all pretty spot on (as usual) and B) the place I told you to go to which you may have already been to and may not go to and I don't care if you do but in case you forgot it's called Bi-Rite Creamery on 18th by Dolores Park and get the salted caramel ice cream and, if you're feeling bold, get one of their sundaes."}
{"text":"The food was great but our server (Justine) was really rude.  Problem seemed to start when friends questioned whether the tap for the diet coke was working properly.  Didn't ruin the meal but we weren't happy."}
{"text":"Kaya is Caribbean food, not Mediterranean. 

I have been to Kaya maybe a dozen or so times. Use to be a great place for some fish or tofu tacos but now I'm not so sure. 

Two visits ago when we ate outside our meal was subpar. We chalked it up to how busy they were and ignored it. Today my wife and I ate at Kaya and my meal was horrible. I got tofu tacos and my wife had tempura avocado tacos. She really liked her meal and it came out hot. Mine was cold, the tofu batter flavorless (use to have seasoning to it) and the guacamole they buried under everything was a brown sludge. The side salad that came with it had mushy runny lettuce hidden under good lettuce. 

This is similar to how our last meal was there  6 months ago. I'm thru with Kaya. It's beyond forgivable to serve that bad of lettuce and bad guac. I can let the cold tofu slide when there are other cold stuff on it. 

Not to mention our server was less than pleasant. We've had her before and she was the same then too. 

All of this was on a Friday at 2:00 pm for a late lunch. The place had one other table, nobody else. 

Why I give it two stars? My wife enjoyed her meal and the booze was good. 

Hopefully this isn't indicative of the other Big Burrito chains."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  We came in a group of four, had reservations and were quickly seated.   We ordered four appetizers and four entrees.  Each and every dish was well made and was amazing.  My favorite was the jerk chicken, ribs, and the burger.

Atmosphere is nice. It was mainly 20-30ish crowd here.  Overall, the food was good and I am definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Went on a double date with friends. I will start with the bad. It took over 45 minuets for our meals to come from when we ordered (we ordered them after our appetizers). But it took no time for our appetizers and drinks to come. But with that said out waitress was great. Letting us know that the kitchen was backed up and when to expect the food etc. also when we got the food it was fantastic. I got the crocodile appetizer and for my meal the Cuban  sandwich. All very good. We also shared the hot bean dip and everyone else enjoyed their meals. I would of given this place a lower score if they food had not been so good when it did come out. Also since the weather was nice it was a great night to sit outside. Only issue was the bad river/shit smell that blew past every now and then but it did not ruin the experience."}
{"text":"It's taken me quite a while to eat at Kaya, but between a group of friends' invitation to eat here and a $10 off coupon I had to stop in and give the place a try this week. Overall I was definitely not disappointed.

I came in around 7:00 for dinner, which meant I missed their 4:30 - 6:30 happy hour. A minor disappointment on my part but not their fault by any means. Either because it was a Tuesday or because the happy hour was over the place wasn't super full when I came in; it was, however, still kind of noisy, and it was probably not the best place I could have gone with a large group of folks that wanted to talk. But we did just fine and managed to make ourselves heard without hurting our throats from yelling during the evening, so at least the noise levels weren't super bad. The restaurant also wasn't brightly lit but it was still bright enough for me to read my menus quite easily (and to enjoy the colorful murals, masks and other decorations in the place). The menu itself was so fun to read - the meals all looked flavorful and the drinks were definitely unique, so everything stood out to me. It was really hard to pick what I wanted. 

I ended up ordering a Pomegranate Mai Tai and the fish tacos. Neither disappointed. The drink was simply delicious - it was made with Amrut Old Port rum, Myer's Dark rum, pomegranate liqueur, amaretto, and lime. The result was a tasty drink that was sweet, but not too sweet, with a twist. There just aren't enough words for how much I liked this drink - I can only say that my friends commented that I started beaming after my first sip! 
 
And the fish tacos? Just excellent x3! There was definitely a moderate level of spiciness but I didn't think it was too much, so long as I paused to sip on my water and Mai Tai every couple bites. They were also crispy but not overcooked, so they had the right amount of crunch but also weren't overly dry (a problem I've found with other fish tacos in the past). Best of all there were plenty of toppings and sauces to top off the fish - avocado, cabbage slaw, a spicy sauce and cilantro - and as a result I got to enjoy a full taco featuring mouthfuls of flavor every time I took a bite.

After all that, I reeeeally wanted to have dessert - I just knew that it would be absolutely delicious, too (and it was! it was moist and yummy and OMG I'm running out of descriptive words to use) - but just didn't have the room to eat it there. So I asked if they could packed up a chocolate chip banana bread pudding for me to take home. They could! At that point I thought my night was more or less complete. Unfortunately dessert was about the point we saw a couple problems service-wise; our waitress actually put in the wrong dessert order for one person, which held us up a bit; there was also a major slowdown in service around that point, as our waitress stopped checking on the table so frequently. As a result it took 25 minutes to get our checks. Fortunately I had nowhere important to be on a Tuesday night, but I'd definitely be wary of eating here in a time crunch after that.

Well, service slowdown or not I would SO come back for another meal or just for a drink sometime; the dining and drink options here are worth any potential future hassle in my opinion, and I'm hopeful that what I experienced near the end of my night was just a fluke. Just a final word of advice for new Kaya diners: the spiciness in certain dishes can be a bit much if you're not a fan of spice, so it doesn't hurt to ask about this before you order any meals here. Personally, I'm not the biggest fan of spicy foods and I thought my meal was DELICIOUS, so I still recommend them."}
{"text":"Made reservations for 7pm on a Saturday evening but found myself a bit hungrier at an earlier time and walked in to a fairly empty restaurant at 6:30pm to bump my reservation up.  They gladly seated my boyfriend and I and promptly served us. 

This is exactly the kind of place a San Francisco raised and Los Angeles based Yelper is looking for when they're visiting Pittsburgh! It's Caribbean food set in what i believe is the cultural district of Pittsburgh.  The atmosphere is cool, sexy, fun, and semi romantic.  There's a full bar, dim lights, and a bunch of island like paintings on the wall, and some other unique decorations.

Started off with the JAMAICAN JERK WINGS. Woo! This is spicyyyy. The range of spices coasting the wings somehow burst in your mouth as fast as the heat does.  8 wings come plated on a cilantro cream dip which i assume is supposed to cool your mouth a bit and balance the power of the spices but it didn't do as good of a trick as my 2 glasses of iced water did to fight the burn. Good stuff though!

We split the BEEF BARBACOA TACOS and although we didn't ask them to, they actually split the dish for us assuming we were sharing. These are very large tacos on a flour tortilla.  I didn't find anything special about them. A bit bland to me. They were around $17 so I'd pass on this next time and try something else.

All desserts are $6.50.  We ordered the trio of sorbets to cleanse our palates.  I was taken by the unusual variety of sorbets but  was sad to hear they ran out of the nectarine sorbet. Instead we had the:
CARROT LIME SORBET - wow. this was revolting.
MANGO CARDAMON - interesting.. not bad, but not my fav.
DULCE DE LECHE ICE CREAM - fantastic!
All sorbets/ice cream scoops come on top of a mini tart :)

Our bill came up to around $50 (including a pint of Ocktoberfest beer) for 2 people. Will come again next time i'm in the area!! Thanks Pittsburgh Yelpers for leading me to a great restaurant! 4 stars for a great appealing and different menu, the alcohol, atmosphere, and the service."}
{"text":"There's a reason that Kaya has been around for so long. It's just such a good restaurant. Headed here today with a group from work and everyone had different requirements and restrictions. Everything on the menu was thoughtfully conceived and executed so we all were able to enjoy our meal. This is by far one of the best restaurants in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"We were in town from Jamaica and decided to try Kaya. Music had a reggae flava with wonderful ambiance and scenery! Sampled 3 apps and the fish tacos entree. The salmon-crab cakes were fresh and delish along with the 3 green salad. The calamari was just ok as the ringlets were small and didn't taste the freshest.
The fish tacos (talapia) were served with soft tortillas and asked for my fish grilled and was filling and tasty.
Service was great, mildy pricy but rewarding. The only negative was the red sangria which wantde to be a real tasty drink but tasted more like enhanced kool-aid! :')
Overall a positive experience and will be back."}
{"text":"This food is definitely good.  But not spectacular.  We go the bean dip for an appetizer.  It very tasty and had a little spicy kick to it.  It's weird it came with regular chips and not tortilla chips, but was still tasty.  My friend got the conch chowder.  He really liked it a lot.  The main dishes we got were a slight disappointment.  The cuban was really bland and not tasty at all.  The chipotle aioli wasn't that great and didn't really help make the sandwich taste much better.  My friend was super excited to try paella for the first time, but he wasn't really excited by the taste of it.  It was good, but not great.  It seems the appetizers and soups are a little better.  I will be back, but I may just stick to the starters."}
{"text":"The food is great!!! We had the Ahi tuna poke and the cuban sandwich! We cant wait to go back and try other things! 

The dishes were very well served, nice presentation and tasted great!"}
{"text":"Skirt steak, pulled pork quesadillas, sweet potato fries, pisco sour, and white sangria... A must if you're in the strip district and want to go into an amazing Caribbean experience... Great music and nice service!"}
{"text":"Got a Big Burrito gift card for Christmas so decided to try this place out. I'm really glad that we did! The food was amazing! We got the Kaya burger and the fish tacos..and I would highly recommend both. Our server was friendly and attentive and the manager stopped by to see how everything was as well. Overall great experience! We'll definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"I really liked this place. My husband and I went there on New Year's Eve, so it was a little crazy for that reason. The food was great though and pretty unique. The only problem I had was that the server hassled me about using a coupon that was completely valid, but her manager eventually signed off on it. I would definitely go back (preferably not on a holiday). The Big Burrito restaurant group always seems to be a safe bet, and this place exceeded my expectations."}
{"text":"Kaya and the entire Big Burrito Restaurant Group are just so awesome!  These folks do it right. Kaya has been around a really long time and held true to its original menu and décor.  I love their mixed drink variety and seasonality using fresh ingredients.  They have an extensive draft beer menu with a lot of rotating seasonal offerings.  Their food is simple, good, elevated casual food.  I heart their black bean appetizer (although it always gives me WICKED BAD heartburn) and their crispy fish tacos.    I tried the corn and lentil beignets with that delicious green curry sauce and was really impressed.  They were not dry as I feared and had such a deep curry flavor with a brightness from the green sauce.  

Their wait service and bartenders are always so friendly and helpful.  They know their menu inside and out and they want you to have an excellent experience each time you dine with them.  Their training is top notch. 

I really want to try their Fried Chicken Night on a Thursday.  I bet that knock that one out of the park!"}
{"text":"One of the best Mediterranean food in town. Their home made chips is one of the best deserts. They serve it with mangoes. Yummy. Heard that they change their menu very frequently."}
{"text":"I ordered the shrimp po'boy sandwich with sweet potato fries. I loved the combination of flavors-sweet pineapple with a savory creamy sauce. It was super messy-but the sauce was finger-licking worthy. The sweet potato fries were super crispy and delicious. I can't wait to come back and try some other menu options because my neighbor's Kaya burger looked to die for. 

This place is really fun and bright, and I love the vibe. It temporarily transports you to a tropical paradise, and it's a great location with plenty of street parking. I came over my lunch break, and the service was quick, but not rushed."}
{"text":"Who thought homemade bean dip with housemade chips could taste SOOO darn good??? Well, I didn't until my visit to Kaya.  As many times as I've driven past this place, I can't believe last weekend was my first visit. 

We had reservations but it seemed like we arrived at a good time before it started to get jam packed, around noon.  We were greeted at the door and arrived a little before our seating time but offered to be seated immediately and we agreed.  We ordered the wings, bean dip (I know I mentioned this already :), paella and the fish tacos.  I have NO complaints.  Quite honestly, after the bean dip (3rd mention), my favorite was the salad that came with my fish tacos...so simple with a lime based dressing. OMGee! Okay, please don't think I didn't love everything else because I did.  The fish tacos were amazingly good with perfectly cooked pieces of fish, jicama slaw and buttery pieces of fresh avocado slices.  Seriously, each bite made me feel as though I was in the caribbean somewhere.  (Maybe a bit dramatic, okay).  My friend's entree was the paella, which was good, pieces of pineapple were really juicy throughout and shrimp cooked perfectly...although it was the least favorite for me because my husband's brother has me spoiled by the paella he makes on the grille :)  

All said and done, Kaya did not disappoint and actually exceeded my expectations.  This restaurant is owned by Big Burrito Group and I've been very happy with all of their restaurants I've tried.

Can't wait to visit Kaya again.  My next trip will be on a Thursday.  I hear the chicken is to die for...

YUM!"}
{"text":"Made reservations for two on a gloomy Sunday night in Pittsburgh. After a through review of the menu and a few questions for our server we settled on the corn and conch chowder, ribs, soft shell crab bahn mi, and the mahi mahi satay. 

The chowder was delicious full of conch and corn nice spice level and mildly sweet. The ribs were fall off the bone tender, we didn't need any utensils to eat them. The Mahi mahi was grilled me had a mild peanut sauce which was a nice twist on traditional satay. The star of the meal was the soft shell crab bahn mi sandwich, the crab was fried but not heavily battered, the bread was lightly toasted and flaky, the veggies were thinly shredded and the chicken liver mouse was a nice touch.

We finished the meal with the chocolate banana bread pudding, the chocolate didn't over power the banana, nice flavor and texture.

Great experience, our server, Tori, was pleasant, attentive and thoroughly explained the menu. The drinks are good as well."}
{"text":"I went to Kaya hoping to have a nice relaxed evening. The blue mussels were bland, the black bean dip was tasteless (until our efforts, see below), and the tofu cracklins were soft and soggy.

Ah, but I must say that the waitstaff did their best. Unfortunately they can't make up for the failings of the kitchen.  After getting the tasteless black bean dip, we were determined to have something edible, as it was too late to head elsewhere. So we gave the waitress our requests, and she soon returned with chopped cilantro, chopped onion, salt, pepper, and chopped hot pepper. After mixing those in the appropriate amounts, we finally had something edible.... though I'm giving the restaurant no points for the work we did.

... a shame too, because we've visited before and the food was quite enjoyable."}
{"text":"I stopped in for a bite after a wine tasting event. The place was packed for a Thursday night. I enjoyed the ambiance. The food was OK. I has the fried chicken Thursday special and the portion was huge. I felt it was very good. My date had the seviche. She was not impressed. Very small portion and lacked flavor."}
{"text":"I should not have visited this place after moving from Miami - obviously I noticed the difference between the \"caribbean\" taste.  Also, the mix drinks were a little weak.  Again...could be because I moved to PGH and know the difference."}
{"text":"Came here during Saturday night from Anthrocon, they had a 45 min wait inside but no wait for outside seating. Our server was a goofy, genuine guy that took our orders and made us laugh. They had an okay beer selection, along with some interesting cocktails ( with mezcal!). We put in our drink orders as well as food orders at the same time. Drinks came out soon, as well as a pitcher of water for our table of four. 

As for our food, we'd ordered the spicy ahi Tina poke, the salmon poke, the loco moco, and the Rueben sandwich. All of these things took almost 50 minutes to come out to our table. Two of those are raw fish bowls, and the others didn't seem that hard. I don't know what was going on there.  Our server apologized for the kitchen delay. 

The spicy ahi tuna poke was very good. I liked it better than the salmon poke, which had nuts in it. The loco moco was really good too. Their waffle fries seem to have an interestingly sweet, light seasoning to them."}
{"text":"I happened to stumble upon this place on the best night that I could: Thursday fried chicken night. I got the chicken \"Nashville\" hot. It has a great and welcoming bar with lots of local brews on tap. The food was excellent, and parking was ample for a Thursday night."}
{"text":"Good food, but extremely tight restaurant with nowhere to wait for pick up and extremely slow pick up service and a little pricey for what you get"}
{"text":"Kaya has now become one of my favorite places in Pittsburgh for happy hour--almost all of their excellent cocktails (and beers and wine) are half price from 5-7 M-F. A serious good deal."}
{"text":"Black bean dip!

The cocktails! ( Cucumber / gin drink called the Cool Me Down, what a savior)

Salmon Salad!

Beignets!

and Fish Tacos!

Went on a friend of a friend's recommendation and have been back multiple times since. Kinda loud / crowded inside, so would be fun with a group."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.

\"Pittsburgh Magazine\" listed Kaya as one of the top 25 restaurants of 2011, so I was really looking forward to our lunch there.  Maybe we visited on an off day, but overall, I thought the food was pretty bland.

It was nice to sit outside and people-watch on the Strip, tho, and the White Sangria was excellent with fresh orange juice and bits of crisp green apple.  The service was top-notch, too.  When our first batch of Corn and Lentil Fritters came out with sticky, liquefied batter still in the middle, our server was most apologetic.  And the manager herself came over to apologize as well and let us know the appetizer would be removed from the bill.  Wonderful.  I would have been happier if the fritters had more zing, tho.  The green curry sauce that accompanied them was phenomenal and completely outshone them.

Speaking of green curry sauce, I ended up dousing my Jerked Tofu Tacos with the remainder of it.  When I hear \"jerk\" I think of that puckery vinegar tang and that punch-you-in-the-mouth Scotch bonnet heat.  I think \"FLAVOR.\"  Kaya's tacos were pretty tame and unremarkable.  And before you go all pooh-poohing and saying something about how tasteless tofu is, what did I expect? -- I've had some mighty flavorful tofu dishes in my time!  Husband had the Pulled Pork and Banana Sandwich, an interesting pairing which he seemed to enjoy.  However, the accompanying sweet potato fries were flaccid.  Don't you just hate a flaccid fry?

With so many fabulous restaurants in Pittsburgh and so little time each visit, I don't feel tempted to return to Kaya.  Big ups for the great service, tho."}
{"text":"I pretty much came here with my brother because it was pronounced like my name and it was Caribbean food. It's a place you may want to make reservations for because they were full, but had some room to squeeze at the bar. I end up getting the tropical paella."}
{"text":"Wow! I was not expecting to find Caribbean inspired cuisine in the middle of the Strip District! My husband and I stopped in without a reservation, but we were seated outside immediately. Our server Justine was right on it, with cold water, and within a few minutes there was a pineapple-strawberry Mai Tai in my hand. 

Thursday's are fried chicken night, and after seeing so many other patrons had ordered it, my dining partner couldn't resist! He also got the conch chowder which was delicious. The conch was sweet, and not chewy or rubbery at all - it tasted like conch chowder from a place in the Bahamas I've been too. 

I got the heirloom tomato salad and order of crab cakes as my meal. I loved the avocado purée that was plated with the tomatoes- so flavorful, I will have to try and recreate it at home. My crab cakes were excellent too- sweet chunks of crab with a mango and red pepper salsa on top. There was a little something extra in one of the crab cakes, and our server was quick to bring me another order, she also took them off the check without me saying anything - I would have been happy to pay for them since they brought a replacement, but nice gesture. 

I live on the west coast, but will definitely come back to Kaya on our next Pittsburgh trip. I'm still thinking about that heirloom tomato salad!!"}
{"text":"My company took us here for our holiday group lunch. The atmosphere is great, the staff is friendly, and the food -- IT WAS SOOOO GOOD. 

i will definitively be back."}
{"text":"\"This chicken sandwich is SO GOOD, I'd come back here tomorrow\" - my girlfriend, as she savored the last bite of her fried chicken sandwich."}
{"text":"I love Kaya, it's one of my regular go to places. Great atmosphere and food and a reasonable price and almost always easy to find convenient parking."}
{"text":"My husband and I had the opportunity to have lunch at Kaya.  We had a hard time deciding what to have to eat so we split the Paella and the Salmon Apple Salad.  Both were FANTASTIC and a great pairing of taste.  The service was fantastic and it was mostly quiet with some great background music but not to loud so that we could hear each other chat.  I will definitely go back for dinner and  continue going for lunch .   Like all the Big Burrito restaurants, this one is a winner."}
{"text":"The food is enough to give Kaya 5 stars, but add in the excellent service and you're talking about a whole other level. The atmosphere/vibe is chill and feels fancy without being super formal. Try the Rainbow Salad and you won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere at this place and the food was really good. I was here on a business dinner and I had their caipirinha, which was really good. For food we shared the bean dip, which I'd recommend and for my entree I had the paella. The paella was pretty good, my only feedback is to ease on the tomato sauce that seemed to be in it. Although it had good flavor, the tomato seemed to overpower the deliciousness of all the other ingredients, but it was still pretty good. 
I'm glad I found the place and will definitely be coming back next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Love this place, have only been for lunch, but always take out of towners and visitors here. the food is delicious and prices are on par with the area"}
{"text":"Interesting selection if food and drink. Probably my favorite flavored martini ever. Earl Grey tea infused Bombay Sapphire gin with a lemon twist and sugar rimmed glass. So awesome. 
Had the paella which is nice twist of the traditional. A little salty, but good."}
{"text":"The cocktails were very good. The service was poor, even to my standards, which are already pretty low. I don't expect to be treated like a queen, but waiting on a drink I ordered 20 mins ago, seeing it sit on the bar while the place is not at all busy, is not great. Our server was very nice though! Food was mediocre at best. For the price I expected better."}
{"text":"I've been to Kaya for brunch and the vegetarian prix fixe dinner. 

Brunch was pretty good and included Bloody Mary's, conch hush puppies, Eggs Benedict, and huevos rancheros. We sat at the bar because the host said the other tables were for reservations. The bartender did a great job checking on us and getting food to us in a very timely manner. Now onto the food- The bloody's were pretty good, although the cucumber infused vodka was almost too strong of a flavor, even for a Bloody Mary. The hush puppies, and pretty much everything, except some of grilled pineapple, was devoured. 

The prix fixe dinner I had was AMAZING. Every dish, besides dessert, was made with peas. And although I know I *like* peas, I *loved* every dish they brought to the table. I wanted to lick the plates clean, but I refrained. We ordered two of the dinners, so we were able to try both options for every part of the meal. We ended up trying eight different plates of food. Among the most memorable was a soup, a fake pork dish, and a chocolate mouse s'mores type thing. There was a strawberry and pretzel dessert that we both did not enjoy, and although the wine pairing was great, the last wine seemed to be almost a liqueur and was too strong for me to drink, let a lone finish. 
I will definitely be going back for the prix fixe menu as soon as I can, and if you enjoy delicious food, I recommend checking it out. (Third Wednesday of every month.)"}
{"text":"Ah, one of my favorite sandwich combos in the burgh...

Pork and banana sandwich, with conch chowder and sweet potato fries.  The combination of savory and sweet in all three make for one of those addictive meals that you inhale before you even have a change to realize what happened.  The fiancee and I also periodically venture down for the standard Big Burrito brunch fare, which my eggs benedict didn't disappoint.

Great bar and a decent draft selection that's worth checking out every once in awhile."}
{"text":"salmon salad was good although i found it very strange that I got asked how I wanted my fish cooked.  I felt a bit nervous that it wasn't cooked all the way through but so far no food poisoning so i'm happy"}
{"text":"The Jamaican Green Curry Vegetables is not anything like a Thai green curry - and I love my curries, but think Kaya's dish is better. The dish is not served in coconut milk like it's Thai counterpart. Instead, it's loaded up with all sorts of veggies on a huge platter, easily making two meals.  The saffron rice is special too, and complements the flavors really well. And, unlike most curries in Thai restaurants, Kaya's is vegan (among a few other amazing sounding menu items)!

Great happy hour deal, although I wish it was still 5-7pm instead of 4:30-6:30pm - that half hour does make a difference when you get off work at 6!"}
{"text":"The service is always friendly and accommodating.  The vegetarian burger is to die for.  It is only on the lunch menu but they will serve it at dinner if you ask."}
{"text":"Ok I'm updating my review because I had the most delicious Cuban Sandwich ever.  

Came here for lunch - sat at the bar and had a great time.  Whenever I come I always get the black bean dip - which never disappoints.

My friend got the mahi mahi tacos but they came back and said they were out so she settled for the shrimp po boy which was good too.  Seriously though - that Cuban was full of flavor and huge. 
Next time I'm trying the chicken"}
{"text":"Such a nice restaurant to visit at Pittsburgh, PA! I must say that it's pretty awesome that they have a lot of options for vegetarians! My hubz just became a vegetarian so I am always on the look out for restaurants that serves delicious meals for carnivores (such as I) and vegetarians. 

Decor: First, I must review on the decor. I mean the interior design just makes me to think of an art space. The paintings on the walls, the furnitures, even the bathroom, was decorated nicely. 

Service: Lol... I felt like a food critic as they served our meals one by one. We did ended up sitting at the bar as you had to make reservations the night we came so there were not a lot of space to place all the food I ordered lol. I didn't have any issues though. 

Food: (I'm salivating...) We first got the Yucatan Hot Bean Dip. Delicious! I especially loved the fresh house-made chips. We also had the Tofu wrap! My hubz looooved it! He kept wanting to go back here for the tofu wrap during our time in Pittsburgh! The tofu was just nice and firm, sweet, and spicy all at the same time. We also tried the corn and lentil beignets. For me, it just tasted like flour with corn and lentils lol. For my entree, I had the Flank Steak Cemita! Definitely a must!!! I enjoyed every bite! The avocado, black bean with the chipotle aoili was just plain delicious! My husband ordered the Jamaican Green Curry Vegetables. I did have two to three bites. It just tasted minty cool and spicy. I wasn't impressed. 

Overall, I wanna come back and try more dishes from their menu!"}
{"text":"We tried this place based on Yelp reviews.  Glad we did.
The food is very good, with fresh ingredients and generous portions.  As much as I love the Italian food in the Strip District, Kaya is a nice departure from that.  Fruity Caribbean flavors and aromas aren't a norm for the area.  
Their coleslaw is a unique ginger-based, crunchy recipe that goes well with the entrees.   Try especially the fish tacos and flank steak sandwich.    
The service was friendly but a bit slow.   The water served with the meal was lukewarm and very chlorinated.   The food took a long time to come out once we ordered."}
{"text":"Carribean food... well if you say so.  Came here for lunch.  Decor looked like they tried really hard to make seem as if they didn't try hard on it.  Imagine Rainforest Cafe as a pre-teen who just realized his parents dressed him funny, so he goes to some random crap store and buys a pair of JNCO jeans to wear with his hawaiian print.  This is sort of what the inside of Kaya feels like.  It wants to be fancy and cool at the same time, but c'mon now... your bar stools look like they're wearing palm tree skirts.

Food: Not good, but edible (lunch).  The paella was dry and looked more like fried rice.  Paella is supposed to be moist, absorbing all the juices of the seafood, white wine, spices that go into making it.  This was more akin to wok-fried rice with mussels and mexican rice mixed in.  The burger was also lacking, with a dried out (although sizable) patty with formless bread to hold the contents together.  For the lunch price point, not bad.  $20 got me a beer and an attempt at what could have been a good dish, tip included.  Would have paid more for a better dish, but won't be coming back for lunch again."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is what got this a 3 star rating . Had a tropical Veg Paella and it wasn't all that bland and basic AF could have made better at home honest truth . From reviews should have gotten the Kaya Veg burger but it wasn't on the menu. Taco Tuesday is a phuckin joke those little ass tacos are 4 dollars and misleading AF matter of fact that will take the rating back to 2 stars. After eating, felt like  I should have gotten a diff dish. Will be waiting for the Kaya Veg burger then I may come back so now we're back at 3 stars. We also had the jerk wings which were barely jerk (poor seasoning) and 1star and poor grade of chicken back to 2 stars. I'm willing to let them redeem there self. Service was cool and swift which is saving this review. But I'm just a foodie and know food and good dishes so the average person may like it but I wasn't impressed to say the least."}
{"text":"This by far is one of my top 3 restaurants in Pittsburgh.  The happy hour is amazing-half off of almost all drinks.  This means great bold and oaky reds for a decent price.  I think the Yukatan Bean dip is also amazing!!  They use root chips instead of tortilla chips that Mad Mex uses and it is so much better that way!  I also enjoy their vegetarian options and their vegetarian-friendly days now and then.  I also went for brunch recently during Open Streets Pittsburgh and I think I had the best breakfast burrito that I've ever had. The bartenders are extremely friendly and never leave you sitting too long with an empty glass.  The only downside of this place is that it is small, I wish the space was bigger and their outdoor seating had a better set-up."}
{"text":"Tried this restaurant last night and i am left with mixed feelings. First of all the music was great! Awesome reggae music. It was a group of 7 including 2 kids. This place is not kids friendly but if you so happen to have your kids with you , you will be alright. We ordered a number of things and they all turned out good except for the grilled Steak with chimichurri sauce. The steak was a bit burnt and the sauce was not a good fit neither was any other option brought to me. So i left very disappointed! But my server Kurt i think his name was was so awesome and he tried so hard to give me a sauce to go with the steak. But at the end of the day. I think it wasn't the steak but the sauce that was so much of a problem. So i recommended this place but skip the steak. I am a New Yorker i know good food!"}
{"text":"Honestly, I was not that impressed.  I came here hearing a ton of hype, so maybe my expectations were a bit too high.  For my meal I had the tofu tacos which frankly tasted somewhat bland, and not very substantial given the price.  I do find that the happy hour specials are a steal and worth while.  Perhaps I would have been better served trying another dish.  Either that or maybe this place is great for the non-vegetarians out there, but not so great for vegetarians."}
{"text":"For our first visit to Pittsburgh we wanted to try something a bit different. For 9 we were easily accommodated and the fare was true to what was advertised and excellent with excellent service"}
{"text":"Love the wings, the other stuff is just okay. I came here on a weekday night with my husband and sat at the bar.  We ordered apps and Paella, and only the wings stood out to me.  

The wings were spicy (which I don't usually eat) but they were so good I couldn't stop. It came with a cilantro cream sauce which paired so well with the jerk seasoning for the chicken.  It also was not soggy at all, which always earns an extra star in my book."}
{"text":"Great food. Social and upscale atmosphere. We were there for lunch, but I think this would be a great date restaurant.  On the lunch menu, the Jerk pork quesadillas were incredible and so were the tofu tacos... Neither of them were too spicy.  FYI: I was told \"not too spicy\" by family who hates all things spicy.  

Attention parents: Since we were out of town, we brought our preschooler and thank goodness he was well behaved. This place is not for kids at all!  The waiter brought him water in a GLASS glass... fortunately we had no spills.  

FYI: If you do need to bring a child here though good news: child dishes that are not on their menu are available. He got the cheese tortilla and loved it.  It came with a delicious peach salsa, that he didn't eat.  We had to \"force\" ourselves to eat it.  

Overall, this is a great place and if I return to the city, I would definitely try to come back!"}
{"text":"I couple of the dishes could be better from their menu. But they have a 5 course menu once every month with original dishes which was one of the best dinning experiences I've had. You can choose meat, vegan or vegetarian. My boyfriend got vegan and I got vegetarian so we were able to try everything. Only thing is I wish there was a little more lighting inside.

Been here about 5 or 6 times and service has always been goo"}
{"text":"Jerk chicken wings are delicious, jerk chicken is seasoned to perfection and spicy. I was first introduced to Kaya's when I was in middle school, on a school field trip. The plan of the field trip was to introduce inner city youths to tropical/exotic cuisine. That field trip left a huge impression on me. I have now been dinning at Kaya's for over 11 years!  

Crispy Fish Tacos are excellent and bright and flavorful.  A meal that picks you up and give you energy, instead of bogging you down.

Kaya's keeps it genuine to the Caribbean isles. 

They do remove and add menu option frequently, one of my favorite menu items was the paelle. There is a lobster tail served right in with the sausage , chicken , muscles and clams."}
{"text":"The roasted banana ice cream was in my dreams all night and everything else superb before it"}
{"text":"Kaya is great.  There's big variety in the menu, including some vegetarian dishes.  In addition to the great food, this is a great, casual place that takes reservations, so if you have a special occasion and want to do lunch in the Strip, you won't have to wait for a table.

Here's my take:

- Bean dip app is nice - served hot, with some cheese on top and fresh green onions, it's tasty and the portion is definitely large enough to share. 

- I like the Cuban Sandwich, made with a proper sandwich press, so it's warm and just a little crisp on the outside. Kaya's version has some turkey in it.  Oddly, the pickles (a standard Cuban sammy ingredient) are served on the side.

- The Rainbow Salad is fresh and filled with lots of good stuff.  Plus, you can add a protein.

I've not tried the Kaya burger, nor the Kaya Veggie Burger, but each is on my list.  Plus, I suspect plenty of reviews have covered the burger already.

Finally, service is excellent.  People working there all seem pretty enthusiastic."}
{"text":"I had heard about Kaya since I first moved to Pittsburgh but it was only recently that I got a chance to try it out and I regret not having done it earlier! This is a nice place for both lunch and dinner, with good food, drinks and helpful service.  i ordered the cuban sandwich, which was delicious and the other two people in my party ordered the paella which also seemed amazing! I will be certainly going back when I am in the strip district or I can even make a trip just for Kaya."}
{"text":"We went to Kaya last Saturday for a late dinner.  I set up our reservations online and being a Saturday 8:45 was the earliest unless we wanted to eat with the early birds at 5pm.  I really like the convenience of scheduling reservations online.  When we arrived at the restaurant it wasn't overly busy.  There were a few open tables and a few open spots at the bar.  The Pens game was on, but the one TV I saw was too far away from the table to see.  That's ok, I was really looking forward to this place so concentrating on my meal seemed to trump my attention to the game...  

Well I knew already I wanted to try the wings, and they didn't disappoint.  I absolutely loved the cilantro sauce they were served with. It really heightened the wings to a more sophisticated flavor.  I wanted to ask for extra sauce but we actually ended up finishing them before our waitress returned.  Recommend the wings.  Now as far as the entrée went I really, really wanted to get the fish tacos.  I love a good fish taco and everyone talks highly of Kaya's so I was sure I couldn't go wrong.  However, my H talked me out of getting the tacos and trying something \"new.\"  As he put it \"you know what fish tacos are like, try something else.\"  So I did, and I can confidently say I was really, really disappointed to say the least.  I got the tropical Paella that had chicken, chorizo, mussels, scallops, shrimp, some pineapple flavor with peas and crushed red pepper.  Ugh I thought this would be delicious considering I am a seafood junkie and it just missed the mark completely.  The chicken and chorizo were totally overcooked and the rice resembled the flavor and texture of Rice A Roni, yes it was that bad and bland.  I found no scallops and there was no sauce to the dish to soak the mussels in meaning dry, dry, dry.  The only part of it that was tasty was the shrimp.  I am guessing they cook up the paella in advance for dinner then reheat it and add fresh shrimp?  Well that was how it tasted... So get this, my H who talked me out of ordering the fish tacos, ordered them for himself, a move I was not anticipating.  A few bites into my dinner and I just said to him, I really don't like this at all.  He offered to swap dinners with me so I had almost 2 whole tacos, and yes folks they were delicious, and way to take one for the team dear!  I knew I should have just went with my gut and got the tacos from the get go.  As for the rest of the Paella he did eat it but grudgingly and had the same opinions about it as I had, not good and definitely not worth $24.00.  

So cool place, good drinks, pleasant atmosphere, attentive servers, but I would never recommend the Paella.  The fish tacos, YES, the paella, NO..."}
{"text":"It was a delicious day at kaya we all had different plates and the food is to die for we've rated it  thumbs up !!!"}
{"text":"Not bad but not great.

The decor was cute and fitting to the type of food; it had a Caribbean feel.

Reading through the reviews and looking through photos I HAD to get the jerk chicken wings. It was pretty flavorful and tasty but it wasn't anything spectacular. However I did not enjoy the green sauce squeezed all over, which was cilantro cream sauce. We also got the crab cakes which were pretty good but I wasn't really feeling the mango aioli that came with it but I guess that's personal preference.

For entrees, I got the pulled pork quesadillas and let me warn you IT WAS SPICY! I would say my tolerance for spicy foods is not bad but man my tongue was on fire to the point where I couldn't even enjoy my dish. My mom got the whole fried porgy, and I'm sure she enjoyed it because she devoured the whole thing. My dad got the jamaican green curry which he said was okay.

The food was full of flavor, which Carribean food is full of, but overall it was just okay. I would not come again though."}
{"text":"Back for lunch with Liz and this time we brought the boys. Service was awesome and the food was excellent.  Everything was expertly prepared and presented as one would expect from Big Burrito businesses,  even at this accommodating price point."}
{"text":"Not bad at all.  It was reccomended by someone from Caffe Mona's over by the Children's hospital.  I like the fact that they offer a small sandwich and two small sides for a really reasonable price. I liked the Conch Chowder and the slow roasted pork and banana sandwich was wonderful.  Apparently they're part of a chain of other restaurants that come highly reccomended.  It's a cool neighborhood, kind of like the Metapacking district a few years back or South Philadelphia around 9th st.  A little high end dining, some real ethnic food, and a little historic charm.  Well done."}
{"text":"Food is alright...They do get points for being unique...where else can you get alligator?? And what's chihuahua cheese?? Anyway, the paella was just alright. Maybe the rave reviews are for drinks only?? Our waiter on the other hand was very friendly."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try Kaya for sometime because I spend a fair amount of time in Pittsburgh for business.   I journeyed here on a Tuesday night, there was a decent crowd at the bar and in the restaurant.   I was greeted at the host stand and escorted to my table.   I ordered a red sangria and the Kaya Chips and Tomatillo and Mango Salsa as a starter.  The couple at the next table had the conch hushpuppies and hot bean dip with Kaya Chips, which also looked very good.   The hot bean dip must be popular because almost every table in the surrounding area had the same appetizer.   The sangria was just ok, nothing to write home about, not particularly fruity tasty, especially for $10.   The chips and salsa....yum.   The Kaya Chips were homemade potato chips that were seasoned accordingly....slightly spicy but very flavorful.   I don't  think that the chip were a good pairing with the salsa.  I was expecting a yucca or tortilla chip.   The Salsa was EXCELLENT, just not with the potato chips.  The salsa was a great blend of flavors sweet, spicy, flavorful.  I saved the salsa to accompany my entree.   I was torn between the jerk chicken entree and the cuban sandwich.   I chose the jerk chicken, kinda wished I had chosen the sandwich.  The entree included 1/2 chicken, chopped into manageable pieces.  The chicken was served on top of red beans and rice and then topped with an heirloom tomato/avocado/jalapeno salad with a hint of lime juice.  The highlight of this dish was the salad and the salsa that I had saved.  The chicken was not what I expected, the jerk seasoning was just not apparent.   I also think that the price point was a bit high at $24.  The chicken was moist and tender but just didn't taste like jerk chicken and the red beans and rice were just ok.    I would return to Kaya, but would opt for a different menu choice.  All was well prepared and generously portioned.   The service was a bit stand-offish, but all-in-all I would return."}
{"text":"Ahhh, I adore island food, and no place in this city does it better than Kaya!
I've been meaning to write a Kaya review for FOREVER, because their glorious menu has never let me down... From the all-star Tropical Paella to the Killer Cajun Alligator, every dish I've ever had here, any time of day, any day of the week, has been simply OUTSTANDING.
The drinks are fun and well made. I enjoy the Sangria especially, but if you're not into that (who ARE you???) the draft list is pretty rad too!
The seafood is just phenomenal, but their offerings include some knockout vegetarian dishes and stellar jerked pork and chicken entrees.
Notice the obnoxious use of capital letters and exclamation points; YES, it IS justified!
I go here for special dates, friend dates, birthdays... Any time possible. You seriously can't go wrong with Kaya!"}
{"text":"I had a business trip in Pittsburgh and went to Kaya. OMG, it was amazing. I got a salad and seafood dish.  I will be coming back for work and this will be a regular stop. You will not be disappointed. I got the Rainbow salad and the Tropical Paella"}
{"text":"Kaya has the best mediterranean food you can get in Pittsburgh. The chicken wings were so hot and spicy, oh my god!, even being an Indian I was sweating but I could not stop myself from eating, coz they were so delicious. 

The service was great, but do remember to make a reservation because the place is usually crowded, specially on weekends!"}
{"text":"AMAZING food!  The Filipino BBQ ribs  glazed with banana ketchup were the best BBQ ribs I have ever enjoyed.   I even got a second order to take home! Robin was a fantastic server as well. Very attentive and informative. Highly recommend this jewel in the Strip District"}
{"text":"Food was really good! Seating was a bit uncomfortable, but the service was great! The only thing I wish for is a broader wine selection."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner as I've had this place on my to-go places for a while, but never really got a chance to follow up with it until recently and sat down at a bar seat to see what to get. The menu is pretty decently sized and judging from the crowds and the buzz when I walked in, I'd say this is probably one of the more popular restaurants in the Strip District as it's also on the cheaper side as well for decently sized portions. Anyways, ended up ordering the Ahi Tuna Poke Bowl and the Jamaican Green Curry Vegetables entree. As for the poke bowl, it was decent tasting. Ingredients were fresh and tasty, although probably not really worth the $14 I paid as I've had better poke bowls elsewhere for less (and also made-to-order aka I could customize it however I liked). Now as for the Jamaican Green Curry Vegetable ... mmm did this entree really blow my mouth out of the park. Now I will say it's not as spicy as Indian or Asian style curries, but I will say that the spices (mid-spicy), the pineapple (sweet), along with the carbs in the dish (potatoes, saffron rice) and the veggies (peas, greens, mushroom, squash) made for a delightful medley of different flavors in my mouth ... made it so happy haha. I would say the curry itself is actually pretty darn good and was reasonably price as the portion size was rather large for what I paid (my appetite has really declined in comparison to previous years ... prob a good thing). In general? Great place to come and get some great tasting grub. Bar here is also pretty lively and there are many drinks that you can order. I would not recommend coming here if you're planning a date or more intimate gathering though ... place is rather loud with the crowds and all, but for good reason! It's certainly worth paying a visit to come try this place, the great food, and the drinks (if you're into that kind of stuff haha)!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch. There was four of us and between us four, we each ordered the pulled pork quesadilla and tropical paella. 
The Jerk Pulled Pork Quesadilla had spicy slaw, tomato, Machaego cheese and cucumber aioli. Everything had it's own flavors, but I wasn't a big fan of their slaw. I think it would have tasted fine without the slaw or perhaps up the taste for the slaw. It just had a sour taste and didn't go well with the pork.
The Tropical Paella had chicken, chorizo, mussels, shrimp, bay scallops, sugar snap peas, pineapple and red peppers. This dish was well flavored and the pineapple gave the dish a great touch. There was chunks of everything everywhere, I would say they need more rice with all that stuff! =)
We also had an order of Jamaican Jerk Wings with cilantro cream- this was very tasty. The wings were seasoned well and the sauce went very well with the dish.
Overall experience, this place was very tasty and would come back. Service was quick and friendly."}
{"text":"We've been here two weeks in a row already for lunch and brunch and will definitely be coming back in the future. I'm not sure how authentically \"Jamaican\" the food is, but it's still pretty good food nonetheless. It's probably best to get reservations, because it fills up pretty fast on weekends, if you want to avoid waiting around. 

It's nice that they change their menu every so often, to keep things new. The brunch menu online hasn't been updated since April 2011, but after eating brunch there today, i think it's not too far from the real thing. For brunch today, hubby and I ordered the pulled pork benedict and the shimeji mushroom omlette. 

Hubby really likes the pulled pork ($13, i think) there. Too bad they don't sell it by itself. It was also pretty good in sandwich form last week when there were bananas mixed in. I know, it sounds weird, but the added sweetness really does work. Reminds me of a sweeter/mild curry flavor. Anyways, brunch options come with grilled pineapples and breakfast potatoes (referred to as hashbrowns, but they really are cubed bits of potatoes and onion and bell peppers). His pulled pork benedict came as two crisp cornbread rounds with pulled pork piled on top and two poached eggs with hollandaise sauce. We got the eggy-buttery sauce on the side, which was good, because it didn't need too much sauce. It was pretty flavorful on its own. 

My shimeji mushroom omlette ($9) turned out really well. Our waitress actually admitted that was her favorite. They used shimeji mushrooms (the little japanese brown ones that you buy in clumps) and some arugula (i think) and chevre cheese inside, then I requested the omlette to be made with egg whites. It was a good combination with the chevre cheese, and I was surprised that they were nice enough to change it to an egg-white omlette free of charge. I'm pretty used to being told it'll cost extra. Oh, it also came with grilled tortillas, which are clearly way better than plain 'ol tortillas. And the salsa verde drizzled on top is amazingly good! And the soy sausage patties were especially delicious. They didn't taste like soy at all. Kinda meaty, without being too heavy/oily. 

When they brought out the dessert menu, we saw the ice-cream/sorbet assortment for $6.50. We got to pick 3 flavors/scoops on tartlets (out of a choice of 5 or 6 options). We went with the chipotle, avocado, and coconut/chocolate. The coconut/chocolate is the best chocolate flavored ice cream we've ever tasted! It was a really rich and velvety dark dark dark chocolate ice cream. I assume it was made with coconut milk, because there was a very subtle coconut taste, but it's not as if there were flakes in there. The avocado was our 2nd favorite. The taste and texture reminded me of a lighter green tea ice cream. Lastly, there was the chipotle ice cream. It was good, but just good for a bite. The aftertaste gets a bit too spicy/overpowering and is hard to get rid of.                                             

All in all, a great meal, and for a great price. Deee-licious!!"}
{"text":"Appetizers were out of this world.  We had their ceviche, beef ribs and for a meal my gf had tuna tacos and crab cakes.  Very diverse and unique offerings and taste that felt very carribean which is what we wanted.  Only complaint is for my entree i was really looking forward to the Paella and it came without the Chorizo which should of been included, chef had to make it for my dish after the fact and it was brought out 15 minutes into the entree.  With the Chorizo i felt the dish was a bit to spicy but overall a good dish.  We will be back and I will try another entree. Great drinks as well."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a Tuesday evening dinner while our daughter and friends attended the J Biebs concert. 

  Tried the Crispy Calamari  which was terrific. Awesome taste combination with the apple, peanut, coconut and vinaigrette. We also had the Cuban sandwich  and  the Jamaican Green Curry Vegetables. I really enjoyed the Cuban sandwich but my wife was not a big fan of her veggie dish. 
  We were also there in time to partake in the drink happy hour which we were ALL fans of!

  Great place and very friendly staff. Stop and check it out when you find yourself in the Strip!"}
{"text":"Updating, as I have visited many times since my first visit. At least 5-6 times since then. Everything here is wonderful and reasonably priced and DELISH. The smoked wings are some of the best I've ever had. Their brunch is my favorite, their dinner is delicious, their happy hour is great and their service is always friendly. I love this place. They easily deserve 5 stars."}
{"text":"we had Sunday brunch here.  this would be 5 stars except we had rather slow service at the bar.  besides that, everything was good.  they make a nice bloody Mary and have a nice cocktail program. my eggs Benedict were as good as any i have had.  everything on the menu looked very good.  i would recommend this place and i would return again.   other reviews said this place was pricey.  i would agree with that."}
{"text":"Conch fritters. That's really all I have to say. At Kaya, they're the best I've ever had. Kaya is a member of the Big Burrito group who also owns Mad Mex, Eleven, and several other places around the 'Burgh. Kaya has Mad Mex Prices with Eleven-level food. It's really fantastic. 

The place is cozy and full of Island flavor from the tiki-looking statues in the corners to the tile decor. Surprisingly, given the amount of area covered in tile, it's not cold or uninviting in the winter. You can also choose to eat outside during good weather, but something caused their outdoor tabletops to warp slightly so keeping a drink upright is sometimes challenging. 

Their menu is fantastic. Among the winners are the Kaya Burger, the Crispy Fish Tacos and the Conch Fritters. The salad that comes with is also amazingly good. Something about the lemony garlic dressing... I would eat the side salad alone as a meal given the chance, it's just that good. 

When they serve chips, they're taro chips that feel (and probably are) home made. 

The service is always great, and their bartenders really know how to mix their drinks. Though the place is somewhat small - maybe 30 tables or so - I have never had a problem getting seated except when we went there for dinner on a fried chicken Thursday. I didn't know it was a \"thing\" and the wait would have been so long that we decided to find other food. 

Overall, Kaya remains one of my favorite places to eat in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Not bad, but I don't think I'd come back unless it was pretty convenient. Overall thought it was decent. I came here with my family in the late afternoon and it was pretty crowded still. We only had to wait a few minutes to get seated as a table of four. The service was a bit slow due to it being so busy but not too bad.

The drinks were really great! The cocktails were probably the highlight of the meal. We had the conch fritters, seafood paella, jamaican curry with shrimp, and jerk chicken torta. I loved the fritters! Or rather, I loved the spicy sauce that came with them. Could have eaten those all day.

The curry was decent, but not as spicy as I'd hoped. The seafood paella was a huge portion, lots of chunks, which was good, but incredibly bland. The jerk chicken torta was probably the worst thing - a very dry piece of chicken on some bread, and there was no flavor. Really couldn't tell that it was anything but some grilled or boiled chicken. I blame my brother for even thinking we should order this as it didn't sound appealing in its menu description either, which is a testament to their menu-writing at least.

When I think of Caribbean food, I think a lot more flavor than what was here. But it would still be a good place to gran some tasty drinks and some small fried snacks."}
{"text":"I don't know why this place was so highly rated. I'm disappointed. 

Flank steak was literally just a steak with a little bit of salsa. No sides, barely any flavor. And it was $26. 

The margarita was like any other margarita, except they charged me $12 for it.

I sat on the patio because it was a nice day. The service was fine and the restaurant seemed clean enough. 

Overall I don't have much to say about it. It was a bland experience and I don't recommend it."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant with a group of friends and I have to say I really enjoyed the food. I had the steamed buns with the pulled pork and it was very tasty just enough spice and the mango slaw and mayo added lots of flavor. I also had the Cemita burger with sweet potato fries. This steak burger was awesome! My steak was well done and with the combo of black bean, avocado and pickled onion it was very flavorful. The sweet potato fries were amazing with just enough crisp to them. I wouldn't necessarily classify this as a Caribbean restaurant just because they have a few jerk dishes on the menu but I would definitely recommend the Cemita! I did have the pomegranate mai tai which many reviews raved about but I didn't really enjoy it and neither did my friend. It wasn't as sweet as described and it was too strong for my liking. Overall great ambiance, great for friends and if you go definitely try the Cemita!"}
{"text":"While in Pittsburgh for a short work trip, I decided to go somewhere I never went while I actually lived there, and settled on Kaya.  It was packed when we got there, so we had a seat at the bar, and after admiring the art, we decided to eat at the bar.  

First of all, the service was great.  Our apps came out quickly and were divine!  I had the Tempura Avocado, which was served with an amazing chipotle reduction.  The combination of creamy avocado with crisp tempura was absolutely perfect.  

Our food came out quite quickly, as well, and was absolutely perfect.  I got the Tropical Paella, and could not have been more impressed.  The seafood was cooked perfectly, it had the delicious saffron flavoring, with pineapple and jerk spices added to it.  So amazing, I would like it again as soon as possible.  

Throughout the night, the service was just amazing.  I wish Kaya would come further east so I could enjoy it more often!"}
{"text":"Everything at this place is amazing. If i could eat my metal seat with the cilantro sauce the Jamaican jerked wings came with, I would! I had the kaya burger, Bomb!"}
{"text":"No clue why I keep forgetting to review them. They are one of my gf's fav places ever. She eats there at least twice a month. I really enjoy them as well although I prefer takeout over dining in there. 
They are famous for their burgers. They are huge and juicy with a lot of flavor. I know you yinzers like gross  drippy egg yolk on your burgers, but I can't *shivers*. If I get one with egg I ask for it to be rock hard yolk. Once they didn't listen and I sent my burger back, they replaced it with a very good burger. 
If you're a cheese burger fanatic like my gf you need to check them out!"}
{"text":"My friend and I visited this place this weekend the food is really good I ordered which tacos which had Avocados cilantro and cumber it and my friend ordered Kaya burger liked the food good ambiance"}
{"text":"We were looking for a good Cuban sandwich in Pittsburgh. After reading the reviews on Kaya we decided to give it a try. The Cuban was very good and as we were ordering the group at the next table told us how good the sandwich is so we ordered with the sweet potato fries.  Very good Cuban. Would recommend highly. The hostess was very nice and friendly and our server was great!"}
{"text":"Here you will find American-esque dishes with carribean flare. The fish tacos are tasty as is the cuban sandwhich/sweet potato fries. A step above Mad Mex, thats for sure."}
{"text":"Not sure how we have just made it out to Kaya.. was never on my radar. We are always in the Strip District but always on Penn Ave and not Smallman. My co-worker and I ordered the Roasted Brussels sprouts and cauliflower tropas (appertizer?), the Conch and corn chowder, strip steak tacos and the Pumpkin Creme Brulee. Everything was really good except for the Pumpkin Creme Brulee. The Pumpkin Creme Brulee made me think of baby food with a sugar hard top. I love creme brulee and this was a no bueno for me. 

Server was very polite and had a spunk to him. We ordered, drinks came out, food came out and dessert came out very quickly. 

We would love to come back to try some of the other items on the menu like the paella."}
{"text":"In truth, I'd rate my first experience at Kaya at a 3.5.  I really dig the tropical/Carribbean atmosphere.  The drinks offerings were creative and my smoky cocktail was delicious.  Service was good.  What disappointed me was something so simple to get right--the guacamole.  Yep, that's right. The guac.  And I get that Kaya isn't a Mexican restaurant, but I think that means if you're going to put guacamole on your appetizer list, it better be on point.  It did have a lot of tropical ingredients mixed in, but it didn't have enough salt or acidity, and the chips were rather bland as well.  The jerk chicken wings with the cilantro cream sauce, on the other hand?  BANGIN'.  I'm definitely willing to go back and give them another try."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner one night and enjoyed the feel of the restaurant. If you know Mad Mex, think a similar layout with less horror artifacts, more space, and better service. 
The host and waiter both were very polite and caring as we went through the menu from drinks (providing thoughtful advice on the sangria) to the dishes. Everything was plated beautifully and more importantly, they taste delicious. They definitely know how to use avocado and vegetables well to pair against the main meats or seafood. If you don't know what to get, fish tacos won't let you down! The portions are large too for which I am thankful for. 
Now it is located on Smallman St so it is out of the way, definitely a night life area so weekday dinner is naturally quieter. If you're looking for a nice fancy casual dinner outing, Kaya should be on your list as well!"}
{"text":"The staff at Kaya was sweet and accommodating when we booked a last minute family brunch for 14 people on a Sunday afternoon.

The cocktails were delicious (loved my Dark n' Stormy, Blood Orange Mimosa was splendid, and even the sip of Waffle-Martini I tried was yummy, if a bit sweet for my tastes.) I ordered the pork benedict (poached eggs + pulled pork + corn cakes? #duh), served with grilled pineapple, and enjoyed every bite. The benedicts were on the small size, but if you want a gut buster, go for any of the omelets, sandwiches, or the burger. Be sure to upgrade to the sweet potato fries served with a spicy special sauce. The brunch menu was extensive enough to please my meat-and-potatoes grandmother as well as my cousin's with more exotic palettes.

Our waiter was congenial, gave informed answers about the menu, made great recommendations, and was a total cutie. (Hey boy ;) AND he didn't get mad when my talkative aunts lingered at the table for 40 minutes after the meal.

All in all, everyone had a great time. I would love to return for dinner, or just a few drinks at the bar with friends."}
{"text":"Kaya is by far ONE of my favorite Big Burrito restaurant - if not THE favorite. If this is your first time in Pittsburgh, you're going to want to try and get here for sure. Their drink menu is WAY above average, and the food isn't like anything else around. 

I have been a vegetarian now for 2 years, but prior to that I LIVED for Kaya's fish tacos. Quite possibly the best in the city. Now that I'm all veggie, I go for their tofu tacos, which are one of their best veggie dishes. They also have a great avocado egg sandwich served with their amazing mixed green salad. Don't forget a side of sweet potato fries no matter WHAT you order - they are a must have.

Definitely plan ahead with reservations, or risk it and end up drinking at the bar for 45 minutes while waiting. Either way it's a win-win!!"}
{"text":"Never a disappointment! Make a reservation online before you go, as it's pretty small inside and can get crowded, and try to get there during happy hour. Kaya has one of the best happy hours in the city!

There is not a lot of outdoor seating (and it's basically just tables on the sidewalk), but the inside decor is really cool. The Caribbean theme is unique when compared to other restaurants in Pittsburgh, and they really do it well.

Some of the food I've had there include the following (spoiler alert: I like everything I've ever had here...):

--Jamaican Jerk Wings - so good! The sauce is tangy and the wings are cooked just right.
--Yucatan Hot Bean Dip - it's a heavy, thick dip, but it's really tasty and cheesy, mild on the spices.
--Tropical Guacamole - really tasty, pineapple and the mango in this give it a sweet and fresh flavor
--Caribbean Flank Steak Stir Fry: had this most recently.. OMG. My boyfriend kept trying to steal bites. It is a huge portion, the steak is cooked perfectly and there is a lot of it. The flavors just go together so well!
-- Crispy Fish Tacos - this used to be my favorite menu item before I experienced the steak stir fry. The portions of the fish are really generous and cooked to the right amount of crispiness, but be wary of the spicy crème fraiche, it's REALLY spicy. 
-- Fried Chicken (on Thursdays) - my boyfriend makes sure that we only go on Thursdays so that he can order the fried chicken. It's really fresh, hand battered, and you get SO MUCH. He tried the Nashville hot once, and it is no joke. We found it too spicy to actually be enjoyable. 

In summary, make a reservation, be cautious of anything advertised as \"spicy\", because they do not mess around with the spices, but otherwise, everything here is SO GOOD. The service is always on point, and they have an awesome draft and cocktail menu. What's not to like?

One more tip -- make sure to sign up through Big Burrito's website to get on their mailing list. You get a coupon for a free meal on your birthday every year :)"}
{"text":"The food was very very good, but I dropped the ranking two stars based on service.  My wife, 2 year old son, and I visited tonight for my Birthday.  While we weren't ready to order immediately (first visit), our server seemed very friendly and relaxed/ready to go.  But once we ordered, everything took way too long.  Our drink order took 5-10 minutes, and when we placed our full order (apps and entrees with a rush on sweet potato fries), everything showed up around 25 minutes later (our entrees came out 2-3 minutes after the apps).  I told the server countless times to bring out a side order of sweet potato fries as my kid was melting down and she kept saying they ran out and were making more; meanwhile said kiddo was pointing out all the fries every other table was receiving as everyone around us received their food.  I also asked if the kitchen was in the weeds (I don't want to blame the service unnecessarily) and she said \"no\" and looked at me like I was crazy.  Service was absolutely pitiful (yes, I served tables back in the day, so I know bad service).  Ultimately, although their food was absolutely fantastic, they are too dysfunctional as a kitchen and wait staff for me to risk bringing my family back there again.  I truly love Casbah and Mad Mex, but this restaurant just hasn't figured out how to make people comfortable.  I really hate writing such a harsh review about a restaurant with such wonderful food, but from a family stand point, I am definitely not their target customer, and that is a-ok, I just know I won't be back for a long time.

Side Note: the bar tenders are great!  When the service hit rock bottom I bussed most my dishes to them, asked for extra silverware, drinks, etc, and they were very cool."}
{"text":"I know this is not the most original review, but I have to agree that the fish tacos are a good choice. The service was friendly and prompt."}
{"text":"Kaya has a great menu that's different but extremely accessible. Veggie burger with avocado and a fried egg? Yes, please.

As a starter our group split (and devoured) the mango salsa and spicy black bean dip (which was actually spicy!). Service was good for a party of eight and the food came faster than expected.

We were having a mature, classy lunch, so we didn't do a lot of drinking, but they have a good cocktail and beer list which we did sample from.."}
{"text":"Kaya is a Big Burrito restaurant.  If you like Mad Mex, you'll probably like Kaya.  Kaya is the Caribbean influenced Mad Mex.

I like the paella.  Mallorca is much better, but Kaya does a good job.  I'd say Kaya has more spices in theirs.  It seems more intense.

Kaya's fried chicken is excellent.  It was my favorite until Meat and Potatoes came along.  Crispy with a nice spicy batter."}
{"text":"Kaya has a unique and delicious menu! There are plenty of vegan and vegetarian options with a ton of flavor ! The service is great and the staff of a super helpful when it comes to making suggestions. Being from Florida, the tropical dishes of Kaya is a piece of home with its own unique flair."}
{"text":"We went to Kaya for brunch a few weekends ago and the chicken & waffles BLEW MY MIND. Seriously. I've tried chicken & waffles at dozens of restaurants (in Pgh and outside), and so far Kaya has served the absolute best version of it I've ever eaten. Also, the bloody mary with cilantro vodka? On point."}
{"text":"I would give them four stars for their happy hour and three stars for their food.  Happy hour is half off all drinks from 5-7 in either the bar or sit down.  The bar was pretty busy at 6 on a Wednesday so I believe this place gets crowded on a weekend.  We had the Mango Mai Tai, Caipirinha, Rum Swizzle Punch, and Mojito and the Punch and Mojito were our faves.

As for dinner - we started with the Crispy Calamari that had this wonderful pineapple-chili glaze.  Not too spicy and not too sweet.  It was really a wonderful combination of flavors.  I then had the Tropical Paella and my husband had the Wild Alaskan Halibut.  Both were decent dishes, but nothing to write home about.

Kaya was a place I would go back to for drinks and appetizers (during happy hour), but I would skip the dinner."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a cocktail and we had an appetizer as well.  Great outdoor seating.  Interesting menu.  Good drinks. Server was friendly, too!  Would go back if I were staying in town!"}
{"text":"We went during the time no one else really seems to rave about- dinner on Saturday. No amazing happy hour specials, no cool brunch options. 
The Jamaican Jerk wings app we ordered was good, but I've had much better wings at a dive bar. The flavor on point, the texture just didn't do it for me. I like my wings to be crispy and tender. These were tough and chewy at times. 
My friend got the salmon. He said it was over cooked on the outside and too soft on the inside. 
I ordered the rainbow salad, it  was good and not a bad value. I opted for no meat because I had the chicken wings already.
Im leaving 4 starts for my overall experience, but there is definitely room for improvement. I'd give it another try and you should too. I heard the fish tacos are on point and happy hour is the best."}
{"text":"Somehow without even checking Yelp I managed to stumble into one of the trendiest brunch places in Pittsburgh! Apparently this is a Caribbean restaurant, but I couldn't really tell from the menu. I do appreciate that there are a variety of vegetarian and vegan options!

I had the eggs cemita (torta) with cilantro, pickled red onion, avocado, black bean, chipotle aioli, and Oaxaca cheese. The sandwich had tons of flavor. You can't argue with eggs and melty cheese! At first I thought it was silly that the sandwich came wrapped in parchment paper, but it would have been really messy otherwise, so that was a smart call.

With a sandwich you have the option of hash browns, waffle fries, sweet potato fries, or salad as a side. I should've gone with waffle fries inside of sweet potato--the sweet potatoes were old. I also tried a bite of the Rainbow Salad; it was SO delicious and definitely an exciting lighter option!

The location is great; since Kaya is on a corner, you can soak up the vibes of the Strip without feeling like someone is selling a vegetable two inches from your face. There's a lot of outdoor seating that's perfect for people watching, but I was happy to be seated right away indoors with air conditioning!

It was a pretty affordable brunch at only ~$15 per person with tip. Of course, we didn't indulge in any of the brunch cocktails! Although the restaurant was full, the service was super fast so we could get back to touring Pittsburgh in no time. Overall, Kaya has a great atmosphere and some interesting menu options. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking to recharge while in the Strip!"}
{"text":"Ughhh....So good. Our last time eating here has me on a southern style fried chicken sandwich kick. The Kaya Fried Chicken Sandwich is perfectly breaded and fried and the seasoning is on point. The dressings were so perfect. Cabbage slaw, habanero honey mustard, and pickle chips. I could eat this sandwich every day and be content. We also had the Jamaican Jerk Wings. They have considerable kick so beware! They are thoroughly enjoyable though. Our table also shared some conch hush puppies and I'm sure you can guess, they were fab-u-loussss."}
{"text":"Kaya is by far one of my favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh.  This is one of my go-to places to take friends, relatives, and co-workers when they are in town and I have never heard of anyone having a bad meal or cocktail.  The atmosphere makes you forget you are in Pittsburgh and has an awesome Caribbean feel.  The fish tacos are pretty spectacular and are typically my order when I am there; The Don cocktail is also a favorite.  I would also recommend getting the tofu cracklins as an appetizer - I am not a tofu lover, but these are incredible.  You also cannot go wrong with the Kaya burger, conch fritters, or the chicken entree.  The pulled pork quesadilla is pretty spicy, so if you don't like a lot of heat in your food, I would recommend against that.  But overall, you won't be disappointed at Kaya - it's one of the best, and their homemade sorbets/ice creams are a delicious way to end the meal."}
{"text":"Never anything less than a perfect meal at Kaya.  The menu changes, but the experience is always great.  The fish tacos and the green curry vegetables are fantastic menu staples - they are both so good that I have to struggle not to order the same thing every time I go to Kaya.

On the current menu, the adobo flank steak is to die for so long as you like the spicy heat.

Over the years, I have been to Kaya at least 30 times.  It remains #1 in my book."}
{"text":"Very much enjoyed everything I tried there today. I went for lunch and got Jamaican wings (well done) for appetizer. So good. Then I had true Cuban sandwich and with the spicy mayo they serve it with is everything I was looking for. Everything was exceptional. I didn't have one complaint, even the mimosa was delightful. Staff was friendly. It was just hard to find the front door lol maybe just for us I don't know.

Just wanted to add just went back and not only was the Cuban sandwich cooked better than last time, the conch human puppies were amazing! Highly recommend. Also get the cucumber sauce to dip anything in. So good."}
{"text":"I was down in Pittsburgh visiting with a couple of friends and we had dinner at Kaya.....then the next morning we ended going back for brunch. Awkwardly, we saw the same hostess and the powers must have been with us because they sat us at the same table. 

Between all of us we tried several of the dishes including the Tuna Tartar with plantains, Calamari, Fish Tacos and pulled pork quesadilla. I enjoyed everything. The tuna tartar was massive and fresh. Calamari was good. It had peanuts, coconut and was served with a jicama and apple salad that complemented it well. Fish tacos were good (not the best I've ever had) but I would not hesitate to order it again if the craving it and the pulled pork quesadilla was delicious (very very very porky and meaty). The quesadilla looked more like a sandwich because it was so thick. 

Drinks were also excellent. I tried the Kaya-Chelada and loved it. It was not a traditional Chelada but it was a corona mixed with rum and lime. Had a sip of the mojito which was also excellent. Drinks were very strong. 

The next day we did some sight seeing and then at noon found ourselves starving. We had seen some people order the Kaya burger the night before.....and wow that was a sight. This was something we needed to try before leaving Pittsburgh. 

The Kaya Burger was delicious and messy. It was a thick burger stacked with an egg sunny side up, bacon, cheese, all the fixings and came with sweet potato fries. The sweet potato fries were perfectly salty and crispy.  It was a delicious pig out. 

My friend had a bloody mary that was delicious and spicy. I don't even like vodka or tomato juice that much! 

Service was excellent and prompt and the surrounding area has some fun bars and clubs just down one block."}
{"text":"I've been to Kaya a couple times (mainly for the fried chicken) but had never been for brunch. The ladies and I decided to give it a shot and arrived at 11:30 on a recent weekend. I ordered an orange juice to start. It may have been 5 o'clock somewhere but not for me. As I looked over the menu, I saw some really interesting options. Most seemed to be with a Caribbean flare. Then my eyes wondered to nearby tables. Are you kidding me! The portions were gigantic. Was this brunch or dinner? I don't think the kitchen realized it was before noon. Accordingly, there were lots of tables with to go boxes. I decided to go with the chicken and waffles. I recognized that I was taking a risk here. I'm much more of a sweet brunch person than a savory one. When our meals arrived, I dug in. The fried chicken was spectacular as it always is. The waffle was light and fluffy. But somehow the combination was off to me. Maybe it was the tabasco butter mixing with the sweet syrup. Sweet and savory failed to come together for me. I ate the chicken separately and left the waffle. Should have stayed in my comfort zone and went with the chocolate banana waffle. Oh well, I think I'll stick with Kaya for dinner."}
{"text":"i have been going to this place for 15 years and there is always something amazing. but it is the fried chicken sandwich i had on friday that made me write a review. the server said it was life changing, which sounded ridiculous until i got it. this sandwich is so delicious i went back tonight just to have it again. just go get one. really. just go."}
{"text":"I came here on a Friday night with some friends. We had previous reservations, which had been made that week, so it appears as though it was relatively easy to get in if you plan ahead a little (as opposed to Salt of the Earth which was booked well over a week ahead).

It's a long, narrow restaurant with seating outdoors. Everytime I've driven past Kaya in the summers, it's got lots of people sitting outside relaxing and eating.

My friends enjoyed the variety of beers on tap as well as the sangria and mojitos (and nojitos since one was preggers). For the mains, I had the  seafood jambalaya was quite good. Good flavors, nicely melded together.

When I started this review, I was going to give 4 stars but then I remembered that they took extra care to accommodate some friends who have various food allergies, including gluten. One friend called ahead about his allergies and the chef and waiter marked up a menu with which dishes that he could order. For that service, I'm bumping Kaya up to 5 stars."}
{"text":"Kaya is out of place in Pittsburgh. It's kind of a funky, big city restaurant, with a Caribbean, African flavor. The food is top shelf, but not your meat and potatoes style, with some spice and unusual preparations and a limited menu. If you can accept all of that you'll like this place, particularly if you enjoy a good drink, since the happy hour is one of the best around. Service is professional, and the room is a little loud, but appropriately so. 

Our dinner tonight was just the fish tacos, which were great, and lots of alcohol, as usual. I can't think of any areas for improvement, and am real happy to eat here when the opportunity arises. It's small and crowded, so reservations are recommended."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. I liked Kaya but can't say that I would run back. We went with a group for dinner and made a reservation. We started the meal with appetizers. Crackling tofu --yummy but pretty spicy and our mouths were burning. The ribs were deliciously sweet, and the Jamaican jerk wings were good. I had the veggie green curry with tiger shrimp. The actual curry was delicious, although I felt the vegetables were overcooked. The rice, however, was disappointingly crunchy! I did like the tuna, and my friends enjoyed the flank steak and the tacos. nothing was spectacular but it was good. 

and finally desserts were good. I loved the banana chocolate bread pudding and the chocolate pecan torte was super rich. I'm not a fan of the trend of putting cayenne pepper in sweets, such as the ice cream that came along with the torte. It's always such a surprise and just doesn't work for me. I avoided the ice cream for that reason, but my friends were surprised and didn't like it either."}
{"text":"Great happy hour and consistently good food!  Ranging from 8-$26 good value appetizers and tacos and sandwiches!"}
{"text":"Delicious and fun!  I attended a small rehearsal dinner last week at Kaya and they did a fantastic job!  There is not a private dining area, but it was nice and lively.  The food was incredible and everyone in the party thoroughly enjoyed it.  The manager was visibly present and delightful as well.  I can't wait to come back in town to try something else on the menu!  :)"}
{"text":"Kaya is great! The bean dip is sooooooo good. I love salsas and dips but this has to be one of my favorite bean dips ever. The flank steak salad was great also. The smoky flavor is great and the dressing just really makes it flavorful. I'd def eat there again. Next time dinner though."}
{"text":"We had their monthly prix fixe vegetarian dinner. It was spectacular. Every course was special. You had two choices for each and we went with both, splitting each one. Creative, tasty, well-prepared and seasoned. The roasted carrot risotto was about the best dish of its kind I'd ever had. The desserts were fantastic.

The service was great. The price, at $39 each, was fine. The place is very loud, but that was the only drawback. 

This was one of the best dining experiences we'd ever had."}
{"text":"Second time there, went for lunch with a friend. Got the lunch combo - black bean quesadilla, winter veggie soup, sweet potato fries. The quesadilla was surprisingly small (especially compared with my friend's pork slider, which for $2 more was HUGE in comparison). The soup was excellent, luscious without being overly creamy, and topped with some notably tasty fried sage. The sweet potato fries were nothing to write home about, but were a nice accompaniment. Decent prices, could have been more creative, but I'd go back for lunch. There are certainly other, better places in the Strip, though."}
{"text":"The food was not great. The wine also sucked. There are other better options available around. This is not the best food for the kind of price I paid. For the basic appetizer like chips and salsa, I found that the chips were burnt. Very average food."}
{"text":"My FAVORITE restaurant! I love it here! The best night is fried chicken night on Thursdays... They have a new side every week, my favorite has been pineapple rice.. I also have had jerk chicken wings that were also amazing... I love the Caribbean feel of the restaurant"}
{"text":"Conch Fritters were amazing! Meaty and fluffy with peppers and really good habanero aioli sauce. Also had the Jerk chicken wings, great rub flavor and the meat was tender. The cilantro cream sauce complimented the spicy wings perfectly. Finally, nice decor and good atmosphere. Can't wait to try more."}
{"text":"Kaya has the best sweet potato fries, and their Cuban sandwich is amazing! By far one of my favorite restaurants downtown."}
{"text":"Stopped by Kaya for lunch the other day and got the jerk chicken sandwich. The sandwich was really good, but the waffle fries were absolutely amazing. Service was pretty slow - hence the four stars. The restaurant was pretty empty and we had to grab another waitress to get our drinks refilled after a while. Great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Our experience at Kaya was outstanding. We were seated promptly and greeted by our server. We ordered a couple of the small plates (corn and lentil beignets, charred baby carrots) and entrees (chile rellenos and bahn mi tacos). Everything was outstanding. The chile rellenos was maybe the best I've ever had--full of flavor and perfectly prepared. Both entrees were less than $20, so it seemed like a phenomenal value considering how great the food was. I would definitely go back to Kaya."}
{"text":"I guess I would describe Kaya as a middle of the road restaurant. The food is good at Kaya but I'm just not overly enthused. 
They offer a few staple things that you'll always see on the menu while also changing up the menu to always offer a few new items. Non of the dishes really WOW me, most of them I can get at other good restaurants around Pittsburgh. 
As a restaurant that's part of the Big Burrito Company you'll find they use fresh and local ingredients when possible, which is always a plus in my book. 
The outside seating area is a nice plus BUT they do not allow dogs if you are dining outside. This seems a little ridiculous to me seeing as how it's a casual setting & you are on the sidewalk. 
Overall its worth eating at Kaya at least once."}
{"text":"The staff inside of the restaurant was very nice. Smiling and saying hello as I passed through to meet my friend who was seating outside. The waitress at our table was probably one of the worst I've ever had, though. 

I had my mixed drink and water within minutes of ordering it, which was great. (The mixed drink was basically entirely alcohol and I couldn't manage more than a few sips, so without me even asking, the waitress did remove it from my check at the end of the meal, which I did like/appreciate.) 

I ordered a sprite to try to wash taste of the mixed drink from my mouth. About 25 minutes after ordering, I finally stopped the waitress while she was walking away from helping another table, to ask for the sprite again. I finally received it about 6 minutes after that. 

My friend and I ordered an appetizer but we both only had a few bites as it was pretty horrible. (If I remember correctly, I believe it was three types of hummus and pita bread.) Everything on the platter was bitter while at the same time, tasted the way I imagine cardboard would taste. It was strange.

Our meals arrived about 15 minutes after ordering them, which was lovely. At that time, there were three of us and I think we were all pleased with our main meals. I ordered a burger with waffle fries. (I highly recommend the waffle fries.)

The burger was massive and I couldn't finish even half of it so I asked for a to-go package. The waitress took the plate and brought our check about 10 minutes later, without the packaged burger. I had to stop and grab her again on her way back from helping another table to ask her if the burger had been packaged. She brought it out and sort of tossed it into the table.

I don't think I will ever be eating there again. Well, maybe to order some waffle fries to go. (They were that good.)"}
{"text":"One of my absolute favourite restaurants in Pittsburgh!!! For a few hours infused with friends, martinis, and delicious culinary fare, I feel like I took a flight south to the Caribbean! I even leave saying things like, \"Eh man!\" It's so classy and cool, and the staff is friendly as can be. Must go here again ASAP."}
{"text":"After seeing the ridiculous line at Primanti's we used Yelp to find this cute little Caribbean place. Although tiny inside, the atmosphere was very relaxing. The drink menu had a lot of interesting options on there. We started with the fried conch (excellent). I then had the paella, which was filled with chicken, chorus, mussels, scallops and lots of vegetables and pineapple. The paella was great and it was the perfect size for a lunch portion so that I didn't feel like it was going to waste. Travis L. had the jerked pulled pork quesadilla, which went really well with the spiced slaw on top. The service was excellent and the owner is an incredibly friendly women that makes an effort  to see that all of her patrons are pleased."}
{"text":"Kaya's brunch ends at 4pm which is great for people that wake up late on Sundays or leave church late. They have the BEST chicken and waffles that I have had in Pittsburgh. The shrimp omelet is great as well."}
{"text":"This is one of the overall best restaurants in Pittsburgh for three reasons: 

1) The appetizers. If they have it on the menu, as some items are seasonal, the spicy tuna poke bowl is a MUST TRY. The tuna was clearly fresh, the dish wasn't smothered in spicy mayo like a regular tuna roll might be, and it was overall delicious. It had me and the person I was eating with literally scraping up single grains of rice to finish off.
2) The drinks. They have a really fresh and innovative cocktail menu and a pretty good wine list as well. I had the rum punch, and it was very very good.
3) Fried chicken Thursdays. This was the reason we were there on a Thursday night. They have fried chicken plates every Thursday, and it is very very good. Upon being seated, we were told they were out of the fried chicken and I was disappointed, so it might be worth it to go a little earlier in the night if you're really interested. However, they still had the fried chicken sandwiches, and I got the spicy chicken version which was truly delicious. It was crispy and perfectly spicy, I would definitely recommend it. 

A little tip, the waffle fries are AMAZING."}
{"text":"Order the sorrel tea. It is really good!"}
{"text":"I love Kaya. Absolutley love it! It's always on the list for options when we consider going out to dinner or brunch. It's that good.  Been going here for years and have pretty much had everything on the menu and there is NOTHING I wouldn't order again! That good. Service is always superb (well, we had one visit when it was subpar but Monika the General Manager showed how much customer service means to them and took care of things for us! She's amazing!). 

Starters for us always include the spicy bean dip or the lentil and corn beignets. Amazing. The greeny curry sauce for the beignets is the perfect complement to a superb dish! The conch fritters are not something you see elsewhere in the Burgh and worth a try! Entrees are spectacular and range from  crispy fish tacos with cabbage slaw (Highly recommended!) to jerk pulled pork quesadillas with that yummy jerked flavor, to specials like barramundi (which might have been the best fish dish I've had in years!) and skirt steak so tender it melts in your mouth.

And with all the burger talk in the city, don't sell Kaya short in that category! Oh no! The Kaya burger may be the best burger offering out there!! The juicy, perfectly cooked burger topped with fresh avocado, fried egg, Kaya sauce and whatever mystical ingredients they supplement it with is enough to make me dream of burgers! I've even ordered it for brunch! Yeah, I know - so good. The salmon eggs benedict for brunch is killer. KILLER! 

And let's talk about alcohol, shall we? Happy hour cocktails and beer are half off. Cocktails are imaginative and super tasty. And the draft beer selection is among the best around! Huge selection of craft beers that rotate frequently. May be in the top two happy hours I've ever been too. 

Love the atmosphere, the food, and the beer. I will keep coming back. And with a freee entree on my birthdays, here's hoping I'll be there for a long, long time!!"}
{"text":"You mix the lime and the coconut, you shake it all up...

Alright this is the wrong song but the food here was fantastic.   I had some folks in town and decided to adventure the Strip District.   I picked the wrong time (after 6pm).    I quickly accessed my Yelp 911 app on my phone and found Kaya a few steps away.

We walked in and were met by the Hostess.  She explained the place was completely booked for the evening with reservations.   She did mention we could eat at the bar.   There were just enough spots for our group.

I knew this was going to be a long night so I was wearling my big boy pants and was ready for some festivities.   I ordered our group some drinks and appetizers.   

I am used to beer and wine flights.   Kaya offers Rum flights.    I boarded this pupply and went on the smokey flight while my friends went on the sweet and traditional flight.   We had a great pairing of appetizers (corn and lentil beignets, mango salsa, and calamari).

The dinner  - I ordered the Flank Steak (recommended by the bartender).   It was marinated for 2 days!  The steak was very tender and the meal was awesome.


Atmosphere:   Very trendy with lots of people.   Awesome atmosphere
Price;  Price can run you for an entree anywhere from $15-25 on average
Food:  Great , wow, yummy ...

I strongly recommend this place.  I hope you like it as much as I did.  (Please note that this owned by a restaurant group (Big Burrito) who own Eleven, Casbah, etc...)"}
{"text":"Kaya can be a bit of a hit-or-miss. If you have 3 things on your plate, I find it's unusual to like all three of them. Last time I was there the chicken was awesome, but the cole slaw was unpleasant with kind of a weird taste to it. There are enough really great things there to keep me coming back but I find myself needing to keep track of which things they do well and which should be skipped. (No slaw, I'll have a salad instead). I also get irked at some underhanded things I've run into such as ordering a drink during happy hour but being charged full price for it, and then getting an explanation \"you ordered dinner, and we charge full price for a drink if you have it with dinner.\" But of course that doesn't appear on any sign or the menu, I guess you're supposed to read their minds before ordering."}
{"text":"The food is Caribbean with lots of seafood and jerk chicken (which is indeed spicy). I'm not a fan of spicy or seafood, but I did enjoy the conch and corn chowder, sweet potato fries, and chicken wings. The fried conch fritters were super chewy and the jerk chicken sandwich I got had super extra dry chicken and was hard to eat. The paella was also a big hit at my table. It seems they change their menu quite a bit but their HH (beginning at 4:30pm) seems good. They also seem to have good specials (like Filipino special dinners and fried chicken nights) that I'd recommend people trying."}
{"text":"I've got no complaints with Kaya. Sure, like any decent restaurant in Pittsburgh, they get busy during prime hours. 

They have a rotating selection of great beers, some good standbys in bottles, and adept bartenders who can mix a great drink on or off their seasonally changing cocktail menu.

The food here runs the gamut of Caribbean and American fare. Some of my favorites are the flank steak salad, cuban sandwich, or green curry for lunch and the paella, fish tacos, or the burger for dinner [note: their burger is stacked and loaded, good luck on that first bite]. 

Outdoor seating on a sunny afternoon is great. Parking can be trouble, but that's the case anywhere in the Strip. It's worth the time you'll spend circling for a place or the $5 for parking on the warehouse side of Smallman."}
{"text":"We heard such good things about Kaya... Sadly, those recommendations were way off!
My wife and I ate there tonight and I am sorry, but the only thing we had all night with any taste (seasoning) was the sauce the Conch fritters came with. If there was a bright side, our server was nice enough.
25+ minutes after the appetizer was removed from the table, the entrees arrived, here is the recap:
My wife is 7 months pregnant, she eats just about everything in site nowadays and tonight she didn't have the desire to finish her dinner... She had the Jerk pork quesadilla that even she said had ZERO taste. I tasted the pork by itself, and I concur.
I had the supposed infamous Kaya burger (medium well)... Where do I begin? The burger was beyond well done, dry and had only the char taste of the grill. The egg was tasteless, cooked too long and thus couldn't run when cut, no doubt because of the far too long of a wait. The bun was from yesterday, the sauce on it had no spice or flavor and how the hell does bacon have no taste?!?! 
Look, a lot of places screw up the egg on the burger concept, but this was by far an insult and theft of $15... At only $8 the ENP breakfast burger blows the Kaya burger away!
We have been to a few restaurants that screw up either her's or my dish, but both, and for neither to have any taste?... So disappointed!"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to come to Kaya for a very long time. My mom is a vendor near by and I always see people eating outside when the weather is nice! Finally we got to try it out Sunday for brunch:)

I have never had paella before and I was happy to see they had a tropical paella with chicken, shrimp, chorizo, mussel and rice. I am not a fan of mussel so I told the waiter to leave them out so it doesn't go to waste. My mom ordered the black bean, shrimp and jalapeño omelet  but requested just the shrimp and cheese be left in it. The table beside us received their food and it wasn't long before two of the three sent their dishes back. Our plates came out and my moms came out with jalapeños and black beans, so her dish went back to the kitchen to be fixed. The manager was very apologetic and took the omelet off the bill. When mine came out, scallops were mixed in with the paella and I am also not a fan of scallops. I didn't say anything, I just picked around them, but it would have been helpful to know that these were included in the paella as well. I did feel bad wasting them, but I will say that the paella was bursting with flavor. It's a bit on the spicy side, but it was not lacking in the flavor department that's for sure. I would recommend this true Caribbean dish! All in all, the kitchen may have been having an off day since certain peoples dishes didn't come out as requested; I would still come back to try other menu items!"}
{"text":"Some great tasting and original dishes, everything was at least good - if not great. Service was standard big burrito quality.

Very, very fair prices and portions are generous. 

Tables are very close, and I do recommend reservations as the place get's quite busy.

Definitely worth a visit - full write up on site.

{"text":"Fish tacos are awesome, flanks steak is awesome, Cuban sandwiches, well, let's just say I haven't had anything I didn't love here. The only thing is that sometimes a few dishes are too spicy for me. Nice atmosphere, friendly bartenders, definitely recommended."}
{"text":"Kaya has one of the very best happy hours in town, and the space inside is nice.  

Pros:

Good happy hour
I will knife fight you for the last glob of the bean dip, it is THAT good.

Cons:
The service is iffy and the staff can be rude.  Dont try going there without a reservaton and expect to be seated at a table without the hostess letting you know she is BOTHERED

The food is just ok.  It is not great.  In my opinion, this is the weakest of the Big Burrito's restaurants.  I ordered Paella the last time I was there and it was so pungently fishy it was inedible and I had to send it back

If you dine here, stick to the appetizers and enjoy some good cocktails.  I'll go here again, but this is not my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Kaya, along with the other Big Burrito restaurants, is great. Lots of veggie options (I LOVE the black bean and pineapple quesadilla), great atmosphere... Also great for brunch."}
{"text":"3.5 or 4 stars .My friend told me we were going to a Carribean place.... This is not what I expected. My experience  with Carribean places has been shabby restaurants with great authentic food made with soul. This place didn't involve plastic furniture or island accents. I was suspicious especially when a hostess asked if we had reservations? Anyhow I had my 5 year old son with me. The menu is not what I would call kid friendly, nor is the ambience. My kid was on best behavior for some reason but I wouldn't suggest bringing yours here.  We shared the jerk wings with a killer cilantro sauce yum o. My friend had a chowder and crab cakes while I tucked into \"the best burger in Pittsburgh\". The best burger involves an egg and guacomole and bacon on the burger, not the best that I have had, I feel that Primanti Bros could offer some competition if burger judges weren't apathetic to that chain. My friend liked her food a lot. I ended up getting the lava cake a la mode which was decent because chocolate is always decent.

It's OK.. Seems like a nice date night spot but don't come expecting authentic Carribean dishes."}
{"text":"I have never been attracted to try Kaya, but in total fairness, the Big Burrito chain is not in my budget as a graduate student. However, the $10 off an entree coupons I got in the mail made it possible for me to try Kaya last Sunday with two friends.

Our table ordered drinks, most of which ranged from $9 to $15.  I ordered a Mojito ($9). It wasn't very strong, but it was aesthetically pleasing and tasted OK.

We ended up ordering the Jerk Pulled Pork Quesadilla ($14) and Crispy Fish Tacos ($18) to split amongst the three of us.  Both came with 3 sections/ 3 tacos. The Quesadilla was spicier than I expected but good. There was plenty of meat, but I wanted more cheese.  However, I preferred the fish tacos. There was so much fried fish in these tacos, and the slaw and cilantro mix was perfect.  The three tacos would have been enough food for a meal and a half for one person.

Similar to Casbah, I find the Caribbean ambiance odd with the menu. However, I do like the theming of the restaurants. 

While Kaya is not in my budget since it is a bit pricey in relation to the quality, I did enjoy my meal and the ambiance."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch, so I don't know anything about dinner- but brunch was good! The orange juice is fresh-squeezed and is some of the best I've had. We had the queso app and it was fantastic- the pita bread is soft and delicious! Husband had salmon eggs benedict and loved it. It comes with a heaping portion of pineapple, which I can only assume most people take home for later. I had the paella, which was good but not great. They lose a star for service- we didn't have a reservation (didn't know we needed one for brunch- don't make our mistake!!!) so they if ignored our 2-person table for most of our meal. We had to call the waitress repeatedly. Note, the tables are very close together, so when I say \"call her\" she was standing right next to me, checking on the table to my left and to my right but outright ignoring our table. Took them 20 minutes (not exaggerating) to bring the leftovers *after* paying. If it wasn't pricey I would've left, but the busboy was very courteous when I pointed out that he still had not brought them back. Overall, make a reservation and you will have a great 5-star experience!!!"}
{"text":"Met some friends there on a Friday night and had a reservation which I recommend. The waitress really sold us on the fish tacos which  we all ended up ordering.  She actually recommended that my friend and I split the tacos because the plate was so big.  Worked out well!  I could only eat 1 and a half tacos, and the original plate came with 3.  The tacos were OK.  Not the best I have ever had, great flavor, but the fish wasn't as crunchy as I would have liked.  The prices were also really high, I think.  17$ for tacos is a lot.  We had some starters too, corn and lentil balls and tuna tartar.  The corn and lentil balls were good, the tuna was just OK.  They did have a great beer list selection and our waitress was great!"}
{"text":"I've honestly never had the food but Kaya has one of the best happy hours in Pittsburgh! 1/2 off all single serving drinks and draft beer Monday-Friday from 4:30-6:30! It can't really be beat. 

When I wrote about it on my blog: https://www.nataliezazula.com/adventure/2017/10/17/pittsburgh-happy-hours

I love Kaya's happy hour for what it offers and because it begins at 4:30! Kaya's happy hour features  1/2 off all single serving drinks and all craft draft beers. What an ideal combination. It is located right in the Strip District on the corner of Smallman and 20th.

Kaya is a Caribbean restaurant and that reflects in its cocktail list. My favorite drink is the Caipirinha. It is the national drink of Brazil with an ingredient list of leblon cachaca, demerara and lime. Confused? Me too. Cachaca is also known pinga or caninha and is Brazil's most commonly distilled alcoholic beverage and it is closest related to rum."}
{"text":"Came here for the Kamayan meal that they serve on Tuesdays. I called them the day before and was able to get a table (although it was on the early side--5:15 PM for dinner). The kamayan meal is a traditional Filipino meal served family style on bamboo leaves and meant to be eaten using your hands. It did not disappoint.

Kaya took creative license to modernize the dishes a bit. For example, they made ribs with a banana ketchup barbecue sauce. The chicken adobo utilized chicken wings. The beef bistek was perfectly seasoned and the fish was cooked to perfection.

I docked a star for two dishes that were just okay: the mussels and the shrimp. Both were flavorless. But don't let these two dishes ruin the experience for you! The meal was overkill--definitely a lot for three people and a great value for $35/person."}
{"text":"Love love love love love Kaya!  One of my favorites in the 'Burgh.  Great specialty cocktails (love the Frozen mojito and the Lava Lover), great appetizers (I recommend the Mango-Tomatillo Salsa and Bean Dip with their house made chips) and some of the yummiest Fish Tacos ever.  Even better has been the service on my multiple visits here... I find the staff friendly, knowledgeable (when my friend asked about an odd beer on their menu, she described it to a T and offered her a sample before a whole glass as it was on draft), and attentive.  If you have not been to Kaya, I highly recommend checking it out!"}
{"text":"Great Strip District bar and restaurant!

The ambiance was causal, urban, caribbean.  The music was not too loud, creating a relaxing atmosphere for a late afternoon (3pm) meal.  

The service was prompt and attentive.  Bethany seated me immediately and checked in with me frequently throughout the meal!  The general manager (Monica? I believe?) was very pleasant.  There was a slight problem with the timing of one of my dishes and the general manger handled the minor setback graciously and professionally.  Thank you!

The food was delicious!!!! I had the basil infused margarita.  It was not a sweet drink (which I like) and the basil added a refreshing after taste. The conch corn chowder was perfect!!! I have never had conch and I am so glad that my first experience with conch was pleasant- I will definitely experiment more with it.  I ended my meal with the Kaya Burger.  Everything I read online was true... It's a good burger! The fried eggs was drizzled perfectly from the bun and the special sauce added tremendous flavor.  I did not have to add salt/pepper/ketchup to anything.  All of the dishes were ready to eat as is.  

Cheers to a great meal at Kaya! 

Only one critique: one of the staff members began sweeping. I respect and understand her efforts to clean up during this down time just  before the 5pm happy hour rush hits.  But, I wish she had waited before pulling back the chairs and sweeping both tables DIRECTLY flanking me.  Kicking up dust from a broom on either side of meanwhile eating was not pleasant.  If she could have stayed one table distance away with the dust/broom, I would have appreciated that courtesy."}
{"text":"We had an absolutely wonderful experience here! It can get a bit pricey, but the quality of the food and the portions do not disappoint! Our bill came to around $150 (tip included) for appetizers, dinner and drinks for 4 (with leftovers to take home!).

Autumn was our server and she was just splendid! She made thoughtful recommendations for both food and drinks, which was wonderful for our indecisive group! We had the margarita and the ___ which was a refreshing cucumber drink. Both were delicious!

We started with the Bean Dip and the Shrimp/Avacado Bruschetta. The dip was great, served with crispy and seasoned house-made chips. Warning: The Bruschetta was delicious but VERY HOT. I knew there would be a hint of habnaero, but our mouths were on FIRE! 

Our server told us that each order comes with 3 tacos, but if we are splitting orders, they will give you 4 for no upcharge! That's a pretty amazing deal when the 3 tacos are already a very generous portion!

We heard the fish tacos were very popular, so we had to go with an order of those! I'm not normally a huge fan of fish tacos, but these were so enjoyable! It was topped with cabbage slaw and a spicy cream sauce. The fish was rich, but not overpowering.

My favorite part of the meal was the Tempura Avocado Bahn Mi Tacos! What a unique dish! The flavor was amazing and I can't wait to have them again! It was topped with carrot, radish,cilantro, yuzu mayo, & cucumber. Our server told us that they can add any type of protein to them, so we also had shrimp on them also. Yuuuuuuuuuuuuuum!

They serve their tacos on Reyna's tortillas, so I love the local aspect as well!

I was very impressed with the quality of the food and the service. I'll definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"This is a review for their catering, which I had the pleasure of trying yesterday.

When I think of Caribbean food, I don't really think \"vegetarian-friendly\" but Kaya does a really great job of blasting that misconception to smithereens.

I very much enjoyed the veggie Cuban sandwich - I have had sauteed mushrooms and cheese on bread many times in my life, but never has it been so delicious! The black bean spread is super flavorful and it makes for a wonderful sandwich experience. The chips are great too, and the cilantro-lime dressing from the salad makes the perfect dipping sauce for everything.

The salad itself is a little plain - basically just mixed greens and pepitas. But man, that dressing is good! The other lackluster item was the veggie paella. It was less flavorful overall, and there was hardly any pineapple. Due to time in transit, the rice had clumped up quite a bit. It also lacked the crispy crust I expect on a paella.

Looking at Kaya's menu, I'm intrigued to go check it out in person, but I'll have to save it for a special occasion (it's pretty pricey). I wish the veggie cuban was on their regular menu - it's sooooo good!"}
{"text":"Kamayan Review Only

Every Tuesday, Kaya does Kamayan Night.  It is a traditional Filipino feast where the food is laid out in front of you on top of banana leaves, and you just go HAM on it.  No utensil and no rule.  Our server said Kamayan at Kaya has a Caribbean twist to it.  While not all the dishes are made traditionally, the kamayan is pretty damn close.  We also observed that every table had a least one Filipino in the party.  If they come back to this, that's good enough for me!  The presentation was mouthwatering.  We watched as they set up the whole table, dish by dish.  The amount of food is too much to deal.  We did our best and were still able to pack two full containers home.

My favorites are the fried fish and the adobo chicken wings.  I've heard the fried fish is on the regular menu.  I also love the avocado salad.  The pineapple/mango dipping sauce goes well with the lumpia.  The shrimp and mussels topped everywhere were the icing to the cake.

Kamayan is a really fun way to get a glimpse into the Filipino cuisine, which is often underrepresented in the US."}
{"text":"On my epic voyage to Pittsburgh we had had friends take us via car (fancy) to a little district called the Strip. It's a unique, thriving little area that has definitely developed over the past few years. My sister says it was a completely different place ten years ago. You'll see vendors with fresh produce, breads, meats, cheeses, flowers, etc. Free samples from restaurants. Antiquing galore. I was digging it. Then we stopped in this restaurant to regroup everyone together for a drink and lunch. 

I wasn't particularly starving so opted to split a dish with my sister. It was a vegetable Paella and it was most def. pretty delicious. There were chunks of fresh zucchini, pineapple, peas, carrots and melded well together. If I were more hungry I would have totally got this SUPER DELICIOUS looking slow cooked pork sandwich with banana! The guy across from me was eating it and he looked like he was creaming his pants over it. He said the banana and pork just melted together. A few people got the non-vegetarian paella, which looked better but more filling: chorizo, chicken, mussels, shrimp, scallops. A full freaking meal. They enjoyed it. Someone else had fish tacos and they looked supreme. 

Drinks were pretty tasty too. I had a fancy mango mai tai. Only complaint is really the price for their cocktails is a little up there. $10 for a drink that was exceptionally fruity and not very strong is very New York. I was hoping for something very Pittsburgh. Second complaint is that the bathroom was a little way too dark. I almost couldn't find the toilet paper after coming in from the glaring sun to a low red lit bathroom. But that's not a biggie. This is a solid restaurant."}
{"text":"It's been about a month since I've been, but I'm still dreaming about the pulled pork quesadilla. I tasted everyone's selections, and they were sublime.  It is a hefty price, but this is the kind of food you want to splurge on. We tried many of their drink specials, all of which are good. The last drink I chose was a margatini (tequila martini-ish) and it was delicious. As for the other drinks, my memory has grown foggy, but I'll update with specifics after my next visit. 

The ambiance is great, dark but boldly lively with oranges and reds.  I recently moved back from Pittsburgh, and I was surprised to see the place so quiet on a Friday night. I remember the strip being much more vibrant when I was in high school. I guarantee that this restaurant would have a wait every night of the week in Chicago."}
{"text":"Jerk chicken quesadilla was extremely soggy on one side. Pricey beer. 
Loved sitting outside and people watching though."}
{"text":"Bobby was stumped on where to go for his birthday. We literally sat in the car for 15 minutes before he decided on a Caribbean dish. I instantly thought of Kaya since we never been and it was on my list of places to try.

We arrived around 630pm. We were informed inside was booked for the night from reservations but outside seating was available. It was a nice night so we decided why not.

For appetizer, we tried the 'Jumbo Lump' Crab Cakes ($11). They were absolutely delicious but it was a very small appetizer. Two tiny patties. Luckily it was just two of us sharing.

For entrees, I went with the Jerk Chicken Thighs ($18) which came with 3 thighs over well seasoned red beans & rice. It also came with a side of tomatoes, avacado & jalapeño which went great with red beans and rice. The entree also had a few pieces of perfect pita bread. 

Bobby ordered the Skirt Steak ($27)  mainly because he wanted ox tail. The steak was seasoned so well, full of flavor and it was delicious!. I tried ox tail for the first time and I loved it as well.

Our server was friendly but seemed to disappear towards end of our meal. We waited a little while at the end to be checked on & get our bill.

I'm glad we experienced Kaya. It had a nice menu.. Not too big and overwhelming but enough dishes to want to try back. They had a great list of sandwiches under $15. 

I'm excited to head back.  I heard about their amazing happy hour plus brunch!"}
{"text":"Kaya was highly recommended online and by our hotel, and it was our first stop in Pittsburgh which was also the first stop on our honeymoon. It was delicious! Cold beer, corn and lentil beignets as an appetizer, Caribbean Rainbow Salad with crispy tofu added, and Tempura Avocado Bahn Mi Tacos with waffle fries. It was a perfect, hearty meal. Check it out! It's beautiful, cozy, and we had great service."}
{"text":"This place was highly rated on some website that my wife found. I think that it's a little more hyped up than it should be. 

The place has a cool feel. Really cool area. Tons of parking. They paid attention to details when putting the place together. 

The prices were a bit high. We had the fish tacos and skirt steak. Both were good but nothing to write home about. For what we paid, I wish that it had a little bit more."}
{"text":"Kaya, a Caribbean restaurant, is my least favorite Big Burrito restaurant. I ate dinner there with three friends. I just was not impressed with the taste. The menu changes daily but has foods such as conch hush puppies, ceviche, tacos, jerked chicken, steak, and burgers. They offer several dishes for vegetarians. The waiter did his job well."}
{"text":"Came here for their Sunday brunch one weekend in November. A little late on reviewing but here we go... First off, the service was great and staff was super friendly. The food was excellent and prices were ok for the food. I gave them 3 stars for the fact that not only does brunch not include any drinks, but they charge $10 a mimosa for the small champagne glass size. That's f*ing ridiculous! Won't come back, as I don't like feeling ripped off."}
{"text":"This is a bit of a one-off review.  I enjoy Kaya.  If I was being objective about the restaurant overall, the review would probably be a solid 4 stars...but the thing is...

I just ate the best thing I've had in 2018 there the other night.  And I feel like all things considered that has to make it a 5 star review.  Compounding this is the strong possibility that the best thing I ate in 2017 was ALSO here; a Caribbean re-imagining of poutine that knocked my socks off.

So I'm not really REALLY reviewing Kaya so much as one spectacular dish on Kaya's menu.  I can't vouch for all the food.  Some might be good, some might not be to your liking...

But this past week I had their \"Fried Chicken Tuna Poke Bowl\": sticky rice, yuzu, Fresno, mayo, pineapple, cucumber, mango, edamame, avocado, seaweed, sesame, tobiko, garlic, cilantro...all of this is stuff I loooooove.  But...but...what's missing from this description is the fried chicken.  I know you're wondering, how does THAT play with this asian adjacent, Hawaiian \"fish salad\"???

Like the right hand of a ragtime piano player: syncopated, crisp, bright and joyful.  Off the poke beat perhaps, but completely and satisfyingly fitting into the gaps, the element of crunch otherwise missing from the dish, a comfortable savor in the midst of the tangy acidity and asian spice.

And, best of all, it's the bowl.  The poke is served in a bowl MADE of fried chicken.  Right-hand-to-god I'm not sure what could have made it better...bacon?  I don't know.  I probably would have collapsed at that point. 

When I ordered it our server scribbled it onto her pad, a slight smile creasing the corner of her mouth.  Nodding almost imperceptibly she said, \"good choice\" and I knew this was no polite, \"make the customer feel good about his selection,\" patter, no well-practiced rote response.  She and I shared something that day.  We communed mind to mind and her message was...\"oh, you are going to enjoy this...\" then \"get out of my head...don't make this creepy.\"

I don't know how frequently Kaya changes their menu.  But I know this: 
 Possibly the best thing I ate in all of 2017, the poutine, was not on the menu.  So you owe it to yourself to try this before the menu changes. 

*A note about the chicken-bowl...it was a bit overdone (a tad dry).  I'm assuming it was pounded very thin and wrapped around a bowl or form prior to frying, which meant it was super easy to overcook when made crispy enough to hold the shape.  THAT.  DIDN'T.  DETRACT.  But by way of coming completely clean about the experience, if you try this because you're a fried chicken purist, you'll miss the magic."}
{"text":"This is without a doubt one of my favorite restaurants. If you like fish tacos, then you won't want another one after eating here. There is something about these tacos that I just fell in love with. The portion is so huge that I always take half of them home with me. 

I love Kaya because it is laid back enough that you can go in jeans and a jersey or you can go a little more dressy. It is a cool and comfortable vibe there and just another notch on the belt of the wonderful restaurants in the Big Burrito Group. 
The corn beignets are to die for and are paired so well with the curry sauce. Everything that I have had here has not been a disappointment. The desserts and drinks and slightly cheaper than Eleven down the street and the entrees are more reasonably priced.  However, you do not lose the flavor in these dishes with the decrease in price. 

Go here! You will love it!"}
{"text":"We were walking by and peeked looking for a place to eat a lite late dinner. The hostess really sold us on this place so we stayed.

The fish tacos were good and so were the wings. We didn't care for the green sauce that came with the Jamaican wings but other than that it was delish.

Service was pretty good."}
{"text":"I figure Kaya is about as good as any place to start with my reviews!  My one friend visits every year for a Steelers game and she always makes it a point to go here for dinner.  Definitely good for me since I sometimes forget that it's there!

I love the decor of this place...the caribbean theme with the colorful paintings and tiki heads hanging on the walls!  Unfortunately we didn't make dinner reservations and were forced to sit on the bongo-style stools with no seat back!  Liz the bartender completely made up for it - started off with their signature Kayapolitan which found its perfect spot between sweet and tart.  Then she made us her own secret cucumber concoction.  I didn't really believe the cucumber part of the drink until she actually pulled the cucumber out and sliced it up.  The drink was AMAZING...highly recommend it if she's there to make it!

We started off with the Seared Sea Scallops, PEI Mussels and the Calamari.  There's no doubt that they were all great, but out of the 3, the Mussels were by far my favorite...portion was huge!  For dinner I ordered the Grilled Salmon Salad...I loved the spiced pecans, crumbled bleu and sliced apples.  The salmon was also grilled to perfectly.  Between the food and Liz as our kick-ass bartender this was a great way to start off our Saturday night!"}
{"text":"I recently went to Kaya's monthly vegetarian prix fix dinner, complete with wine pairings. I ordered all of the vegan options. I was not entirely impressed...

The amuse, a beet ceviche, was delicious -- I would have traded out my main course for a big bowl of it. The two bite portion was a true tease.

Course one was roasted potatoes, meh. These were served with a green tomato ketchup which tasted too much like heinz for me to give a shit. OK, it did have notes of apple which was slightly interesting. But also served on the side was a \"sour cream\" and onion dip that was pretty yummy and had hints of horseradish.  I think the \"sour cream\" base is the same as that used at Mad Mex.

Second course was Chilled English Pea Soup. I LOVE raw english peas, thus appreciated the imagination of this soup (I believe it was a raw dish). However, I would have just as soon cracked open fresh pods, enjoying the full texture of nature's candy. Toward the bottom of my bowl of soup, I realized that blenderization diminishes the essence of peas, and felt slightly sad.

Carrot-lime intermezzo -- fine.

Third course was a big disappointment. Roasted Porchini Arepas sounded exciting (\"what are arepas?\"), but it tasted rather plain. The arepa was dry; dying for some of that \"sour cream\" and onion condiment from course one. The mushrooms were delicious, as mushrooms are, and that is my only compliment for this course. Crispy sweet potato fries were served on the side, but again with no condiments and I had had my fill of potatoes at course one. This course lacked moisture and flavor all around.

So why three stars instead of two? Dessert was amazing. \"Strawberry Pound Cake\" is the strawberry short-cake I have been dreaming about for 13 years (about the length of time I have been vegan). Probably not all that difficult to make, but wow, those strawberries were good (I surmise they were local, yay)!

The mignardises, chili chocolate, was like a slightly spicy m&m. Cute.

To quote Kaya's website, \"The menus emphasize flavor and variety, presenting familiar foods in exciting ways, and making exotic foods delightfully accessible.\" I feel that exotic foods were completely lacking from this meal and that the emphasis was placed on creativity with familiar foods. Plantains would have been an excellent substitution for one of the potato dishes. The meal was full of \"American\" flavor with very little suggestion of \"island\" influence (ie. lime and cilantro). Perhaps they strive to use local ingredients, which would be cool, but there were no indications of that on the menu. No, I am not going to lay into a discourse to define \"American\" cusine, but hey, the restaurant is located in the U.S., admittedly serves \"fusion\" styles and the kitchen boys were white; probably studied culinary arts in 'merica. I mean that one should not expect an exotic experience at Kaya, though one should expect, demand even, an imaginative and quality meal.

The wine pairings were all perfectly on point; I owe much to this in creating what was generally a lovely meal. 

The service was also excellent. We had come in from the rain and were soaked; the host brought us towels to dry ourselves. Our server made intense eye contact which, in my eyes, made her an attentive communicator.

The ambiance was nice, with exception for the tv airing CNN in the front corner; it wasn't obtrusive, but it was there. I did not care for the seating. The tables were close together, and there was a great distance across the table between my date and I, thus at Kaya, you will often be sitting closer to your neighbor than your companion. 

Thankful to the date who paid,
Heidi"}
{"text":"Loved this place. Great atmosphere. Had the kaya chips and Rainbow salad. Really refreshing and delicious."}
{"text":"Kaya is one of those restaurants that's been on my radar forever.  I finally received the chance to try it out yesterday (Sun.) for brunch at 1pm with a friend.  Given that I was taking her out for my birthday, that she'd taken me out for brunch at Marty's Market, and that I had a $10 off coupon, Kaya seemed like a natural choice.  As an added bonus, it's GF friendly (my friend is a GF eater), which is a rarity for brunch.

We started off by ordering the chips and guac ($8).  While a bit pricey, the guac was clearly freshly made, containing chunks of pineapple and mango in addition to avocado.  The flavor was good, though not as limey as other versions I've had--likely to avoid overpowering the flavors of the other tropical fruits.  In addition to the appetizer, my friend ordered a Bloody Mary with Old Bay vodka ($11).  Unfortunately, she didn't end up drinking much of it due to it being too spicy for her taste.  If the bartender noticed, she didn't say anything, which was kind of a bummer, since it wasn't exactly cheap.

For our entrees, I ordered the Caribbean eggs Benedict ($12), and my friend ordered the huevos rancheros ($10).  This version of eggs Benedict substituted cornbread for the English muffin and pulled pork for Canadian bacon, with the usual poached eggs on top.  While I enjoyed this take on the dish, I must confess that I missed the Hollandaise sauce, which is my favorite component of traditional eggs Benedict (I make a mean one myself!).  Having said that, the pulled pork and cornbread combination was quite flavorful, and the runniness (sp?) of the egg yolk mimicked the consistency of Hollandaise.  Though I didn't try my friend's huevos rancheros, she enjoyed them, and the bacon accompanying it looked absolutely delicious.  Both of our dishes came with sides of grilled pineapple and potato hash.  While the grilled pineapple was flavorful and moist but firm, complementing my eggs Benedict nicely, the hash was rather dry and flavorless, and I was not a fan of the onions and peppers mixed in.  Personally, I'd have preferred plain old home fries--but then again, I suppose that would be too pedestrian for the likes of an upscale-ish brunch at Kaya.

Overall, my friend and I enjoyed our brunch at Kaya, despite some items not being exactly suited to our personal tastes.  Because we weren't able to get a reservation, we sat at the bar, which may explain why service wasn't quite up to par.  Despite what I'd thought from passing by, Kaya actually isn't *that* big--though there is a decent amount of seating, and the bar itself is quite large.  I look forward to returning for happy hour on a Thurs. to take advantage of half price drinks and fried chicken night!"}
{"text":"I have no idea why I never got around to reviewing Kaya seeing as it's been a staple in my Pittsburgh restaurant rotation since I moved here. In fact, it was the first \"nice\" meal I had in Pittsburgh, before I even made my official move...I celebrated my 21st birthday here! Although it's not one of my very very favorite spots in the 'burgh, the food is consistently good and the Carribean-inspired fare is something that I normally wouldn't gravitate toward, so it's nice when I want something a bit different than the standard \"New American.\"

I mostly come here for their brunch, and one of the big reasons is that it's served until 3pm! The only thing is, make sure you show up at least 15 minutes before that...the \"brunch kitchen\" closes at 3 o'clock sharp, unlike sister restaurant Casbah, which seats for brunch until 2pm but won't rush your ordering. Anyway...my favorite thing on the brunch menu is the roasted pork benedict with grilled pineapple. The Chilaquiles (basically, breakfast nachos) are also delicious, weird as they may sound. And the Kaya Burger is always a safe choice.

The dinner menu changes, so I've never ordered the same thing twice here. But everything I have had has been great. One of my favorite apps is the corn and lentil beignets--if you like spicy, get them! They also have a pretty large and super fun (read: girly) cocktail menu, and since they are tropical in nature, it's totally okay to imbibe at any time of the day! That's how that works, right? Riiight...?

They have a fried chicken night on Thursdays that a lot of people like. Kinda makes me wish I liked fried chicken so I could try it but I'm weird like that!"}
{"text":"I love Kaya.  It is a cool place with an interesting atmosphere.  I've dined here several times and have thoroughly enjoyed my experience every single time.  
It is a long, thin restaurant with a slightly larger room in the back.  When you walk in, there is a long bar on one wall and a long series of tables along the other wall.  The tables are easily configured so that you can have parties of two or move tables together for larger parties.  I've come with parties as large as eight and they were accommodating for any size party.
The menu has a variety of options and although it changes seasonally, there are some items that seem to be staples and always on the menu.  There are a wide variety of appetizers, really something that will please every palate.  What I like is that although entrees are on the pricier side ($20+ each) there are appetizers that are substantial enough that you can make a meal from one or two of them.  
My favorite entrée I've had was a steak with chili rellenos.  It was packed full of flavor and a pretty substantial portion size.  In terms of appetizers, my favorites have been the yucatan bean dip and conch fritters.  Both are unique and full of flavor.
The drink menu offers many tropical options and standard fare as well.  I did find the drinks a bit overpriced for the size you get, but they were very tasty.
Kaya is an enjoyable dining experience and I will be back/"}
{"text":"Kaya is a great experience in the Strip District of Pittsburgh. The atmosphere and service is always on point and the service is excellent. The menu is interesting, and very unique. Try the bean dip, it's magnificent. The cocktails are excellent too, more so in the summer than winter."}
{"text":"Too bad there is no 0 ** ratings.
We had Sat. lunch here. 
Ordered:  Kaya Chips with Mango-Tomatillo Salsa, Caribbean Rainbow Salad, Todo En Uno Cuban Sandwich with Gazpacho and spicy slaw.
Except of enormously huge portions there is nothing positive to write about. The food was tasting just awful, and who needs huge portions of tasteless food? Definitely not us, so more than a half of it was left on the plates.
The service was not any better then food. LOOONG waits for everything.
The value was not good either. It was one of those VERY RARE cases when we didn't want to leave the tips greatly NOT deserved.
Where these \"positive\" reviews come from I don't know, but needless to say we're surely NOT coming back."}
{"text":"Hands down one of my favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh. Each visit I start with their amazing black bean dip, which comes with delicious chips. It has the perfect amount of spice. I've had several meals from their burger, the pulled pork quesadilla, and their Jamaican jerk chicken. The service is impeccable, and I've never had a bad experience. Cheers to Kaya!"}
{"text":"In general, a nice place and we had a very friendly server. I would probably give it a 3.5 if that was an option. And I would put it in the second-tier classes of good restaurant in Pittsburgh. It is a good experience but not excellent. This was my third time being there and all three times ordered their big salad but this time with Tofu. The option without Tofu is definitely better.  The tofu was quite without any taste and somewhat destroyed the salad experience. Also, the iceberg lettuce in the salad does not contribute to much of a great experience. Overall, I had a better memory of the dish that my recent experience."}
{"text":"Went for the monthly(Third wednesday of every month) seasonal vegetarian prix-fixe and it was wonderful. I can't give much more because I went a long time ago, but I will definitely return here in the future to update my review."}
{"text":"Found this place by using Yelp, of course, while wandering the streets of Pittsburgh. The BEST soft shell crab I've ever had! Loved the Caribbean theme, reminded me of the island that I love! Great atmosphere, food and staff!"}
{"text":"I've been trying to review Kaya for an embarrassing length of time. I'd start a draft, realize I wasn't doing this place justice, then I'd start over. I realize I'll never be able to summarize how incredible Kaya is, or how delighted it has made me over the years, but I can't leave the Pittsburgh area without attempting to express just how much I love Kaya.
There aren't enough available adjectives to describe the food. I always start the party with one of their magical appetizers. The lentil and corn beignets are always impressive, lightly fried and served with a wonderfully spicy green curry sauce. Perfect for sharing. The Yucatan hot bean dip with homemade chips may be the most addictive item on the menu. The rich, spicy-ish, slightly cheesy dip with those magnificently salty chips will make it difficult to carry on a conversation with your dining companions. You'll be too busy hollowing out that tasty dip. The tofu cracklins are enough to astound even the non-vegetarians with the chipotle honey BBQ flavor and crispy texture. The field green salad is served with possibly the world's best salad dressing. This lime cilantro vinaigrette should be bottled and sold. To me, specifically. With all of the amazing vegetarian appetizers, it's almost too difficult to save enough room for an entree.  But I do. Oooohhhh, I do.
Jerked. Tofu. Tacos. If Kaya only had one item on their menu and this was it, it would still be my favorite restaurant. Ever. Fresh, soft, warm tortillas with a mind blowing cilantro cream sauce, avocado, a cabbage slaw, peppers and tofu prepared so expertly you'll swear you might cry...but that's probably the jerk seasoning talking. Your order comes with three tacos, and they are large. The third one is perfect for lunch the following day, although you'll be sad you aren't actually eating it at Kaya. The Jamaican green curry vegetable dish is a spicy little number with saffron rice, potatoes, squash, peas, and pineapple. Each time you get a fork full with that pineapple covered in the creamy, fiery green curry, your eyes just might roll back in your head with delight. The veggie Kaya burger is a wondrous experience. Homemade veggie patty (no phoning it in with some frozen Boca burger here!), avocado, pickles, tomato, chihuahua cheese and a sunny side up egg. It's messy. It's large. It's heavenly. And with a side of sweet potato fries it's perfection. 
The brunch menu seems to change often. Just know that you can't go wrong with any of the Sunday offerings, whether it be chocolate chip waffles or huevos rancheros. Just be sure to try the Vampiro cocktail, with tequila and grapefruit juice. 
Cocktails at Kaya are inventive and exciting. Cocktail menu changes quite often and during happy hour everything is half price! My favorite drink I've experienced here has to be the mango Mai Thai. For the winter months, they've traded mango for pomegranate. Which is just fine with this girl. The cherry spritzer served in a champagne flute with it's bitter sweetness is hard not to love. The mojito is a reliable favorite. The dark and stormy is stupendous. The bartenders are very skilled and it makes all the difference in the world.
Service is always on point. Nice servers, who seem to remember us as we are there so often. I'm not sure if Chaz still waits tables at Kaya as I haven't seen him in quite sometime. He was the greatest, most knowledgable, friendliest server I've had in my life, and we'd always get excited when we knew he was waiting on us. If you happen to see him, consider yourself lucky. And please, tip him well. 
The vibe at Kaya is casual, Caribbean and inviting. Always a decent crowd at the bar sampling those stunning cocktails and ample amounts of seating. The lights are low, the music is funky, and I'm probably in a booth resisting the urge to lick my plate. 
Kaya is not only my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh. It's my favorite restaurant ANYWHERE. An exceptional dining experience all around. I could never do it justice with words. You'll have to check it out for yourself!"}
{"text":"I went to Kaya on 2/27 around 9pm.  All of the food was overcooked for each person's meal.  I ordered the conch fritters (and soup) and my boyfriend order the ribs for appetizer and salmon entree.  My conch fritters had such a crunch that the sauce provided was hardly sufficient for one fritter.  My food was so overcooked that the person next to me (not in my party) who also ordered conch fritters couldn't help but tell me he was in the same boat!  His food also was overcooked.

When my boyfriend's ribs were overcooked, I really urged him to return them to the kitchen.  However, he was reluctant out of fear that his food might be spat in.

I really wanted to impress my boyfriend for his birthday, but sadly it just wasn't possible with the look of disappointment he just couldn't hide.  I really had high hopes for this visit because I had a great one about a year ago.  But sadly something has changed.

Someone reached out to me to \"remedy the situation\" but never did.  I can assure you this is a place of false promises.  I wouldn't trust them for decent food or good service."}
{"text":"I haven't had anything I didn't like from this place yet. We've been here for brunch and dinners ordering the chicken and waffle, jerk chicken, corn beignets, tuna taco, kaya chips, and skirt steak. They also serve great cocktails and for brunch they offer bellini!! 

Try to make a reservation as the hostess here is pretty bad at managing tables. We came for brunch and got seated at the bar, which was fine. There were 6 of us, so it was a little harder to talk when there was an empty table for 6 with a reservation card on it. We had ordered, eaten and sat for a little while and never saw that party come in by the time we left."}
{"text":"I have been to Kaya a couple of times now and every single time I loved it so far. The staff is so friendly and knowledgeable and everyone always seems to have a smile on their face! Stepping into the place, it's dark and cozy. It's not the biggest place, but it gives it its flair and I love the decorations.

I have tried a couple of appetizers and seem to always order the \"conch hush puppies\" with spicy habanero aioli and mango! Absolutely delicious with a nice kick to it. Also, if you do love seafood you really cannot go wrong with the tropical paella. The serving was huge for the price at lunch time and very filling with a very generous portion of shrimp, scallops, mussels etc. It also has some nicely flavored chicken and chorizo in it. Definitely one of the best paella I have had so far in Pittsburgh. We have also tried the Flank Steak Cemita and what can I say? The meat was tender and oh so good. I have expected a \"normal burger\", but what I got was so much better than this. With all the food we tried the white sangria, which was very fruity and on the sweeter side, but delicious.

I have been here at dinner times and it can get very busy in here difficult to get a seat, but trust me, even if you have to wait, it's going to be worth it!"}

{"text":"I really love this restaurant.  I think they have some really, really awesome and unique food.  My parents live close by, so this is often a place that we drop in at on the spur of the moment.  The burger is so good, loaded high with delicious things.  I love the fish tacos!!!!  One time we went and sat outside, but there was a really bad smell coming from the street, which threw off my whole meal, so I probably wouldn't sit outside again.  It does get pretty crowded during prime time, but if you go a little early or a little late, you can usually sneak in without a reservation.  I am really glad they have quality places like this in this part of town."}
{"text":"One word for Kaya: Delightful! 
Been there for a dinner date on a Friday evening and I was surprised they took reservations. Our waitress that evening was extremely helpful. We have food restrictions, and she was nice enough to go over all the dishes which suited it. We LOVED the chicken wings (really spicy, so watch out!) We had the Seasonal Vegetable Paella, which was really nice. For drinks, I had the margharita special they had, which I felt wasn't strong. +1 for their service and food quality! Would go there again."}
{"text":"Great food. Awesome atmosphere. Outdoor seating available. Good margaritas. A+. Try the burger."}
{"text":"This visit was my second time here. Came for brunch with my friend and had a big burrito brunch coupon! Food and drinks were great, hostess service was kind of lacking. We called ahead to see about the wait and were left on hold and when we arrived, we stood at the door for a few minutes without anyone greeting us until we decided to just sit at the bar. So that is the reason for 4 stars instead of 5. I had a brunch entree that I would describe as brunch nachos. It had chorizo and a fried over easy egg on top. It was so good and different with the Caribbean flavors! Bloody Mary's were also good with pepper vodka!"}
{"text":"I always stop in here before going to events at Heinz Hall or The Benedum. The food is amazing and the tropical decor makes you feel like you are on vacation."}
{"text":"Checked this place out yesterday for lunch  and was very satisfied with my time here. The atmosphere was very fun and it seemed like they put a lot of effort into their decor. 

The first thing that I usually notice is how many vegetarian options a restaurant has, and Kaya did not let me down! It is rare that I can find so many things that I am able to eat that I actually have a difficult choice deciding. 

I ended up getting the tempura avocado tacos. It had jalapenos, carrots, cucumber and cilantro. I also got a side of the sweet potato fries, which I have to say I did not love. They were just too oily. The tacos were great though! Very filling. The only problem was I asked the waiter if they were spicy at all and he said no, which was a lie! Twas spicy! It seemed like everything might be a little spicy here, however, so beware if you do not like a bit of a kick."}
{"text":"This is an amazing place!  Great atmosphere, very clean, beautiful bar, and most importantly, great food!

Shoot for the fish tacos; yum!!!

The only reason I didn't rate this a 5 star was due to the service being quite slow and lackluster. Other than that, GO NOW!"}
{"text":"Huge fan of Pittsburgh but always get suckered into eating at some trendy place like that famous sandwich shop around the corner.

Words of advice:

Eat at Kaya at least once.  
It has a great ambiance to it. 
Nicely stocked bar, great service

I ordered Jerk chicken wings.  Huge chicken wings with a cool dipping sauce on the side...great start to a huge meal.

I washed down my wings with a Cuban sandwich.  Lots of taste to this thing.  Beats a sandwich with French fries on it any day.

Reasonable prices, food seems fresh and its in a great area."}
{"text":"Creative Menu and Delicious Food!

We were visiting Pittsburgh for the weekend and were so happy to discover this amazing restaurant in the Strip District.  What a creative menu inspired by the Caribbean Islands and South America!  

We ordered the Corn & Lentil Beignets with green curry sauce for the appetizer.  It was very good!  For the entree we shared the Jerk Chicken and Paella.  Both were to die for!!  Love love this place.  We will definitely make a trip back to Pittsburgh to eat at this creative restaurant."}
{"text":"Solid food and friendly, responsive bar staff. Can't wait to go back to try the burger! Glad to have it in my neighborhood."}
{"text":"Fish tacos are consistently delicious! I get them every time (or convince my husband to, so I can have a bite). Still love this place!"}
{"text":"I got the fish tacos and white wine sangria. Both were very tasty. My dinner mates got the Cuban sandwich and paella. Everyone enjoyed their food. Nice atmosphere, good food, pretty good service- I'd recommend giving it a try. 
They do seem a little obsessed with having a reservation (even if tables are empty), so I would get a reservation first, just to make sure you don't get turned away."}
{"text":"Love the fish tacos here. They give you 3 tacos in a corn tortilla filled with crispy fish and cabbage slaw, avocado, and cilantro. The tortillas are apparently Reyna's tortillas which is the taco stand down the street which means they're freshly made corn tortillas. The tacos are a bit on the pricey end for the size of the tacos. $17 for three fish tacos.

The burger is probably worth more the price of $12. It's topped with all my favorite condiments: pickles, sunnyside up egg, avocado, tomato, and bacon. Also comes with Kaya chips which seems to be a mixture of potato chips and plantain chips.

My only complaint is the way they handle seating and reservations. It's pretty hard to come here without a reservation. Even if the restaurant is empty you might not be able to get in without a reservation.

They did accommodate us this one time when we had an extra person than what we originally said when we made a reservation. They seated us at a larger table but told us we had to finish within an hour or so. That was enough time and it was nice of them to allow us to switch tables rather than turn us away."}
{"text":"UPDATE May 2, 2018: Shout out to the grilled salmon with ramp chimmichurri!!i started with the deviled eggs and ramps with ramp chips. They were good, but the rampiness was weak. Not so with the salmon which also came with grilled asparagus and jicama. Both the eggs and salmon came with micro greens! So freaking good!!

UPDATE: Tonight, I came for dinner and had the Manchengo and Avacado Deviled Eggs, Caribbean Jerk Pork and Plantain Nachos, and Grilled flank steak. Another delicious and healthy dish. The flank steak was cooked to a perfect medium rare (note that I wasn't asked how I wanted it cooked). Peppers, mushrooms, avocados, cilantro, and a corn salsa. The salsa was quite vinegary, but I am into fermented foods and I am wondering if the salsa was fermented...That would make it even healthier. If it is not fermented, they need to work on their salsa recipe. 

Last comment: they have my most favorite beer Dechutes Fresh Squeezed on tap along with some good local craft brews."}
{"text":"By far the most interesting and flavorful food I found in Pittsburgh! I just loved Kaya, and went there at least three times while I was there visiting. 

I could always count on delicious vegetarian meals, like the spectacular risotto with a fried egg on top, the green Jamaican curry, and the egg and avocado torta. The appetizers were also top notch, especially the lentil and corn beignets (don't try to tackle these on your own, though -- there's more than enough to share with about 4 people) and the tofu cracklins. 

The service was always great and the servers were genuinely excited about the food being served -- and were happy to share their favorites, or steer you away from a choice that may not be quite as good. 

The meat-eaters who I dined with were incredibly impressed with the double cut pork chop, and the fish tacos (a friend, also from California, said they were the best she'd ever tasted). 

The atmosphere is funky, and the prices are very reasonable, too. Definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"I went with a group of 6 friends for Sunday Brunch/Lunch. We were lucky to get a reservation a day earlier. The place usually gets booked for holidays for brunch. I was really looking forward to try the Island cuisine. The ambiance and service was pleasant and the appetizers were great. The cilantro- lime and cilantro cream sauce were unique and delicious. The Jamaican jerk wings were finger licking good, nice crispy skin with perfect spice-cover and juicy flesh with cilantro-cream sauce. The house-chips, black bean dip and mango salsa were great too. We ordered a plate of lentil-corn beignets too, after looking at the Yelp photographs , however was disappointed by the taste. The food went downhill from there. We ordered fish tacos and Huevos Rancheros. Two friends ordered the steal entree and shrimp omelette, which weren't all that amazing. I think the food severely lacked salt which is essential to bring out the real flavor in every dish. The Rancheros dish was too dry and bland and I couldn't finish mine, even after asking for extra sauce. One friend jokingly suggested that the appetizer menu looked so interesting, that we should just order all of them and make that our lunch. I wish we did that."}
{"text":"Delicious food and drinks! Our server was friendly and suggested some good items for us to try. We will come back to visit!"}
{"text":"Five Stars - Beer selection on draft!!!! Oh my, probably one of the best in the Burgh for american craft brews on draft.

Three Stars - Food.  I assumed because they do a vegetarian price-fixe at times they would have good vegetarian eats, but they were strikingly mediocre.  Maybe I'm just not into Caribbean, but the bland, soggy pile laid before me doused in coconut milk just didn't cut it.  I'm sure this is a more exciting restaurant for the meat eaters among us."}
{"text":"Try the Kaya burger. They know how to cook a rarer  burger. The happy hr was pretty good this was the first time we went for that and good selection on IPA's on tap. The bread pudding is really large. The Chips(lots of spices) are good but I like the Fry s"}
{"text":"It's alright.

The food has always been hit or miss for me. Some nights I'll get a delicious spread that I eat until I think my pants aren't going to button the next day and other nights I'll get somewhat 'okay' food. I've had mixed drinks before and they're strong- like no mixer strong. Which is fine if you're wanting to get wrecked but not fine if you plan on drinking it with your meal. 

The service varies according to what waiter you get. I've had some great service there but I've also had to literally chase down a waiter before in order to even get our order taken. They are pretty quick with getting food out and are on time with reservations, which is nice. 

The Kaya burger is delicious, but be prepared to eat it with a fork and knife. It's soggy as all get out but it's a delicious kind of soggy."}
{"text":"Excellent food and drinks. We just at off the tapas menu and they were able to accommodate our picky teens."}
{"text":"I saw this cute restaurant while I was walking this morning and decided to come in for dinner. The atmosphere is cute and the outdoor seating was very nice. The wait staff was pretty slow and kind of annoying. The food was good, not great. We got the spicy tuna poke and the pineapple seafood paella which were both just okay. Might be a little over priced for the portions."}
{"text":"Great!! Try the Vege burger for lunch!! Nice plated meal with a nice salad on the side. Good drinks and good fun.....Esp on a nice Saturday around the strip."}
{"text":"Planned on lunch there after reading the great reviews.  We started with the black bean dip.  When I noticed it was microwaved, we quickly paid our tab and went elsewhere to eat.  This is a neat little place with a cool Jamaican atmosphere, but the really have to lose the microwave.  I can make microwave dinners at home."}
{"text":"Happy Hours rock in general, but I have to admit I was impressed by Kaya's HH...1/2 off drinks - AWESOME!!! 

A friend I went there last week and we got the black bean dip (delish) and then I ordered the Jamaican jerk wings which I really enjoy with their cilantro cream sauce which is delectable. She got the fish tacos which I had a bite out of and they were sooooo good! 

We also got the BBQ Tofu thingy and have to admit - NOT a huge fan. There was little flavor to them and they had a cinnamony taste which was weird. Maybe I was expecting the Tofu that they have at Mad Mex as an appetizer (I think it's Asian inspired) which is really really good. 

So although I wasn't blown away by all the food, the fact that we were getting 1/2 off drinks and 90% of the food was very tasty - I think I'll check this place out more often!"}
{"text":"Kaya is a Big Burrito joint and aims to hit the Caribbean in both atmosphere and flavor profile. I would say it succeeds moderately well in both departments. 

We had a number of dishes and drinks so I think we got a decent cross section of their offering. 

We both started with the Pisco Sour (we can't say no to egg white froth!) and gave the jerk wings and the curried cauliflower a shot as apps. 

The wings were spicy in a good way, but not spectacular. In fact, they tasted like regular old wings with jerk sauce poured over them. They were, however, plated on a creamy herb sauce that was quite excellent. 

The cauliflower was good, and had an interesting sauce and pistachios that actually gave it a new angle. 

The main dishes were oxtail (from the Trinidad special menu) as well as the famous rainbow salad with flank steak. 

Although the oxtail was very good, the portion size was tiny and not commensurate with the $15 price tag. 

The salad, however, was something to write home about! Hot damn, that was the best salad \"as-a-meal\" I've ever had! It was colorful with a dozen different ingredients, well dressed and perfectly cooked flank steak chunks. I would honestly go back for this salad alone. 

We sat at the bar, and service was decent, despite the busy night. All in all a good experience!"}
{"text":"We were disappointed here. It was Sunday brunch, so perhaps this is not representative of the other items on the menu. I had the crab omelet ($10) and it was okay, but the crab didn't taste completely fresh. I dunno, maybe it is a Pittsburgh thing.  The strong mustard (infused with horseradish?) was a good addition to the flavor however. My dining companion had the curry vegetables ($10) and she was less than enthused. The best part was the appetizer of Kaya chips and Caribbean salsa ($7). Service was so-so. Our waitress seemed indifferent.

{"text":"Visited Kaya for the first time yesterday with a friend who loves the place.  It was around 3:30 and basically empty with the exception of a couple sitting at the bar, so we decided we'd also just take our place there.  The menu is small (1 page), but theres a lot of variety to choose from.  Reluctantly, I ordered the Kaya burger (I'm not really a burger fan and DEFINITELY not a bacon fan) because my friend gave me a couple of her faves and the burger was right on top, so I took her advice and went with that, cooked Med Well, with a side of sweet potato fries, and let me tell you, i ate every. last. bite.  it was that good.  So kudos to the cooks in the kitchen for making this hater of red meat and bacon clean her plate with no regrets!

We also ordered a pitcher of white sangria, which was OK.. I mean, we finished it so it wasn't bad, but I've had better (which is the only reason I gave this place 4 stars instead of 5.. but I've been told that the other drinks are amazing so maybe there will be a review update in my future). 

All in all, I really liked Kaya.  The theme and the decor was cool I thought, and the service was good.  Not fabulous, not horrible.. just your basic good service, and thats ok with me.  I was with a friend and enjoying stuffing my face with everything that I would normally never touch, so I wasn't looking for a chatty bartender anyway. Thumbs up, Kaya!"}
{"text":"Mmm mmm good paella! So tasty. Highly recommend. 

Red sangria? Yes! 

Service? Really good. 

I've been hitting this place for the last three years and never have I been disappointed."}
{"text":"While I agree this place isn't an authentic Caribbean spot I think they do a good job of incorporating A Caribbean flare to the dishes. 

I got the flank steak and oxtail which came served over a plantain and squash hash. It was great! So flavorful and tender. The oxtail meat was shredded in with the hash. If you've ever had oxtails you know how difficult they can be.

My fiancé ordered the fried chicken sandwich. It was good but wasn't that great. He did swap things around so it could of been amazing the original way. 

Will definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"Went crazy here a few nights ago and ordered about eight dishes. The tuna, calamari, Nachos, chicken wings were fantastic. The burger is always the best. Ceviche was a great addition as well as the fish tacos. Flank steak was really tasty but a little tough. Otherwise, perfect meal."}
{"text":"I've been here many times and have never had a bad meal.  Stopped in for dinner recently on a Monday night with friends and we went crazy on the appetizers menu: tuna poke, bean dip, jerk wings, Tennessee-style drumsticks, conch fritters, green lentil and corn beignets. Top that off with some of the tastiest craft cocktails you can find and you'll be in store for an amazing dinner."}
{"text":"Easily the best culinary experience I had while visiting Pittsburgh. My boyfriend ordered the roasted chicken, which was succulent and well accompanied. I opted for the Cuban sandwich since I'm a junkie for the things... It was one of better renditions I've had outside of Miami."}
{"text":"Loved my fish tacos. Outside seating was perfect on a nice day. Only gripe was that my date's fish sandwich was very dry, especially with the dry bun used. 

Oh, bean dip and chips were awesome too."}
{"text":"Kaya was great for Sunday brunch and during happy hour (rated separate days).

Chiliquiles and Chantralle/manchego cheese omelet were really good. Started off with Kaya chips and mango salsa with blood orange mimosas. Finished with a Belgian waffle coffee drink that tasted like a yummy alcoholic maple syrup drink. The service was outstanding. Friendly relaxed atmosphere.  Easy like a Sunday morning with Calypso and Raggae music playing in the background. Mexican and southwestern decor. Pretty cool place.  

 For happy hour --good beer and tequila selection. Fun atmosphere. Vegan and vegetarian friendly.

Definitely will return!"}
{"text":"Walked in without a reservation and was politely declined seating but was given the opportunity to find bar seats, if available. Luckily, we were able to convince our friendly neighbors to scoot over a few spaces such that my family of 4 could fit.

We started off with the Kaya juice which is a combination of 4 fruit juices (mango, guava, pineapple, and grapefruit - I think). Drink wasn't too sweet and was very refreshing on such a humid night.

For appetizers, we opted for the Yucatan hot bean dip and the cheese/corn fritters. The fritters were just okay...presented more like cheese sticks than fritters. The chipotle sauce that accompanied them though was good. As for the bean dip - order this! The bean dip is hot and gooey from the melted cheese served with a hearty side of house made chips. Some pieces were definitely overdone, but most were seasoned well and not too well done. Actually, it was a pretty divine bite when you combined the bean dip and the chipotle sauce...yum!

For entrees, we ordered from the more 'casual' menu but I was surprised at the portion sizes! 

My fish tacos were huge! The tacos featured creamy guac, approximately 2 filets of crispy fish per tacos, and a hearty topping of slaw. The slaw was just okay in my opinion...had a hint of ginger which didn't pair especially well with cilantro and limes. Mom opted for the flank steak sandwich. GET. THIS. The steak was sooo tender and had the right balance of flavors. The waffle fries were a bit too salty though. Brother opted for the pulled pork quesadilla but found it to be too pork heavy and severely lacking in cheese or other toppings. His sweet potato fries were on point though. Dad ordered the regular cubano and enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Kaya is on my \"Top 5\" list in Pittsburgh for sure.  Anything I have ever had here has been wonderful.  My absolute favorite thing here is the fried tofu plate that they have on fried chicken nights now--it's hard to make something like tofu taste this amazing!  (And probably totally unhealthy as well).  

I also like the kaya veggie burger, the black bean dip, any fish I've ever eaten here, and don't even get me started on the cocktail menu...it's SO hard to decide!  Even if you don't think you like Caribbean food or spicy things, give it a shot.  There's something for everyone and I will come back until I've tried everything, and probably more times after that!  It's wonderful!!"}
{"text":"I ate here for brunch this past weekend with my girlfriend and her parents for Father's Day.  We had made reservations earlier in the week for when Kaya opened and I am glad that we did as the restaurant seemed to fill up quickly shortly after we arrived.

We decided to start off our brunch by splitting the conch fritters.  There were seven conch balls that were served on top of a tropical tarter sauce that contained capers.  The conch was nice and crispy and paired well with the slightly salty tarter sauce.  For my entree I decided upon the slow roasted pork benedict.  After a long wait of about 70 minutes after being seated, it finally arrived.  Even though I generally do not like cornbread, I enjoyed the play on Eggs Benedict by using the cornbread as the English muffin and pork instead of the ham.  It tasted wonderful as well with the pork being tender and juicy while the lime hollandaise sauce had a good flavor to it.  The sides were good to as they made a sweet and savory mixture with the hash browns mixed in with pineapple chunks.  Several times during the wait for our entrees the waitress apologized to us and even took the step of notifying the manager that our food took a long time, without us saying a word about it. After the meal the manager came over to us and apologized herself and comped two of the meals, once again without us having said anything.  From that I would have to say that they have some pretty good customer service.

The bottom line for me is that I have been here many times before and will be headed back again.  Kaya has both interesting and tasty dishes that you will not find anywhere else in the city and I was more than impressed with their customer service this past visit."}
{"text":"After hearing some really good things about Kaya, my wife decided to take me here for brunch on a Sunday afternoon. Several people have raved to me about their chicken and waffles and I wanted the chance to indulge!  

My wife ended up ordering the chicken and waffles, promising me a few bites so that I was able to order the tropical paella.  Last year I was first introduced to paella and loved it.  Needless to say, Kaya's paella was excellent. The scallops, mussels, and shrimp were blended beautifully with chicken and chorizo with not one element overtaking the dish.  I also thoroughly enjoyed the sampling of chicken and waffles I had from my wife's plate. For some reason, fried chicken always taste so much better with waffles and maple syrup! We ended up ordering some coffee and tea to go with our meals.  A little pricey for each, but we both needed a nice pickup after our filling meal.

Kaya definitely lived up to my expectations.  I really enjoyed our brunch here and was pleased to see the prices on the menu were reasonable for a nicer brunch place with good food. I saw a few things on the men that I would like to come back to try, especially the rainbow salad. Kaya is a solid choice for taste and price and I imagine this will be one of my default go to places in the strip when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I have not actually been in the restaurant itself, but have ordered delivery from them numerous of evenings! The Chicken Sandwich with Waffle Fries is my go-to order, but I have also enjoyed the Shanghai Ribs, Queso, their Burger, and the Sweet Potato Fries. All were 5 stars!"}
{"text":"This review is for catering: I've ordered from Big Burrito catering a few times. The Kaya option is, without a doubt, my favorite. Robin has been my contact and does a fantastic job helping me stay on budget, while still providing me such great food options!

This most recent time, I ordered food for 50 and it was delivered.. (by Robin's husband, he introduced himself after I was raving about Robin. We then struck up a convo about how I think Bill Fuller must be a cool human after listening to him on WYEP. Hey Bill - If you read this, I need to know if you'll adopt me around holidays!)

Okay, back on topic. I ordered a sandwich, salad and paella combo. The order arrived on time and was set up fabulously. I love that I can always count on those print-out cards to label the food. With events, I am always being asked what ingredients are in the food, so it's great to defer to the cards. Both the veggie cuban and the chicken sandwiches are big hits. Ended up having a large amount of the paella left over, mostly due to the amount included. 

If you're looking for unique catering options, I would highly suggest Kaya. The menu is easy to customize and able to accommodate vegetarians. 

One last thing: a tip on tipping.. Ask to add it to the invoice, otherwise it will be too late to add on once delivered!"}
{"text":"Kaya is a staple for Pittsburgh, so if you're visiting, and want some great South American/Caribbean style food Kaya is a must.

Located in Pittsburgh's Strip District neighborhood Kaya has an eclectic and festive atmosphere.  The staff are friendly and attentive and the menu should make everyone happy.

Happy hour is amazing - HALF OFF ALL DRINKS.  Sorry, I didn't mean to yell, but this is exciting information.  And they have awesome mojitos and margaritas.  

On my most recent visit I had the tempura avocado Bahn Mi tacos.  I loved the carrot and radish garnish with the cilantro but this was just a little too spicy for me with the addition of the jalapenos.  I had to take the jalapenos off and then I enjoyed them much more.  You're given three very nice portions (tacos).  

I also had the Kaya chips with mango salsa.  That salsa is amazing!

Kaya, I'll be back (likely during happy hour)."}
{"text":"Kaya's is a great little gem found in the heart of the strip District. They have some amazing Caribbean drinks, including a dark and stormy which I haven't had since I was in Bermuda. Delicious!! The appetizers are to die for, and their fish tacos are exquisite. I highly recommend popping into this place for a drink or a bite to eat"}
{"text":"Though my husband and I enjoyed our first experience at Kaya (a Friday night dinner), our recent Sunday brunch experience made me revisit my 4 star review. 

Four words for you... Fried Chicken and Waffle. For only $13, you can partake of one of the best brunch dishes of all time. The menu describes this item so normally, but this isn't a normal dish. The waffle is good but the chicken packs a spicy punch while the maple syrup is extra sweet to balance that sassy Caribbean flavor. It's an absolutely incredible experience, and we'll definitely be back to enjoy it again."}
{"text":"Great food! Very different from other restaurants in Pittsburgh. Intimate atmosphere yet casual. Service is great as well. Smaller restaurant but very spacious with their seating."}
{"text":"This is my boyfriend and I first time visit yet kaya's associate is very nice and helpful. We've tried fish taco(super huge-normally you will get three huge tacos in one dishes yet you will get four once you mention you want to split it into two (like my boyfriend and I did). If you in favor of sore flavor you will like it! Also, parking is quite convenient in front of kaya."}
{"text":"I was in Pittsburgh for the weekend, and me and my wife were looking for a good place to grab a late lunch in the strip district.  A few places we tried to go to were closed (which I thought was odd for a Sunday when both the Pirates and Steelers had home games), so we ended up going to Kaya based on the good reviews onlined.

We got there at around 3:00, and I was upset when I found out that I couldn't order some of the dishes I saw on the online menu, because they don't start serving dinner until 4:00.  So I ended up \"settling\" for the Cuban sandwich.  It turned out to be one of the best sandwiches I've ever had in my life.  My wife had a chorizo and eggs breakfast dish that she loved also.

So the food was amazing, the place has nice decor, good music at an appropriate (not too loud volume), and the Pirates game on the TV.  Next time in Pittsburgh I'd like to go back and try some of the things I didn't get the chance to order off of the dinner menu.

Oh, and the food was very reasonably priced.  $10 for an amazing sandwich, waffle fries and some pickles!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, super nice wait staff.....The crab sandwich and salad was delicious and so are the sweet potatoe fries.  Plus they have an excellent Boulder cold hop IPA on tap..."}
{"text":"Actually, 4.5.

We had brunch on Sunday. Kaya has a fantastic menu that mixes a number of cultures, but still seems fantastically simple. It's a great space, wonderful service, and very attentive across the board. Amongst the four the us we had three benedicts (two with soy sausage, one with smoked salmon), and the monstrous mushroom and cheese omelet. Top marks across the board. They even added a nice side plate of slice avocado on request. Great drinks, great coffee, great place."}
{"text":"I've always enjoyed dining at Kaya. Most recently, I went for dinner with two of my close friends. We had and I suggest making a reservation, even if you're planning on dining during the week. It was quite busy for a Thursday at 7pm. 

Upon arrival, we were promptly seated toward the back of the restaurant. Our sever, Autumn, greeted us and gave us ample time to review the drink and food menu.

In addition to a fun selection of cocktails, they also have a large wine menu. We each ordered a glass of wine ($10).

We decided to order an appetizer and chose the calamari. I always like calamari, but I always think it tastes the same. Which leads me to ask, why do I order it? Anyway, instead of a traditional marinara on the side, they served theirs with a yummy, green sauce. Slightly spicy tangy, but delicious. The calamari wasn't super greasy (a plus).

For our entrees, I ordered the fish tacos (grilled, not crispy) ($18), and the other two ordered the fried chicken special ($18) and a fancy burger (can't remember exactly what made it so special). The tacos, something I've had many times before are just wonderful. The kitchen doesn't skimp here, packing each with a nice portion of fish, coleslaw and dressing. The fried chicken platter looked amazing. Keep in mind that they only serve the fried chicken on Thursday nights (perhaps that's why it was so busy?). My friend noted that the chicken was super delicious (it looked it!).

We didn't stick around for dessert because we were so full.

All in all, a really great night at a fun restaurant in Pittsburgh's Strip District."}
{"text":"Got to have Kaya now! Cozy atmosphere. Creative dishes. Nice little selection of \"tropas\" to snack on. My friend and I split tofu lettuce wraps, tropical guacamole with Kaya chips, Brussels sprouts and cauliflower and lentil corn beignets. All of those selections were very delicious and obviously vegetarian friendly (lots of meat though for those who are into that). The lettuce wraps were particularly fantastic. Sangria was tasty but weak. Overall, this restaurant is recommended! I will come back if I'm back in town. PS - Pittsburgh is kind of cool. Cooler than expected."}
{"text":"If this restaurant were a boat, they'd have forgotten to put a \"k\" on the end of their name.  Happily, however, this restaurant is not a boat.  It's a restaurant.  (I may now refer to myself as Captain Obvious in the third person for the rest of this review.)

Captain Obvious went to lunch at Kaya.  She ordered the following menu items: 1.  A glass of red sangria, 2. a cup of gazpacho verde 3. a small isabeleta(?) and monchego grilled sandwich with lime oil, arugula and some other item in there of which Captain Obvious does not recall the name.  The sandwich came with two sides.  Captain Obvious chose the spicy slaw and petite salad. 

Considering that an appetizer and meal generally is generally a overzealous amount of food, I... I mean Captain Obvious... was very please with the portion sizes.  They were mid-sized, reasonably small, yet still big (go figure that out) portions of delicious.  The sandwich and gazpacho were particularly delish.  Delish dish! (Say that 10 times fast). The side salads were nice, but they were side salads aka somewhat boring. The Sangria... well perhaps they should rename it Saintgria, because it was heavenly.  Actually, it might have been a touch too sweet, but I liked saying that.  It was good in any case.

One downside was the the service was kinda slow... It took a long time for the waitress to get us our drinks and apps (which considering that they were just soup should have been easy to maneuver). The entrees came perhaps a bit to quick.  Time is always of the essence, so that could be worked on.  

In addition, the chairs... ugh... who designed those?  Clearly, they never sat in them, because they weren't great for posture or comfort and, let's face it, chairs should meet one of those two basic needs at very least. Let this be a lesson to you all:  Sit in every chair you design before finalizing plans.  (Captain Obvious design chairs ALLLL the time - don't you?) 

In all though, Captain Obvious did like the place and mmm to the food."}
{"text":"Excellent happy hour! 1/2 price delicious cocktails. Highly recommend the basil-grapefruit marg."}
{"text":"What a bummer. Totally overpriced and overcooked fish. Per the servers suggestion, I got the porgy fish, which was completely overcooked and dry. Pretty disappointing.

Mojito was decent and outdoor seating was nice. Service was not overwhelmingly friendly, but it was fine."}
{"text":"Wow not sure where to begin here! I came here last week during Kayafest and had an amazing meal! I've past Kaya so many times and now i regret all that time i never tried it! We made a reservation to avoid the wait. I'm pescatarian so when I looked at the menu I was surprised by how MANY options they had for me to choose from. I got the fried avocado bahn mi tacos, my husband got the Chile rellenos, my sister got the rainbow salad and her bf got the fried chicken wings. We all LOVED our food. The tacos were surprisingly large portions and i was stuffed but i still managed to shovel in those last 2 bites. Shout out to Brian who gave great recommendations and was super nice! Do not skip out on this place!"}
{"text":"I have now been to Kaya twice, once for dinner and once for brunch and both occasions the food has been lackluster at best. 

Kaya is attempting to pull off a high concept fusion style restaurant, blending Caribbean, South American, Pacific and Mexican cuisine into an appetizing blend of food. To be perfectly honest I am skeptical of fusion places due to the high rate of failures in execution. In many cases you have a young hot-shot chef who wants to be known as a bold flavor innovator, blending cuisines that he has never mastered to achieve usually poor to mediocre results. The dishes in many cases have only a vague similarity to the original and if it would be beneficial if the chef would stick to concentrating on the basics instead of cooking up bizarre fusion dishes.

Some examples would be the Jamaican Jerk Chicken Wings - which tasted nothing like Jerk seasoning should (loaded with allspice, heat of the scotch bonnet pepper, cinnamon, cloves, etc. Instead it looked like we had a dab of commercially bought jerk seasoning tossed on the wings after cooking. The wings themselves were cooked nicely, big and juicy but still had some pin feathers attached that were not removed, attention to details such as this is mandatory. 

For brunch I tried the eggs benedict with smoked salmon, the eggs were poached hard, again another detail that is unacceptable and sloppy. The salmon was cheap, the cornbread it was served on was good and made for an interesting combination but the addition of smoked paprika on top was okay, but nothing exciting. 

I could go on and on, but you see the problems.

2.5 Stars because the place is interesting for Pittsburgh but for those of us who have traveled and eaten in the Caribbean, South America and Mexico, the food comes off as dull copies of vibrant originals."}
{"text":"I received a certificate for up to $30 off an entree for any of the Big Burrito restaurants for my birthday (you can sign up for this on their website). I decided to try out Kaya for my birthday dinner. I selected the seared ahi tuna and it was excellent. The meal paired a lot of different items that hit different taste buds. There was a rice that was a little spicy and tasted great with some sort of green (I think arugula) that had a tart flavor. The tuna was perfectly seared in my opinion. The staff was also very friendly, especially the woman that seated us. The only complaint that I would have is that the restaurant was on the smaller side. My friend and I unwillingly listened to the party next to us debate on who had how many rum runners so they could split their check."}
{"text":"We had exceptional service here last night. The food was also excellent. I split guacamole with a friend. The guacamole was so good. The tropical aspect with the mango and like made it so Delicious. The chips that came with it were seasoned and so tasty also! My main dish was the flank steak cemita with waffle fries. The waffle fries were so delicious. Really crisp, could tell they made them on the spot and were not frozen & heated up. The flank steak cemita was delicious. I usually don't eat steak, and the steak was cooked amazingly. It wasn't too medium or well done, and it had a lot of flavor. They put a good layer of lettuce and tomato. I hate places that skimp! Finally I got a angry orchard cider. They poured it into a cute little glass. Really exceptional service, beautiful decor, and great food. Makes the pricier tag worth it. My food cost $25 with tax"}
{"text":"I actually love this place for the special drinks like Graduate and the Caribbean Jerk wings. They are awesome, they tend to look underdone inside a bit pinker than they should but they are great."}
{"text":"Kaya is another offering from Big Burrito and if you're familiar with their other restaurants (especially Mad Mex), you'll know what to expect from the vibe. It's a pretty dark space, heavily style with an island flair...both in decor and menu. The menu is pretty small, but all of the items that I've tried have been pretty good, and the service has always been really good, whether sitting inside or outside.

We absolutely love their black bean dip, but fair warning: it's pretty spicy if you're not good with heat. The burger is good, as well as the cuban sandwich, but my go-to is probably the fish tacos. I tend to think they overdo it on the cream sauce, but otherwise, they're excellent. The red sangria is also delicious! I wouldn't say the food will blow you away, but I doubt you'll be disappointed, either.

It's warm vibe and good service means it's good for both casual meals and for a nice date night spot. The strip district can be insane at times, so while you may have luck grabbing a table or seats at the bar on a whim, I'd advice making a reservation to save yourself a wait. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Amazing way to spend a Sunday. I visited Kaya for brunch, which is only offered on Sunday, and was pleasantly impressed. From the moment we walked in the door, we were thoroughly taken care of. The hostess, whose name I didn't catch, was a wonderful woman who offered us a table even though they had a reservation coming in at 2. 

We opted for the mojito and grapefruit-basil margaritas instead of traditional brunch cocktails and they were fantastic. The tropical guac (order the homemade kaya chips to substitute the tortilla chips) was awesome, I really wanted to take it home with me. We chose the chicken and waffles (it came with a spicy Tabasco butter which added an extra layer of flavor) and the huevos rancheros. I was super excited that the huevos rancheros came with ~more~ of the tropical guac, but it was all in all a fantastic dish. The bacon was peppery and delicious, albeit I wish it was a bit crispier, but it was a great juxtaposition to the sweetness of the grilled pineapple.

I'll have to come back and see what Kaya has to offer besides an awesome brunch, but if brunch is what you're in the market for, definitely come check it out next time you are doing your Sunday shopping in the Strip."}
{"text":"Delicious food! I've been there multiple times and keep coming back. Jerk wings are hands down the best thing on the menu. The place is small so make reservations."}
{"text":"The brought us the wrong but easily fixed it. Food came quickly and was interesting. The pork sandwich was a little dry but we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Despite Kaya already being well-reviewed, I still think it's underrated.  In addition to executing well on dishes within its wheelhouse, Kaya manages to far exceed expectations on other fronts as well.  For example, the burger here is easily in the Top 10 I've had in Pittsburgh, and they cooked it better than even many well-known burger places (beating comparable burgers I've ordered at BRGR, Union Grill and Tessaro's).  I also wouldn't overlook Kaya as a stellar brunch option; their menu offers plenty of variety, great flavors, and combinations ranging from classic to inventive.  Not only is Kaya a very good restaurant, it's stunningly well-rounded as well."}
{"text":"My friend and I were in town for a Pens game, and stumbled upon Kaya while exploring the Strip District. Every other brunch spot we saw was packed with a line going out the door. No thanks on the wait, we were starving!

We were seated immediately, and brought drinks. The bloody marys were a little spicy, but the waiter had warned us (and thoughtfully gave us a glass of tomato juice to cut them). We ordered sweet potato fries as an appetizer, and they were honestly some of the best I've ever had. The chipotle mayo dip for the fries was really good too.

We each had a benedict for our entree, I had the pulled pork one and my friend had the smoked salmon. I liked their take on the benedict, with corn bread as the base, and the slightly sweet/spicy hollandaise. Our benedicts came with grilled pineapple and potatoes. 

Overall, I was very happy with our experience at Kaya. The one ding I would give it is because the service was slow, but the food was great. If I'm ever back in Pittsburgh, I would visit this restaurant again."}
{"text":"I had a made a reservation for saturday evening, however found that the Bar was fine and received service there. The Bar tender was very nice and attentive, even being as busy as he was. We started with the Kaya chips with mango salsa. The chips were very good, however some were a little too burnt. The salsa was amazing though, and I loved the kick that the chips had to them! I was in a Kaya kind of mood, so I also got the Kaya burger, med well, with sweet potato fries and this cayenne dipping sauce (one of many sauces they offer). The burger was perfect with just enough pink, and the avocado and egg was the perfect blend. The sweet potato fries were awesome, hard to mess that up."}
{"text":"Sooo that was a pretty fantastic sandwich...

Let me explain the pork and banana sandwich for you from bun to bun:
Slice: fluffy baguette
red onion
cilantro mayo
lime
slow cooked pulled pork
sliced plantains
Slice: fluffy baguette
**if you're one who enjoys the dynamic duo of savory and sweet - this dandy is for you!

According to our Pittsburgh hostess with the mostess, Rachel C, we HAD to order the sweet potato fries as they were some of the best in the city - and, she added, that they paired nicely with an order of the cilantro mayo. True and true! From the sidewalk looking in this place is extremely unsuspecting - I didn't even realize there was anything there until she swung the door open. Inside sits a Caribbean oasis tucked away in the heart of the Strip District. Warm lighting with a long bar that boasts tiki-style bar chairs and colorful walls. By ordering the \"Todo en Uno\" portion size I was able to have a smaller version of the sandwich with a side. 

Rachel informed our crew that Kaya is a great spot for Happy Hours and that in her downtown working days she was a regular;) Next time, Rachel, - you + me + Kaya."}
{"text":"I reserve the 5 star glory for places that truly rock my foodie world. Everything about my Sunday brunch experience had my tastebuds begging for more! 

My friend and I stopped in after shopping for groceries  in the Strip. We were seated immediately in a spot with plenty of room to place our grocery bags next to us. Our waitress was friendly & gave excellent recommendations for drinks. We started with a bloody mary and grapefruit margarita. I got the horseradish infused vodka in my first bloody mary and the old bay infused vodka in my second. Both were the perfect kick but the horseradish had a stronger flavor. Our app was the mango pineapple gaucemole. The mango overpowered the pineapple but not the avocado! I would order that dip again. I stuck with Bloody marys throughout our meal and my friend switched to a mojito. It was crisp, fresh and well blended. 
For our entrees, I got the Jamaican veggie curry and my friend got the flank steak burger with arugula and truffle aioli and a side salad. Wow! Both dishes were incredible!!! The citrus that pulled through my curry was a delightful surprise and the portion was huge. It was served with saffron rice and I had to leave most of the rice behind. My friend demolished the burger in record time. The aioli was the perfect compliment. I am not a burger fan but one bite of her dish, I saw the appeal. 
The attentive service, excellent food and drinks screamed 5 star. I am excited for my next trip back to further explore the menu and libation creations!"}
{"text":"A takeout visit for te Cuban Sandwich, Jerked pork and Plantain nachos. Overall, the Cuban sandwich was absolutely phenomenal! However, the plantain nachos tasted as though they accidentally dropped their entire spice rack into the jerked pork.

Cuban sandwich: a sumptuous mix of different kinds of well-seasoned meats melded together with creamy cheese and savory aioli. Although the sandwich was a bit heavy, it was incredibly delicious, and I look forward to tasting other sandwiches they have to offer.

Jerked pork and plantain chips: the plantain chips by themselves were crispy, well-salted and delicious. However, as I mentioned above, my taste buds felt that they were on a roller coaster ride of different spices, some of which may have gone well, but others that made me wonder \"I think something happened in the kitchen, and it involves someone experimenting with every spice he has in his spice rack\". I personally would not recommend this dish.

Overall, the receptionist was welcoming, servers were kind and patient with our orders, and wait for take-out was not long at all.

The Cuban was a solid 4.5, the Plantain nachos a 1.5, service 4, ambiance 4."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went there for his birthday, and we both absolutely loved it. The server was extremely helpful and friendly. My boyfriend ordered the fish tacos, and he said they were some of the best he's ever had. We both loved their calamari, as well. Oh, and their specialty cocktails were excellent."}
{"text":"I went with a party of five, and it was the first time for all of us.  We got the Philippine special.  They gave us a lot of food, and it was good.  the chicken adobe was a little salty, but the food was quite good.  The waiter and chef were friendly.  The waiter did a good job.  It was pricey.  35 dollars a person.  They did not put the price on the menu.  I believe they should, as sometimes you feel funny having to ask the cost.
Speaking of asking, our party of five consisted of two couples, and a single.  They gave us one check.  I do not understand why restaurants are not more thoughtful in this regard.  It is as if their attitude is \"well, if they ask, we can split the checks, but if they don't ask, why should we make more work for us?\"  All I know is that if I owned a restaurant, I am going to do all things big and small to make it as pleasurable an experience as possible.  Everything counts!
But the biggest thing was that the chef (congenial as he was) had an unkempt beard that was sort of dangling over our food.  I know how today's society is, but that is not right.  As of now, I am not going back.  But if they make two simple changes (automatically ask the party how they want the checks done and have any chefs shave a long beard (small beard is ok), I will go back.  One other positive.  I see the manager, or whoever it is, responds to some of these reviews in an attempt to right some wrongs..  I think that is the right idea."}
{"text":"Atmosphere, food, drinks are great. Not too many places I would give a 5 star but this is the exception. I've eaten here a few times and each time has been phenomenal. Coming from a vegetarian that says a lot. The rainbow salad is fantastic."}
{"text":"Since Big Burrito was kind enough to send me a gift card in the mail for mah birthday, my boyfriend insisted that we go out to dinner for my birthday...again....yes, this was my third birthday dinner in the period of one week.  Hey, you only turn 27 once!

I decided we should go on a Thursday, because that was Fried Chicken Night and I don't even need to say why that sounds insanely awesome.  I didn't even end up ordering the fried chicken, but I made my boyfriend get it so I could try it.  Birthday girl gets to make decision!  We didn't make reservations, just showed up around 7 pm or so.  They were pretty busy and we thought we'd have to wait awhile, but by the time we ordered drinks at the bar, our table was ready.

We both ordered delicious cocktails - one was a grapefruit-basil margarita, and I forgot what the other one was.  That's what I get for being a bad Yelper and not posting for a few weeks.  Since it wasn't quite 7 pm yet, our drinks were half off, making any cocktail suddenly an amazing bargain.  Definitely a good reason to come to Kaya early!  

Our server was friendly, and he recommend the barramundi in chile broth.  I sprung for it, since it was an expensive entree and I wanted to get my gift card's worth.  My boyfriend got the fried chicken, at my insistence.  Let me say that my barramundi was OUTSTANDING.  Way better than I expected.  Fresh, flavorful, and just marvelous all around.  Totally worth the money, but if you have a gift card then it's a don't-miss!  I was so happy that I didn't even really want to share my boyfriend's chicken, but I took a few bites.  It was incredibly crispy, which I loved, but honestly it wasn't as flavorful as I hoped.  More salt in the breading needed, perhaps?  Chicken was very juicy though - just didn't deliver a flavor punch.  It was served with a salsa of some sort, so perhaps that was meant to compensate, but I hoped for more kick.

I wouldn't get the chicken again, but I'd go back in a heartbeat for that barramundi and another half-price cocktail!  mmmmmm."}
{"text":"We came here based on the recommendation of a bartender on the other side of town, so we had high hopes. As much as I wanted to like to, I just couldn't.

The drinks were OK at best. The food, incredibly over priced, but not half bad. Our server on the other hand just sucked. With only 4 tables filled, it took 20 minutes to be greeted and get water. After an hour, we finally got some good. The table was positioned so that you could see into the kitchen. We saw our server standing over the food she was supposed to be boxing, eating something else. Completely gross. 

Additionally, saw several people in street clothes bring guests into the kitchen for a few minutes, then leave - seemed like employees bringing their girlfriends for a tour. 

The food and drinks were 2 stars at worse, but slow, rude service and grossness gives it 1."}
{"text":"We went to Kaya last night for dinner.  We were seated outside which was great!  Make reservations because it's definitely a really busy restaurant.  

We really did not enjoy the food.  We got the guacamole which comes in a really small bowl, with basic Tostitos chips, and ends up costing $11.  We ended up asking the waitress to give us more or at least fill the bowl up to the top.  She said these were their portion sizes, did go back to the restaurant and added maybe a spoonful more, and then said she'll have to charge us if we still wanted more.  I understand but probably a little more than half an avocado was used in that guacamole bowl. 

My husband got the jerk chicken wings.  He said it grew on him eventually but it wasn't spicy.  I believe the sauce that comes with it is cilantro aioli? which makes dipping the jerk chicken in it taste even more mild.  The sauce was pretty yummy.

I got the vegetarian Caribbean rainbow salad with tofu because the description sounds SO yummy.  It was not.  It tasted bland and there wasn't any dressing on it.  I typically don't add dressing to my salads -- a little olive oil and lemon goes a long way.  But this salad was just tasteless and it was the first time where I wished for dressing.

The drinks were yummy!  We both tried a cocktail and both were delicious.  I would go there for drinks and apps but not dinner."}
{"text":"Illuminated only by the track lighting hanging from the ceiling, the glow of a monitor, and spotlights placed upon the bar, this suave, darkly lit atmosphere screams classy dining with eclectic Caribbean décor. A medium to small sized joint to enjoy dinner and start your Friday bar crawl. Most patrons here are dressed in casual to semi-formal or business attire. 

The environment is fairly loud. You have to practically yell to be heard by the person across the table, and people sitting next to each other still had trouble hearing each other. This was mainly the result of the music, although the words and language used in most of the songs were indistinguishable. However, the music was clearly a mix of genres, from hip hop and R'n'B to Reggae, from Latin American pop to soft rock from the 80s. Later, in the night, this music was quite upbeat and made everyone want to dance! This appears to be a calculated move, since when hip hop is played on busier nights, the fast music leads to quicker table turnover. 

I ordered the Kaya Juice, a delicious mock tail comprised of mango, guava, cranberry, and pineapple juices. The cranberry juice's bitterness and the muted sweetness of guava temper the overwhelmingly sugary pineapple and mango juices. The conch fritters appeared similar to a pakora, a deep fried and breaded vegetable appetizer featured Indian and Pakistani cuisines. Biting into it yielded a chewy, salty and quite savory taste, made deliciously tangy by lime squeezed on top of it. Underneath the fritters was a green habanero aioli, about as spicy as a teaspoon of Cholula. This was incredibly potent, with a delicious mix of savory ingredients reminiscent of Hispanic Caribbean, potentially Cuban, cuisine.

The entrée was a monthly special, the Bake 'n' Shark burger, composed of lettuce, tomato, tamarind, cilantro, hot sauce, and fried bread. The taste was initially tangy, and slightly sweet from the sauce. Unfortunately, the shark part itself was quite underwhelming. Even though the shark patty was breaded and fried, the fish itself tasted extremely bland, like unseasoned tilapia. The mixture of cucumber, crunchy iceberg lettuce, leafy cilantro and other textures added interesting dimension to this otherwise tasteless dish. Its crunchy, possibly fried hamburger bun felt unusual, like an oily cracker. This and was probably the best part of the entire meal. Indeed, the conch fritters probably overshadowed the main course with their flavor and spice. Yet the shark burger's only selling point was its exotic nature. 

Overall, it was a great experience! Although I found my entrée to be bland, I'm excited to come back and enjoy other plates when the next opportunity arises."}
{"text":"Another terrible experience at a big burrito restaurant. This is probably the 10th bad experience I've had at a big burrito restaurant. Usually it's Mad Mex, but this time it was Kaya. I walked in and asked for a table for two and a half. The hostess who didn't make eye contact with me, informed me there was nothing but outside seating available. It's funny because there was over half the room available inside. Her claims over reserved tables were unwarranted, there were plenty of tables open and weren't being seated for another 45 minutes. AVOID THIS DUMP."}
{"text":"Fun vibe! Tried the Caribbean rainbow salad and the Kaya burger. Well seasoned, lots of flavour. Would definitely go back to try different things!"}
{"text":"I got the Kaya Burger, because I kept reading such good things about it. It is possibly the messiest burger I've ever received. Very, very wet. The bottom of the bun was deteriorated by the time I got it. I tried the fork and knife approach, but they serve it on wax paper, so now I have wax paper in my food. TIp: If you order the burger, get them to put it on a normal plate, and put the sauce or whater it is on the side.

Also, for some reason, the mixed drinks were not good at all. I got the \"Tiki #7,\" which really tasted like frozen juice concentrate (just bitter sour and lots of acid. I sent it back and got a \"Mojito\" which was basically a mixer with mint leaves on top. Not great."}
{"text":"After many years of enjoying and recommending Kaya, I am reluctantly forced to downgrade it from 4.5 stars to  2.5. As uncharacteristic as it is for a Big Burrito Group establishment, I must sadly report that the  service and food quality have diminished to the point of  consistent disappointment."}
{"text":"I have to say I never really had Kaya on my list of places I wanted to try. It was on the list but it was very bottom of the huge list. A friend asked to go here one day for happy hour and I'm pretty glad she picked it. From the outside this place looks a lot bigger then it really is. I was expecting it to be much bigger.

All of the drinks we ordered were unique and had great flavor. I also decided to order some of the tofu lettuce wraps. I was also very impressed with those. They were similar to the tofu from Pan and Mad Mex. And I'm a sucker for some goof tofu. After this experience I'll definitely be bumping Kaya up on my list to try for an actual meal."}
{"text":"Whenever I'm in Pittsburgh, I come here. The food is always good. The service is up to par as well. Highly recommend this spot."}
{"text":"The drinks and atmosphere: awesome! Those plantain chips: amazing! I love the vibe of this place and they had some of the best sangria I have ever tasted, but came short when it comes to food. If I had even a slightly better meal, I would have bumped the rating up, but unfortunately it wasn't good at all. I went for lunch with co-workers and ordered the Green Vegetable Curry. It was seasoned oddly, and the rice was super salty. The sauce was not really there, leaving dried, weird seasoned vegetables in a heap. I tried working around it but it was such a big pile of food, it was unappetizing. Maybe it's just this dish that's not up to par? Everyone else really loved their food! I also see another review about the curry dish... I am definitely coming back here, hopefully for a better experience!"}
{"text":"I had really high expectations for this place after hearing so much about it, so that may be part of why I'm only giving it 3 stars, but I really didn't think it was that amazing.  I went with a group of 15 where we had a reservation a few weeks in advance for such a large group.  After we made our reservation, my understanding is that they later asked us to move the time up from our original 7pm to 7:45 pm since that was a less busy time for them, which I found kind of odd since they should give priority to who called first.  Since they close at 10pm and dinner with that large of a group can take while, around 9:40 they started bringing checks out even though some people's desserts hadn't arrived yet, which I also found to be unusual and kind of annoying when they did push our time up 45 min.  

The service was just ok, but decent for such a large group.  When I sat down I had no drink menu (though did have a food menu) but there was one way on the other side of a very large table.  I asked the waiter for a drink menu and he said his hands were full but that there was already one on the table---ummm way down on the other end and people were using it.  He said he'd be back with one in a bit anyway, but when he came back he had no menu so I then had to eventually get it passed all the way down the table when he finally brings more.  They did have a very nice drink list, including an impressive draft selection that I was happy about.

As for the food, it was a little pricier than I was expecting for Caribbean food so I expected it to be amazing (most entrees in the upper $20's, and appetizers also expensive--chips and salsa was like $7/8!!).  I ordered the bbq tofu cracklings for an appetizer which was tasty but way too huge, and I normally really like generous portions--it filled up a HUGE plate and was bigger than my entree so I could not even eat half of it.  I would have much rather preferred a smaller appetizer for half the price.  It was tasty but there was a bit too much bbq sauce on it and it really was just fried not so crispy tofu, not sure why they called it cracklins--I was expecting something much crispier.  For my entree I ordered the flank steak and the presentation was beautiful and the fried egg on top was a nice touch.  I asked for it cooked medium and it came out exactly as I requested.  However, although it tasted quite good and flavorful, the steak was quite chewy, which was disappointing for something that looked so lovely.  I was expecting a higher quality of meat for the price ~$26.

The atmosphere and decor are very nice and the bar seems to be the centerpiece here although there's a decent amount of table seating.  I think I'd come back for their happy hour but I felt their dinner, while good, was not really a good value for the prices."}
{"text":"We went to the vegetarian diner. It was a nice surprise! The scramble eggs with citrus hollandaise sauce and espargus were to die for!! Everything else was pleasant but defenitly limited to what preconception of vegetation food most people have... Want to try again!"}
{"text":"My coworkers and I visit Kaya for happy hour, occasionally.  I love the ambiance!  Brick faced walls mixed with a non-tacky tropical vibe.  It's warm and inviting - a great place to go.

I've only nibbled on a couple appetizers - Conch fritters were tasty and the black bean dip was not too bad either.  However their drinks... I have a favorite.

I've tried the Graduate which is sage liquor, limoncello, lemon, sparkling wine.  It's very fresh but a tad bit sweet.  I asked my bartender his favorite and he said the Pisco Sour - Barsol Pisco, lime, egg white*, Angostura bitters.  Frothy yet tart - I love it!  We have a winner :)

If you're looking for a great happy hour venue, try Kaya and have a Pisco Sour.  I'll be there too, so say hello!"}
{"text":"Great brunch, even better happy hour, and always a pleasant experience. I've probably gone here 30-40 times (might have a problem), and it's consistently great. The avocado tempura tacos, fish tacos, salmon salad, and grapefuit marg are my go-tos!"}
{"text":"It must be good if I remember eating here all these longs months latter.

I had whatever they pass off as a burger and let me tell you kids.  It was delicious.  

Highly recommend giving this place a shot."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Big Burrito restaurant. The place is small and funky, but never feels cramped. The food is very generous in portion size and priced fairly. You will not leave hungry. The waitstaff is very friendly and accommodating. The fish tacos were delicious and enormous."}

Parking: there are the pay stations as well as pay parking by the loading docks

I had a Bloody Mary with cucumber vodka because when in Rome. It was good but I think it was on the small side and full of ice.

We split the black bean dip with homemade chips. The chips were well seasoned: salty with some subtle heat. The black bean dip was very filling and lightly seasoned. It wasn't heavy and paired so well with the chips. 

I got the veggie burrito (since it had mushrooms and seasonal veggies) but had them add the chorizo and bacon (for a few dollar up charge). This thing was gigundo! The over easy eggs were on top, so when you cut in the creamy yolky goodness cascaded down the burrito. This thing was chock full of potatoes, veggies, hunks of chorizo and pieces of crispy crunchy bacon. I used one of my BBG coupons and saved $10! I pretty much waddled out of there to do some shopping in the Strip."}
{"text":"The service was excellent. The restaurant was not exactly quiet and appropriate for a romantic dinner. Most food was quite good.  Unfortunately for this vegetarian couple it was disconcerting to receive the Tofu Cracklins to find out that they're deep fried in the same oil as the fish dinners. Thus our tofu tasted like fish. We also thought that there was way too much dressing on the Field Greens."}
{"text":"The decore was modern Caribbean the food is good the bar has a nice selection of rums to choose from. I would not call this Caribbean though I would call this modern Caribbean fusion the staff is attentive and the drinks will definitely get you turned up. I would give this place 5 stars but I did have one issue the Caribbean is relaxing and comfortable but this place missed that completely. It felt a little stuffy I really never relaxed while there. Another problem I had was the rum selection was extensive but like most places in the city they completely miss one of the best destinations in the Caribbean. The Dominican Republic. Now I have to admit because my wife is Dominican and i have been exposed to that culture the most I tend to look for those flavors and I never see it represented in Pittsburgh. But that's more of a issue with the city's Latin population not having representation then just this place. I would like the addition of brugal añejo rum"}
{"text":"Update time!  Unfortunately, my previous rating was only updated, not upgraded.  A friend and I had intended to hit Bon Giorno for a quick bite before our Knife Skills class at In the Kitchen.  The sign on the Bon Giorno door said \"Open for Dinner!\"  The door was locked.  Hmmm.  We knocked, a guy came out and told us they're not open on Monday nights.  Hmmm....perhaps there should have been an asterisk with a notation to that effect?  I digress.

Anyhoo....Kaya was our fallback dinner spot.  It was pretty empty, but then it was a Monday and it was only 4:30 so that wasn't a bad sign.  Or was it?  Our movie-star-handsome-waiter highly recommended the Jamaican green curry.  I LOVE curry!  It came with saffron rice.  I LOVE saffron rice!  They could make it with shrimp.  I...well, you get the picture.  Both my dining companion and I ordered the curry - how could we go wrong?  Fail.  It was acceptable.  Period.  No punch of heat, although I'd ordered it hot.  The veggies were cut oddly with huge chunks of carrots and tiny pieces of green beans and cauliflower among other veggies making for hard carrots and the rest of the veggies overcooked and soft.  So disappointing.  My dining partner tried hers, but didn't even eat it.  Not wanting to hurt the waiter's feelings, she had him pack it up and then tossed it in the trash outside.  

I guess Fried Chicken Thursday is the night to go.  It sure wasn't Monday.  Hard to believe this is a Big Burrito restaurant."}
{"text":"Upping to a 5.0! This warrants a whole new review. Kaya was the first restaurant I visited in the Pittsburgh area. Not sure why it's taken me years to come back, but just when you think things couldn't get any better, boom! 
 
Did I make a wrong turn and end up in the African jungle? The dining room at Kaya transports you do a different place, far from the ordinary. Stools wrapped in what looks like burlap, African still art statuettes, colors colors everywhere...

The menu is as lively as the walls, with creative dishes like Tempura Avocado tacos, corn/lentil beignets, Jamaican jerk wings, and my personal favorite the Yucatán bean dip with homemade chips. I'm not sure how this dip is made, but I'd like 5 gallons to go please....."}
{"text":"We managed to secure a table for 3 on a busy Friday night. The decor is certainly unique, but it was fun to have a tropical vibe given that we had snow earlier that day. I'll agree with others that the tables are quite close together, and we did occasionally struggle to converse over the rowdy Happy Hour crowd. The Happy Hour deal is amazingly good--half off every alcoholic beverage in the joint. I tried The Graduate, which was strong enough that I actually declined a second drink.

Chas was our server, and he was incredible--if this review were for him, he'd get 5 stars. When we sat down as a party of 3, he took the liberty to point out which appetizers came in 3s. He also promised to give us last call on Happy Hour (and delivered), and performed all the regular duties of a server admirably. But he truly went above and beyond by actually recommending how we could repurpose our leftover paella by reheating in a pan with some eggs. Brunch paella is amazing, for the record.

The food was all pretty good. The skirt steak tacos were delicious, the fish tacos were very fresh (the slaw does not contain mayo, a downright miracle in PGH), and the paella was great. The alligator wasn't fantastic--definitely have had better. The corn and lentil beignets were tasty but smaller beignets would have worked better.

I'd definitely come back for Happy Hour for drinks and apps, but the ambiance struggles to match the prices for a sit-down dinner. Chas was so charming that we might give dinner another shot so long as he's working!"}
{"text":"Came here for Brunch and the food was yummy. I had the shrimp and black bean omelet, its was good. Husband had the chicken and waffles. He said it was the best chicken he'd ever had..and I sampled his waffle and it was buttery/crispy amazingness. I would definitely go back"}
{"text":"Took advantage of this venue during the \"Stroll the Strip\" event, which is another story and review all by itself.  Suffice it to say, after the stroll, I was still hungry and, while Kaya was not a participant of the Stroll, the Stroll was the reason we found Kaya.

We sat outdoors and had a great meal.  My husband ordered the fish tacos, while I had the Jerked Pulled Pork Quesadilla.  Both dishes were quite delicious and I'd highly recommend.  Service was attentive and prices were reasonable."}
{"text":"One of my all time favorite places. The food is so originally made and I've never been disappointed. My particular favorites are the black bean dip and veggie Kaya burger. Delicious."}
{"text":"Checked this place out on a Sunday night with a friend from college, and a co-resident.  

Food (8.0/10) = started off with the Jamaican jerk chicken wing appetizers.  When I go back to kaya, this is all I'm going to order.  Absolutely loved it.  The cilantro cream sauce is the best.  I was scraping the plate with the edge of my knife trying to get every ounce of that sauce.  If I wasn't dining with my friends, I would've licked the plate clean like a dog.  Also ordered the fish tacos since it was the most mentioned item on yelp.  The fish itself was nicely done.  Tilapia.  Crispy.  Moist.  Soft.  The only thing weird about the flavor profile was the thousand island dressing in the taco.   It wasn't bad...just felt out of place?  The quantity was a bit overboard as well.  3 big tacos on a platter for $17.  Two tacos would've been just perfect.  This seems to be a recurring formula for restaurant success in Pittsburgh = large quantities of food per order (other examples:  Pamela's, Church Brew).  

Ambiance (7.0/10) = we sat outside.  Strip district is really dead at night.  First time I visited the strip at night.  The surroundings felt like a post-apocalyptic movie, such as I am Legend with Will Smith.

Service (7.5/10) = felt a little awkward whenever our waitress interacted with us.  Not sure what it was.  She was still nice though.  

Overall opinion = fish tacos (most mentioned item on Yelp) is done well by the folks at Kaya, but that thousand island dressing...it bothers me.  If you haven't had it, I'd still try it out.  The real winner, the gold medalist, the award winning dish of Kaya has to be the Jamaican Jerk Chicken wings.  The skin is crispy.  The wings are juicy.  And that amazing cilantro cream sauce!  The folks at Kaya should consider opening up a small wings shop in Oakland, just selling this one dish and beer.  The college kids would eat this up."}
{"text":"The rainbow salad is the salad you've been waiting for.  Lovely restaurant and attentive service too."}
{"text":"Came here for a late lunch. A friend told me how much he liked their cuban sandwich is, so I had to try that. For lunch, you can get a 1/2 sandwich with 2 sides, or a full sandwich with 1 side. I decided to get the full sandwich combo (cuban + sweet potato fries) and a cup of their cauliflower & potato soup. Food-wise I'd give everything a solid 3.5*. Everything was tasty, but it just wasn't terribly memorable. Of everything, the sweet potato fries were my favorite. The soup was nicely spiced and not at all heavy. My friend had conch & corn chowder and it didn't look very chowder-like (it was a thinner soup base), but he said it still tasted good. The cuban sandwich was smaller than I expected: the two sandwich halves were cut like strips (instead of two triangles). Nonetheless, I still found the sandwich+soup combo more than filling and even had a bit to take home. What bumps this review up to 4* is the service. It wasn't crowded, so we were seated quickly. The food also came quickly and the waitress was attentive. You really can't ask for too much more service-wise!  Next time I'll try coming back for their dinner menu."}
{"text":"Kaya is an amazing restaurant, hands down my favourite dining experience when I was on my vacation in Pittsburgh. It's tucked behind this...sketchy-ish street where you can park your car along the \"street\". We sat outdoors on a beautiful weekend. 

We ordered the Jamaican Jerk Wings, Ahi Tuna Poke Bowl, and Blue Bay Mussels. Food came surprisingly fast, we didn't have to wait too long, considering all our dishes had a decent amount of meat in them. The Ahi Tuna Poke Bowl was amazing, fish tasted decently fresh, and everything else in the bowl complimented the tuna so well. Mussels weren't too bad, nothing to complain about; although,the portion was huge. We were sort of disappointed at the Wings. The Jamaican Jerk flavour wasn't special in anyway, and it felt like the Wings were a bit overcooked - meat was dry and a bit on the tougher side.

I remember ordering a Margarita and it was amazing, but I couldn't find the drinks menu on their website."}
{"text":"Not the best place for brunch. We usually go here for dinner. I got the omelette with shrimp and black beans which was just ok. Potatoes were cold and it took awhile for the good to come out (30+mins) will continue to go for dinner just no for brunch"}
{"text":"Very good food! I love the atmosphere. It is a great place for a ladies night out, grab some dinner (the food is delicious) and drinks before heading to your next spot. Or just make it THE spot for the night. Either way, it's a great place. T"}
{"text":"I went here a couple times the food is decent I probably wouldn't go back here. I got the pulled pork quesodilla and the quesodilla was like dripping wet from the pork or something I don't know. You couldn't pick it up and eat it like a normal quesodilla you had to eat it with a fork which was annoying. It just was falling apart when I was trying to eat it and not it a good way lol. I wouldn't really recommend this place or go back it wasn't that great there's way better places to eat in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Kaya is one of the best rest. in Pittsburgh.  The food is consistently good, and the carrib. theme is not common for a city that consists mostly of fried food.  Great conch (and sometimes shrimp) chowder and its safe to say the place has the best Cuban sandwich in town.

The lunch special ($12) is very reasonable and would highly recommend it.  

If you are from out of town, this is one of the places to go."}
{"text":"Finally got the chance to stop here for brunch and I was pretty pumped I did.
They have a variety of bloody mary's using different flavored liquors for a start. Pepper Whiskey Bloody, sure. Cucumber Vodka Bloody, yea! Habanero Tequila Bloody? If it's hard to comprehend how that would taste, get it because it's bloody amazing. (I hate myself for that)

I had their Chilaquiles and it was amazing as it looks and LOADED with flavor. I was starving so my picture is a butchered version of how it was served but KAYA is spot on for brunch. It is a wee bit on the expensive side for Pittsburgh(really not expensive), but they have great service and the portions are more than adequate (you'll be stuffed). Not to mention the location is pretty nice. I'll certainly return to try everything else on the menu at some point."}
{"text":"Excellent place to stop by. 
Sophia at the bar is a gem. She will take care of you with minimum of fuss. I have a lot more respect for bartenders after being served by her. 
This is an awesome restaurant. They have over 15 beers on tap and also bottles for a reasonable price. 
This should be rated $$ on yelp 
Started out with plantain and mixed chips. 
I cannot say enough things about this place!!"}
{"text":"Came for brunch with a group of friends and Kaya did not disappoint. The Bloody Mary was very spicy, I would not order if you aren't into horseradish. The pork eggs Benedict was AMAZING. We will be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"This is our (my wife and I) second time going to Kaya and both of our meals were better than we had remembered the first time.  First,  before you think about dinner, the Pork Nachos were out of this world! Everything was perfectly proportioned and delicious to start the night off.  

For dinner, I got the Jamaican Jerk wings (Yes it's listed as an app but I fell in love with them the first time I dined here). The jerk sauce is THE BEST JERK SAUCE I'VE TASTED here in the states. Again,  I would compare them to the jerk chicken I got while my wife and I were in Jamaica.  Just incredible.  You get 10 crispy wings with sauce on the bottom of the plate.  Myself being the dipper I am,  I had to ask for a side of sauce.  My wife got the crispy fish tacos and loved every bite. I can't speak about them too much because she didn't do much sharing (so you know they're good). The fish looked perfectly breaded,  not to thick but just enough.   

The service was amazing!  Everyone was very nice and professional.  You can tell the staff genuinely has a good time and enjoys working there.  We went for my wife's birthday and they couldn't have treated her better.  From wishing her a happy birthday when we were seated to helping us celebrate with a lava cake. If you dine here,  save room and eat a small lunch because everything you try here will blow your taste buds away! 

I would 100% recommend this place and definitely will be returning.  Thank you so much for the amazing service and food!"}
{"text":"Kaya was recommended to Me by a few friends and I finally had the opportunity to try it tonight for myself. The nachos were absolutely amazing. I had the flank steak stir fry and was pleasantly surprised by the complexity of flavors. My mom loved sweet potato fries had the most amazing chipotle sauce served with them. The sangria was not worth it. We tried both Red and white.will definitely return and try a different specialty drink. Worth the wait and price."}
{"text":"I hate to say this, I just can not recommend this place.  It's nothing wonderful and it is pricey.  Service is great but, for the price of food and drinks, there are SOOOOO many better places to try.  
The Jerk Chicken salad was OK, and the Paella was bland.   However; the bowl of strawberry/red pepper gazpacho was the best thing we ate today.  
Maybe its hit or miss here but, for me... it's been more MISS.
Ill take my business elsewhere... OH and FYI Kaya is part of the Big Burrito restaurant food chain which encompasses my FAVORITE place  MAD MEX !!!  Just not sure why Kaya is so inferior.  So I guess it does not matter if I wont come back to Kaya because Ill still go to Mad Mex every chance I get; ether way, Big Burrito gets my cash."}
{"text":"The black bean dip and tropical paella are delicious. Definite must try. White sangria isn't anything special. Try another drink. Kaya is a unique and tasty restaurant with great food and ambiance."}
{"text":"I decided to come here for my birthday dinner. It was highly accommodating and it they sat our party of 13 on time given the small space of the restaurant. I read that it's a Carribean style type of food and coming back from there for spring break last month I was afraid everything would be made out of conch and shellfish. Fortunately only half the menu consisted of that.

We began with some calamari, a carafe of the lava lover (which in essence is just a large bay breeze), and some of us at the table spoke nicely of the kaya burger but I ordered the paella which came out in a nice large portion. It wasn't the best or worst paella I've had before. The service came and went and the place seemed to have trouble bringing everyone's meals out at a timely fashion. Albeit, we had a large party, the last few people shouldn't have to wait an added 15 minutes to get his food while everyone else was sitting there waiting for our dishes to get cold.

I couldn't really tell what the draw of this place is, neither the food or drinks were very unique, even though it specializes in its own type of cuisine. If I had to rank the big burrito restaurants, Kaya comes in last."}
{"text":"I visit Pittsburgh a couple times a year and try different restaurants each time.  Kaya is definitely on the list of the best meals I've had in Pittsburgh! Loved the Carribean theme, its something we don't have in Philly.

We started with some of the house tropical cocktails and an order of the Jamaican jerk  wings, which were possibly the best wings I have ever had. The wings were large, juicy and spicy and the cilantro sauce tasted so good with them.   There are plenty of wings on the plate and more than enough for 2 to share.

The salads were also terrific, we had the grilled peach salad with herbs, blueberries and spicy peppers, I loved this combination. The heirloom tomato salad was also amazing.

For entrees, we had the crispy whole porgie which a whole porgie with a crispy fried coating and inside the meat was tender and delicious. Worth having to deal with the bones etc.  The Jamaica Green curry vegetables was good and spicy, I had it with shrimp but you can also get it as a vegetarian entree.

Service and atmosphere, great. Overall, a fun casual place to eat with well prepared, interesting food. Would return!"}
{"text":"Kaya, a really nice spot in the Strip District. One of my favorites to go to. They have a great selection of beer and super friendly staff. The appetizers are pretty tasty, too. Not your usual cheese sticks and tater skins. We had Jerk Chicken and something fishy that I didn't eat."}
{"text":"Have been to Kaya before but honestly it's been a couple of years. We started the night with some salsa and chips and the corn and lentil beignets. The beignets stole the show. Excellent flavor. Hot, crisp on the outside, soft and tasty on the inside. 

For dinner we split the Jamacian Green Curry veggies with shrimp. The curry was pretty tasteless and the veggies were mostly potatoes. 4 small size shrimp were hardly worth the up charge. In addition, we split the tuna tartar for dinner. It was very flavorful. Pure clean tuna. No fillers to stretch it out. It was topped with an avocado. Very tasty. Best value of the night. 

The one thing that blew us away were the drinks. We ordered a drink, who's name escapes me but is was a whiskey drink and we asked for it to be made with our favorite spirit instead of well whiskey. It was tasty. HOWEVER, at the end of the night, when we got our bill, we noticed that they charged us for the original price plus a full up charge for the premium spirit/ not the difference between the two. $21 for a small drink in Pittsburgh. You have got to be kidding me. It's Pittsburgh, NOT NYC. Get it together."}
{"text":"Stop everything you're doing and think about the last time you had a cemita.

An egg-based bread bun, rolled in sesame seeds. Cut in half and decorated with marinated (or grilled) meat (or meat alternative). Topped with a white, stringy, Mexican cheese. Adorned with avocado, onion, tomato, salsa roja (sometimes also a spicy creamy sauce), and papalo (an herb somewhere between cilantro and arugula). To dismiss a cemita as a torta is blasphemy; to enjoy a cemita is an understatement.

The cemita is elusive in the United States. Primarily found in NYC and LA, we rarely see the sandwich spread its wings beyond the most well-known of cities. Okay, okay, okay, now for the best part: Kaya has the best (i.e. only) cemita in Pittsburgh.

My unhealthy obsession for cemitas aside, Kaya is a pretty nice place for any time of dressy-casual. Great for date nights, sharing a few plates, brunch that isn't Ritter's, celebratory happy hours, and just about any other occasion you can suggest. The service can sometimes be a bit slow, but they do a great job for nearly always being packed. The menu isn't perfect, but there's always something to enjoy--the fish tacos, the mango salsa, but honestly why wouldn't you get a cemita and then another cemita to go and then a third cemita to ship out to your mother.

Other notes: Thursday night is fried chicken night. The Kaya Burger is one of the best in Pittsburgh (close second to the Pub Burger at Meat and Potatoes). They make a stellar bloody mary with some jalapeno-infused booze."}
{"text":"Read about this place in the Pittsburg Magazine in my hotel room and decided to stop in and try it when I accidentally walked by the restaurant. It's located in a very unique neighborhood call the Strip that has a long street with a bunch of small mom and pop type shops. The area is a little run down but retains its old time charm.

We asked what the top sellers were in the restaurant were and surprisingly the burger was not on the list. Whaaatttt??? Our waitress recommended the carribean salad and chicken sandwich. We ordered the salad and the burger.

The salad was nice but needs a little more robust dressing than just fresh lime. My friend had the burger and said it was amazing.

Worth a stop if you are looking for a nice place to eat on the strip!"}
{"text":"Ordered the flank steak with coconut rice. Looked excellent and steak was cooked as I asked (medium rare). However it arrived mushy and the sauce was flavorless and thick (like a gelatin). It was also overpriced at $23. I wouldn't return here."}
{"text":"Kaya never disappoints. I've been here a handful of times, and there's always something unique and interesting to try. The food is great, and the atmosphere is lovely! We started with the guacamole and a beer, and then I tried the corn and lentil beignets. There were tasty! A little spicier than I expected, but nothing I couldn't handle with my glass of water by my side!"}
{"text":"This place is always packed with people-a sure sign they're doing something right-and they certainly are! My friends and I arrived a little after 8:00 PM on a Friday night and the entire restaurant was full of people. After waiting near the hostess stand for no longer than ten minutes some seats opened up at the bar, we were in! From that point forward it was a 5-star dining experience. We were greeted by such friendly bartenders who offered us samples of the beer and wine we were interested in. The hostess even came over to let us know she was keeping her eye out for an opening table.
 
Food:
Everything was so fresh, delicious, flavorful, and unlike any placed we've dined in Pittsburgh in quite some time. Caribbean cuisine at its finest. For starters we ordered the Yucatan Hot Bean Dip with House-made Chips & the Lobster Tacos. The dip came out sizzling hot, a blend of beans, cheese and spices baked to perfection served with their house-made chips that really pack a punch! Quite spicy. We could have eaten the dip by the spoonful we were practically drooling over it. The Lobster tacos are served on three mini hard shells with cabbage and some other fixings. Very substantial amount of Lobster so you're getting your money's worth. My friend loved them-high quality lobster. For entrees we ordered the Jerked chicken thighs and the Caribbean Rainbow Salad. Jerk chicken was seasoned to perfection, very large portion served with two sides. The salad was enormous and comes served like a chopped salad with all the ingredients separated for you to toss on your own. So fresh and flavorful, close to 20 different ingredients in total. Overall dinner was fabulous, not a single complainant, and we will certainly be back again. It's very unlike us to not even look at the dessert menu--I guess it's safe to say we were completely satisfied and didn't need to consume one more thing. One additional bonus is the menu is seasonal which keeps it interesting and us coming back for more.
 
Ambiance:
Very unique Caribbean décor inside. Lots of wooden figurines and statues around the restaurant. Darker, romantic lighting. Caribbean music. Restaurant is on the smaller side but they pack in a lot of tables inside, outside and there's a long bar inside that seats about 20 people. Very cozy. The upstairs bathroom even has a beautiful mural painted along the walls.   
 
Overall service was great, food came out quick & always delicious, we loved every moment of our dining experience here. Can't wait to come back for more."}
{"text":"Kaya always has good food and service.  I am particularly a fan of the black bean dip with sweet potato chips.  And I have recently learned that I REALLY like their burgers.  That last isn't something I'd expect at a Caribbean-style restaurant.  I highly recommend that you try one.

The location is great although parking can sometimes be an issue, particularly on Friday or Saturday nights.  But even then it's not a big issues to park a little further away and walk.

The ambiance is fun and is suitable for a couple as well as for a larger group.  Overall I give them a great recommendation."}
{"text":"3.5, rounded up to 4 because CORN AND LENTIL BEIGNETS.

The main entrees didn't really impress us (Mahi mahi sandwich was a bit too dry for me, quesadillas were ok; disclaimer that we're from California?), but the corn and lentil beignets definitely did. I'm a big fan of cilantro, & that was pretty strong in the green curry sauce. I could rave (and eat) all day. 

Friend & I joked about making a list about reasons to come back to visit Pittsburgh. Bottom line: beignets make the list."}
{"text":"I love this place! The fish tacos are to die for, the bean dip is flavorful, and the drinks are delicious especially the dark and stormy. This is the place I go to when there's some sort of special occasion since it's a little pricy. I would give this place 5 stars, but the server I've had a couple of times is just really unfriendly and odd."}
{"text":"Stopped by after 9p one evening for some food/drinks while in the Strip District. They had a great looking menu, lots of interesting/delicious looking things. We settled on a few appetizers, the soft shell crab (absolutely fantastic with chorizo and potato) and the steamed buns (yummy pork with mango slaw) and the white sangria. It was all wonderful and the atmosphere was great too, would definitely return. The only strange thing was we were one of the last few tables and our waiter sort of forgot about us and we had to ask the busboy for our check after waiting 20+ minutes to get our waiters attention."}
{"text":"Oh Kaya. What a love/hate relationship I have with you. There are some truly great things on your menu. But the service . . . 

As one of the few places open in the Strip District after 5 pm I usually come here at least once a month if not more. As I am usually by myself I sit at the always-packed bar. And that's where the problems start. One bartender for a bar with around 20 stools that spans nearly the length of the restaurant? I don't know how they do it. During the evening hours, this is just not enough. Especially as they're serving food and fancy drinks. 

Management - Please try adding a bartender at happy hour to say 9 pm. The food runners NEVER remember your whole order. I don't get silverware until I ask for it. I don't get my aioli that's supposed to come with the dish until I ask for it. And the runners always look confused or put out with my simple requests. The bartenders are supposed to be providing these things but when do they have the time? Also - why does the food always end up on a metal prison tray with paper that ends up sticking to the food? It makes cutting impossible. Try plates. Really. They work. I know you're going for the rustic look but it's just not practical. 

Now I know what you're thinking. You're sitting at the bar ya dumb bunny. You can't expect table-level service. Oh yes, I can. Single people are making up more and more of the dining population. Expectations on the part of the restaurants need to be adjusted. And I have eaten at the tables in a group. The service was still not great. Lots of socializing between servers and not much hustle. And still, the resentful looks when you ask for things like cutlery and water. Now that's just silly.

If you're going to Kaya be sure to check out the Fried Chicken Thursdays. I wish they would do away with the incompatible sides like tortillas(?) and do a take on island soul food. Also the conch fritters would go really well with the chicken. Oh gawd. The conch fritters are so good. Crunchy on the outside and almost creamy on the inside. And the spicy mayo (aioli) is insanely good. You'll want to use it on everything. I love the Poke bowl as well although I usually order it without all the fruit. I prefer a simpler version. Pro Tip - The side dishes and appetizers overall seem to be much more interesting and just plain better than main entrees. The cocktails could be a lot better as I have ordered many different kinds and haven't found a stand-out. The liquor choices could be expanded as well. 

But whatever you do Kaya please don't lose the conch fritters."}
{"text":"The Good: cool vibes; well decorated, renovated industrial buildings, by the river. Really friendly, laid back staff. Varied meats / fish options on the menu. Bean dip is awesome, served with root chips. Sizable portions. Good crowd. Overall food is fresh, fun and tasty. 

The Bad:  Shark was a bit boring, totally got my hopes up. A bit pricer then $$ but for what they serve it's fair. 

Bottom Line: Spice up your life with some eclectic Latin food in a modern but authentic atmosphere."}
{"text":"Kaya=Get The Cuban Sandwich

Oddly it's kinda difficult to find a decent Cuban sandwich. Seems simple enough pork and ham, pickle and mustard and good bread.....not so simple. Kaya gets it right. 

Service is good. Seating is a little cramped when it's busy. You are close enough to easily steal food off of your neighboring tables plates. 

Nice beer selection probably 20 on tap. Not much crap. Nice strong drinks. 

My only caution would be if your going with a group make sure they have open minds. I made the mistake of going with a group of our culinary people and I guess I gave them too much credit. The menu is Afro-Caribbean so if your people are looking for familiarity go elsewhere."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh.  Very cool atmosphere at this restaurant, but the food is even better than the atmosphere.  The dishes have a Caribbean flair to them.  Tons of flavor and creativity in the dishes.  Everything on the menu looked great."}
{"text":"Really good at delivering a caribbean flare to food in a city that is far from caribbean! Unfortunately the drinks are not so spectacular and the decorations are borderline cheesy."}
{"text":"What a great happy hour! My hubby and I grabbed drinks here the other night before our anniversary dinner at Eleven (which was also very good by the way).  Kaya's happy hour specials included half off most drinks. I got the caipirinha and grapefruit basil margarita and my husband got a frozen mango mojito and Kayapolitan. Wasn't a fan of the Kayapolitan, mainly because it tasted like juice. But our other drinks were delicious and strong (get Joe to make your drinks!). After two I was recommending the grapefruit margarita to everyone sitting around me, haha. 

We also munched on the Yucatan hot bean dip which had some good kick to it. Unfortunately, I don't think their food is part of the happy hour, so you're looking at around $10 bucks for an appetizer. But when all was said and done, our bill came to $35 and we got 5 drinks and the bean dip (with a double portion of chips), so I'd call that a deal! 

I hope to come back here soon and check out their dinner menu. In the meantime I'll definitely be back for more happy hour deliciousness."}
{"text":"this was my go to brunch spot when I lived in Pittsburgh. the mimosas are on point. and the burger is really good. plus you gotta love the strip district."}
{"text":"Food was good but our wait staff made the experience regrettable. At first we couldn't tell if he was sarcastic and joking but after multiple interactions, realized the waiter was being extremely rude. Every time a friend asked for a drink he would roll his eyes, make comments about how long we were taking to finish, and told us we couldn't order menu items because they were getting low and needed them for other dishes. I emailed the restaurant privately to discuss this incident but received no response."}
{"text":"Every time we have a reservation for Kaya, I'm super excited and every time I see a friend check in there on Yelp, I'm jealous. Guess you could say I really, really love Kaya. 

We've done brunch, dinners & even one of their special theme dinners over the years and I've got to put several of their dishes up there with some of the best food I've ever had: the jumbo lump crab omelette on a Mother's Day Brunch that had more crab than most lump crabmeat dinners & the crab and avocado appetizer served during their Creole themed dinner were standouts I will never forget, ever! Yeah, I really love crab and theirs was fresh and perfect! And silly as it may sound I had coconut grits as a side with a recent brunch that I can't stop thinking about. Who but Kaya could give you a side dish like that? 

Delightful standbys as starters include the Yucatan hot bean dip, the ridiculously delicious tofu cracklins (and I'm not even a tofu fan but those converted me) or the lentil and corn beignets.

You can't go wrong ordering any of their lovingly and creatively prepared fish dishes, the fish or jerked tofu tacos or the Jamaican green curry vegetables with the black tiger shrimp. Lots of my family members love both the Kaya burger and the veggie Kaya burger. Personally there are too many other fun things on their menu for me to consider a burger.

Their Happy Hour half priced drink menu is also delightful! The grapefruit basil margarita calls my name regularly!

Service is typically a standout and on the rare occasion (1time) that it wasn't, their manager made sure we felt the Kaya love even more in the way she treated us. Phenomenal!!!!"}
{"text":"I came in on a Monday night around 7:30 with a group of 8. They were able to seat us right away outside by pushing together 2 tables. We all commented how we felt we were somewhere other than Pittsburgh as it was gorgeous outside and we were able to enjoy the weather. We just looked past the graffiti in the alleyway. I ended up splitting a carafe of Red Sangria with a friend which was good and nice to sip on. Although it only had apples in it but oh well. The table ordered 2 orders of the Jerk wings and I was able to try one. It was crispy and delicious and the Cilantro cream sauce was so so good. For entrees the table ordered Fish Tacos, Green Vegetable Curry, a Kaya Burger, and the Grilled Salmon salad. I had the tacos which were really good and with 3 tacos I was able to take one home for lunch. I tried the Green Vegetable Curry that was on the sweet side that I wasn't expecting but a nice dish. I loved the taste of the salmon salad, the dressing tasted delicious! 
I've tried to come here for happy hour before but it was too busy so I'd love to get in for 1/2 price drinks. I had a great time and can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"We decided to stop in on a whim for Sunday brunch.  Without a reservation, we were seated outdoors.  The hostess was pleasant, waiter was attentive, and the seating was clean.  He was very pleased with the vegetarian options.  I had the avocado bahn mi, which comes with a dressed side of field greens.  He had a veggie burrito topped with 2 poached eggs.  He loved the red sauce on the burrito and the potatoes weren't soggy or tasteless despite being mixed inside with the vegetables.  My food was perfect temperature.  The tempura avocado was lightly crisp, as it should be.  The dressing and aioli were not overwhelming of the dish.  Then came the drinks!  He had a tequila bloody Mary that was rich with horseradish.  He loved it!  I had a red sky and a pharmacist's daughter.  There were so many novel options from which to choose.  Kaya automatically got 3 stars because their cocktails, which were a little heavily priced for Sunday brunch, were definitely NOT short on the liquors, while still being tasty. Only complaint was the single restroom, although apparently clean, was very dimly lit, bordering on dark. Overall, we'd return."}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed brunch at Kaya yesterday. Really nice atmosphere. Not an over abundance of Sunday brunch selections but I loved my Crispy Fish Tacos! I also, shared an appetizer of the Guacamole and chips. That was delicious as well. 

Service was great and the food came out quick.

I will definitely come back to Kaya to try items from their lunch or dinner menu."}
{"text":"Had my first trip to Kaya this weekend for lunch, a Saturday, and it offered some of the best food that I've had in quite awhile. 

Their made from scratch, Jamaican dry-rubbed jerk wings were stellar (our waiter recommended including a chipotle sort of aioli to go along with them, too, which was incredible) and all of our sandwiches and tacos were great. Specifically, we had the Skirt Steak Cemita, the Shrimp Po' Boy, and the Tempura Avocado Bahm Mi tacos. Also saw a killer looking Cuban sandwich come out to an adjacent table, and the paella looked pretty darn good, too. 

The customer service was somewhat informal in a homey sort of way, and I enjoyed that the aforementioned wings took an accurately advertised 15 minutes to prepare. This allowed for plenty of time to relax on a hot day with a cold drink in a really nice atmosphere. A particularly nice touch was also the friendly stop-by of the General Manage, Monica. We were all so impressed with the experience that we immediately made reservations for Mother's Day for six, the day before Mother's Day, mind you, and the general manager was kind enough to squeeze us in. We cancelled other plans that we had made and were glad we did.

Can't wait to get back to Kaya again, especially for a happy hour to enjoy some wings, a cold mojito, and whatever else the place is offering. I'm an instant fan."}
{"text":"Ok I've been to Kaya a few times, my review comes about 40 minutes from leaving there. First off

1.BEST MOJITOS IN TOWN.... its hard to find a bar in these parts familiar with the Mo, let alone that it should be served with fresh mint, muddled with simple syrup and the right kind of Rum. Kaya does not fail here. 

2. Jerk chicken wings, pulled pork Quesadilla, and calamari are lovely, I am not overly familiar with this cuisine. But I feel like they hit the right mix of flavors here a little spice, a little peanut, sometimes coconut mixed in. Nothing overly done. I've also tried the Jerk tofu tacos, nice and still flavorful for the vegan or vegetarian. 

3. Best Customer Service, so I ate there with a friend tonight, who can be picky. She first asked for the jerk tofu done as jerk chicken tacos, A dish not on their menu but they accommodated. The chicken in the tacos was blackened, as Jerk meat often is she did not care for it. She asked for the wings, they came back and she again felt they were burnt although she began eating them anyway, when the waitress asked how were they? I promptly ordered another drink thinking I was settling in for a long night. My friend replied she felt they were burn but i could see the meat was tender, and why would she eat one if they were burnt? 

Again the kitchen and wait staff accommodated and brought her a dish of her choice, she went with creme brulee. Then out of the blue the manager who had already once rushed to her unsatisfied side, said they would be picking up our tab. This was not necessary as we told them we were happy with the rest of the food we ordered and we would be back. We put our cash together for a tip for the waitress and thanked them again. 

I feel guilty for my free meal i completely enjoyed and would have paid for, Kaya I will be back and not just for your fabulous Mojitos and excellent customer service."}
{"text":"Respectable eating establishment. I had the Poke Bowl. If I had to give a rating, I would say a 7.4. I would definitely return. 

For you Vegan our there try the Rainbow Salad. Totally worth it!"}
{"text":"My suggestion is to just go for lunch or dinner. The Brunch fell short for me. I had the chicken and waffle. For the price, the meal was a bit smaller than I expected. The chicken was really dry and had a sour taste. There were three of us. We had wings and dip as apps, two cocktails each and each had an entree. The bill was almost $90. I did see a super looking omelet at the table next to us. It looked fantastic. We are starting a \"brunch-a-month\" club. This was the first on the list. Not going back for brunch. I will go back for everything else. And Monica is the absolute most kind and professional person!"}
{"text":"Just, seriously -- don't come here. The food is so repulsive that I'm surprised they're still in business. I actually am having trouble revisiting the food we ordered there enough to just write this review. Also, despite what you hear, the cocktails suck. Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"Happy birthday to me. I was taken here for my birthday dinner by two of my work friends. I have not been here in a really long time. I always enjoyed their food and their drinks so I was happy that it was suggested. 

We made reservations, but were an hour late due to the rainstorm. They still had room for us and were so nice about it. We started with the Yucatan Hot Bean Dip and the Mussels. The bean dip was amazing. The chips were fresh and warm and the dip had a great taste to it. Yum. The Mussels were my pick and they were just ok. The sauce was amazing, we were even dipping our chips from the bean dip into the sauce. The mussels were too small.  I love mussels and I am not saying that I am someone who really knows all about mussels but these were really little and about half of the mussels were empty. 

For my dinner I ordered the Tropical Paella. It had chicken, chorizo, shrimp, scallops, mussels, peas, pineapples, and red peppers.  I love paella. This had a nice good taste to it but it had too much tomato and it overtook the dish. I did not see/taste any scallops which to me would mean that they were so small that I couldn't detect them. The pineapples were not overbearing and they were a nice added ting of sweetness. The mussels also were the same as the appetizer, small and sad. Overall the meal was really nice and I enjoyed it. 

I enjoyed the food. I enjoyed my drink. I enjoyed the experience."}
{"text":"One of several hip restaurants, in this hip part of Pittsburgh. The menu is somewhat exotic, and everything ordered was delicious. The ambience is cool/trendy, and the wait staff was very professional. Definitely worth a look if you're ever in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"In the middle of the previous week, I had yet another concert to attend at Altar Bar, and with gigs come visits to restaurants near the venues. Kaya had been on my brain for months, and I was on a mission of sorts to try them out, but all I knew was that they were on Smallman Street. 

I strolled down Smallman, a road that for the first quarter or so is pure industrial loneliness, particularly after dark. I passed Kelly O's: Closed as was Smallman Street Deli. I almost went into Marty's Market since it's new, but Kaya had me under a spell, whispering to me on a soggy Wednesday night as watery, formless headlights floated towards me, \"Before your show, you must come and taste...the Caribbean, boy...\"

But I couldn't find her!

Dodging cars, I trudged forward. Knowing that I was getting close to Altar Bar, I was about to settle for another nearby restaurant...until I heard those rhythms, those beats...

It was Kaya, and she was waiting for me. 

I opened the door and immediately felt as if I had entered a houngan or shaman's converted urban hideout. Masks of wood and dolls of straw hung in the gloomy, sultry, but lively and welcoming atmosphere. Businessmen dined amongst slackers. Professors and students ate alongside...me, the anomaly. 

Autumn, my server, casually approached my table, her eyes smiling, glistening in the brown darkness. 

\"I looked up the menu online, I already know what I want,\" I told her.

\"Shoot,\" she replied.

\"I want the Cuban Sandwich.\" I didn't see it mentioned or photographed on Yelp yet, and it was inexpensive. 

\"Dining alone?\" Autumn was perplexed by my solitude. 

\"Well yeah. I'm meeting friends at a show.\"

\"Wiz Khalifa!\" she blurted. Pittsburgh's hip-hop star and lover of Mary Jane was in town that night.

\"No, it's Sonata Arctica.\"

\"Who?\"

\"They're a power metal band from Finland.\"

\"Oh. Ummm, is that your scene?\"

\"I guess.\"

\"Oh, I'm sorry.\"

\"No, it's cool. I'm just not used to it being put that way.\"

\"Metallica changed everything you know?\"

\"Yes, they did, didn't...they?\"

Just as the conversation was getting...awkward (There was a tension between her and I for some reason, initially only. Hipster vs. metalhead?), I requested a side dish of fried plantains. Alas, there was no such thing on the menu that evening, but with a desire to please, Autumn rushed back to the kitchen and brought me two plantain chips. 

\"These are on the house,\" she assured. And crispy and sweet they were. Immediately, our dissimilar musical tastes became irrelevant and all that mattered was our shared love of food. 

\"It's cool that you like plantains,\" she gushed. \"I don't know why we don't sell them. Maybe next time.\"

That's when she recommended the Conch Chowder to accompany my sandwich, and a fine luncheon foil it was. Not having ever had conch before, I wasn't sure what to expect but was pleasantly surprised to find that it was akin to a clam that was more \"to the teeth\" if you dig. The milky broth never coated my tongue enough to miss the conch's oceanic flavors, nor did it allow the subtle nibble of the poblano peppers to go undetected. Sweet potatoes and corn merely disappeared and resurfaced in the pale liquid, frolicking like children in a swimming pool, adding texture and sugar to the warm, solacing, tropical stew, rounding it out if you will. 

Guilefully dimidiated on a bias, plated in a manner that creates the illusion of height, and served with a bowl of shocking orange chipotle aioli and some sour pickle chips, Kaya's Cuban Sandwich is street food morphed into haute cuisine through presentation alone. Tastewise, it is genius immaterial of where or how it is served and eaten. The turkey, pork, ham, Swiss cheese, and mustard are stacked in a deliberate sequence between with the flaky cuts of elongated baguettesque bread. I applied the pickles at Autumn's request and dredged each half of the sandwich through the ochreous, spicy cream before every bite, experiencing grains, sugar, salty proteins, dill, sharp cheese, and piquancy as actualized in the most exotic yet humble grinder you're likely to find in Pittsburgh. 

Once again looking to my mod, new, platonic acquaintance for guidance, I chose as my dessert (Kaya doesn't list them online for some reason) the Pistachio Pumpkin Pie. Served with a tantalizingly tart quenelle of cream cheese ice cream, a caramel glaze, and shards of pistachio brittle, it was apparent that \"pie\" was a misnomer. No, upon seeing and tasting this mildly decadent pastry, it seemed more like a dense, raisin-studded muffin in composition. By itself, this pumpkin cake would humbly satisfy a mid-morning hunger with coffee, but when paired with such creative companions in the aforementioned candy and frozen dairy product, it became a stroke of the sublime. With that, my affair in the Lesser Antilles had ended. Kaya, you haunt me...

P.S. Autumn was efficient, accommodating, adorable, groovy, and didn't charge me a dime for the chowder."}
{"text":"Have been to Kaya many times and have always enjoyed our meals.  Surprised that I have not written a review until now. Have had many items on the menu including brunch.  We stopped in on a Thursday because one in our group really loves the Fried Chicken Thursday.  The chicken is really good and comes with a very tart slaw and it had a very good homemade ranch dipping sauce.  
The drinks are good.  Our waiter was very good.  Refills when needed, helpful with the menu and with a nice personality!"}
{"text":"The food is written to sound amazing but none of the plates delivered. 3 apps, 2 main courses, and 2 \"craft\" cocktails. None of the food was finished and we didn't take any home. I would like a little more variety to the cocktail menu. Trendy bitter herb drinks only. None of what we ordered was bad, just only ok. Service was adequate."}
{"text":"This is our first time here we are from California and we wanted something different .. This place was Amazing our service was really good and our food was delicious.My chilaquiles were the Best"}
{"text":"I hear from friends all the time about how amazing Kaya is. It's difficult to get specifics out them or have them put it into words though. There's just something about the place as a whole that they are infatuated with. This could speak well for Kaya. Maybe they have the whole package??? My numerous experiences there over the years haven't impressed me the same. It is a fun spot to go to. There's something about saying you're going to Kaya that sparks up a little excitement in you. I'm not sure what that comes from. The food I think is way over priced. I've had their fish tacos, some kind of pork they swear by, and a quesadilla. Everything was good each time I've been there, but nothing to write home about. The interior is unique and a cool spot to hang out with friends for appetizers and some drinks. Maybe that's the source of the Kaya-love?"}
{"text":"Well, we went back again, with a friend who hadn't been to Kaya in a few years.  We accidentally hit a happy hour we didn't know about, and had a half hour wait for a table; no problems.  The bartenders basically ignored us for fifteen minutes while we sat there - seated at the bar - and that kind of soured the tone.

The portion sizes were opulent, and most of the food was excellent.  But one of the appetizers was just straight up burned; it'd be hard to respect the food you're serving *and* let that out of the kitchen.  

A-OK, since it averaged between excellent and terrible."}
{"text":"I'm not sure exactly what it was, but I kinda dug this place immediately. I could see it being a little different on a busy night, but i came for lunch on a weekday and it was very chill and friendly. The decor is cool as well, it's got caribbean flavor but not super kitchy or anything. 
    The bar has a great selection of beers on tap, and they also have some really great sounding cocktails.
I'm not sure if they use sustainable seafood, but they're meats are all from good local farms, which I always appreciate from a restaurant.
    I had the cuban sandwich, which starts out as really good and then jumps to amazing when you dip it in the accompanying chipotle aioli...yum!
    Overall, right up my alley: comfortable, good food, good drink selection, and reasonably priced.  I would definitely go back to try more..."}
{"text":"Dined tonight at Kaya with 4 colleagues.  It was actually our 2nd attempt to eat here because the first time we did not make a reservation (big mistake).  This place is not very big and they draw huge business. Reservations are a must, even for 5:30pm on a Thursday.

We arrived during happy hour where everything from the bar is half off.  The drink list is outstanding.  They have a huge offering of cocktails, wines, and diverse beers (I had a great India Brown Ale).  This isn't too surprising because the bar takes up almost half the space of the entire restaurant.

We started off with the conch fritters and mango-tomatillo salsa which were both extremely flavorful.  Everyone at the table agree that the pulled pork quesadilla, the fish tacos, and the Kaya burger were excellent.  Our waiter was very attentive as well.  Prices were reasonable for what we had.

Overall, Kaya is a great place for Caribbean fare.  Make sure you call for a reservation if you want a table (they're not on Opentable).  Compared to other Big Burrito restaurants, Kaya definitely appeals to a younger crowd. When we walked out it seemed like almost everyone in the place was under 25.  You may or may not view that as a good thing."}
{"text":"I brought my cousin to Kaya to celebrate her birthday and we had a great time. I made a reservation on OpenTable and was glad that I did because this eatery was pretty busy for a Thursday night! We started off with drinks and took advantage of their happy hour special (1/2 off between 4:30 PM - 6:30 PM).

After drinks, we started off with the Yucatan Bean Dip. It was very good and had a nice spice to it. For dinner, we both had the crispy fish tacos. These were made with tilapia on that particular night and were light and not greasy at all.

Everything was good and I would recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for something a little different. While parking can sometimes be an issue in the Strip District, that was not the case at Kaya as there are quite a few parking spots to be had in the area especially at night."}
{"text":"Kaya never disappoints.  Stopped in for a last-minute lunch and the rainbow salad with shrimp was everything I wanted it to be.  Fresh, colorful, clean, and healthy.  Beware...the salad alone is only about $12...add protein and you're almost doubling the price (+$8).  But it's so good it almost doesn't matter.  Check out Kaya for lunch and you'll leave feeling ready for the rest of the day!"}
{"text":"Awesome happy hour! Interesting veggie food options. Great crowd."}
{"text":"Was I on a date? She just looked at me when the bill came. There was no offer to split the bill. The look in her eye forced the words, \"I got it\" out of my mouth and I paid the bill. I had gotten a design internship that summer. It was half a weeks pay. Maybe it was a date so maybe it was okay. We went out to a bar afterwards and she went home with someone else."}
{"text":"I wasn't sure what to expect with Kaya but I was definitely pleasantly surprised. The food and the service were both excellent. We got the guacamole appetizer. It was a twist in classic guacamole with the added pineapple but it was extremely delicious. 
Then I had the Kaya burger for my entree and I was absolutely not disappointed. The burger was amazing and the fries were amazing too. My only complaint was that it was too big for me to finish it all. If you love burgers you should definitely give Kaya's a try."}
{"text":"This place was excellent.  Went here on a trip to the Strip District.  The portions were huge and everything was great!  I order the Jerk Tofu Tacos and they had a really good kick to them.  I would recommend this place to anyone looking for an exotic lunch or dinner while in the Strip District."}
{"text":"Just go.
Food, drinks, ambiance....it's a great place to catch dinner with friends & a cool place for a date & a neat place to take your relatives visiting from out of town. Spicy Tuna Poke... best meal ever. Okay... now I know where dinner is tonight!"}
{"text":"I have had happy hour at Kaya, but I had been wanting to try the food for months and finally got the chance after a Saturday morning shopping in the strip. I had the veggie burger and sweet potato fries - definitely my favorite veggie burger I've ever had. It was loaded with yummy sauce, avocado and an egg - so much flavor and the sesame bun was such a great addition. I've heard the regular Kaya burger is amazing too. This place gets pretty packed at most times of day and has a GREAT happy hour (almost everything was half off), but it's not a huge location so it gets crowded! Put this on your list for your next stop in the strip."}
{"text":"I have the best boyfriend in the world and together, we like to explore different restaurants. We actually keep a list of places that we want to visit and the list is long! 

Saturday night we were in the mood for something a little different and Kaya seemed to fit the bill. We had a 7:00 pm reservation, however, I do not believe that a reservation would have been necessary. Things didn't start off too well, as the hostess tried to seat us at the banquet next to a gentleman at the next table who was fixated with the TV and had his butt blocking off half our table. When we insisted on another seat and pointed out several available, the hostess said \"I think we are expecting a table of 10 and need that space\". Well, alrighty then. 

We did get a different table without an over hanger, but then it seemed to take awhile for our server to greet us. Adam was very nice and very knowledgeable concerning the menu. 

I had a Key Lime marguerita. BJ had a Red Stripe beer. We were starving so we ordered up a couple appetizers. We got shrimp fritters with spicy mango sambal. They were delicious but I thought they were a little stingy with the sambal. BJ got Jamaican jerk wings with cilantro cream. He said they were very crispy and tasted good. He also really like the cream sauce. 

For dinner I got the tempura battered chili relleno stuffed with hominy and crinimi mushroom stuffing and served on slaw. Adam reported that the chef had recently changed the recipe and inquired if I liked it (I was only able to eat a little less than half). I thought it was definitely the best chili relleno that I have ever eaten. The only downside was that it was served slightly warm. I like my food just like I like my men, hot and toasty! BJ had the Tropical Paella. It was chicken, chorizo, shrimp, bay scallops, mussels, pineapple, roasted red peppers and sugar snap peas. I managed to steal a couple snap peas which were awesome. But BJ, who always cleans his place, didn't finish. He reported that the portion was plentiful, but he expected the dish to be a little more Spanish type flavored, rather than a jambalaya. Also, he thought was over seasoned, the flavors could have been a bit some subtle. 

For dessert, we shared a single scoop of \"mystery\" sorbet. It was a mix of mango, ginger, lemon, etc. and after eating it, the rest of the flavors is still a mystery. It was a great finish to the meal. 

Our take was that the restaurant was just okay, nothing special and definitely not the place to go for a romantic meal."}
{"text":"I have never veiled my disdain for pretentious bistroids. I really do have a personal standard for quality/quantity/value, and over priced art projects on plates REALLY irk me. The Big Burrito Group really seems to love glitz over substance, and I've known this for years, but this evening's meal really put the icing on that cake.

After attending another event, my better half and I were off in search of food, and ended up wandering the Strip District. Our initial intent was to try Gaucho, but they had a line of hipsters out the door and around the corner. I'd heard of the Smallman Galley, and after finding it, and talking to one guy, we learned that it's a 'chef incubator', and that they were mostly between chefs. The two that did seem open, paid no attention whatsoever to two people discussing their signs and trying to figure out how things worked, so we left. On the way down the sidewalk, I remembered having had some decent wings from Kaya years ago, and tired of wandering and thinking, we just decided to stop the search at Kaya.

First, we had the gal at the front door, and five minutes of trying to figure out where to seat two people, and then were found a seat in the back.

Our server was very accommodating, but he was so high energy pep that we thought he may be zinging on something. He was kind of a cross between an aging hipster and a younger original hippy wannabee. He asked what we'd like to drink, and my partner mentioned that we'd just come from an event with drinks, so we didn't need to drink more. I don't 'drink' out, so I asked what their soda products were, and they're Pepsi, so I asked if they just had brewed tea. I ordered the tea, and he didn't ask if my partner wanted anything non alcoholic. We had to flag him down for that later. After discussing options, he ordered a ginger beer. It came in a tiny bottle, next to a small glass. 

The menu was a mish mash of culinarily-brilliant-altered (sarcasm) versions of Caribbean dishes that made it a little hard to order. I worked and lived in the Caribbean, and have experienced the authentic versions, and seeing the added 'twists' to dishes I was familiar with did not make them appealing. BUT, having lived in Puerto Rico, when I saw the special menu of the month supposedly honoring the cuisine of Puerto Rico, I saw Mofongo (something I make at home) and we decided to split an order of Mofongo and the Cuban sandwich.

The waiter was kind and split the Cuban and sweet potato fries for us onto two trays that kind of looked like cookie sheets, and the 'mofongo' came in a large kind of soup bowl. I looked down into the bottom of the soup bowl, and saw about five, maybe six very nice looking shrimp, some red sauce...but the mofongo was missing one very key ingredient. Mofongo.

Mofongo is generally fried then mashed plantain, with garlic and chicharonnes (pork rinds) mixed in, and TOPPED with some type of savory meat sauce (shrimp, pork, etc.). What we had was a bowl of light topping, with barely a hint of the actual mofongo. If you're going to honor the cuisine of a country, perhaps you might try finding an actual authentic recipe first? I mean if I gave my elderly neighbor three plantains and NO recipe, he could manage to make a better mofongo than what this pretentious bistroid served up for $13. I honestly dug my fork around in the bowl looking for anything that even remotely resembled plantain. There MIGHT have been a teaspoonful down there, but honestly not enough for even ONE solid bite of mofongo.

I pointed out to the waiter that this was NOT mofongo, and when a Latin looking family was seated at the next table he altered his pitch to call it more of a 'gourmet version' of the dish. I wanted to seriously tell them it was NOT mofongo.

The shrimp was good...and the Cuban was a saving grace. Again, a Cuban from a shop in Miami would shame this knock-off, but this one at least filled the void where the mofongo was supposed to have been.

If the Emperor's New Clothes could be sold as food for a profit...Big Burrito would be the ones doing it.

And the hipsters would oooh and ahhhhh.

**Final side note: Our waiter was VERY good. And that is saying something, considering the product he has to work with.**"}
{"text":"Stopped by here for lunch one day and had the Kaya burger with a side of sweet potato fries. The burger was gigantic (I couldn't physically eat it with my hands, rather, I had to dissect it with my fork and knife) and it came with a fried egg, avocado, their Kaya Special Sauce, chihuahua cheese, tomato, bacon, and pickles. I ordered my burger medium rare and I found it cooked a little too much for my tastes. The burger was alright - not mind-blowing, but pretty decent. The fries were a disappointment. I had read such rave reviews about the sweet potato fries, but I found them a bit stale, dry, and bland. 

Ambience of the place was very nice - eclectic blend of modern furniture and artwork. Service was very mediocre."}
{"text":"I love the grilled pineapple, so warm.. So sweet.. So delicious! 

Hands down best blt I've had!!! 

The drinks are pretty strong so be careful ;) 

Everyone raves about the chicken and waffles, they always look delicious.

Everything has seasoning and is good!"}
{"text":"so i've been working for big burrito for about 9 months and just FINALLY made it to kaya. i loved it and everyone needs to try it.
we arrived and sat outside (where you can see into the kitchen, which i must admit is kind of strange but i new the sous chef, so it was kind of cool for me). i ordered a guavatini which was pretty good. we got 2 apps: conch fritters (A-MAZING is all i can say about them) and chips and mango salsa. for my meal, i got the kaya burger. egg, avocado, secret sauce, how can you go wrong? my only complaint is that there should have been more kaya sauce on the burger, it was hard to taste it.
our server was super nice, and the prices were about average (now granted, i get a discount here, so without it, it's kind of on the expensive side, but for the quality and quantity of food, that's to be expected). the menu is small, but offers a good mix of caribbean-style foods."}
{"text":"I've been to Kaya in the past and it was great.  However, it appears to be experiencing a rough go of it lately.  I went for lunch and ordered the Jerk Chicken.  The menu describes it as a \"tropical chop salad, romaine, flour tortillas, mango, pineapple, cucumbers, tomatoes, cilantro, avocado.\"  What I received was chicken atop a pile of pineapple with some slices of avocado on the side.  The redemption of the meal was the wonderful chowder and some good wine."}
{"text":"More like 4 1/2 stars...not quite 5 because our food took a long time to get to us. 

A friend I drove in to Pittsburgh to support our friend who was showing as a part of NCECA. After that long drive and checking out some amazing artwork throughout the city, all while avoiding drunken green people (we were there on St. Patrick's Day), we were in need of some good food. And we purposely avoided all bars/restaurants where we saw green people hanging out at. 

One of the artists familiar with the area suggested we head over to Smallman Street, where we would have some options. There just happened to be another exhibit near by so it was a win. 

There's a fully stocked bar, booths, and tables in towards the back. Restrooms are downstairs...I didn't really explore to see what else was downstairs. Anyways, our server was great. He was able to answer any questions we had about the menu and very nice. 

I forgot what was ordered...I think one of my friends had a pulled pork quesadilla thing sans tortilla. It came with a side salad that looked amazing and some sweet potato fries. It was highly enjoyed. My other friend had ordered some broccoli cheddar soup (also highly enjoyed) and the vegetarian burger (not highly enjoyed, but finished). They admittedly don't make the patty in-house, and that may have made the difference. You can tell that everything else on their menu is made in-house however. It may be the reason why our food took so long to come out. 

I ordered the jerk chicken salad. While it wasn't what I thought it would be (it came with tortillas and not a lot of greens), it was absolutely delicious. It had some mango, cucumbers, tomatoes, etc. And surprisingly was even good wrapped inside those tortillas. Not for the faint of heart...I am someone who can take the heat, and this definitely had it. I basically licked the plate clean and could've probably had more. It was absolutely delicious. 

I would love to go back when/if I'm ever back in Pittsburgh. If you're around, check it out."}
{"text":"Went to Kaya on a Saturday night as part of some Bachelorette festivities. Our server was nice and very patient, as the majority of our party were loud and inebriated.  As our party trickled in, he told us to try and stay in our seats throughout the dinner as to make it easier come check time. 

My gf and I were one of the first to arrive and he made sure to get us some tasty beverages to sip on. We both had 2 mojitos ($9/piece)! They were soooo refreshing with a good amount of mint!

We had an order of salsa and chips prior to our meal. The salsa was also very refreshing. A lot of the girls commented on not expecting it to be as fruity as it was but enjoyed it. The fruit was bonus in my book :)

I ordered the fish tacos ($18). They were fried and I wish there had been a grilled option but they were still pretty damn delicious. There were three on the plate with a HEAPING portion of cilantro (triple bonus points for this). I only ate 2! I NEVER leave a (fish) taco untouched and I was sad.... but the two I ate were so good I was definitely satisfied. 

The bathrooms are quite small and dark but overall the ambiance in the restaurant is intimate and tropical. The place was packed the entire time we were there but there was room at the bar. 
I can't wait to make someone take me back here! Ha"}
{"text":"Do you have this issue where you really want to like a place and keep going back only to wish you hadn't?

We do, with this place.  

The one consistent item we like is the black bean dip.  We order this every time and it rises up above every other item we have ordered.

Please kick me if I walk in again.  I warn myself but I don't listen."}
{"text":"As a vegetarian I was really excited about the food here! I got the Tempura Avocado Bahn Mi Tacos, as well as black bean dip as an appetizer.  The tacos were delicious but missing a little something.. Put the black bean dip into them and OMG even better. Really impressed, and my mouth's watering just thinking about it! Hope to return soon (:"}
{"text":"Every month a large group of friends (10-14) of us get together for dinner at a Restaurant unique to Pittsburgh.  It's often times a slow and long dinner process because there are so many of us, but the service was great at Kaya, and I didn't notice that it took much longer for our large group to eat, than many of the smaller groups there.  

We all started off with drinks, and all of the cocktails I tasted were delicious and high end (causing the prices to be high).  Their Dark and Stormy was amazing, and something totally unique.  

The food was also amazing, I had the jerked pork quesadillas, and not only were they delicious, but they were huge!  Often times, when you order quesadillas at a restaurant, you have to get an appetizer to supplement your meal, but this was definitely not the case at Kaya.  On a side note, their chips are heavenly, and while probably not the healthiest, they really didn't seem all that greasy and gross.  

We were all too full to get dessert, but I would love to go back and try some sometime.  

The majority of the meals were under $20, and even the more expensive meat options were under $30, so I would say a good price for the quality of food you're eating.  

I would definitely recommend Kaya to anybody"}
{"text":"This atmosphere is great, cool music to vibe to as well. I had a two fish tacos and a salad that were very tasty. Definitely stop by when you're in the area on the strip!"}
{"text":"After Cirque du Soleil in the Strip, we wandered over to Kaya for some dinner and luckily we made it there before everyone else so the wait was only a couple of minutes. We sat outside and it was really nice on a warm day. Have to take advantage of them when we can here.

I agree with everyone else that the drinks are awesome - I could drink Kaya's white sangria all day. But as for the food I thought the fish tacos were overpriced for what they were. I ordered them from the suggestion of the waiter who said they were a popular dish since I couldn't decide. I just remember eating them and thinking to myself that I've had better. I would go back to Kaya for some drinks but maybe pass on the food. The service was super though."}
{"text":"The overall experience was ok.  I would probably go back because the food had some highs.   My husband made reservations finally after we tried their food at the Best Restaurant Party.  The decor is neat and the hostess was nice.  Our waitress was kind of odd and I didn't think she was listening half the time.  We tried the conch hushpuppies that were really good (I hate seafood and I loved them).  The sauces with them were amazing.  My husband got the flanksteak with yucca cakes.  It was also cooked very well and tasted great.  I got the burger, mostly because I saw someone else and it looked tasty.   It is a large burger (too big to eat without a fork and knife) and and it comes with a medley of root vegetable chips (but I asked for waffle fries).  My burger was burnt to a CRISP and tasted like it was on a charcoal grill too long.  I loved the sauce, but the waitress forgot to put in the waffle fries so I got the chips.  She did fix it when I brought it to her attention but then I got 1/3 of a tasting cup of ketchup which I thought was kind of strange.  So....  there were definite highlights (appetizer and my husband's meal) but my burger and the waitress was much to be desired.  Food prices seems on par with the other big burrito restaurants (so pricey but you get a good amount of food)."}
{"text":"So I've been here twice, and I was more than happy with both experiences. The atmosphere is so cool! I wouldn't really say it's the most authentic Caribbean venue, but they do a good job of incorporating those vibes into a place that people of all backgrounds can enjoy. It stays busy here for a reason. Everyone knows that their Sunday brunch is great. 

The service is really good. That's one thing that sets restaurants apart, in my opinion, especially at places that usually have a large crowd. The hostess is such a sweet sweet lady. She checked in with us a couple times to make sure everything was okay. The food was wonderful; it was appealing, flavorful, and very satisfying. The chicken and doughnuts appetizer is a must try. Please find a way to try it. I'll reimburse you if you don't like it... But I know you will. I've also tried the fish tacos, cuban sandwich, and other dishes and I don't have a single complaint. 

Make a reservation and go have a great time!"}
{"text":"My meal was very good at Kaya, but the mussels that I ordered for an appetizer went above and beyond! Everything about them was perfect, and the toast that we were given to soak up the delicious broth was an excellent compliment to the mussels.  I've only been to Kaya for dinner, however, and I would like to visit for brunch."}
{"text":"I'll start off by saying that this place really impressed me with their dishes. The taste and presentation of everything was just superb!

I ordered the eggs benedict with roast pork. The cornbread was crunchy, seasoned and delicious. I usually don't like runny eggs but they tasted great with everything else on my plate. Hubby ordered the rainbow salad and that was amazing. The size was generous and it included papaya chunks, mango slices, chickpeas, pickled pink onion, crunchy shallots on top, avocado and more! It really did look like a tropical rainbow and there wasn't any cheese, croutons or heavy dressing to ruin it. We finished everything super quickly. The prices are high here.

We went on a Sunday and stopped unexpectedly for brunch without any expectations. I will say it's actually a bigger place than most other restaurants in the Strip District. The owner had to move us to another table and there was a change and delay in being served but for the trouble, she offered us a free drink on the menu. I had the lime grapefruit margarita and it was so strong! Presentation was beautiful but I could not finish it ;). 
The only downside was the slowness of our server. Since we changed tables, we had to wait an additional 8-10 min for someone to notice us and assign us a new server. Other than that, they were friendly enough. I would definitely come back to try their weekday menu!"}
{"text":"My wife and I stumbled on Kaya when in town for a wedding.  The ambience was terrific and we got a table for 2 quickly.   

The service was good, well decorated, and definitely a nice place for a date.   

The barbacoa was amazing, you must try it out.   2 years later we are still talking about it!"}
{"text":"I recently had dinner here, and it was definitely some of the best food I've had in a while! The menu had so many new and interesting options, so it was very difficult to choose what to order. The street corn, tofu lettuce wraps, kaya chips & salsa, and lava cake were all fantastic. I ordered the Chile Rellenos as my main and I thought that was the best dish of the whole meal. The texture and flavors were incredible and everything was very satisfying yet not too filling. If you ever find yourself in Pittsburgh I would highly recommend that you come here!"}
{"text":"What's happening ? Good people usually great restaurant. Had Paella tonight that tasted like it was cooked in dishwater. My wife had salad that was purely lettuce leaves,no dressing nothing else at all dry as hell. We were minutes into our hot starter (great wings) then out came our mains. Choice then is which one do we let get cold ??? You are too good to become substandard like this."}
{"text":"When you sit out side it smells like poop. Smh I would never come back again. Why would make people sit out side if you know it smells like poop??"}
{"text":"Love the chowder. Ate the chicken thighs first evening and chicken sandwich next - both a good. Seems like a consistently good place to eat. Bear selection good as well."}
{"text":"One of my favorite go-to places. Fun drinks, delicious food, and a super rad atmosphere. I've been lucky enough to have Kurt as my server a few times. He's absolutely fantastic and super helpful with menu selections."}
{"text":"I've been to Kaya many times and have had stellar food and service but last night I took my girlfriend here for a date night and we left disappointed due to the service. It took a few minutes for ANYONE to acknowledge us when we walked in (we were standing around twiddling our thumbs) I made eye contact with bartenders, waitresses, and probably a manager but not a peep or smile from any of them. The hostess was speaking with a table right next to us and couldn't even lookup and head nod us or say, \"hey guys, give me a second.\" Once seated, a woman came up to us and offered us water. 10 minutes later she took our drink and food orders- couldn't tell you her name because she never introduced herself despite being our waitress. I got an old fashioned; my girlfriend got the mojito and both were great. I got the kaya burger and it was amazing. She got the tropical paella and loved it. The guacamole (app) was subpar unless you're looking for a sweet guac because the mango-avocado ratio is 3-1. 

Overall the food is what saved this experience.

Drinks-5

{"text":"I had the jerk wings and they were fantastic. They were cooked to perfection and they were bursting with flavor. I already can't wait to have them again"}
{"text":"Great food with a Caribbean twist.  Love the Jerk Pork quesadillas and the plantain nachos."}
{"text":"Impressive. Great food, service AND decor. Love this place.

We had butternut squash/pumpkin/apple soup, corn and lentil beignets, and the fish tacos. All were a hit. The soup is completely vegetarian (with a touch of cream) and had amazingly rich deep flavor and spice. The beignets were light, with a sauce we just had to finish. And the fish tacos were a classic, as others report, really nicely done. The soup was so good, we quizzed them on the preparation!

I found the interior attractive and interesting, with great African art pieces and sculptures, a beautiful wood wall and back room, comfortable seating and good lighting. Not too noisy at lunchtime, when they were about half full, and I like the industrial touches with the old brick building as the backdrop.

We tried a couple of their drinks, and the Hummingbird is a very good, unusual rye-based cocktail. The bar is innovative. And the caramel-cardamom ice cream was also really good, not too sweet.

Strongly recommended. They have a prix-fix fried chicken dinner on Thursday too. Absolutely nothing to criticize here, well-worth seeking out."}
{"text":"This place was just average. We started with the kaya chips with the mango-tamatillo salsa, which was pretty good but not worth the $8 price point. For dinner we got the Caribbean rainbow salad and fish tacos. The salad, which included guacamole, mango, papa and chickpeas. It was a refreshing salad, but again did not WOW. The fish tacos were with tilapia, and a disappointment based on all the amazing reviews.I would give this place 3 stars but the service was quite off-putting at the beginning. We had reservations and the hostess told me to seat myself outside. The waiter came out and got upset that I seated myself and told me to go back inside until i explained I was told to sit here by the hostess. He then told me to move to another table because he was too busy to serve us.  Unfortunately, this place will not a Pittsburgh staple for me."}
{"text":"GREAT drinks. Nate is a great bartender. 
The conch fritters were great. I loved the spicy Habanero Aoili. 
Had the soft shell entree which was just fabulous.  Perfectly cooked in a great dish. I could have ate many more.  Great job to all. Yum!!"}
{"text":"From the industrial look of Smallman Street, stepping in to Kaya is like walking into a tropical oasis. Beautifully decorated and colorful, there is a lot of character in the space. The owner is very friendly and it is apparent that this is a labor of love. We were seated for lunch and the server went over the menu with us, necessary as there are plenty of dishes with unfamiliar ingredients or combinations (pulled pork and banana, malanga).

She did not steer us wrong. We ordered chips and spicy-sweet salsa, and steamed buns with pulled pork. The house-made chips were composed of various starches, including malanga, a slightly-sweet root vegetable.

Our group ordered the Kaya burger, the pulled pork and banana sandwich, and rainbow salad. Rainbow salad is pretty special stuff (it's toasted garlic, spices, lots of different vegetables, and a lime to squeeze over it all, then mix) and Kaya's was a decent representation of it.

Everything was spot-on, overall. In the bathrooms - embossed guest towels! The floors, walls, bar, art - it can be upscale or kitschy depending on the mood. We are so happy we got here, and will be back in our Burgh travels."}
{"text":"I come to Pittsburgh on business pretty frequently, and a co-worker and I were bored after a long day of trainings and reports. So, we asked the driver for the shuttle at the Westin for recommendations and he brought us to Kaya.

I was not dissapointed. Jamaican Jerk Chicken Wings are amazing. If I retire to a carribean Island and Jamaica has sports books that serve wings like this, it's a done deal. After that recommendation, I turned over my life to the waitress, who was hardly stunning but could've convinced me to propose based on her food recommendations. She guided us through a meal of Jerk wings, Tempura Avocado, some Tacos Al Pastor that we split and a couple different brews that are not sold on the west coast but were very good. 

I'd definitely go back, especially since this is the only entry that comes up for Carribean food in Pitt on Yelp."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a few drinks about 20 minutes ago. The atmosphere is a mixture of islandy beach bar and sports bar, but w/ craft cocktails.  One impressive thing I must mention is the unbelievably swift service - I swear a drink was on my table before I even finished uttering the words! Wow.

Grapefruit-basil martini -  mmmm, basil.  Different.  I liked it.  
Mai Tai - WHOA, strongggggg.  Good gracious. Very good.

Terrific reggae and soca music."}
{"text":"My friends and I are Mad Mex regulars and I've been meaning to check out another restaurant in the Big Burrito family, so I was glad when an opportunity to have lunch at Kaya presented itself a few days ago. Overall I had a great experience and I'm already looking forward to returning.

The space itself is small but comfortable. Even at lunch time it was pretty dark and cozy. We waited only a few minutes before being seated, and everyone we interacted with was friendly. Our waitress was also knowledgable and answered all of our questions. 

I had the Crispy Fish Tacos. For only $12, it came with two large soft-shell tacos that were packed with cabbage slaw, avocado, flaky fish, and a slightly spicy cream sauce. This was, believe it or not, my first fish taco experience and I absolutely loved them! There was also a pre-dressed side salad; I need to find out what the dressing was because it was delicious. 

There were so many other options on the menu that sounded good. I'm looking forward to returning to try out the dinner menu and maybe also happy hour."}
{"text":"Kaya has been in business for over 20 years and they continue to provide an excellent menu and service. I've actually only been here twice, but my elder friend who came with me last night knew all the servers and the general manager. I'm surprised they were taken off of Pittsburgh's \"Best Restaurant List\" this year since their food and drinks are outstanding. I had the flank steak stir fry and it had all the right veggies and just the right amount of heat. I also had the capirinha and it was also mighty tasty. Since I work in the Strip now, this might be a more frequented lunch spot. Keep on keepin' on, Kaya!"}
{"text":"So good! Came here on a rainy Saturday night and the place was packed and jumpin with good vibes all around. I had to sit and eat at the bar bc there weren't any available tables left, but it's all good bc the bartenders were super attentive, friendly, and service was quick. 

Now for the food! I order the Jerked Pork & Plaintain Nachos and it was such a great appetizer turned into entree bc it was way more than I expected. Pretty spicy, but still very tasty. Can't wait to come back to try more!"}
{"text":"I really like it here. I've never had anything here that wasn't delicious. The bean dip is always good, and the menu is constantly changing & seasonal.  They have one of the best happy hours in the city, and this place is a great place to bring a date, whether it's the first or the 50th.  They have a very good draft list as well.  The theme, as many have likely mentioned, is Caribbean.  That being one of my favorite cuisines, I really have nothing bad to say here.  They even have Carib beer!  It's brewed in Trinidad & Tobago...it's not necessarily special, but I've spend ~4 weeks in the country, and it brings back a ton of great memories.  

If you haven't been here, you need to go.  It's location is not ideal in that it's in a relatively slow area of the strip, but this place is a real gem."}
{"text":"I love Kaya. I have tried three quarters of the menu items and have enjoyed them all.  Great food, nice decor/feel inside, waits aren't horrible.  Pretty crowded after work Fridays for happy hour...but that is probably good if that is why you are there."}
{"text":"I arrived at Kaya on a Saturday night with a party of 6 and the wait was over 2 hours- yikes!  Make a reservation if possible.  Luckily, there were 6 seats in an L shape at the bar which we took over.  Inside of the restaurant is pretty dark and intimate.  Our experience started out kind of shaky- the bar tender was clearly annoyed to have to serve such a large party.  But, he came around and ended up being very friendly and entertaining.  I was sipping on mojitos for my stay and they were great. 

We started out with the conch fritters which were unique and delicious!  Many of us ordered the avocado bahn mi tacos.  They were so good.  I would go here again just to order that.  

I was really surprised with how busy/unique and good their food was- especially for being part of a bigger corporation.  We all left full and happy.  Would definitely recommend trying."}
{"text":"Located in the strip District on Smallman St., Kaya is a big burrito restaurant and one of my favorites. This is sort of a 'Friday night tradition' normally with my wife and I when she flies into town. I always get the tofu tacos;however, it seems that the tofu tacos one on the menu today. I hope that's not a permanent thing! 

Sat outside with my friend Rick tonight. Had the fantastic ox tail bruschetta followed by the skirt steak on a bed of asparagus and polenta.  They serve nonalcoholic beer, which makes me very happy. I wish more restaurants did that! Oh, and by the way, I do not think O'Doule's qualifies as anything other than rotgut, so if that's what you serve, you're not serving nonalcoholic beer.

They screwed steak tonight was okay, but a little bland. I was able to put some hot sauce on it to make up for it.

Service is good, location is good, highly recommend."}
{"text":"I'm always down for Kaya, whether it's brunch or dinner. Mmm I've been to this place plenty of times, I don't think there's a time I don't like my food. This place at dinner time get very busy and I would definitely recommend reservation if it's more than part of of 2. 
Highlight of dinner: I love their happy hours which is half off drink. Yes sangria! And I always come here with my friends for their Jamaica jerk wings, the best in Pittsburgh 100%! Kaya burger and crispy fish tacos are also so good. Sweet potato fries mmm
Highlight of brunch: first of, mimosa is way overpriced. C'mmon it's brunch!! Ain't nobody tryna spend $30 on three small glasses of mimosa. Lol. Right. it is a little upscale restaurant. Anyway, get CHICKEN and WAFFLE. It's amazing :-) oh and my friend got steak and eggs, I had some of hers, it was super delicious as well. 
If you're thinking of coming here, stop thinking, go give it a try ;)"}
{"text":"I had been hearing a lot of great things about Kaya and finally got to give it a try. I liked the atmosphere and they had fun cocktails. The mussels appetizer was delicious and the pulled pork quesadillas had some great flavor. They noticed that our appetizer was taking a while so they even struck it from the check at the end of the night. So nice! I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Grilled flank steak salad and Kaya chips are fantastic. I really like the tomato-mango salsa. Great service with an attentive staff."}
{"text":"Highly recommend. Food is original, abundant, and well prepared. Staff are wonderful. Very engaging, helpful and professional. 
We had a complicated reservation - many moving #s in a large party - so I ended up having several phone calls and the team was super constructive and helpful. At one point, we grew to be too many people for the available space but shortly after that discussion, staff called to tell me there was a cancellation so we'd fit. 
We are from out of town and went to Kaya for a celebration. It was perfect! Also, all of our guests are from away too (college students) and every one said they'd be back with their family. Definitely a great place."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick lunch. The hostess told us the food would come out pretty quickly, approx min, so we decided to eat here. When we were seated the music was obnoxiously loud. We put our orders in and waited for our food. We waited a lot longer than 5 min... But when the food came it was pretty yummy! And the staff was personable and friendly. It seems like a great place to sit at the bar and have a drink but because of the music was so loud it really detracted from enjoying our meal."}
{"text":"I was really worried coming here for brunch. It was like seeing a friend after a very long time. You're pretty sure you're still going to like them, but something could go terribly wrong and you'll be disappointed at the hope of a long lasting relationship. 

Kaya is my go to joint for happy hour. Hands down they have thee best happy hour in the city. I mean, half off EVERYTHING! Even shots (okay, things get a little crazy when you enter that into the equation). And, of course, if you're drinking it up you also have to get some nourishment. Coming here so much, I've gone down the menu with my meals and not-a-one has let me down! All amazing... Big shout out to the Fish Tacos.

I'd heard how good brunch was, but I really wanted it to live up to the normal Kaya standard. You can see why I'd be nervous. If they ruined something as sacred as brunch, what would be left? Maybe I'm being too dramatic, because you know I'd be back at that bar once it hit 5pm, but still... I was expecting a stellar meal. 

I'm happy to report, they delivered, and then some! There were a handful of items that stood out to me, but the Salmon Eggs Benedict was the true winner. I believe the key item being corn bread instead of a biscuit. LOVED. IT. Every bite. The cornbread made the dish, but the hollandaise was a close second (you can't mess with a good sauce!). Eggs were perfect and salmon was smokey. The side dishes held their own with juicy sweet sauteed pineapples and a spicy potato hash. I really wanted to lick my plate clean. 

They can do no wrong in my book. Come for brunch, stay for lunch and exit after dinner. You'll probably want to throw up after a full day spent eating and drinking at Kaya, but it will have been worth it, I swear!"}
{"text":"Visited Kaya on Thursday for fried chicken.  Happy hour is a good deal with 1/2 price drinks. Service was good but for some reason the kitchen was backed up.  The manager was apologetic and comped one round of drinks.  Nice.  Appetizers were good but not great.  Steamed pork buns a bit bland.  Soft Shell Crab was good but $15 for one is a bit high.  Now the reason we went, the chicken.  Good, but not as good as we remembered.  A bit unusual in that the batter/crust fell off the chicken when we picked it up.  Not sure what that's all about.  Also, while you get 5 pieces, the actual chicken was very small.  Mostly batter.  A bit disappointing."}
{"text":"Definitely tasty, but it's not at the top of my list of \"places I'm dying to go back to.\" Unique and interesting ambience, service was good. 
We called to make a reservation Friday morning and they only had an early time or late time remaining -- we took the 8:45 reservation. So definitely call beforehand if you want a reservation during a \"prime-time!\"
We ordered the alligator, vegetable green curry with shrimp added, and the crispy fish tacos. The tacos were the hit; \"best fish tacos I've ever had\" according to my boyfriend."}
{"text":"The calamari was excellent, with toasted coconut and cole slaw with apple. The Tofu Tacos were very good, crispy tofu and three to an order. The helpings were large and the waiter was super nice."}
{"text":"If you are looking for fresh and full of flavor food then this is your place. The menu all looked delicious, I wanted to try it all. The beignets and the chowder on the appetizer menu are an absolute must!!! I am vegetarian so for the entre I ordered the vegetable paella and it was absolutely delicious! It was full of flavor and a nice sized portion. The beautiful décor and friendly staff will take you to the Caribbean in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Had a great burger, claimed it was the best in the city.  Fantastic service. I was a little let down by the speciality cocktail. Overall a good time."}
{"text":"Had such a great experience for lunch came back for a dark and stormy and stayed for dinner.

For lunch we started with conch frittersw- the sauce contained capers and was perfet with the perfectly cooked app. Share the Jamaican Green Curry Vegetables- added black tiger shirmp. the curry contained brussels sprouts, parsnip, peas, oyster and Hon Shimeji mushrooms, fall squash, pineapple and tomato. It was serve with saffron rice and was the perfect portion. 

Our server, Brenda was great -took time to explain the dishes we asked about sharing her honest opionion on her most and least favorites. 

I recommend the dark and stormy - black jamaican rum and ginger beer - very refreshing. 

Returned the next day for a dark and stormy and stayed for dinner - again a great server and a wonderful meal. No matter what you orer you will be satisfied. 

The place has a nice buzz about it - will return and would highly recommend it anyone visiting the strip looking for something different."}
{"text":"SC and I met up with a friend here for a weekday dinner and had luckily caught the end of their happy hour (430-630p) with 50% drinks!! I ordered the Grapefruit Basil Margarita and SC the Poco Picante. The drinks had great flavor and according to SC, his was \"the best drink I've ever had.\"

Food wise we got the Jamaican Green Curry Vegetables and Jerk Pulled Pork Quesadilla. There was a lot of great flavor in the curry and I love the fresh pineapple to offset the (a little too spicy for me) curry, all the veggies and the rice. It was comfort in a bowl!

The service was also very friendly and attentive. I also liked the decor of the restaurant. Would definitely come by again next time we're in town!"}
{"text":"I can't believe this is my first time at Kaya. I have heard really good things about their island food and great happy hour. We stopped after work on Friday, 2/10. The happy hour is from 4:30-6:30. This is a pet peeve of mine. Happy hour needs to start at the earliest at 5pm. With that being said, all drinks are half hour which makes up for the early start. You can't beat it. The bar is a little tight when it gets crowded during happy hour, but the bartenders worked hard and diligent."}
{"text":"The other Big Burrito restaurants are some of the pricier restaurants in town and I usually don't mind paying the extra money because the food is well worth it. Kaya has a lower price range but I still don't think the food is worth the amount they charge here. I had the conch chowder, which was fantastic, and the crispy fish tacos. The tacos were huge - I will give them that - but they were mostly packed with cabbage and impossible to eat without making a mess. I am a very experienced taco-eater and know some taco-eating tricks, but I tried just about everything including using silverware, and was quite unsuccessful. I was also bummed that they took the coconut milk cocktail off the menu - that was my favorite summertime cocktail in all of Pittsburgh. Oh well!"}
{"text":"This is a good spot and a good choice for the big burrito chain.  I was here last night and the place was pretty busy.  The decor is totally tacky, but in a fun way.  It's a relatively small restaurant with a really big bar.  There's also outdoor seating, which is great for people watching in the strip.  The service was friendly and prompt without being intrusive.  The bathrooms are a little out of the way in the basement, but nevertheless nice and much nicer than I remember them years ago.  We started with a selection of appetizers.  The black bean dip with cheese was pretty good and is the same stuff you get at mad mex.  The scallopp app' was awesome, three huge scallops perfectly cooked with a nice sauce.  I got the \"pork belly\".  I've had this in other places and it was different than this.  This was basically a really fatty barbecued rib, but I like ribs,so I was happpy enough.  My entree' was the flank steak, which was a nice portion but a little undercooked and the black bean side was cold.  Overall an average entree'.  My friend ordered the shrimp with curry vegetables, which she liked a lot and had plenty of leftovers.  I tried the shrimp and they were cooked well and very fresh.  The curry veggies were super hot.  I was a bit disappointed in the wine list having asked for two of the wines on the menu only to find out that they were out of stock.  This is a good spot, but I wouldn't really consider it caribbean or west indian food.  I'm from the carribbean, so maybe I have too high standards.  I'd say this is to carribean food what olive garden is to italian food."}
{"text":"You have to try and the chicken wings and the plantain nachos! Great location (right off Penn Ave) and really good service."}
{"text":"The relaxed atmosphere helps one to fluff of the shame of the week, as do the drinks. I enjoy this place more every time I go."}
{"text":"Frequently visited Kaya for Sunday brunch. Black bean dip is something special, Yum!! Sangria, white or red, is phenomenal. Everything I've tried has been tasty."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.  I've had the Kaya burger in the past as well as brunch yesterday.  Kaya focuses on an \"island\" theme to their food and is located in the Strip District at the corner of 20th and Smallman St.

Brunch on Sunday starts at 11 AM.  My companion and I decided to sit outdoors since it was a rare beautiful day of mid-November in Pittsburgh.  We started out with their smoked salmon appetizer and their Jamaican Jerk chicken wings.  For entrees I got the Kaya Benedict.

I ordered the smoked salmon b/c I like beginning my meals with some sort of cured meat, either a smoked salmon or some sort of antipasto.  The smoked salmon appetizer came out with a large serving of smoked salmon topped with minced onion, cilantro, a drizzle of creme fraiche and two fresh tortillas from Reyna's Foods right down the street.  We added the Jamaican Jerk chicken wings and it was definitely a good decision.  Typically chicken wings are fried and then tossed in a sauce.  These wings were super flavorful and crispy; I think they were marinated and then baked?  I'll ask next time I'm there.  The lime cilantro sauce was creamy and full of cilantro, but I would have liked a bit more lime for a little more zing.

The Kaya Benedict didn't meet my expectations at all.  It was cornbread with roast pork topped with poached eggs and hollandaise sauce.  The cornbread was sweet but it just didn't fit into the dish at all and clashed with the roast pork and the egg.  It's texture was soft and made the entire entree mushy...  The roast pork too... completely uninspiring.  It came with grilled pineapple, which was pretty good as well as their house hash brown, which was a plated as a weird mound with slight crustiness on the outside and mainly mush inside.  The spices of it just didn't click with me.

The Kaya burger though, is one of Kaya's saving graces (along with their happy hour).  I ordered it medium rare and it came topped with bacon, avacado, tomato, cheese, special sauce, and a sunny side up egg.  It comes with a side of chips, but you can substitute their side salad if you want.  Gourmet burgers are always interesting because the chef's choice in combination of toppings and the bun shows a representation of his/her cooking style.  As someone who views himself as a burger purist, I'm not too familiar with gourmet burgers in general, but the Kaya burger did impress me.

I'd probably just stick munching on some appetizers with drinks during their weekday happy hour from 5-7 PM."}
{"text":"I can't believe I've never reviewed Kaya!  Kaya is a Pittsburgh staple that has been around years before the 'burgh became a big foodie town, and is still going strong.

Kaya's food is fresh, full of flavor, and a great value.  I'm particularly partial to the Crunchy Fish Tacos - these are 3 tacos full of fried fish goodness, topped with plenty of veggies.  And the drinks!  Oh my - strong, varied, and delicious.  Plus they even offer non-alcoholic mixed bevvies if you are so inclined.

Reservations are a must on busy nights, which you can make online at Open Table.  Parking is limited in the Strip, and if you do park on the produce terminal side, there is a charge (bring cash!)."}
{"text":"We came here over the weekend and it was quite yummy.  I loved that you had the option of dining inside or outside.  We chose outside.  Great for watching all the hustle and bustle the strip has to offer on a Saturday afternoon. I had the Kaya Burger and the red sangria. It was just what I was craving.  Mmm beef.   It had avocado, bacon, fried egg, and kayas secret sauce, mayo based with sweet potato fries and chipotle aioli for dipping.  It was darn delicious.  The egg yolk was oozing out perfectly over the beef and bacon.  My only complaint is it was well done, asked for medium, and it took about 40 minutes to get our food without an explanation or an apology.  Just a heads up would've been nice. They were empty inside with a few patio tables outside.  Will be back next time at the strip!  Can't wait to try more of their menu items!"}
{"text":"Came up to Pittsburgh for VCCPA15, and our server was Chaz. We absolutely loved the service and the food. Chaz had made the environment so relaxed and suggested awesome selections. The food itself was beyond on par, i had tried the fish tacos which was suggested. I don't think I have ever had a fish taco that tasted that amazing. If you are visiting Pittsburg and you are around the strip. Its a must to stop by this restaurant!"}
{"text":"The N/A beverages are fantastic!  I love the kaya juice.   I had the black been and pineapple quesadilla and it was amazing!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed our visit to Kaya restaurant. The drinks and appetizer was just great. We ordered green curry - it had too much pepper in it, making it hard to enjoy. We also ordered plant in tostada, it was alright. The mango creme brulee had a bitter taste.

The ambience is great and service is excellent. I wish the food was similarly good."}
{"text":"I've visited Kaya several times now, both for lunch and dinner. This review is a little bit biased in that I'm generally not a big fan of the \"island cuisine\" that Kaya serves. It's one of my least favorite \"Big Burrito\" restaurants.  As such, I've never independently chosen this restaurant as a place to eat,  I've only met people who are already there. 

Nevertheless, I always receive friendly and knowledgeable service from the waiters. In terms of the appetizers, I enjoy the calamari and the tuna tartare. My favorite entrees (the only ones I can order, really) are the kaya burger and the crispy fish tacos.  The burger is huge and packs a punch, but for some reason has a sunny side up egg on top of it. I don't understand where the egg fits into island cuisine, but ok. The fish tacos are less substantial but still very tasty. 

I'm don't like \"jerk\" spicing, but if you are, you will have a great deal to choose from on the menu. EVERY category of food from the tapas to the appetizers to the main courses has SOMETHING \"jerked.\" Hey, did I mention \"the new phone book's here!?\"

All around, Kaya has quick and nice staff but few offerings for a lady who doesn't like the cuisine theme, so three stars it is."}
{"text":"The food is amazing and after working in a professional kitchen all day, I would come here and fall in love with someone else's food for a change. You will fall in love with the food too. Must stop in here."}
{"text":"I have only been here a few times but I feel confident in my feelings toward Kaya. It's a  Big Burrito restaurant which owns restaurants like Casbah, Mad Mex, and Eleven all very respected restaurants in Pittsburgh. Kaya is Island themed and falls in the mid to upper price range of the several Big Burrito restaurants. 

Between my wife and I we have tried a few dishes on the dinner menu and all of them have been delicious. What I really want to talk about is their Sunday brunch menu. 

My wife and I happened to be in the strip on a Sunday and wondered into Kaya for a little lunch. We had the Eggs Benedict and Fried Chicken & Waffle. The Eggs Benedict was good but what I crave is the Chicken and Waffles. 

A large Belgian style waffle with spicy breaded chicken strips on top. The syrup was extra sweet with what I suspect may have been infused with vanilla to make it extra sweet. The combination of spice breaded chicken and sweet syrup on top of a delicious waffle was about more than mouth could handle. It was so good that you will just have to try it yourself. 

Don't miss their weekly happy hour  Mon-Fri 5-7 and if you are there on sunday do yourself a favor and get the chicken and waffles."}
{"text":"I went to Kaya for lunch with a Yunzer friend. Veg options weren't abundant, but the lone veg lunch entree, Jamaican green curry, was solid. I particularly enjoyed the saffron rice.

Decor and service were both pleasing. Another success pulled off by the big Burrito Restaurant Group!"}
{"text":"Service was awesome....thanks Brian! Atmosphere was really colorful and cultural. Food was amazing! We got the jerk pork quesadilla and the fish tacos. Both great choices. Really great beer and mix drink selection. The hot bean dip is out of this world and the homemade chips really hammer it home. If you don't go here you are dumb."}
{"text":"Love this place. Everyone is so friendly. Both the other customers and the Kaya folks. The food is great and the service is outstanding!"}
