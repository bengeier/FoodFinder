{"text":"Excellent carvery. 
£3.99 for a big plate full
Great place to eat, kids love it to because of the playground."}
{"text":"Scalby Manor re-opened late last year, having rebranded itself as a Crown Carvery. The building is is an old Victorian Manor House set in countryside just to the north of Scarborough.


 The food is pretty good - generally speaking, in places like this you know what you're going to get, and it doesnt disappoint in that respect. The carvery is pretty good value -daily carvery with choice of usually three roast meats, a choice of vegetables, new British potatoes & accompaniments for only £3.50 per person. Or Sunday £6.50. On top of this theres always a vegetarian ption and a childrens menu.


 They have a decent wine list too, as well as a range of beers on draught and bottled, and soft drinks and spirits as you might expect. Having recently been totally refurbished it looks fresh, clean and tidy inside.


 Its a family friendly venue, and has an outdoor play area for the kids. Worth a visit."}
{"text":"Great value for money, our family of 4 enjoyed the carvery for £13 (another £8 for drinks). The kids are allergic to dairy products and when I asked the chef if the veg had butter on he disappeared into the kitchen and came back with a huge plate of veg for us minus any butter, so very impressed with that.
We went at teatime in the week and it was busy, had to wait a while to get served at the bar. Food all hot, fresh and tasty, we'll be returning."}
{"text":"Cheap, cheerful and reliable hearty roast dinners. Can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Excellent value for money and I am sure you will not be dissapointed. Visted 3 times during my stay at the camp site next door and each time I was highley satisfied.
Always busy but very effecient staff and you did not have to wait long for your meal."}
{"text":"Great value hence so popular  avoid peak times"}
{"text":"I feared for the quality of what I would get for 3.50 but I am happy to say I was surprised at just how good it was. I opted for the 1.50 upgrade and had beef, gammon and turkey. All the meats were cooked well and were very tasty. Good array of veg and ate until full. Black sheep on draught. Staff efficient and friendly. A busy place and I shall return"}
