{"text":"Small local place my parents go often. Friendly staff. Vintage decor. Great fresh fruit and kid portions. Ate breakfast today. Standard breakfast options. Nice little place. Nothing super unique but a nice breakfast. Prices reasonable. ($4 kid meals w drink) my breakfast $7.95, coffee $1.95)."}
{"text":"Small diner style spot with a large menu. Breakfast anytime which is nice for those days you want a change of pace. Omelets are IHOP style with a southern twist. Everything I have tried has been great. Wait staff are always friendly."}
{"text":"Great breakfast at a great price. Everything is homemade and they use fresh fruit toppings on their pancakes. Haven't had lunch or dinner, but my wife and I go often for their breakfast."}
{"text":"I am giving this place 5 stars. No doubt, hands down I just ate the best omelette ever outside of my home. I also ordered the deep fried French toast. Just had to try it. They are great as well. When I go to a restaurant I have to order the sweet tea. To me that is a sign of how down home you really are. The sweet tea was perfect!! The hash browns were tasty and crispy just the way I like them to be. What a great place to come for breakfast anytime of the day.  The service was excellent too. Winning!!"}
{"text":"There is nothing better than a Detroit Coney Dog people who have never had one should not criticize.  Will we tell Emeril not to bring his Louisiana background to the Charlotte area?  I do have one thing to say regarding Omega, how dare you bring something as good as a coney and charge almost twice as much than you do in Detroit!  By the looks of your reviews we will not attempt to dine in any of your restaurants, pay much more, and deserve more.  Just a little note when you go to a coney island for dinner remember they speciaize in coneys"}
{"text":"The Owners and staff of this restaurant are what set it aside from any other in its class, not to mention the food.  Whenever you walk in they greet you by name and let you choose between your \"regular seat or something different\".  The food is always good and portions are generous.  It is not a gourmet restaurant, but rather a fantastic lunch spot for the Indian trail area and a tasty weekend brunch spot."}
{"text":"It is really good food at a great price.  They are super nice in here too.  I adore their Hush Puppies and they will even give them to me at 8am if I want them.  That is excellent customer service!!"}
{"text":"Stopped for lunch, had a Rueben with homemade chips.  Great Caraway rye bread, lean corned beef and good Kraut. Dressing on the side,so you can add as much or as little as you like.  Under new management, the place was clean, service fast and friendly.  They have a huge menu, but it's for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  Have to go back to sample more choices."}
{"text":"We went in expecting to eat at Trail's End -- we loved having breakfast there on the weekend.  Once inside, we discovered that the restaurant has changed ownership and is now Omega Coney Island.  I ordered corned beef hash and eggs over medium - my wife had an omelette with hash browns.  The hash browns appeared to have been made much earlier (maybe the night before) and were essentially almost mashed potatoes that had been fried in a pan.  The outsides were burned and the inside was like mush.  My \"corned beef hash\" was actually not corned beef hash at all, but rather pan fried corned beef on top of the same poorly cooked hash browns.  Over all, a bad breakfast and we are very sad to have lost Trail's End."}
{"text":"We have eaten here before and decided to return. They seemed busy and noticed most customers were eating breakfast as it was only 12:45 on Sunday. The waitress took our drink order , then another waitress came and asked us also. When she returned with drinks and to take order I asked her to give us a minute to look at menu and she returned to to our order. My husband ordered a patty melt, fries and okra. I ordered a fish sandwich. A young man came to table to refill the jelly container. An older man walked by and said they were not as busy as usual and were trying to find things to do. Our meals came out as ordered, and I asked for tarter sauce. I waited for awhile, then flagged down another waitress and asked again. She came back and said they were out and are making it, she said someone should have come out and told us. Ten minutes have passed and the older guy walked by and I asked him. He said 'Yeah, they are making it and I hope you get it before you are done.' I haven't eaten yet and food is getting cold. My husband is almost finished. I got up and went to register and asked another lady if she was the owner. She said no and pointed to the older guy who said he hoped I got it before I finish my meal. I went back to table and sat and then they finally brought it out. The waitress said \"Sorry, it was not intentional.\" I said that it is okay, I will be sure to write a review. Our drinks were not even refilled until we asked for our bill. The owner really has a care- less attitude, and needs to learn some customer service skills. We will not return."}
{"text":"I came in strictly because of the breakfast served all day sign. I had the half stack pancakes with eggs and ham. It came out pretty quickly and everything tasted great. The service was good even with being very busy. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We love Omega!! The breakfasts are always wonderful and a great price point!  We've ventured out for lunch and dinner a few times.  My husband enjoys their chef salad and their dogs.  I really enjoyed the chicken gyro pita.  The staff is really friendly and so great with our kids!"}
{"text":"Glad been very curious & am SO GLAD I STOPPED. I love the bacon cheeseburger & onion rings. Very taste & fresh. My daughter tried the meat omlett and it was good.  Lots of meat & cooked perfect. Would highly recommend stopping!"}
{"text":"I went in Sunday the 22nd and waited 30 minutes for gyro and fries. Fries were luke warm. This place since its been under new management has gone downhill. They really struggle getting food out in a timely manner when it's busy. Never waited more than 10 min for my food with previous owners."}
{"text":"My wife and I live in Indian Trail and are back again this week just to see if the quality and service was just a fluke. It wasn't. The service was just as friendly and prompt and the coffee was just as hot and good. We ordered the vegi-omelette with hashbrowns. All I can say is WOW! They were so good and fluffy. The hashbrowns were fresh and cooked perfectly. We also ordered the blueberry pancakes which were the bomb. They were as big around as a volly-ball and were so fluffy and so good. Again thank you Omega for once again giving us a  great start to our day."}
{"text":"My husband and I are from MI and LOVE coney islands! We were so excited to find this place. We come here often for their wonderful breakfast and friendly staff! We have never had a bad experience here."}
{"text":"Use to be a great place. Unfortunately, the food and the service are not good at all. It took 20 minutes just to get 2 diet cokes and a water. The waitress then took our order, brought it out, and said she was leaving so please cash out now. We had not even taken a bite of food. The food was horrible! The toast was not even buttered, was very crispy and dry. The hash browns had no flavor at all - no seasoning, no butter. The pancakes were very dry as well. When I expressed my dissatisfaction about the food, the owner agreed that the food was bad and that it was probably not a good idea to eat there again. Really???"}
{"text":"The best diner breakfast in the area. Basic American with a Greek influence and waitresses who call you honey or darlin.  I love the Greek omelette and have them add spinach. It has been our family go to location for breakfast since we moved here 5 years ago."}
{"text":"This was by far the worst experience I have ever had in a restaurant. I have been in the service industry for over 10 years and I can't imagine ever giving someone the kind of service my husband and I received here. We waited 10 mins for a table which we expected on a Sunday afternoon, but that wasn't the problem. Our food took over 40 mins to come out. The restaurant wasn't even super busy. We never saw our waitress after she took our order and when we finally did I politely asked if our food was going to come out soon because we needed to get going. The manager came out and told us \"you should know your food is going to take 20-30 mins when you come at 1pm on a Sunday afternoon, and you shouldn't be in a hurry\" then he said our food was probably sitting in the window waiting to be ran but nobody was competent enough to run it... Extremely unprofessional. Our food finally came out and it was wrong. I ordered blueberry pancakes and two over medium eggs. The eggs came out scrambled, and the pancakes were just regular with no blueberries. I honestly was so fed up I just decided to eat it anyways. The pancakes were cold and just not good so I didn't eat them. I decided to go ahead and eat the scrambled eggs when the manager came out to the table and said \"hope those scrambled eggs are good that you're eating that belong to someone else\" and then put over medium eggs down on the table in front of me and walked away. I couldn't even believe what just happened. At this point I was really upset and just asked for our check to leave. We will definitely never be going back!"}
{"text":"I was introduced to this place by a small group of folks who highly recommended it.  Our group comes twice a month on Sundays to enjoy a good, reasonably priced meal.  No qualms with the food at all.  However, the last two times we've gone, a waitress (different one on these two occassions) rudely came up to our table and asked us to leave as they needed our table. This last time she said people were lined up, waiting on tables.  I got up to look and well, one group of four was waiting.  Really?   We had been there 45 minutes, waiting 20 minutes for our food to come and don't want to be pushed out the front door.   I understand this establishment makes their money by the turnaround of tables, but quite frankly, so what?  It just doesn't make sense to me if you want to keep loyal customers, don't start pushing them out the door.  Not sure if I'll go back with my group."}
{"text":"We were visiting the Charlotte area, and found it difficult to find cool places.  This one was a gem.  We had breakfast there every morning, all dishes were Excellent.  The place has great charm and the staff is overly friendly.  Definitely worth the stop if you need some breakfast in the Matthew, NC area."}
{"text":"Coney Island, Michigan style!! Another reviewer was not so happy with the corn beef hash, which I agree is below par.  But the food and service are otherwise very good.  And breakfast anytime is something most so-called diners in the Charlotte areas just don't get.  Most importantly: If you're from Michigan, or want to get a taste of an honest-to-God, Detroit-style Coney Island hot dog, loose burger or baby greek salad, this is THE ONLY PLACE TO BE.  Dogs and chili imported from Detroit.  It's a twice-a-week destination for me!!"}
{"text":"Good hole in the wall breakfast place. All homemade food. Breakfast hash is good and the biscuits are made fresh."}
{"text":"Great Hamburger steak!!! Went in to eat and kill time during a traffic jam on Old Monroe Rd ('cause if you're from around here you know the struggle) but overall good food, nice staff. Clean restaurant and restrooms!!! The fried okra was cooked perfectly & THEY SERVE BREAKFAST ALL DAY LONG! Daily specials with affordable prices!"}
{"text":"I know there are mixed reviews on this place. Maybe that means it won't get too crowded, and that would be great. This is a locals spot, no question. The people who come here, come back for repeat business a lot!.   We dared to try this place, even with the mixed reviews and are very happy we did. We are a repeat customer now, and look forward to trying more of the menu.   The service has always been spot on, very attentive and very friendly. The prices are great, and the food has been delicious."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast, ordered the eggs over medium and they came back way under cooked. Not edible. The toast was saturated in butter. Was stunned when we got the bill and they charged separately for the meat. Very conceiving when looking at the menu. The waitress was friendly and it was clean. Will not go back!"}
{"text":"We tried to eat there on Wednesday 4-24-13 at 3:15 pm.  I had purchased a coupon from groupon and was told i could not use it until after 4:00 pm. So I looked,  and there was nothing about time on the coupon just an expiration date . So we asked the lady that was waiting on us about that and she said \" oh this must be an old coupon\". I told her yes, but the coupon does not expire until july 2013. So about 5 minutes later the waitress came over and said she called the owner and he would not honor the coupon, because groupon had not paid them.  We got up and left...just a matter of principle....  if you have a problem with the advertising company you are working with don't fight with your patrons fight with the advertising company!"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch just the other day. My husband drives by almost everyday for work and wanted to try this place. Ugh!!! Horrible from the waitress with her nasty attitude and not letting me finish my sentences.  Food did not look appetizing at all. The booths , seats, tables, decor looked dirty and out dated. To tell you all !! I did not eat a thing there!!! My husband and son were not impressed either.. We won't be back."}
{"text":"I have eaten breakfast lunch and dinner at Omega Coney Island restaurant and every time it has been delicious. I have read some of the other reviews so I wanted to wait until I had tried it a few times before I made my final decision and I have to say I love this restaurant. The first time I went was for lunch and I had a club and french fries which I know seems pretty simple but a lot of places can't seem to do it well however the Omega club was yummy and their fries are scrumptious. The second time I went I had the most amazing Italian wedding soup it was the best soup that I have ever eaten you could tell it was homemade and it was made by somebody who knew exactly what they were doing I could go there every day and just get this soup. I also had a Mushroom Swiss burger and french fries the hamburger was cooked to perfection juicy and exquisite, the french fries perfect as usual. The Omega offers breakfast all day everyday so this evening I decided to try breakfast for dinner I had the western omelette hash browns and grits with cheese all were perfectly cooked and absolutely delightful. I also had the homemade vegetable soup and again whoever makes this soup is a master it was absolutely divine. I know when you're driving past the Omega it's not much to look at and when you go inside it's not really fancy but the food is prepared fresh the menu is extensive from at least 5 different kinds of hot dogs, Gyros, pitas, hamburgers, sandwiches, Patty melts, salads, full dinner plates and every kind of breakfast items you could ask for it really is worth a try in fact several. The the service is friendly OnPoint if you need anything they're quick to get it and make sure you have everything you need to make your dining experience perfect. I highly recommend that you try this restaurant as soon as possible side note they have delicious macaroni and cheese."}
{"text":"Very delicious breakfast. FRESH hash browns. FRESH biscuits. Excellent price. I haven't had lunch or dinner here yet. Highly recommend breakfast!"}
{"text":"Used to come here when it was Trail's End, but don't remember it much. Rediscovered with a friend as a student at CPCC Levine campus and we loooove this place! Food is cheap, wait staff is friendly and helpful, and everything is good. I usually get the super patty melt if I feel like a big greasy burger, but breakfast is great too, and specials make the prices super reasonable. I this place were open late into the night, because unfortunately it closes at 7pm now."}
{"text":"Omelets okay everything else sucks!  Don't waste your time or money. I'm originally from NY and The name \"Coney Island\" got my attention so I went to check it out! Left there with a stomach ache! Home fries... Yuck!"}
{"text":"Soooo this place is either hit or miss. Today there wasn't even a swing.  My wife and I Have dined here several times and have had 3 star experiences at best.  We love the location , option of lunch or breakfast and the small town feel. That is why we continue to come back. ...or should I say continued, past tense.  Today we were greeted with a warm welcome and sat at a booth in the back.  Took several mins for the warm welcome lady to come back and get our order.  We were in the mood for lunch so my wife ordered the chicken gyro and I ordered the Philly steak with no peppers.  We also ordered an order of onion rings ( gotta love onion rings!)  About 5 mins after taking our order my wife's gyro arrived. It was regular not chicken. The host/busser/server said that my sandwich would be out in a min. My wife likes regular gyros, so she decided to eat on with out pointing out the mistake.  No biggie , right?   A few mins later my philly steak came out and it did have peppers . I  would have just rolled on with the sandwich, but our server came back and said that she brought the wrong order to the table and that I had someone else's food. (Three other tables in the place and all eating breakfast)  She took my food away and said mine will be \"right up\".   Several mins later we received our onion rings. You can't mess up onion rings  can you? Why as a matter of fact you can.  Let's just say that they cooked my rings on the fly. And by fly, I mean they must have flown right past the fryer and on to the plate.  So undercooked ! Crazy.   ...sorry I am a little passionate about my fried food.   Finally my Philly steak arrives and it looks great.  Unfortunately It was also made in haste.When I picked it up,the grease had already eaten threw the bread. I actually love greasy food , but wow. I could have used the grease on my plate to finish cooking my onion rings.   No concern or compensation from our server/host/cashier/busser.   I know that this is a lengthy review  with some value added sarcasm , but I assure you it is accurate. My wife and I agreed that it was our last visit until we start hearing better things about Omega."}
{"text":"I see all the bad reviews, but I can't agree.  Went for b-fast on a Sunday and service was quick and the food was good and reasonably priced.   Decor is what it is...it is diner like and reminded me of home Philly-NJ."}
{"text":"Went Sunday at noon on Oct 4. No wait. Several tables available. Excellent creamy chicken & rice soup. Good and very large club sandwich. My husband had a huge Greek omelet with loads of hash browns. He loved his meal. He said his coffee was okay. I was almost scared off by the bad reviews. Glad we tried it anyway and had a nice reasonably priced meal."}
{"text":"Great place to take your family for breakfast. Wait staff is so nice and they know us."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here today for the first time.  While the service was pleasant enough, the excessive pricing for ordinary quality food was disappointing.  But the most disappointing was the \"Strawberry\" Pancakes.  There may have been 1 or, at most, 2 strawberries sliced and laid on top of the stack of 3 decent pancakes.  And they weren't even juicy or sweet strawberries -- sour, even tart.  Not even any whipped cream to attempt to mask the puny amount of strawberries on top.  To rescue my meal I decided to simply separate the unremarkable strawberries from the pancakes and enjoyed the pancakes sans strawberries, essentially paying $1.50 or so for a \"side\" consisting of just 1 (possibly 2) not-so-tasty strawberry."}
{"text":"First visit for breakfast. Now for a lunch visit. As others have wrote this place from the outside is a dump. Drove right past it and had to turn around. But the lot was filled. The inside wasn't much better. Lots of workers running out food and drinks and not slowing down. Now the food. Sweet tea is not overly sweet. I had the corn beef hash, eggs over med, and rye toast. One if the few times my eggs came out perfect. Usually they come out like hard-boiled. The Hash. Need to remember to ask for it extra crispy. Not much corn beef lots of hash browns with fresh onions and green peppers. The beginning still had crunch.   It may not be the prettiest place but the service and food was worth turning around. Lunch next time"}
{"text":"Place was packed for a Sunday lunch.   Food looked good and reasonably priced.   However service was very slow.   When the food did come, the pancakes were burnt and crunchy.   The cinnamon roll pancakes were just piled cinnamon on crunchy pancakes.    Not likely to return."}
{"text":"This is the ultimate place for breakfast! Incredible amounts of food for a great price. Service is hit-or-miss, but the food makes up for it. The parking lot is small and there isn't much room to stand if there's a wait."}
{"text":"We stop by on every visit to my Dad's house we make.  Good breakfast and super friendly staff. Affordable as well, which is offered all day.  In addition to a wide variety of breakfast offerings they also have hot dogs, pitas and sandwiches/ burgers. My hubs enjoys their loose meat sandwich."}
{"text":"I have eaten here several times and love their food and service.  Their wait staff has been very good and the food fresh.  I agree with others who commented about their breakfast and especially the hash browns being great."}
{"text":"If you are looking for real solid comfort food, this place is it. Seriously good and reasonable. Wait staff couldn't be better.  My go to place for a Saturday breakfast."}
{"text":"My husband & I love the Omega! Great fresh homemade cooking, breakfast was delicious & great portions. Our new favorite breakfast & lunch place!! The owners & staff are so friendly , Corky & Tammy came to our table to see how  everything was. A great little gem!!! Can't wait to go back ! Told all our friends, neighbors & family!!!"}
{"text":"First time this morning, and we were very pleased!  Saturday morning around 8 and we were seated right away.  Our waitress was very pleasant and helpful, especially when I had questions about egg white omelets (yes, they will make them), etc.  Service was fast, portions were large, and food and prices were good!  Overall, a really good breakfast experience.  We are sure to return!"}
{"text":"We live in the Oakhurst area of Charlotte, but there are no restaurants around us that are edible, so as time passes, we tend to branch out to other smaller towns to find decent restaurants to give our money to.    We found Omega Coney Island one day and decided to try it.  The best part of this establishment is the friendly people.  We enjoy the waitresses and the owners; the food is better than what is offered at local mom & pop type places in Charlotte, but it's not outstanding either.  I usually get my eggs scrambled because I've had to send my over medium eggs back on a few occasions as they were undercooked - clear and runny.  Their marinated chicken breasts with eggs are pretty good, but steer clear of the hash browns as they're horrible!  They taste so frozen that no amount of ketchup makes them edible.  Today we went and I tried a gyro and fries...  again- edible, but nothing to write home about.    I'd say that Omega Coney Island needs to stop trying to introduce us southerners to Detroit and try more to embrace how we southerners like our food as we're the ones paying the bills."}
{"text":"From the outside, Omega doesn't look like much - just a shack, really, along Old Monroe between Matthews and Indian Trail/Stallings. They also have a parking lot that fills up surprisingly quickly at certain times, so you'll want to get there early if you're hungry (if the parking lot is full, the inside probably is as well: The good news is that the tables turn over quickly).  While others have mentioned that the service isn't great, we have had exceptionally good luck in this regard, and found that everyone was very friendly and have no complaints whatsoever. It's not fine dining, but the servers are prompt and eager to please. As a bonus, you get plenty of food for a reasonable price - their omelette is gigantic, so much so that I took half of it home (not sure omelettes are great for eating the next day, but I did regardless).  Certainly not a fancy place, but worth a visit."}
{"text":"My son and I went to get a bite to eat after his Dr appt.  The waitress went to our table only to take our order, bring our food/drinks and when we flagged her down for our check and to complain about the hash browns that were so over cooked I thought I would break my teeth on them.  I was able to flag down another waitress to ask for more hash browns but she never returned with them.  After waiting 20 minutes and no hash browns were brought I had to flag down our waitress that walked by us many times to check on all her \"regular\" customers to get our check and have the hash browns taken off my bill.  If you aren't a \"regular\" there or personally know people that work there you will not get good service.  We've gone before and was only ok at best and will definitely not be back. Do not recommend."}
{"text":"We visited for the first time this morning for breakfast. Loved the country diner décor and experience and it I very clean.. The food portions were good but not overwhelming. Very tasty and not greasy. The staff is all very friendly. We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"This is a small no frills dive place, but the food is awesome,  waitstaff is super nice and the prices are great!  It's a local place where you can take your time and not feel rushed. Great burgers and fries,  specials like chicken and dumplings and fantastic breakfasts!"}
{"text":"We have been to this place a couple of times and have never been overly impressed. On 1 occasion we walked out because no one waited on us, but they did say good bye as we left! Our LAST visit was horrid. The waitress was nice enough but the food, ugh! My husband ordered Philly cheesesteak without peppers, fries and onion rings. I ordered a chicken gyro with fries. When our food was delivered his had peppers on it and mine was beef gyro. The waitress said she would be back with the fries and onion rings and was gone for about 5 mins before she returned saying she gave us the wrong food. Apparently there was a similar order as ours, however the other 4 tables that were there never got any food similar to ours. Hum. So, I decided to keep mine...his went back...still no fries or rings at this point. Another few minutes they arrive...soaked in grease. The fries we actually good but the rings were barely cooked. Once my husbands sandwich came back he could literally squeeze the grease out of it.   Customer service....no manager stopped by, no real apology...so we paid our bill and left. We will not be returning until there is a new name on that building. Very disappointing"}
{"text":"When my wife and I lived in Matthews we would always hit this place up for breakfast. No frills atmosphere with a friendly staff. Sometimes the staff can get too friendly and lose track of time with talking with customers. That's not a huge inconvenience in my opinion. Go for the omelette or the loaded hash."}
{"text":"Service and wait is quite slow, but the food is good, depending on what you get :) first time I visited I got the oatmeal, loved how they loaded it up with strawberries and bananas, was delish. Second time I ordered a Club pita, fries are nice and crispy, the pita was good but had quite a bit of extra grease. I think they will do even better if they work on their service and make the menu smaller."}
{"text":"Family restaurant in an old converted house and is no frills. It was the former Trails End and the new owners have not done much.   You can get away with a nice cheap breakfast here but plain coffee is &3 a cup-whew! My husband and I got omelets and our bill was $25! That is too much for a diner-type breakfast place.   The plates are generous; biscuit or toast, entree and hash-browns or grits  I took home 1/2 my omelet is was so large  food was good but next time I order the eggs, bacon, toast breakfast for $5.95."}
{"text":"Back when this place was Trails End, it was the JAM! Best club sandwich anywhere.  Then one day we showed up and a big stupid red Coney Island sign was over the door.   Absolutely HORRID food, terrible service, and filthy nasty. There were bugs everywhere. So sad."}
{"text":"Friday we had breakfast here, my friend recommended it and she will never live it down.  We were seated quickly and the waitress was great, friendly, quick and attentive . Fille our coffee often, brought our food out quickly etc.  The food which is why you go out to eat was another story: We ordered Farmers Omelet and Chicken with waffles. When they came out they looked fine.   The Omelette was filled with a selection of crunchy hard burnt veggies ,raw hash browns and some sort of burnt meat scraps...I ate around the filling so I only had some scrambled egg crepe basically . I had a biscuit instead of toast which is a mistake if you like biscuits , they are the pre made frozen ones they just defrost to serve.   The Chicken and waffle came out . My friend had asked that pecans be mixed into the waffle. what she got was a frozen pre made waffle with some chopped pecans thrown on top . The chicken strips served on top were again pre made frozen and just heated up there.  We left more on the plate then we ate, they never asked if we liked it or why we left it on our plate. Here is a note to restaurant owners. If I want to eat microwaved frozen food I can do it at home for far cheaper. The check for this menu was 23.00, for food I wouldn't feed my dog or bother to bring home the scraps for them.  Add to list  Edit"}
{"text":"Nothing special. The coneys were average. Service below average. If you are in the area and have to have a Detroit style Coney dog then by all means stop in. It's not horrible. Just not great."}
{"text":"Ordered a fish sandwich. They had no tarter sauce. Said they had to make more. Took 10+ minutes and had to ask twice  owner came to table not to apologize but to make an excuse. Said it was because they were selling so much fish which from an observation was not truth. No comp on meal  either"}
{"text":"I came here a few times in the past for lunch and always had a good experience. They have a very extensive menu with a huge variety of items. The staff is always friendly and the service is quick.   I would come back if I were in the area. And I would recommend to anyone, especially picky eaters, because there is something for everyone."}
{"text":"Went here about a year ago on a weekend day that was packed, we got on the list and waited for about an hour.  Got seated, ordered and waited another hour for the food.  After waiting so long, we were excited since we don't mind waiting if the food is worth it. The food finally came, and.....yuck! This place is gross! The breakfast food felt like it was just reheated from the freezer.  Talk about disappointment!  My out of town friends from NYC picked this place, hoping to get some Coney Island goodness.  The hot dogs were not even close, they would know.  The place has not looked busy every time we drive by, so I doubt it has gotten better.  Avoid the Omega Coney Island!"}
{"text":"Nothing fancy just great food and super service. Their omelettes are fantastic and they are flexible to do substitutions."}
{"text":"I fail to see the appeal of this place.  Food was average at best.  Service was extremely S-L-O-W.  They were not busy & there were 3 servers working.  When other people around me commented on service there was always an excuse--like \"stuck at the register\" or \"chopping lettuce for salads\"...REALLY?!"}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast when we first moved here because we instantly noticed the crowd and how often the parking lot is busy.  Even some locals were raving about it.  Oh my, it was the worst food I have ever had.  If all the rrestaurants in the world disappear I still wouldn't eat at this place.  If I could give it a 1/4 star or even no rating, I would.  I think all of their food is frozen, not a single thing is fresh which is funny because there are tons of fresh produce markets in the area.  I can't say one good thing about the food, or even the coffee! I wouldn't even feed this food to my dog. Let me at least say what we ordered: I had the country hash (I can't believe I paid $7 for that garbage), my husband had an omlette ($7 plus $2 for 2 extra toppings), and my daughter had pancakes. I just don't know how this place can mess up breakfast so badly."}
{"text":"I had breakfast here the other day.  Just eggs, hash browns & a biscuit.  The waitress was very nice, but the food is way too greasy."}
{"text":"I was too fond of this place. The outside and inside is run down... but oftentimes the best food comes from these places. Anyways, I got eggs, bacon and toast and it was ok. Nothing special. Nothing that makes me think \"WOW\"."}
{"text":"No- No-No We walked in, sat down, stood up, walked out.  I miss my High-Fiving, Mitten State of Michigan where Coney Islands are in abundance and delicious but this place will certainly not do. It's   The menu, decor and people in general who ate here were gross. We didn't even stay long enough to order the vibe and overall ambiance was just low class trash."}
{"text":"First time at this restaurant since it changed from Trails End. Went in for lunch as we were in the area. My husband had the south of the border omlette, I had the gyro supreme. My gyro was good, it very nearly didn't fit inside the pita. Husbands omlette was good as well. He also had the the new yorker dog ( he has a big appetite). All in all the food was good and our waitress was friendly. Will go back and try some other items from the menu."}
{"text":"A lot of people raved about the breakfast, so I finally went to try it. Service was ok... not great. The food... meh... not really good.  Kinda greasy , and the sausage just tasted... weird. And let's just say my meal did not stay with me long. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast joint. Friendly staff and fast food. Find it hard to believe the bad reviews!!"}
