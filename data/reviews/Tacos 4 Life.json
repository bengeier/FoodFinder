{"text":"i got the tofu taco with chips and a personal guacamole after specifically asking if these items were vegan friendly (our cashier had to go ask the manager). the taco was okay: under-seasoned but i liked the cabbage and fresh avocado. the chips were slightly stale and had a strange seasoning that didn't pair well with the guac, but the guac itself was delicious. a few hours after eating, i started to feel sick, almost like i had eaten dairy (i am lactose-intolerant). i searched online to confirm if the items i had eaten were really vegan-and they were-but the entire day after i ate here i felt the same nausea, hinting that there might be cross-contamination of some kind within the kitchen or food/equipment hasn't been properly sanitized. i wish i'd had a good experience here, but sadly, i didn't."}
{"text":"The wait for to-go was ridiculous. It should not have taken over 30 mins for me to get a chicken quesadilla. Will not be going back when I'm on a time crunch. Even as to-go. Not worth my time and money. I might as well have gone to the other food places in the area


Review update: 
Went on a Friday night to dine in and had a pleasurable experience. I purchased a cookie for what I expected to a long wait for food. The cookie was fabulous. And within 5 mins of ordering I received my chips and queso! And within 10 mins of that got my tacos. Excellent service on the dine in side!"}
{"text":"Very good food!! I got the southwest bowl with grilled chicken very delicious! The side of corn is also a must have! Can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"Went a few weeks back. We started with the dip trip (quest, guac, and salsa). The guac was good and we'll get that by itself. The queso - AWFUL!!!! Soooo runny, more like a cheese soup than queso. 
The tacos were really good. Both my husband and I had 2. I had the carnitas and the blakened mahi mahi. He had the koren bbq adn chicken bacon ranch. We both enjoyed what we had. I'll get teh lettuce wrap next time. Our son the kids meal beef tacos and enjoyed what he had. We'll be back to try more tacos."}
{"text":"Awesome taco shop!! I'm from LA/Texas, so I can be fairly picky when it comes to tacos, but this place is great. I had the Korean bbq and fried chicken tacos... excellent!! There was a long line when we came, but it didn't take too long. It's worth the wait! Really cool vibes also."}
{"text":"This is a \"Nuevo\" Mexican Grill.  Walk in, wait in line, order up and find a spot to dine. New addition to the neighborhood and it's getting some flair.  

Went with several family members while visiting from LA and thought it was different than an ordinary authentic Mexican Grill.  However, there motto is to donate dollars to charity for each purchase to help starving kids, and who doesn't want to get behind that!  I do hope that it'll stand the test of time while there are many other choices."}
{"text":"The crab & shrimp tacos was so good I really like this place and price is reasonable this is a place that I will frequently go too"}
{"text":"Such an amazing place with a great purpose behind it. Guacamole was AMAZING. Queso wasnt bad! Didn't mind the salsa either! Mexican creamed corn was a phenomenal choice of side. Family enjoyed their tacos while I enjoyed my rice bowl with chicken. Looked beautiful and tasted amazing. Definitely will be back again to not only eat but to also give meals to those in need. The restaurant was pretty full with a long line but the line went very, very quickly! Would definitely recommend"}
{"text":"This place has had signs up for a week or two but I stumbled in here on a whim today because I saw the parking lot finally had cars in it. Boy am I glad I did. I was walked in and was greeted by what I would later learn was Nick the GM. He asked if I had a ticket as today is apparently the private \"soft opening.\" I, looking clueless, said no, and just as I was about to thank him and leave, another customer in line said they had an extra ticket. Surprised, I thanked her (I believe her name was Nikki) and proceeded to the back of the massive line. 

Inching closer to the counter I spoke again with Nick and he explained that the mission of Tacos 4 Life is to feed starving children by donating $0.22 of every menu item purchased to sending meals to those who need it. Today being the special event all items were only $0.22. Essentially their \"soft open\" is 100% for donating towards feeding hungry children. It's a great cause the staff really seems to support wholeheartedly. 

The food. Just isn't a Yelp review without something delicious. I got the Paradise Punch to drink and it was really good. Non-alcoholic fruit punch they make fresh in house, kept in big fresh lemonade style containers at the register. The chips and salsa were a good start. Not my favorite tortillas when compared to similarly styled restaraunts but the salsa was on point. Flavorful and just enough spice. Chicken quesadilla was good as well. Flavorful, not lacking in the meat department, nice and cheesy.

The tacos are, as the name might suggest, are the star of the show. Maybe there are other restaraunts that serve this kind of taco but I've never been to one. They use special \"fluffy\" tortillas. Oh geez, I don't even know how to describe these things. It's like a flour tortilla and a roll of puff pastry had a baby and it came out radiating a glowing gold aura. The chicken taco was excellent. Well seasoned, tender not chewy, full of flavor. The beef taco, however, was OUTSTANDING. It has just claimed the prize of my number one taco of all time from Sabor Latin Grill. Perfectly seasoned beef combined with the magic fluffy tortillas and the cheddar Jack cheese into a pocket of happiness. They have cookies for a dessert treat as well, and while the chocolate chip is good, the snickerdoodle is where it's at. Gives the ones my wife makes a run for their money. 

It was a wonderful dining experience. Even with the long lines the employees were on point, no one waiting more than a couple of minutes for their food. I absolutely recommend this establishment. If your anywhere near Concord Mills Mall you must stop by and grab a taco!"}
{"text":"Tacos... tacos... tacos... How do you keep them from being the almost boring food, that never changes? Ask Tacos For Life! Adding the love for tacos, incorporating the convience of fast food, dashing it w/some wholesome ingredients, & splashing it w/a touch of \"This will make them come again\"! Yup!!!"}
{"text":"1st Timer and we were glad the lines moved quickly. Tried a variety of tacos, but the Mahi  Mahi was our favorite. Impressed with the bountiful kids meal and it includes a drink for $5.99. Kiddo has leftovers.  Everything tasted fresh and service was good. Special touch for the manager making his round and speaking with patrons. We shall return."}
{"text":"Yummy queso and chipotle steak tacos!  Great friendly service!  I love the Korea bbq taco too!"}
{"text":"It's ok... since everything is a la cart it gets pricey really quick.  $25 for 4 tacos and black beans served in a soggy fried shell...I'm not feeling it."}
{"text":"I've noticed this new spot, heard great things as well. The cause behind the company is the real blessing. Not only will my family be fed, another will receive a meal as well. 

Each taco had its own authentic flavor. This restaurant has become a favorite. For sure. 

We're on a mission to accomplish the whole menu!"}
{"text":"Super friendly staff and several options to choose from! Had the mango-jabenero taco and it was amazing! If you haven't been here it's definitely a must try! (Plus for every meal you purchase they donate a meal!...how cool is that!!!)"}
{"text":"Great concept of giving back when you buy a taco.

Went today at 12:30 and the place was PACKED! Huge line in the carryout and dine-in areas. 

Ordered the Hawaiian shrimp (grilled) and Korean BBQ Steak. The shrimp was tasty. Plenty of pineapple, didn't taste the coconut. Was refreshing and light. 

Korean BBQ Steak was one of the best tacos I've ever had. Reminded me of sushi with the Yum Yum sauce. A bit spicy, with tender pieces of steak and crunchy cabbage. I'll definitely go back for these. 

Two tacos was plenty for lunch without a side."}
{"text":"Interesting concept and pretty good food.  Everything was fresh and tasty.  We had a great time.  The mahi taco was excellent, the Hawaiian taco was good, and the steak taco was great.

The only complaint I have is the queso/cheese dip was super runny....it looked like water, it was soooo thin!

Overall I give it a 4 out of 5 and we will definitely return."}
{"text":"Super delicious! Love the concept and giving behind this restaurant! I recommend everyone come try it!!!! Unique tacos on their menu! Love the decors interior as well!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant going to be spending a lot of time here food is awesome! Can't wait to try everything on the menu!"}
{"text":"The experience started off ok with some great chips and we got the queso for the table. The queso was delicious. I never thought you could ruin tacos but that's exactly what happened here. I got two tacos. One chicken and one shrimp. The chicken mango habanero on the inside was great. The corn soft shells were so hard it hurt my teeth to eat them. The shrimp taco was ok on the inside, but definitely far from great. Again the shells were so hard it hurt my teeth to eat them. To finish off our meal the wait staff proceeds to set dirty dishes on our table as they clean our trays off and then dropped someone else's food on our table and laughed about it. I won't be back."}
{"text":"I had Tacos 4 LIfe cater a work lunch for 30 people.  They were fantastic!

Kim made everything very easy and convenient.  There's currently no online ordering which might be something in the future but she was easy to contact and communicate with.   They delivered everything, did the set up and were gone in 10 minutes and everything was hot, fresh, and full of flavor.     I will definitely use them again!"}
{"text":"I work across the street and was tired of the same food all the time and I was so happy this place opened! I tried it for the first time today, and it did not disappoint. I don't think I could ever get tired of their tacos. Some of the best tacos I've ever had and that's saying a lot because tacos are my favorite food so I eat them frequently. I will be a regular for sure, love this place!"}
{"text":"I love that they can make your tacos with lettuce cups for those of us looking for low carb options."}
{"text":"Cool concept, great food and service with a smile. What more can you ask for? I can't wait to return with my family!"}
{"text":"Gotta do the update: They've improved so much since their first week. While I still think a bit more time for soft-opening might have been in order, they've listened to the feedback and made the customer service experience much better! Since my initial write-up, I've been back 3-4 times; a couple dining in and a couple doing carryout.

While eating in, they are still super busy pretty much from open to close, however the lines are moving much smoother and the food is coming out faster. I haven't had any issues with order accuracy and everyone is as friendly as can be in there. The tacos are still some of the best damn tacos I've had in the Concord area (read my original review for more details on the food, it's still all 100% spot on!).

Carryout was my biggest gripe about the restaurant and they have it figured out now. I'm not sure if something was wrong with their phones before or if they were just ignoring it. The manager I asked about carryout said they were taking carryout orders over the phone since day one, but countless phone calls went unanswered. This has all changed now as I've ordered twice over the phone and get through the first time. Both times my food is ready at the expected time and the carryout corner in the store moves much smoother.

I love it when I get to update a review for all the right reasons, great job T4L!"}
{"text":"Really really really amazing tacos, I ordered the fish taco and Korean Steak and both were equally amazing! Best I've ever had! I found my new spot!"}
{"text":"I found this hidden gem and absolutely LOVE the Fried Chicken Taco ... the flavors are so cute and mainly tasty. My first bite made my taste buds jump for joy!!!!"}
{"text":"It was pretty good! Nice casual atmosphere, and lots of different tacos on the menu. The puffy fried taco shells are kinda greasy, but my food was still good. I had the crab cake taco, and the carnitas taco. We also got the trio of salsa, queso, and guac with our chips. Queso was kinda runny, but their guacamole is really good! Also their paradise punch is soo good! You can really taste the mango in it."}
{"text":"This is a neat hipster taco place but if you're looking for exceptional tacos I wouldn't advise coming here. The tortilla was extremely hard and dry and the meat/steak was difficult to chew. It is a nice environment and they do have neat combinations. The queso was very watery as well. Staff was pretty friendly and it was a good social setting."}
{"text":"I loved Tacos 4 Life! They food was tasty and I loved how they give money to people who can't afford food! I got the kids beef and cheese tacos and they were very good. I really liked how it came with queso while other restaurants would make you pay extra! I loved the environment and the decor. It was a little crowded but we expected that seeing it is new in the area. Overall a great experience!"}
{"text":"Tacos4Life is a taco chain with locations mainly in Arkansas. They have a simple premise: \"Tacos4Life will donate the funds necessary to Feed My Starving Children to purchase one meal for every meal sold in the restaurant.\" For every taco, quesadilla, salad or rice bowl sold, 0.22 is donated to the charity mentioned above.

I happened to take notice of this place when I was across the street at Viva Chicken on the day they were having their soft opening. I made a mental note to go back and within a week, I had a taco craving and made a beeline over there.

Tacos4Life is located in the newish strip mall on Derita road that has a QT gas station and right across from the Kohl's/Earthfare shopping center. I went on a Wednesday after work (4-11-18) and there was a bit of a line, but nothing too crazy. There was a greeter at the door passing out menus, however, I wish she would've asked people if they were choosing to dine in or carry out because this makes a HUGE difference in which line you get in. Also, there's a separate entrance for carry-out/to-go orders.

I placed my order for three tacos: blackened mahi mahi, mango habanero chicken, and the tofu. I originally asked for carnitas but they were sold out of those. I ordered all of the tacos on a puffy flour tortilla. Tacos are on served on your choice of soft flour tortilla, steamed corn tortilla, puffy flour tortilla, or lettuce wrap. The tacos range in price from $3 and change up to $5. They are decent sized and served a la carte.

Since I had placed my order on the wrong side, I waited for a bit until I was told that I should go next door to pick it up. I initially asked the cashier who took my order and she told me that I was fine to wait on the dine-in side - THIS WAS WRONG INFORMATION. Chalk it up to still being new and learning the correct process?

Once I got home, I tore into my food and will say that the mango habanero chicken taco was my favorite. If you like heat, you will like this one. It was the only one packed with flavor, in my opinion. The tofu taco was surprisingly filling and I would definitely recommend, no matter your dietary preferences. The mahi mahi was very much blah. I could barely taste the fish.

I really liked the puffy tortilla option as it was airy and not like typical stiff flour tortillas served at other places. Overall, I will be going back to give them another chance and try more things on the menu."}
{"text":"This place is is excellent. The concept is delicious fresh made tacos, once you buy a meal they provide a meal for people around the world whom are starving. On my first visit I had the chicken mango habanero taco and a grilled shrimp Hawaiian pineapple. They where so delicious I know I'll be back for more. The tacos are a bit pricey yet know that it's due to the cause. They are also pretty filling. I'm a big guy and two tacos was plenty for me."}
{"text":"Tacos were utterly disappointing! I ordered the shrimp & tofu tacos. The shrimp tacos came with a really sweet sauce on top & the pineapples were sweet as well so every bite just tasted like sugar to me. The tofu Taco had a really weird taste to it. The only item I enjoyed was the chips and guac, but cmon how can you even mess up chips and guac anyways? I really like their concept though, giving back through every meal! But for $5 tacos you would think they at least donate a dollar instead of 0.22 cents? I was so excited about this place, because who doesn't love tacos. But I prob won't be coming back anytime soon! Sorry:("}
{"text":"Tacos are life!!! This new spot just opened up this week in our area and we just had to check it out. You place your order just like a Panera Bread or Viva Chicken and they give you a number and bring the food to your table. This place was packed when we went but the servers were quick to get the food out.

I ordered the Pineapple Shrimp and Carnitas tacos (which was a hard decision to come to). Each taco fell on opposite ends of the spectrum of sweet and spicy but delicious nonetheless. I was very impressed with the cuisine and will have to go back to try each and every one of these creations until I've had them all!

Oh, and the restaurant provides a meal to a hungry child for each meal that you purchase. That is just an added bonus that you get to be a part of something special while treating yourself to some wonderful tacos."}
{"text":"Okay the food is really really flavorful! The price is a bit high for what you get, but knowing your meal helps feed hungry children softens the blow to the wallet. We went in May so they were still just recently opened and the wait for our food was quite long. Overall, it's a really cool restaurant with some eclectic decorations and a nice concept that gives back. I'm sure I'll be back because the flavors were so good"}
{"text":"Bad first Impression!!!
 I have been very excited to try this restaurant out since I saw the sign that they were coming into my neighborhood. I've done my research and saw that for every meal that someone purchase, the restaurant would provide a meal for a hungry child. I thought wow what a great way to give back. The menu looks great so I couldn't wait to try it out. So I told my friends about it and they obliged and were excited. Especially one who has been over seas for a while and has been craving tacos!! 
Upon our arrival the parking was terrible because of all the construction but that's not the restaurants fault so we didn't get upset about that. There are people standing outside and the line is extremely long all to be expected because it is a new restaurant. We are in line and a family is getting up from a table so my friends decided to take seat since they're available (and this is a casual dining spot not a wait to be seated). The busboy comes over and cleans the table. I'm still in line and tell my friends I will just order for them just send me a text of what they want which they do. A server comes around with a tray of juice shots and thanks us for patiently waiting which was cool and there punch wasn't bad.
So about a half hour goes by and I'm still in line waiting to order when I receive a text from my friend that he was being forced to leave the table cause he didn't have a number that he had placed and was waiting for an order. Really this was unprofessional an I felt unacceptable. The busboy didn't say that you had to have a number to be seated at a table and at this point we had been there just as long as the people who were sitting with numbers waiting! The lady behind me asked me did they make my friends get I replied yes she then looked and saw that the same thing was happening to her family who also was sitting at a table waiting for her to place an order. I felt she equally as bad for her because she had small children and it's a Friday night all places will have a wait. 
I understand they have a great mission on feeding the hungry but this local location has no interest in treating the customers like they are valued or appreciated.
My friends were upset and I felt bad for suggesting this place. I also understand it's their first week however they only had one person working the register and the other two I'm assuming must be broke since they weren't in use and it wasn't because they didn't have enough staff cause I counted at least 20. 
I really hope they get it together I really wanted to try them out. Thank goodness my old faithful Razoos Cajun Kitchen was across the street."}
{"text":"The Guacamole was great. It was chunky and fresh. It was the best thing I ate. The concept is dope and makes you feel like you're helping out. I respect that so I'll definitely continue to patronize T4L. The tacos and food was just average. I paid $10 for a salad and wasn't satisfied. A taco was $4 a piece. For those prices I'd like to be Wow'd by the food taste. In total it was an average meal with a heart warming message."}
{"text":"This review is based on our first visit, on a Wednesday 6-6:30pm.
The parking lot appeared almost full but there were plenty of seats available.  The cashier was great; friendly, helpful and informative. We chose the Mango Habanero Chicken, (grilled) Hawaiian Shrimp, Korean BBQ Steak and Spicy Chorizo tacos.  We loved them all; very fresh ingredients and well seasoned.  We also had the Ultimate Trio dip; good but the queso was very thin.
As a Snickerdoodle connoisseur , had to try one; on the small side (for the price), not much flavor, doesn't come close to my recipe. 
Staff is standing by to clean up/clear tables and management appeared to be hands on. 
We look forward to returning and trying other selections AND supporting a business that gives back.
Update: we returned 2 days later lol and tried other tacos; the Mahi Mahi was good/flavorful. The Crab Cake was mediocre; sautéed/pan fried too dark on the outside, laid on top of a bed of shredded head lettuce.  No sauce. Actually took it home @ added sauce there. The Chicken/Bacon/Ranch taco was great. Much prefer the puffy taco shells!  Also had the Mexican creamed corn side- loved it, flavorful but wish the serving size was larger for the price.
We look forward to returning; haven't tried everything yet!"}
{"text":"If a picture is worth 1,000 words .... IMAGINE FLAVOR! I Never get tired of tacos... And now I've found the perfect place. As I eat and enjoy a meal, someone less fortunate eats too!!! I'm almost honored to be here. Me and Chanda hangin out and I asked her \"What's the name of your taco\" to which replied \"GOOD\" so... I highly recommend the Maui Maui, fried shrimp, and canitas tacos.... And take every bite with a smile, someone else is eating because of you!!

I also love the staff, manager Matt, and the party room in the back can accommodate at least 50 people"}
{"text":"Finally a place that serves tasty tacos . I tried only couple but the steak is amazing & vey flavorful. Plz try that you will not regret"}
{"text":"Some coworkers and I went out for lunch on 5/23 at Noon. This was my first time at Tacos 4 Life. Service was pleasant and timely. I like how every meal that is bought helps give a meal to a child in need of a meal. 
I got a Mango Habanero Taco, Chorizo Taco and a Korean BBQ Steak Taco. All were good with a good amount of meat in them, however my favorite one was the Korean BBQ Steak!!! Lots of flavor! 
Tacos are reasonably priced for what you get.
If highly recommend going here, wish there was one in Wisconsin so I could eat at it when I get back home!"}
{"text":"Not your ordinary taco, the grilled chicken taco and Korean barbecue taco were delicious, great friendly staff, great new place to eat."}
{"text":"After 3 unsuccessful tries, I finally had time to wait to try this new place that everyone was going crazy about it. It took 25 minutes between arrival time and receiving the tacos. This was around 11:45am, before the actual rush hour. The line was crazy like always but at this time the parking lot had spots and wasn't full of heavy machinery. There are a lot of customers with lots of time to kill, hence, they take their time to order and leave the tables. They finally started with the take out orders, so you might want to do that in a rush.

Unfortunately, I am not sure what people are raving and piling up about this place. Maybe because it is new...

My thoughts about this place:

1. The tacos are overpriced (close to US$ 5 for a taco is expensive). If you think about the concept buy one give one, someone will have to pay for it, hence the tacos are more expensive so they can cover the donated food. Makes total sense.

2. They are not real Mexican tacos, they are fancy creative tacos (not even tex-mex). Not even cilantro is put in. It says marinated in cilantro, but the taste is not there.

3. The tacos are 90% lettuce/veggies and 10% protein. Again, for a $5 taco, I would expect more balance here. Check my photo to see that and compare to the website photo.

4. Chipotle Steak: The puffy flour tortilla is greasy and doesn't taste well. If your taco comes with that type of tortilla ask to change it. There were maybe 4 pieces of small steak there too. My photo shows that is greasy (the middle taco).

5. Fried chicken taco: super spicy, you taste more the honey than anything else.

6. Hawaiian Shrimp: Okay taco, actually the best one of the ones I ordered. The extra star is for that, otherwise I would have given two stars.

7. Staff is super nice and friendly, deserve an extra star for that for sure.

8. Pepsi products... deserve one less star (sorry but I can't tolerate Pepsi) !

Overall, I think the place is way too busy because it is new. I don't expect to be a hit or super busy in the near future."}
{"text":"Found this kinda of by chance. My husband had the Korean bbq and grilled chicken loved both but surprised by heat in bbq. My son had the quesadilla he loved it , but the big hit were the Hawaiian shrimp fried and fried chicken. We all tasted a little of all. The coconut sauce on shrimp was awesome"}
{"text":"I tried Tacos 4 Life for the first time. I went to the Carry-out section. The staff was super friendly. I ordered the carnitas taco and the grilled chicken mango habanero taco. The carnitas was okay, needed a sauce. But the mango habanero was absolutely delicious! I assumed bc it was a taco place, they'd have $2 tacos, but they didn't. However, the tacos are reasonably priced. The two I ordered came to a total of $7.80. And I did get full off two tacos. They allow you to choose from a variety of shells including a lettuce option . I will go back again!"}
{"text":"We wanted to try Tacos 4 Life out because it's new but also because every time we take our family out to a restaurant an argument ensues between the children because they cannot agree on a place that will make them both happy. What makes everyone happy? Tacos! There are so many options here that even the pickiest eater can find something to enjoy. Even my super sweet but picky nephew was so pleased with his meal and the staff was so kind to him when he made a very particular order. 
My husband wanted to try the chorizo tacos but was unsure of the creamed corn on top so he went with the chicken tacos with a puffy shell and he loved them. The manager, Nick, came to ask us how the meal was and my husband mentioned maybe wanting the chorizo tacos next time but being unsure about the creamed corn and Nick let him try it. That is some serious customer service! I had the southwest rice bowl. It was delicious and the portion was so large I took half of it home to have for lunch tomorrow. 
The queso is a little runny compared to what I'm used to but the flavor is spot on and I truly have no complaints about it. 

Nick gave us such great service! And even when we went to the restroom and my daughter mentioned something about her nachos an employee who was also waiting to use the restroom stopped us to make sure everything was OK. It was! And we will be back after such great service and food."}
{"text":"This place has great tacos. Especially for a first time being here. It's a little pricey (3-5 per taco) I had three tacos the grilled chicken, the mango Haberno, and the carnitas. The best one was the grilled chicken. They are very generous with the lettuce and condiments on the taco which I didn't like but they where generous with the meat. Also I asked for a box and thought the lady forgot about me but she came back in and said she was getting off work and remembered she hadn't gave us our boxes yet and I thought that was outstanding services. The tables where a little dirty but ambiance is very chill. We had rice and beans with ours but to be honest two tacos and maybe some chips and salsa are about you need."}
{"text":"This place isn't that good...
$5 tacos  no sides or chips included
Mediocre food.... been twice and my food was never hot. I think they need to have some taco Tuesday specials  if they're gonna make it. Good concept poor food."}
{"text":"Well...tacos were average at best and the prices were crazy high!!!  Took my family of 4.  We ordered 6 tacos between us...NO CHIPS...just the tacos.  $26.00!!!  and the drinks were free this night!!!  This tiny bit of food would have been well over $30 on a normal night!!!  No...just no..."}
{"text":"Tried this place out. I got a grilled chicken taco, but I am glad I asked what a \"puffy\" shell was...lightly fried...so yeah let's pass on that for me and sub in a steamed corn shell. My Hubby got the fried chicken taco on a soft shell. For mine I must say it was loaded with lettuce! So I had to take most of that off to get down to the meat. Skimpy on the other toppings which was sad. Over all the it was an ok taco, nothing that jumped up and said wow. The Hubs taco was also not as piled with lettuce and had a good amount of sauce on it. He said it was good and had a \"kick\" in flavor. I got a side of guacamole...it was a spoon full in a small cup...it was ok, did not taste fresh just like a pre-packed kind. What made me give a 4 was the great staff. She really explained the menu to us 1st timers. Overall it was a good experience."}
{"text":"I tried the Korean taco and the chicken taco. The Korean was very hard to get down, if you have been to Pinky's West Side Grill, let it be known, although the tacos are named the same they most definitely don't taste the same at all. 
The chicken taco was your basic fried piece of chicken inside of a tortilla. Nothing crazy to make me say I need to come back to this place. It took a while to get our food and there was hardly any seating. 
We also got the trio appetizer, queso, salsa, guacamole. That was good however the queso was like dipping your chips in water. It definitely needed to be much thicker."}
{"text":"** we visited the day after they opened for business and realize they need some time to get it right! **

We got few different tacos to try.   My order (3 tacos + tea) was just over $15.   Thats alot for this area.  I had to look around and make sure I was still in NC and not NYC! 

Their Korean BBQ taco was BANGIN!   We enjoyed the honey fried chicken (strip) taco and the chicken bacon ranch taco too.  Didnt care much for their Eggplant or Crabcake tacos at all.  They were barely lukewarm and served in cold tortillas.  

The queso was mediocre.  Chips were not so great.  I hope they decide to make their chips in-house or get a new vendor altogether!

I dont do Pepsi products, so I opted for the sweet tea and will say that its probably the best tea Ive tasted in a long time!  Not sure if it was the water or just brand new (clean) machines, but it was refreshingly, not too sweet and there was NO slimy, syrupy or gritty aftertaste.   We usually dont go back for refills, but we both did here!  

I saw a private dining area.  Not sure if its for employees only - or if it can be rented out.  

There was an issue with one of my daughter's tacos  that the manager very quickly and amicably resolved.  

Overall, we had a good experience.  I like their business model and its good to know we are paying it forward when we eat here!  

However, we can get better tasting tacos from the little Mexican Taquiera connected to the Citgo gas station on the corner of Weddington/Pitt School Roads.  Their tacos are made-to-order and served piping hot off the grill.  You can get 4 authentic tacos there for $5.  And they always have at least one person at the counter who speaks English.  

So, needless to say, unless we are geeking for Korean BBQ tacos, this place wont be a regular spot for either of us."}
{"text":"We were so excited when we came here. Our first thought upon looking at the menu was \"omg $5 for a taco?!\" But after seeing that for each meal you buy a meal is donated, we cared less about the price. As we waited for our food we decided to take a look at their website and found out they only donate $0.22 from each meal... sooo wait a min, you are charging me $5 and only donate like 4% of my meal. At this point we are thinking, these better be some amazing tacos... finally the food came and it was meh. Honestly you can get better and cheaper tacos at so many other places. Sorry but it wasn't worth it."}
{"text":"I have truly had my TACO for LIFE....  I will not go back ever again.

The place seems clean.  It was noisy due to large crowd on Wednesday about 7:45pm.

I ordered a standard beef  taco...expecting a fresh tasting taco that was at least warm.  I went to get my drinks of water and Coke.  To my dismay they have only Pespi products.  I tried sweet ice tea and it was ok.

Food was served, but it was not hot, the shell was not crispy at all as I expected (no I did not order a soft shell)..and I took a bite.  It tasted awful.  So I thought I would try some taco sauce.  Then I discovered there is no taco sauce on tables.  Waitress brought some no brand name sauce in packets that were very hard to open.

I tried a second bite....it was awful...so I slid the dish away and sipped my tea.

A waitress came and dispose of the taco that looked virtually untouched and did not bother to asked if I enjoyed it.  The Manager walked by several times but did not acknowledge me.

So for those that enjoy the place....great...enjoy.  

For me, I shall never return.  I have had my TACO for (my) life - at least from there.  There are tons of Mexican restaurants in Charlotte with far better tacos."}
{"text":"I have been begging my husband for weeks to take me to T4L. I was HIGHLY disappointed. The steak was So Overcooked you couldn't even chew it. The tacos are subpar especially for the price. I wish i could have just donated $50.00 to the cause instead of paying for those tacos. We both tried 3 different tacos and all of them were bad for one reason or another. I have never gone to a restaurant and left food behind. I chose to leave my food and go to Viva chicken instead."}
{"text":"This place is fine.  Not bad, not good, just fine.  The price is what gets me, you get 3.5 star food for a price that is 2.5 stars, meaning it is overpriced by a reasonable margin.

Nothing on the menu was a must try for me.  I still think you will enjoy thisnplqce, but I doubt you wilp ever recommend it.  It doesnt rise to that level.

The last reason I give them 3 stars and not less is how nice and new the location is."}
{"text":"I've been excited to try Tacos 4 Life so I drove up today to see what all of the fuss is about. The parking lot was empty. 

Closed on Sundays. 

End of story."}
{"text":"I can get behind a place called Tacos 4 Life (the text-like spelling I could do without, but I can probably live with it). Tacos are awesome. And it seems like we've been in the Concord Mills area a lot recently, so when we spotted the building across the street while dining elsewhere, we added them to the list for a future trip.

The menu isn't that different than other taco places that have been sprouting up, and that simply means one thing: Tacos. They do have other options, such as quesadillas and nachos. But tacos are certainly the star here. The nice thing is that you can get your selection of shells, whether it is a traditional style steamed corn, soft flour, puffy flour or even a lettuce wrap for those of you into that sort of thing.

Once you get through the challenge of selecting your taco shell, you have to figure out what you want on the inside: A variety of chickens, beef or steaks, pork, mahi, shrimp, crab or even veggie. It's an impressive (almost intimidating even) list. They give you a number to take to your table and the tacos - or whatever you order - are delivered quickly.

The good news is that unlike some other places, the tacos are good sized, and filled well. Overfilled even. You'll likely get some on the tray, so you want to grab plenty of napkins.

If you're into that sort of thing, they also give a meal to \"a hungry child\" for every meal you by. Not sure what this means exactly. Does \"a meal\" equal \"a taco\"? Is it \"a combo\"? Is it \"each person\" who places an order, so if you go with a family, that is a single meal, but if you order individually, that would feed several hungry kids? These details aren't really set out anywhere I could find, so if that's important, you might want to dig into it - or just donate to a food bank rather than buying a taco and hoping that another gets sent to someone in need."}
{"text":"I applaud the fact that this restaurant gives back to feed the hungry.
Clean and neat atmosphere. The tacos were Okay. I got a strong aroma of MSG on the lettuce which was a big turn off. A bigger turn off
was when I saw a manager asking a party to leave a table while 
they were waiting for someone in line to order. (It was an older couple
who probably were unable to stand and wait). I see where this was noted by other reviews. I looked around and did not see anyone that had gotten their order waiting for a table. I believe this was just a poor public relation decision by the management. Had I been asked to leave a table it would have been out the front door.   Probably my first and last visit."}
{"text":"The tacos were SO good!! I had the Korean BBQ taco and the mango habanero taco, both extremely flavorful and fresh-they make everything in house. Love the decor too. For only being open a few days, I was impressed! I'm sure things like long wait times will get ironed out."}
{"text":"Saturday, May 11 2018- You begin with walk up service. I will say that while I loved the food and every other employee I came in contact with, the woman who took my order was rather rude. She was hurried and seemed to have no time for my questions. As this was my first time at Tacos4Life, I had some questions. I get it. You are busy but good customer service means not letting me, the customer, know you are busy. Anyway, she took my order, gave me a number and a cup. As usual down here, the tea was too sweet so I did my half and half. I'm used to it so no big deal. I sat down and out came my chips and guac. The guacamole had chunks of avocado and tasted so fresh and yummy. I loved it. BTW, everything is a la carte. I did get that from motor girl upfront. I was asked by different employees if I had everything I needed before my taco came out. My taco came out and I found out what a puffy taco shell is. It's a slightly fried flour tortilla. OMG...SO GOOD. I got the grilled chicken taco in the puffy shell. I asked the young woman who delivered the taco to me if they had nutrition info. I have cancer and I try to keep track of everything I eat in an app. She didn't know so she got her manager. He said because they are small they did not have nutrition info but he kindly took the time to explain other options such as lettuce as a sub for the taco shell etc. He even stayed and we talked for a minute. I was out running errands and stopped in by myself. It was nice of the employees to stop by. Anyway, back to the chicken. It was juicy and tender and the lemon and cilantro made a little sauce. It was topped with a touch of sour cream, pico and lettuce. I added Calula sauce for a little heat . It was oh so good. I took the rest of my chips and guacamole home. It was the perfect mid day snack. I will be back."}
{"text":"I love the business model of feeding children around the world. Good tacos! I enjoyed the Chipotle taco."}
{"text":"Real interesting twist on taco flavors.  We really loved the Korean bbq tacos.  The fried chicken tacos were also delicious.  The vegetarian one (eggplant, cherry tomatoes, pesto sauce) was bright and full of flavor.  
The crab one was OK, and the carnitas one was OK. They both needed more seasoning/flavor. 
The Mexican style creamed corn, while very delicious, was a disappointing size for $2.25. 
The tacos aren't cheap.  You are paying for more quality ingredients than what you would find at a Chipolte, Qdoba, etc. You should fully expect to spend $30 for 2 people. 
Also, if you are doing the Keto lifestyle, they do offer lettuce wraps in place of taco shells/wraps. 
I also would recommend 3 tacos each.  They are all filling, but you will want more than 1 or 2. 
All in all, we will be back. The food was yummy, the staff was friendly, and knew their menu well. Great addition to the Concord area."}
{"text":"The Tacos were DELISH!  The SHELL is really what makes a taco, and theirs was on point!  I got the flash fried flour tortilla for all three of my tacos and it was a great decision.  The chicken mango habanero, Hawaiian shrimp, and chipotle steak are my favorite.  I also tried my husband's ground beef and it was great too.  The chips are a little hard, we usually like crispy thin chips, but the salsa was good.  Their mission is wonderful, I admire any business who looks to help, volunteer, and inspire the community.  Overall, definitely a taco spot we will be back to and support!  (Follow me @foodievida)"}
{"text":"Great Tacos.  Good mix and match selection.  Ca
Casual and Friendly Decor.  This is a fast casual place.  Been there twice since in opened about three weeks ago."}
{"text":"Liked it very much.  I ordered the ultimate nachos and my wife got beef tacos.  Both were very good.  It was Friday at lunchtime and the restaurant was very busy.  Even being a new Restaurant in the middle of a lunchtime rush, the staff and management did a great job moving people through and keeping clean tables available for patrons.  The place has a cool vibe with a focus on charitable work, but not overbearing.  I enjoyed the meal and the restaurant.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Overpriced, even considering the $1 donation. The chorizo was not good. The chicken was OK, and the Korean steak was actually pretty tasty. I'm hoping my next experience will be better. Very very disappointing on the first try. It does seem that management cares about the concerns so I have updated my review to add an additional star. Hopefully my next visit is better."}
{"text":"We came here the first week they opened. Obviously any new place has kinks to work out, so there was a long wait. However the food was excellent!! We loved the tacos we got and the atmosphere and decorations of the restaurant. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We were there the second day it opened. I had a Mahi taco and found a foreign object in the taco. I showed it to a manager and he didn't know what it was. He offered a card for a queso dip, but told him I don't eat cheese so that wasn't helpful. Food a little underwhelming. I had high hopes, but disappointed."}
{"text":"One of the best taco places I've been to. It's a little pricier than other places but it's for a great cause because they donate their proceeds to help feed children in South America. I absolutely love their fried shrimp taco, grilled and fried chicken tacos, and crab taco. Some of the tacos come with a fried tortilla which to me is the best part. I've never tried their other dishes because I always get the tacos but I'm sure it's just as amazing and delicious as their tacos. My goal is to try one of each. They all have the best sauces and combinations. Can't stress how yummy this place is."}
{"text":"Super super super good! The interior is very nice, cute little place. I love that they donate a meal for every meal bought! We got a classic beef taco, fried chicken taco, and chicken bacon ranch taco. They were all amazing. They have these fluffy taco shells that are phenomenal. We also got their trio appetizer with guac, queso, and salsa. The guacamole was very very good, best I've had anywhere around. The queso was good, not amazing. The salsa was more on the spicy side. However, my mom had to make a few adjustments to her meal and it came out wrong, and the waiter just seemed very irritated when my mom pointed it out. When it came back out again it was still wrong, but at that point my mom didn't want to say anything else. The managers were walking around and were very quick on responses. Overall very good, great prices. Will totally come back!"}
{"text":"I saw that Tacos 4 Life had opened recently so I waited to try it until a week day because the crowds were large on the weekend. I was happy to see 3 seafood tacos & 2 veggie tacos options. I had the Crab Cake taco & the Crispy Eggplant taco. Both were very flavorful & fresh. The Crab Cake taco was in a puffy fried flour taco which actually worked. My only issue was that the crab cake was a little mushy for me, I wish it had been cooked firmer (maybe more crab) but otherwise I was very pleased. The Crispy Eggplant taco was a big surprise because of the flavor combinations. They had cut the eggplant into bite size chunks before frying them which made they taco easier to eat. The taco also had sautéed cherry tomatoes & cilantro pesto sauce. They were very generous with the sauce which really made every bite of the taco delicious.  I will definitely come again to try other tacos & one of their salads or rice bowls! Tacos 4 Life is a great addition to the area!!!!"}
{"text":"Wow.... new place in town we tried tonight. Delicious!  The seasonings on the tacos were fabulous.  I had the chipotle steak taco and the flavor was outstanding!  My husband had the chicken bacon ranch taco and he said it was one of the best tacos he's had. We split a chicken Quesadilla. 1 taco and 1/2 the quesadilla was plenty.  Their tacos are fairly filling.  The rice with cilantro pesto rice with the chicken quesadilla was ok.  
Really cool concept of feeding the hungry whenever you buy food there.  Very cool.  We had the special drink, Paradise Punch, and it was good.  Very sweet, but offset the tacos really well.  
Very busy even at 8 p.m. They have outdoor and indoor seating and many of their tables are multi-seating long picnic tables which is cool. 
I will definitely return here again and try other tacos!"}
{"text":"Came in for some basic tacos they only had one register open and six people on the floor cleaning up tables with a line out the door after being there for half and hour I told my friend to just grab a chair and I'll get the food and a lady with a whole baby attached to her who I assume was the manager came up to me and told me that I couldn't sit when one of the waiter sorry I mean cleaning staff said we could save the seat"}
