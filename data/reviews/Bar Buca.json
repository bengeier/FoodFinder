{"text":"Went on a weeknight and didn't have to wait for 2 seats. 

Squid ink/portobello 
Interesting flavours and filling despite the size if the dish. 

Offal sausage
Tastes similar to Chinese sausage. This almost seemed like a breakfast dish because it had an egg on top. 

Cannoli and waffle 
So good. The citrus flavour of the cannoli was light and refreshing. The waffle wasn't too sweet so I definitely could've had more than 1."}
{"text":"Nice coffee menu, all the ones I tried were delicious. Had the schiacciata(pork sandwich in focaccia bread). Very tasty but a lot of oil coming out of the focaccia."}
{"text":"Good place to grab a glass of wine and some bites to eat. Limited seating and small size dishes, but extensive wine selection. An intimate space for an after work cocktail."}
{"text":"Came here with my family for Winterlious. I was attracted by their menu. They didn't take reservations, so by the time we got there, the wait for a table was 45 mins to 1 hr. It sounded long, but it's actually not so bad. We're glad that we waited. The atmosphere was exceptional. You can get a drink while waiting. The host was very nice to give us a update from time to time. 

They have the most interesting menu throughout  Winterlious, I think. There were 4 of us, so we got to try most of the items on the menu. The Testa (Pig's Head) was very tasty and crispy. Best to go with a beer. The Sea Salt Baked Beet was very refreshing. The other 2 appetizers were good too. I just found the Fermented Smelts a little too salty. 

Amongst the main course, I found the Tuscan Offal Sausage to be the most interesting. Absolutely delicious! The Porchetta and Salsicce are great too!

Their desserts were the best to enjoy with a cup of their superb coffee. 

Overall, it's a very very pleasant dining experience!"}
{"text":"We came in and had a drink and in about 10 minutes we were able to get a seat on a busy Friday night. The wine list is quite nice and lots of interesting options. We ordered a bunch of different plates, all were delicious except for the skewers. I mean, they were alright, but not memorable. Overall a good experience. Service is great, staff is very welcoming."}
{"text":"Bar Buca is a secret gourmet treat that can't be seen from the street corner, but don't let that stop you from looking for it. I've been there at least ten times since it opened and even I can't tell if it's open until I'm five feet from the door. But don't worry -- it's always open. From 7AM M-F, and from 8AM on the weekend.

The proprietors' vision is an Italian-style bar -- the kind of place you can get a coffee and pastry in the morning, a sandwich in the afternoon, and a glass of wine and a few bites in the evening. They accomplished this with a very warm, welcoming atmosphere, great service and terrific food. 

Coffee -- expertly pulled espresso and some great options like buffalo milk. Pastries are great, including the cannoli which is the best I've had outside Sicily. The food. YES. Small portions of unbelievable quality, really rich food, a lot of it including offal and blood. Not a great place for vegetarians--it seems like nearly everything has meat in it. Also probably not a good option for a big eater who doesn't want to spend a lot. The prices are appropriate for the quality and richness of the food.

Having said that, the porchetta panini is a terrific deal all around. Just half of it fills me to bursting.

The wine selection is good, mainly Italian, though a little light on white wine selections. There's an Enomatic machine so you can get some very expensive offerings by the glass (or half glass). Also an enticing cocktail menu but I haven't personally tried any.

Tip: Brunch starts at 10AM all week long, but you can get breakfast as early as 7 as long as you feel like eating poached eggs on focaccia."}
{"text":"Bar Buca has a nice selection of appetizers and tapas. Almost everything we ordered was pretty good and yummi (except for the Brussels Sprouts ). If you want to try all appetizers, get the sampler, it comes in a nice plate tower and it's pretty good!! The waiters are pretty knowledgeable with the menu and are very friendly.

We sat on the patio. It's not a busy street, but it's still in a hip area of town. Inside looked pretty good as well and view on the kitchen.

Would definitely come back for an occasion."}
{"text":"Went for brunch one day. It's a very cute place (both inside and their patio). I sat inside as the patio was full. Inside is a very nice atmosphere and you can see an open kitchen area. There is also a bar area which has a selection of pastries. The menu is different from other brunch places: a nice selection of cocktails, coffee drinks and food. I chose pancakes as my main and a latte. The staff was very attentive and even though it took them a while to bring me my coffee, they apologized for it. The pancakes themselves are very delicious, a bit on the sweet side, but still I really enjoyed the dish: from presentation to taste. It has layers of crushed pistachios, chocolate, marmalade, cannoli type cream and finished with candied orange slices. I would definitely come back to try other dishes."}
{"text":"Great restaurant. Like nothing in Toronto. It is casual yet classy. The food is traditional Italian meets a gifted Canadian chef. The Buca boys keep knocking it out of the park. One thing worth noting, be prepared to sit at the same table as strangers."}
{"text":"Overrated sandwich shop with fattttttttty food! I heard they recycle the oil for a long time! Definitely won't go back."}
{"text":"The food was fantastic here. Everything was a hit, and we sampled 2/3 of the menu! Has a very pretentious feel to it, which I hate! The waiter seemed liked he enjoyed saying every item on the menu in a super exaggerated Italian accent. He was knowledgable about the food though.

Expect small portions (it's tapas style). We spent about $50 each between drinks and a whole bunch of tapas. A good place to stop by for an hour or so, before heading out for the night."}
{"text":"Much like many other over-hyped TO restaurants, Bar Buca is a complete waste of time and money.  I went to Buca on a Friday night with some girlfriends for a light dinner and drinks. Waited 40 min for a table because no reservations are allowed.  On the bright side the host was very charming and some drinks at the bar helped this time pass quickly. 

We ordered the Assaggini and the Gran Fritto Misto - comes with 10 small dishes in total.  While the presentation was very pretty the food was a complete disappointment.  The amount of SALT added to our food was INSANE! And this is coming from 4 girls who smoke and tend to add extra salt to all of our food.  Was this a ploy to get us to order more drinks? Probably. And it worked. 

Out of the 10 dishes we ordered, 6 were unpleasantly OVER SALTED, 2 were INEDIBLE because of the ridiculous amount salt and 2 were OK at best. 

Disgusted. Will never go back."}
{"text":"I've been a long time fan of Buca so I wanted to try Executive Chef Rob Gentile's new Bar Buca and I'm glad I did! The food was delicious! My boyfriend and I shared two dishes. The first was the Italian pancakes (crespelle) are layered with cannoli filing and drizzled with maple syrup. The pancakes were crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. Cannoli filling and maple syrup had an orange zip to it so gave a nice finish to the dish. The second was a scrambled egg dish. turkey, goose and duck eggs are scrambled with burrata and topped with shaved truffles! Overall, this dish was amazing!

Amazing is what I wish I could say the same about the service. We couldn't order until the waiter looked into a dietary concern. The waiter took a long time to find out about our dietary and was taken aback when I followed up with him. I had ordered a latte when the pancakes arrived and it didn't show up til we were done both dishes. The manager was apologetic and offered me the latte on the house which was thoughtful and I appreciated the gesture. However the delays continued, once done my latte we waited for our waiter to come by so we could ask him for the bill but he was talking to someone by the to-go counter for a while. I tried to stare him down but that didn't work so I had to flag another waiter to get him. When he brought us the bill, he realized that he forgot to take off the latte and had to go fix it. 

I enjoyed the food a lot but the service won't make me go back anytime soon. I'll wait a bit in hopes the service gets a bit better like his older brother Buca."}
{"text":"I love this place! The porchetta sandwich is delicious and they have a great wine selection. The burrata melts in your mouth and is well priced for the portion you get. The service has always been impeccable - very attentive. I've been several times and haven't been disappointed. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"The food and service was phenomenal. 10/10 would recommend the porchetta & costolette di manzo skewers. The zucca is also quite nice. Didn't love the squash filling in the cannelloni but nonetheless, it was far from inedible! More of \"after work\" crowd but it's not an issue- good vibes all around."}
{"text":"Very unhealthy menu - all carb and fat! The grease from their signature porchetta sandwich can make a brown bag see through and gives you the worst heart burn ever. And the garlic knot was so hard to chew that almost cracked my dental filling. 

 If consider going, Please bring someone you hate."}
{"text":"This tidy space at the foot of a condo complex just south of King is Buca's newest foray. Three years in the making. Open from 7-close, 7 days a week, you can get your breakfast coffees and pastries, lunch, cocktails, and dinner. Seating just shy of 40, the stools lining the white marble bar is where the action takes place. High ceilings, lots of light, and white tile complete the look, much in contrast with the Buca's original location. The leather aprons remain, however.

I'd dropped by to get some pastries and coffee. My cappuccino was lovely with a semolina biscotti - a non-traditional (no me) thin round of a cookie. I also snagged a pear croissant, chestnut pizelle (nice), and an excellent (great textures, not too sweet) hazelnut sfogliatelle (really quite good. On a later visit, I picked up their cannoli - lovely citrus hints and a smooth ricotta filling within a delicate shell. Worth a go.

Of course, I couldn't resist looking at the menu. And there was so much to tempt and whet my palette: mixed cicchetti and fritti plates, hot snacks (spuntini), and exciting skewers. I really did want to try it all. I settled for a quick bite of vongole alla carbonara - clams with guanciale, egg yolk, and dash of heat. Good textures and flavour in that snack. Clams were perfectly done. Lovely little snack before dashing off and dreaming of the next time.

Next time, came a few hours later when I returned for their aperitivo (starting from 4pm). Grabbed a cocktail and sat down with to nibble on some accompaniments (as part of your drink order), and enjoyed the bar seats in front of the kitchen again.

Excited to try out their brunch!"}
{"text":"I was at the bar Buca Last week , the restaurant is very nice, very reminiscent of the Italian bar , the atmosphere is very nice and the food is sought . I took a glass of prosecco and my husband an Aperol spritz .
The food was not very good. The account is very expensive , we paid $ 150 in two . But the service was great and I enjoyed it very much ."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Mozzarella was out of this world, creamy and light. The service was poor enough that we probably won't be back (surly and unwelcoming servers). I don't really like to be \"chatted up\" by the server/bartender. I don't need much attention at all, in fact. So if the employees read as contemptuous, then I'm turned way off. Servers needn't suck up, but they ought to be polite (at least when serving people who are entirely courteous)."}
{"text":"PARTIAL REVIEW
Assaggini: Tasting of all Five Cicchetti ($17)

A must order medley for any group of noshers- with each item proposing an entirely different flavour, texture and purpose.

Nodini (Bread Knots, Rosemary, Garlic)

I loved the buttery garlic and beautiful rosemary aroma, but all of the cicchetti, these were the easiest to leave. Great flavour, but a little tough in texture.

Ciccioli (Pork Cheek, Chili, Lemon)

Man, were these babies ever addictive. They were crispy, a little chewy, and although they were unmistakably little salt bombs (they're pretty much like little bits of pork crackling cakes), the citrus and chili helped balance it out. 

Tigelle (Bolognese Skillet Bun, Cunza, Rosemary)

Super simple, but deeply satisfying, this little English Muffin type Tigelle was smeared with some sort of rosemary scented pesto and stuffed with what I think was silky lardo. The result was a deliciously crispy exterior and a moist, meltingly tender center that was just far too easy to eat.  BB, you should consider opening a food truck for cicchetti like this.

Bruschetta (Duck Yolk, Beech Mushroom, Truffle)

Beautifully crusty crostini topped with a supply of supple well-seasoned mushrooms that had been enriched by the creamy delight of the fatty yolk. Heaven.

Panino Bagnato (Lampredotto, Salsa Verde, Peperoncini) 

Lampredotto is a traditional Florence street food made of tripe. BB's was impossibly tender, a little spicy, all piled onto a jus-dipped yet still crusty house-made bun. Gah- by far, my favourite cicchetti on the platter.

Gran Fritto Misto:  Tasting of all Five Fritti ($25)

Because a night of drinking always deserves something fried.

Bianchetti (Young Smelts, Fennel Salt)

Light and airy with a fresh sea aroma and an addictively salty bite.

Carciofi (Artichokes, Bergamot Zabaglione)

I loved the sweetness of the crispy baby artichokes with the citrus aioli-like dip.

Arancino (Saffron, Prosciutto, Peas, Pistachio)

One of the cheesiest, creamiest, most decadent arancino I've ever had. When I broke through the crispy, light exterior, the cheese simply oozed out like savoury lava. I also loved the combination of the nutty pistachios with the salty prosciutto. 

Gamberetti (Rock Shrimp, N'Duja, Rosemary Ash)

To thank us for our patience in waiting for our table, we got an extra little plate of these to start. In a word, absolutely delicious. The shrimp themselves were so perfectly cooked, they almost melted upon hitting my tongue and contrasted beautifully with the spicy lightly fried batter.

Coniglio (Crisp Rabbit Legs, Colonata Spices)

Usually, I'm impartial to rabbit dishes. I have just had far too many rubbery, flabby bunnies to make it a must-order meat. But man, if all restaurants could make it like BB, rabbit would become the new chicken. These legs were meaty, had a moist flesh and a crispy skin, and were perfectly seasoned with aromatic spices.   Think of these like grown up chicken wings. I know, nowhere close to being alike, but let's just go with it if it will encourage you to try them.

Burrata di Buca ($8)
Pesto Stuffed Mozzarella, Gremolata, Alici

Burrata just cannot be bad, I'm pretty sure that's a well known fact. BB's is fantastic. Stuffed with an herbaceous nutty pesto and topped with even more bright green flavour, the addition of the super salty anchovy gave the creamy burrata all the balance it needed. 

Porchetta Schiacciata ($11)
Roast Tuscan Pork, Mascarpone, Apple Mostarda, Agliata

Gah. This was good. Super damn good. So good, we took the leftovers home and I dreamed about having them for lunch the next day, only to return from the gym at 9 AM (9 AM!! I thought I was safe!!) to see my partner had ransacked the take-out container. This sandwich almost caused a breakup. Why? Oh, so many reasons. The focaccia was soft, salty, and loaded with fresh fragrant rosemary and had a nice crispy toasted texture around its parameters. The luscious, fatty pork had both crispy bits and luscious satiny sections, making it something I would love to eat all on its own. However, I can't deny that the addition of the sweet garlic sauce, the tangy apple mostarda and the creamy mascarpone cheese really brought it all home. I will be back, and this time no one will get in my way with this sandwich.

Polpette di Capra ($14)
Sicilian Style Goat, Ricotta Meatballs, Pine Nuts

I am a huge meatball fan and these ones definitely did not disappoint. I was somewhat concerned about a goat meatball, as sometimes goat can be tough and overly gamey, but these balls managed to be neither of those things. They were remarkably tender and moist, and had a pleasant mild flavour beautifully complimented by the bright tomato sauce and the concentrated sweetness of the preserved grapes. 

Canolli ($1.75)

BB's version is fried in pork lard to yield an ethereally light wrapper stuffed with luscious mascarpone..."}
{"text":"This is my new go to for low key drinks in the area. Very few tables, but it seems its always possible to get a spot. The service is really fantastic, our servers always seem to be able to go on and on about what is good on the menu if you ask them. I love that they throw in a little bowl of snacks with your drink order - a little nibble is really what I want when I'm drinking anyway. If you like whiskey cocktails, I'd recommend the Manhattan siciliano!"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch and sat in their cute little patio (yes, summertime). I had the strapazzate, and very much enjoyed it. Oh I must say real GOOD coffee! Definitely recommend Bar Buca!"}
{"text":"FOCACCIA SANDWICHES ARE A MUST HAVE. Like seriously... get it. and don't split it. Me and my friend made this mistake. Don't do it. It's also a very reasonable price for this amazing, oily, fluffy delicious sandwich. We got the only vegetarian variety (sorry forgot the name) - and it was honestly bomb. 

As for other things, my friend got the angel hair pasta (~$16) and I got the baby octopus (~$14 I think). The portions were pretty small, but my baby octopus was very fresh and flavourful. My friend enjoyed her pasta but thought it was quite oily (especially since our sandwich was pretty much drenched in oil as well aha). To be honest, we both kinda wished we just got two sandwiches... cause they were THAT good. 

Lastly the service was great, the waiter was perfectly attentive and the ambiance was nice was well. Overall I'd say 4.5"}
{"text":"Excellent place for a quick coffee or a meal with friends, practically anytime of the day. The service is top-notch and everything on the menu is not only delicious but unique. The wait can get long during peak hours (Thu - Sat evenings) but that's normal for a place that's excellent."}
{"text":"Everything we had was fantastic.  Standouts for me were the doughnut and Buca's take on a Caprese salad, yum.  Waitstaff was super accommodating - we had a tight brunch time and they helped us get in and out with ease."}
{"text":"This place is delicious. Their seasonal menu is full of fresh flavour combinations, and dishes that often can push you out of your comfort zone and into a realm of heavenly gastronomical delights. Bar Buca exudes a more relaxed vibe than its sister restaurants; its definitely lively and boisterous inside (in a good way), with the patio being a bit quieter. The food and the drinks are both amazing, and the service is attentive. 

I went there last night and the summer menu is just mouthwatering. I had the following and can recommend them all:
- summer zucchini salad - refreshing, amazing dish
- fried zucchini flower with ricotta - crispy and delicate, not greasy at all
- ox-tail cannelloni - rich and complex with a delicious sauce, perfect for dipping bread
- roasted whole eggplant - so good. sooooo good.
- the house rose is slightly effervescent and really tasty
- the barbabuca cocktail sounds a bit strange but is utter perfection on a hot summer day. 

Love this place."}
{"text":"Overrated. I really tried to like Bar Buca but I found it uninspired. 

The wine list was fairly limited, but what threw me off even more was the pricing and serving sizes of the by the glass options. 2.5oz serving size for $12-14? Come one. Thats not even enough wine for one small app, let alone to enjoy with a bigger plate. 5oz for $16-28? For a place that should be all about social eating and drinking, this is just awful. Not everyone wants to indulge in a $75-$100 bottle, especially if their friends don't drink wine. The rest of the drinks menu isn't much better, save some of the cocktails that my friends enjoyed.

The food was fairly good, but to be honest, not even close to being noteworthy. The bone marrow at the black hoof is 3x better, while the flavour of my stuffed foccacia was predominately salt. Its important as a component but shouldn't dominate everything else on the plate, else why even bother with fine ingredients like Italian sausage, just buy hamburger meat and mozzarella. Finally, the stuffed cheese cold plate was disjointed. The components were nicely conceived, but poorly executed. It was impossible to get a rounded bite. 

Overall, the food was a disappointment and the wine list, with those awkward serving sizes, quite frankly a joke. 

The main saving grace was the front of house host. He really came through to make the evening enjoyable. Charming and friendly."}
{"text":"The goat meatballs are out of this world. I've eaten them 3 times this month and I don't even live on king west anymore. Definitely destination worthy."}
{"text":"This place is open 19 hours a day. Breakfast lunch dinner late night desserts. We were seated right near the kitchen bar which was nice to see all the action in the kitchen. Menu is good for sharing. Porchetta focaccia was excellent so was the fried app platter we had with shrimps and rabbit. Very reasonable prices. Cannoli was pretty good too. Service is really good. We had a great evening. Will be back soon for more."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a late night pick me up hoping they would have a dessert menu only to be met by disappoint. But the evening was saved by the one dessert choice they had which was their bread pudding. i usually dont like this dessert but their bread pudding tasted almost like a cross between a flan and creme brulee which are my two favorite dessert. Their cocktails however disappointed me a little. Great friendly staff and ambiance."}
{"text":"I had a delicious capuchino plus several pastries.  The cannoli was very rich.  The ambiance was great, watch the chefs baking for the day."}
{"text":"This is just my personal opinion, but I think this place is terrible.  Just a pretentious place with not much to offer.  Not sure how it is for breakfast or lunch, but we went for a light dinner and were very disappointed.  Plates so small that its an insult to a \"snack\".   Too salty and not very Italian.  Just a very snobby restaurant.  Hate the high top tables, no ambiance and food is nothing but overpriced crumbs on a plate that look more like garnishes with the main missing.  Restaurants in Toronto have taken this whole Spanish tapa/small plate idea and are now just abusing it and making money off of it.  Kind of annoying.  Anyway so many other better dining options in the area.  I will never return to this place."}
{"text":"Great service, food and ambience.  I highly recommend this adorable cute bar.  Just wish the service/staff was as great at their Yorkville location."}
{"text":"Went there for a late night supper. The crispy pig head is definitely a must-try and their deserts are super on point.
Food is for tiny mouth people haha - they serve quite small portions. It's good to have a few people go together and try out different dishes
Given 4/5 it's because... great atmosphere for a bar, low light settings and servers are pretty nice but the food are just passable."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch last Sunday with a friend at around 1pm.  Waited 15 minutes for a table at the bar area where we were able to enjoy cappucinos.  Tthere is no seating area so its a bit awkward standing around.

Ordered the Uova rossa ($13)and uova strapazzate ($14).  Both were good egg dishes although I preferred the strapazzate better.  The uova rossa was a thin layer of egg in a skillet.  A bit of a dinky dish compared to the other one.  The toast that came with it was super hard, to the point where it scraped the roof of my mouth and I had to stop.

Waitress was ok, a bit absent but it was a busy Sunday.  The host or manager was great though, super friendly.  

Restaurant itself is a bit unassuming from the outside (base of a condo building) but the inside is lovely, open kitchen and rows and rows of wine bottles on display.  Tables are all high tops with TALL stools.  Short girls need to be careful when they get on and off (just a tip!).

A bit disappointed with the food for brunch, but with all of the good reviews, I'll most likely come back and try out their regular menu."}
{"text":"We went here for dinner on a Saturday night and had a great experience all around. We were greeted at the door, and although there weren't any tables available, the host was extremely accommodating. We were seated within 10 to 15 minutes. Nice list of craft cocktails, and small but creative menu. The food was excellent. We had the short ribs, burrata (amazing!), broccoli skewer, olives and the fennel sausage. Service was a little slow but good overall."}
{"text":"Awesome. Missing a few great small options you'll find at Buca, but the service was A1, the drinks were A1, and the price was reasonable. Good spot for a quick coffee in the AM, good spot for drinks in the PM. Wicked Manhattan."}
{"text":"Bar Buca has an exotic menu, carrying items like pig cheeks, ewe skewers and rabbit loins. The interior is chic and simple, I love the open concept!

After seating ourselves, we ordered quickly as I was starving! The pacing of their dishes was extremely SLOW. I was still waiting for my entree when my boyfriend already finished his own dish. 

When my black cod did arrive, it was severely undercooked - I couldn't even cut through the fish. Typically, black cod would easily fall apart because of how tender it is. Also, for $16 the black cod is small in portion, I'm definitely not consuming it raw. Our server checked with the chef and came back letting us know that the chef \"agreed\" that it was undercooked and if I'd like to order anything else. 

I decided to try the prosciutto focaccia - and waited another 20 minutes for it. It was delicious, except the bread ripped the roof of my mouth and it was very oily.

The service after I sent the raw fish back, was noticeably different. Staff treated us in a cold yet polite manner. We waited for a long time for our bill as well - at this point I just wanted to get out of this place. 

Aside from their unique menu, the chefs here need proper training and the staff could be friendlier... Not to mention service was the slowest I've ever endured! I will not be back."}
{"text":"***4.5 Stars***

Bar Buca is a low-key fancy lunch or dinner in the King West area.  I have been both for lunch and dinner and truly enjoy their sharing plates style menu.

Their burrata is out of this world, just AMAZING!  Their selection of focaccia choices will leave you wanting more.  I would recommend trying anything on their menu because it is all yummy and delicious.

They make a pretty mean espresso as well.

If you are in the King West area, definitely add this place to grab some eats."}
{"text":"The most interesting thing about this place is that it's open late! We love it because there's not that many places who open late and we work late so... we dine late too!

They are always happy to serve us and they have got a good wine selection too. The menu is typically sharing which we like because we can try different dishes. Lots of cheese means this mouse gets to leave happy!"}
{"text":"From the cozy interior, super friendly staff, delicious food to the little containers of espresso-soaked sugar on every table (next to a container of regular sugar, if you prefer)  - I love Bar Buca.

Bar Buca is the physically smaller & more casual counterpart to Buca, but it packs a mighty punch.  I'm here for a late brunch today, which tallies as my second visit to this establishment.  Though you can order one dish per person, I find it more fun to share multiple dishes...and by \"fun\", I really mean it just gives you an excuse to order more dishes and try everything! 

The portions are fair for the prices and are actually large enough to fill the serving container or plate, in a rustic, but not sloppy, presentation. 

For a table of two, I'd recommend getting two dishes plus a stuffed focaccia to feel full.  Dang, I just realized I forgot to order my favourite bolognese pan bun with truffled marscarpone cheese...I guess there's always next time."}
{"text":"Tiny little spot just off Portland south of King. They mix good cocktails and the food is pretty decent though expensive and very small plates. This place lost points with me for the incredible amount they charge for even mediocre wines. 

Stop in for a cocktail and then move on for dinner in my opinion."}
{"text":"I've been to Toronto five times and compared to NYC/Philly/Asia I've found this city to have food that is just average (often too rich/salty/unbalanced proportions) This place was really fantastic though. The latte was especially memorable! The sandwiches we had (fried chicken & the famous pork sandwich) were yummy and not too overwhelmingly rich or salty! You could taste all the ingredients and it was reasonably priced. The server was attentive (off hour Monday 11 AM) and the atmosphere was awesome."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a drink and have some not-too-normal bar foods! I came here for the winterlicious menu and after our AGO visit, there weren't too many options left. I figured to give this place a try. I was a bit skeptical about the winterlicious menu with pig's heads as one of the appetizers but I am glad that I made the choice of ordering it. Also, I recommend the Tuscan sausage dinner, with hen's eggs, king's mushroom and males cooked in a petite wok, which perfectly preserve the favor. However, be aware that the food served here are a little bit on the salty side as they are technically bar foods. Also, this place does not take reservation and first come, first serve.   By the way, there are three bucas in Toronto and in my opinion, they serve different crowds."}
{"text":"Coffee: 5 stars 
Service: 3 stars 
Overall: 4/5 

Hands down, the best coffee I've had in a very long time. Their americano ($3 or so) alone is worth the wait! Be sure to add some of their special brown sugar and skip out on the brown sugar packets because it really adds sweetness to their coffee. The coffee has remained consistent in quality as that place is my regular go-to despite different baristas.


One thing I would say that, is that their service is hit or miss especially during the weekend brunch time. Their coffee bar is located at the front of the store and there isn't a real line up area. Some times people just go up to the bar and order while you've been waiting at the cashier to order. Service can be a little slow some times as there is only one barista crafting the drinks but the wait is well worth it!"}
{"text":"Great food and service ! 
Tell the staff about your allergies/restrictions and they will help in choosing your food! Also, I asked them for recommendations, and all of them were amazing."}
{"text":"The porchetta sandwich at bar buca is absolutely delicious! Moist, tender pork with some crispy bits and the bread is baked well. They also have some unique and tasty small dishes including octopus, squid and others. Their brunch is also something o try, not your typical bacon and eggs - they have some omelette with scallops which is a welcomed option and change. 
We like going for Their happy hour as well :)"}
{"text":"I love all of the Buca establishments and this is no exception. The staff is always so friendly here, the food is delicious and the wine selection is great. 

I've always been lucky enough to get there before crowds and avoid waiting for a table, but I have heard the wait can be a bit long sometimes. My favourite things to start with are the octopus and the burrata they are both so good! My favourite entree is the porchetta sandwich and I always order this when I go, but their burger is also really good too! I did try the squid ink pasta dish, and if you're inclined to try something different but you're feeling super hungry, this might not be your best option! It was good, but not great and I wouldn't order it again. 

Besides that there's always so much to chose from and I'll always be back!"}
{"text":"Came here with friends for the first day of Winterlicious, excited to try Bar Buca (I had heard so many good comments about it!). Unfortunately, the three course menu just didn't appeal to me, and I just didn't think it was worth its price point. As such, I and another friend ordered a la carte, while the two others got the set course menu.

My friend started off with the cocktail and garlic knot combo for only $10. The tiny garlic knots are so flavourful, but so sinfully greasy! They come coated in a very generous portion of olive oil, and there is the delightfully pungent fragrance of garlic in every bite. 

I got the salted cod with tomato sauce (alas, forgot the Italian name), while my friend got the porchetta schiacciata. Don't be fooled by its appearance - my tiny metal dish was loaded and filled with cod and olives! Overall, I found the dish to be quite on the salty side, making me quite thirsty after. That said, the cod was flaky and soft. 

My friend's schiacciata was massive! The porchetta was very fatty - actually, it reminded me of an Italian version of char siu. The schiacciata was rich in olive oil... Drops of oil would drip with every grasp. That said, it was so crispy and full of substance! The schiacciata was so big that although all four of us sampled a couple bites, around half of it was left over! Ultimately, she had to leave half the bread behind.

In terms of the Winterlicious menu, one friend ordered the garlic knots (classic!) while the other for the fried smelts. Unfortunately, the server forgot about the garlic knots until after the mains were served. With regards to mains, they both ordered the schiacciata; one got the caprese, while the other ordered the cicorilli (braised pork belly). I found the caprese to be lighter and therefore tastier. For the desserts, they were able to choose two pastries each, so we sampled all the choices. We agreed that our favourite was the budino, a bread pudding like pastry that was in a cream based sauce and sooo rich! My personal favourite was the torta cioccolatino, a rich, dense, dark chocolate truffle like tart. The other two were fairly unforgettable.

Overall a decent meal, but I wasn't particularly amazed. I did like the open kitchen concept, but the place was quite small and overpriced for what it's worth."}
{"text":"Brunch

Ambience, food, service & presentation and value: 4/5

Repeat: Yes. One of the best brunches I have had in the city. 

Dishes tried: Duck egg burratta, porchetta focaccia and a beet salad. All were good, but the focaccia was the best. The cocktails were good. 

Room for improvement: coffee can be better.

Other notes: It is great there are no crazy line ups or so busy you almost have to sit on someone's lap while eating your eggs benny, not that it isn't busy, it is."}
{"text":"Great service! Good cocktails. Incredible bread pudding. Awesome vibe. Small place, so may not be ideal for big groups. Good date place. Grab a seat at the bar. I will have to come back for brunch. When I do, what should I order? :)"}
{"text":"Went for drinks and food on a Friday night, it wasn't terribly busy which was nice.  The porcetta sandwich and short ribs were tasty.  There was a veggie dish that was literally 8 peices of steamed cabbage with olive oil...  $14! Would only get items as recommended on yelp.  Probably won't be returning any time soon"}
{"text":"The thing to get here for me is the pastries! We both love Buca, and decided to stop here for bite in late summer, the patio is wonderful when the sun is with you. 

The pastries change frequently, are made in house we asked as well as asking if they supplied any place for high tea as these were so good as to make one wonder if they were the work of some fairy or mythical creature that was fashioned from patisserie and so imbued with some arcane or quixotic knowledge that can only be borne by being fashioned from the very materials they spin into these morals that bewitch you at the first bite. The chestnut cookie was so inspiring we picked up chestnuts for roasting, sous vide, Italian chestnut pastes of many varieties to try with many homemade desserts. Do yourself a favour and start with their pastry tasting, assaggini di pasticceria, and if you're still craving sustenance the rest of the menu is wonderful as well!

Since we've been back a few times, the tomato salad and sandwich are sublime beyond what the straight forward ingredients suggest."}
{"text":"What a weird dining experience. Sat at the bar early on a Saturday evening. Bartender was nice but not knowledgeable about wines. No problem. Tried three reds and went with a pretty blah ripasso. Ordered the carciofi appetizer which sounded and looked great but lacked dimension. All I could taste was lemon. Maybe a punch of black pepper. I was surprised by the lack of pasta on the menu save for a cannelloni. Decided to try their stuffed verdure. I had no idea how to eat it when it arrived. It was cut into quarters but too large to eat with your hands and difficult to cut. It was so bland that I gave up a quarter of the way in. What a disappointment for the price and quality."}
{"text":"Love Bar Buca! Both times I've visited, I have walked away impressed with this off the beaten path gem of an Toronto Italian experience. The lattes they make put all other lattes to shame.
Rich and creamy, and then topped with their signature sweetener, the Italian specialty crema, made from the froth of the espresso machine is, if your idea of heaven is drinking delicious coffee all day without ill effects, simply heaven.
The brunch was undoubtedly perfect as well. If you are in the mood for a protein hit, the egg dish I had was fantastic. With so many cookie cutter coffee shops in the area ready to take your money, Bar Buca stands out as an enduring favourite."}
{"text":"Came here for a weekday brunch. 
Upscale fancy, elegant decor, well behaved clientele as the prices for a breakfast place dictate. 
The portions were smaller, but just enough to fill. 

Crazy awesome iced coffee... 
Crema di Caffe is a must try
Coming back here just for this
It's the best iced coffee I've ever had!! 

They could use some more detailed descriptions/translations on their menu. 
We had to ask the waitress what some of the juices were.
Why would there be translations on some but not all? 

Service was great. Very courteous. 
But please try the Crema di Caffe!"}
{"text":"Bar Bucca is amazing!! PAUL was our waiter for the night made our experience unbelievable he was attentive, friendly and recommended the best dishes! Not only is the food great atmosphere and service are on point!"}
{"text":"This has got to be one of my new favorite Italian restaurants. I rarely give five stars.. But this place deserves it!

Service is prompt and attentive. There was an open kitchen and you could see 5-6 staff working in the kitchen on a weekday night! No wonder things came so fast.

Their porchetta focaccia sandwich is a must try! It was amazing. It was a little bit salty but I guess that's what the wine is for! They take care of their wines so well! And most of them are imports you won't be able to purchase at lcbo. 

The atmosphere was nice. It had simple decorations but felt somewhat romantic at the same time.

One downfall was that this place is a little more hidden! You could totally walk right past it even if you knew the address! But definitely worth the time to look. I guess you could call this a hidden gem ;)"}
{"text":"Food is great. I usually always get the duck why. The pizzas are also good. I would avoid getting the breadknots. I find them too salty. Overall good atmosphere and service"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I picked Bar Buca randomly for brunch on our trip to Toronto based on reviews. We're from New York, so our standards for brunch are normally high. We got there and had a 20 minute wait and found a couple of seats at the bar. I wasn't sure what to get or what I'd like, so I got the farinata. IT WAS THE MOST DELICIOUS THING I'VE EVER HAD! I'm not even exaggerating, that's all I remember from my trip to Toronto, the amazingly delicious Farinata! It's just the best blend of flavors and textures! I thought it would be weird to have chickpea pancakes, because I hadn't ever had it before, also I wasn't sure how overwhelming the chickpea taste would be, but I couldn't even tell that it had chickpeas, it was just so delicious. I highly recommend Bar Buca, but even more, go there and try the farinata, it'll change your definition of brunch! Now I need to try and find something like that in NYC!"}
{"text":"4.5 / 5 - damn good

Went here pretty much immediately after I saw Toronto Life say that Bar Buca has the best burger in TO.

Close. I'd likely give it to Harbord Room because I found the Bar Buca burger to be a bit too raw (almost like tartar) for my *personal* taste.

With that said, it was still DAMN good. Juicy, smooth, and delicious. The slightly sun-dried tomatoes were a game changer - I could not stop raving about how damn good they were (and I tend to not care much for them).

Had some of the apps (ala pesto-stuffed cheese), and someone else on the table had the octopus (not bad) and the brussel sprouts (pretty good).

If you love burgers, definitely worth visiting here. It's very upscale for the price."}
{"text":"I've been to Bar Buca twice for Summerlicious now. This year I had the marinated baby octopus as my appetizer - so delicious! The octopus was so tender. We also ordered the nodini (bread knots) which we've had at Buca but wanted to try them here at Bar Buca. Unfortunately not as good but satisfied our craving. For our mains we ordered the mussels and burger. Mussels were served in a tomato-based, hot pepper broth. My only complaint is that the dish was quite small and I was left wanting more! The burger looked average but the flavour was bomb - packed with flavour! For dessert we had the flourless chocolate cake (which I had at last year's Summerlicious as well) - sweet and soft, just like I remembered."}
{"text":"Found this place to be a bit expensive but worth the money. We were told a 20 minute wait upon arriving but ended up standing around for a little over an hour. The host was very friendly however and kept us in the loop.

The bartender we got drinks from while waiting was a big tall bald guy who was extremely pleasant to speak too and quite welcoming.

When seated we were given the corner spot looking into the kitchen. This made the wait worth every second.

The cocktails were 10/10 and the food was fantastic, the service was great and atmosphere was energetic and trendy. 

Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"One of my favourite spots to go on a regular basis.

In the mornings they have the best americanos & cortados, they open up early so that's great for when you're on your way to work!

I normally come after work for cocktails or wine - they have an extensive drink menu which is wonderful. Their dishes are mostly small plates, so if I'm just by myself I'll have 1 or maybe 2 - if I go with a large group we order quite a few - there are so many delicious dishes to choose from!

The staff is amazing, knowledgable and genuine!"}
{"text":"After celebrating my birthday dinner at Buca, I was really excited to check out Bar Buca and had pretty high expectations from the get-go. I went for brunch on Sunday and was seated right away. I'm not the biggest fan of communal seating so I was a little disappointed once we were seated next to two younger girls, scream talking about whether Kylie Jenner looked sexier with blue hair or not. After reviewing the menu, I was stuck on what to order because of the lack of vegetarian options. After getting recommendations from the waiter-who was very knowledgeable, he persuaded me to not \"modify\" any of the items which had meat in them because it would just change the dish too much. So I opted for the Verdure Focaccia and obviously a mimosa (what's brunch without a mimosa). After some time the waiter came to check on us, I asked him about our drinks and he took full blame and said he forgot but made no effort to compensate for his mistake which again was a little disappointing- and yet we still had to wait a while for them. When we ordered the waiter did give us the heads up that the food does come out as it's made but there was a 15 minute time difference between my partner getting his Veal Focaccia and me getting mine. With that being said the Verdure was quite good once it came aside from it being cold (did they forget again?).

I'm not sure if this is an ideal brunch spot, but would give them another chance to go with at least 4 people (a whole table) and split dishes as it is a tapas restaurant for dinner or a late night snack. Although the lack of vegetarian options doesn't have me running back and neither does the service."}
{"text":"Nice tiny cafe under a condo on king west. The entire time I was thinking I wish I lived upstairs. The Americanos and lattes were quality and had a great Taste. Service was friendly and didn't mind any of my annoying questions and repetitive chats. Will return."}
{"text":"The food is tasty and wonderful to my palate! The baratta was one of my favorites, along with the porchetta sandwich. Good wine list and decor is simple but modern and comfortable. Open kitchen concept...

I would've given them 5 stars, but the server (an Aussie) was quite rude and I saw her talking about me to another server. She also took my 2 friends' espressos before they were even done- she didn't bother to ask them. Food was still worth going back but hopefully management is aware of her behavior."}
{"text":"This place has the best coffee in Toronto. I hate writing that, because I hate King Street Foods (who own Jacobs, The Saint, Buca chain, Jamie Oliver...) and the way they run their businesses....but the coffee is good.  And damn, fine, I'll admit it. The food is good too.  I only think of this place as a brunch place (probably because I only drink coffees on weekends in the morning!) so I can't comment on their dinner.  But the brunch food is good.  I had a porchetta sandwich and it was WAY too much for one person, which is odd, because normally I find their food not very filling, juuuust enough to satiate.

Go with a friend, each get a coffee and a brunch cocktail, share the sandwich and the vegetarian egg skillet, and if you sit on the patio, wear sunscreen (there's no shade!)"}
{"text":"Great for Italian small plates. Nice wine by the glass options. Fun vibe. Outdoor patio in a happening area. A favorite of many friends and coworkers."}
{"text":"here for mothers day brunch. 20 minutes turned into 60 to get here thanks to the marathon. I had Al forno and it was incredible. also tried the one w fennel sausage that hubby enjoyed. worth the trek here. wish we had room for desserts"}
{"text":"I went to Bar Buca (again) and got the porchetta sandwich (again) and this little piece of transcendence somehow got exponentially better in the time I had been away. I generally consider my life to be a waking nightmare but my god! this slice of heaven gave my life meaning, if only for a brief period of time before I absolutely devoured it.

I think it's best I end this before I get emotional...Sometimes it makes me sad, though, that Sandy being gone. I have to remind myself that some birds aren't meant to be caged. Their feathers are just too bright and when they fly away, the part of you that knows it was a sin to lock them up does rejoice, but still, the place you live in is that much more drab and empty now that they're gone. I guess I just miss my friend.

The service is still the same staunch, snooty, unbearable service you've grown to hate at Buca."}
{"text":"Had a great brunch with my girlfriend. We shared a strapazzate and porchetta schiacciata along with Nutella lattes all of which tasted really great. The porchetta schiacciata was crisy on the outside and nice and soft in the inside. The Nutella latte was the best I ever had! :)"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing! All the portions are teeny tiny, so it's better to share a few things. Everything was very fresh and homemade, really interesting flavours. We had a chickpea crepe stuffed with ricotta, pancakes with chocolate and mascarpone, and a pork stuffed focaccia. Service was eh, as they were not super friendly, but they were moderately attentive so it didn't bother me so much. Best meal I've had in Toronto by far!"}
{"text":"(3.5*) 

Came here for Winterlicious! We did not have a reservation so it took about 1 hour and 45 minutes to get seated but I was determined to try this place out because it was one of the very few itallian places I wanted to go to.

We got the end seat at the bar close to the kitchen and our server was really delightful to speak to. I didn't get his name unfortunately but he wasn't itallian but his pronunciation of the dishes were endearing!

We ordered all the appetizers because we had the choice of two which was Polenta, Testa, Barbabietole, Cicoria, the mains were Ammazza Fegato and Caponata con Cavolfiore, and we also had another choice of two for the dessert and had them all: Pizelle, Torta Cioccolatino, Amaretti Arancione, and Cantuccino.

Me and my friend also ordered drinks: Gassosa Speziata & La Vita Nuova. The Gassosa Speziata was a house made grapefruit, tamarind, clove soda that was delightfully strong. The La Vita Nuova was a lovely cocktail with bacardi rum that i thoroughly enjoyed with my dishes :)

 Below I listed them in the order we recieved them.

Polenta (4/5) 
They were crispy and deliciously spicy but I felt they were too oily.

Testa (5/5)
Fried Pig Head was so good in terms of flavour, sweet and spicy, but very decadent in terms of fat.

Cicoria (4/5)
The roman dandelions were bitter and lightly tossed in the vinegrette which was a refreshing palate cleanser for the previously two oily starters.

Barbabietole (5/5)
The dessert of the starters; it was naturally sweet with the stracciatella so lovely.

Ammazza Fegato (4/5)
Was expecting alot more farro than recieved but the tuscan offal sausage was to die for dipped in the runny yolk so I guess that made up for it.

Caponata con Cavolfiore (2.5/5)
Just regular cauliflower in butter and little bits of pork here and there with cheese, maybe its just me because I'm not European or well versed in their food culture but it was pretty average for me.

Pizelle, Torta Cioccolatino, Amaretti Arancione, and Cantuccino (4/5) 
We ordered a coffee with the desserts and we were given Expresso Infused Sugar as well as regular sugar and cream. The dessert platter was nice I really loved all of them except the Cantuccino. Each of them had their unique flavour and aromas and complimented each other but the biscotti was just there lol.

Overall enjoyed the experience but probably not looking to come back; a must try for bar food itallian style :)"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try Bar Buca since it opened, but King St. Douchebaggery has kept me away. After our experience here today I can say that I ought not to have been so quick to jump to conclusions. While douches lurk everywhere, we had a douche free brunch. It was quite delightful.

We sat at the bar and ordered two delicious fresh ginger cocktails. I commented to our server, Marco, that I appreciated how the decorative wine bottles were actually stored properly and he was nice enough to give me a squirt of a delicious Barbera. Had I been in the mood for a boozy brunch, I would have downed my cocktail and moved on to a glass of that lovely wine. But, as usual with wine... I digress...

We had the Porchetta Focaccia, which is served with a runny egg at brunch-time. The garlicky, soft meat layered between crackling and egg on soft fresh baked bread was both delicious and comforting. I had the egg dish with scallops, Pine nut and crispy prosciutto. This was staggeringly delicate and simple, but all the ingredients were in perfect harmony.

Marco was really informative and very passionate about the food. A complete pro and not only great at his job, but genuinely seems to love what he does. This makes all the difference for me because as a server, myself I understand the love that goes into not only how the food is made, but great service as well.

My boyfriend and I walked away scratching our heads 'How have we not been here before??'.

Good Question.

We'll be back."}
{"text":"There's nothing not to like about Bar Buca.
The elevated ceiling, minimal interior with wooden furniture to add warmth, shared table to create feelings of a neighbourhood eatery. Yet, the food and drink were no 'eatery type'.  It's worth travelling far and wide to enjoy a meal here.  Each and every dish left you wanting more.  The salad so delicate and fresh. The bone marrow so rich and intense.  Just to say a few.  We are coming back until we experience  each and every dish on the menu. Though it will be hard not to re-order something we already tried and craved since."}
{"text":"Outstanding food. Beautiful decor, though the tile makes for a very loud small space. Not tons of vegetarian options, unfortunately. On recommendation from our server we had the roasted beets, which I normally wouldn't have ordered for brunch but really enjoyed. Also tried an egg dish topped with truffle shavings and two excellent, teeny-tiny specialty coffee drinks. We left hungry and a whole lot poorer, but our taste buds were delighted."}
{"text":"This is a review based on my first experience at Bar Buca, and I might update it when I inevitably return. 

I went to Bar Buca for an impromptu lunch today and it was half-empty when we arrived around 12:15. I definitely liked the airy ambiance, the big screens and the abundance of natural light. Also the waitstaff wasn't like the usual Buca waitstaff, which makes me feel like they're simultaneously being kiss-asses, while giving the distinct impression that they are morally superior and better looking than me. Our waiter was friendly and approachable - and his water re-fill game was seriously next-level. At one point the fire alarm went off but the issue was resolved quickly.

 The \"sangwidges\" were awesome. I had the mozzarella with ciliegini tomatoes and basil on focaccia and my dining partner had the porchetta with mascarpone, apple mostarda and agliata on focaccia. Decent portion at a reasonable price (around $10 each). 

So you might be wondering, \"why are there only four stars when this is clearly a glowing review?\" It all comes down to timing, or a lack thereof. I was served my sandy in a timely manner, and assuming my dining partner's sandwich would be quick to follow, he said to go ahead and eat while it was still warm. Around 13 minutes later (I'm guestimating, so sue me), he got the waiters attention and when I was nearly finished my sammich, he was finally served. I feel like in a mostly empty restaurant at lunch hour with a more than ample staff, it wouldn't be an outstanding feat for two sandwiches to arrive around the same time. While waiting, my dining partner even gestured to the open kitchen, and said \"that cook's not even doing anything! He's just standing there scratching himself.\" 

So for the TL;DR version: cool place, great food, pleasant waiter, awful timing."}
{"text":"We arrived at Bar Buca at about 9:00 tonight, never greeted, after about 10 minutes of multiple staff members looking straight at us, but continue doing their jobs without a word to us, we asked the bartender if we seated ourselves, or if we needed to wait to be seated. He tells us his manager will be over to seat us. We wait. 5 minutes later, two young women arrive, walk right in front of us, and guess what? They get seated immediately. Finally, I ask the next person who looked like a staff person if we would be helped, and he basically pointed to a table outside, (that only had one chair at it) or for us to be seated at the bar. There were 2 open spots at the end of the bar so my husband and I took them. To be honest, I wanted to leave after the young women were seated after we had been there waiting and no one seemed to notice. But, my husband wanted to check the place out because of the good reviews. Once we sat at the bar, again, no one greeted us, the bartender brought us water after about 5 minutes, then didn't come back. So- we left. I really wanted to try the place out, so it's unfortunate the service was so awful. I can't imagine ever returning. We walked around the corner to another restaurant and had a wonderful dinner there. I'm in the hospitality industry, and this was just awful service."}
{"text":"8:30 AM Sunday
Greeted warmly at the door
Told to sit anywhere

8:40 AM as two of five people seated we finally had someone stop by.  Who was immediately rude and overly snooty.  Decided to tweak him a bit by ordering like the stupid American he was treating me as, \"I just want some eggs and meat.\"  He looked physically pained, I enjoyed that.

8:47 AM Receive the Americano with no body and no flavor beyond burnt beans, along with a trendy thimble of water

8:50 The thimble of water ran dry

8:55 I can see my food on the counter, teasing me.

9:00 Another server finally sees the food over there and decides to deliver it to us.  I am warned it will be hot, it is, but no longer hot enough for a warning.  The sauce is decent or would be if it was on pasta, under eggs with the thickest and most bacon like prosciutto I have ever had it wasn't.  The ricotta was very tasty with a great texture.  My eggs were not well drained from their initial poaching, one had a nice vinegar surprise in it for me.

9:05 New server stops back and asks how everything is, sees and hears my \"Eh\" and ignores it, along with my empty water.

9:08 Finally notices my water, fills it.

9:15 After we have thoroughly finished our meals they take everything away and then ask if they could do anything else for us.  We inform New Server that our order isn't complete yet.

9:20 We are assured the kitchen staff was just waiting for something to settle.  Server one apparently forgot to order the second part before going on his break.  I am fuming at this point.

9:23 Pastry finally arrives, good but not worth the hassle of this place.

9:26 Pastry complete and flatly request check.  She takes time to straighten a table before bringing it over to us.

9:28 Brings check, despite me holding credit card, wanders off again.

In finale, food was \"Eh\", Coffee was poor, Staff was terrible"}
{"text":"I came here with some girlfriends on a Sunday night.  Trendy place, with friendly service-I like the open kitchen!  I had the barbarbuca cocktail (with beet-infused vodka)- it was out of this world!! 

We shared a few plates- the nodini, the funghi, the burrata di buca, the barbabietole, the involtini di melanzane and a stuffed foccacia.  All were delicious; the foccacia, barbabietole and involtini were, in particular, outstanding.

I will definitely come back for drinks or for a special occasion date!  I can't get that barbarbuca cocktail out of my head!!"}
{"text":"It's a very modern and minimal space which is nice but not my kind of atmosphere. It's a little too chic for me. Doesn't have a lot of soul.

The food was tasty and it's obvious there is a passion for making interesting food. The portions were quiet small but I get the impression this place is more of a spot for cocktails and snacks. I was hungover and hungry so I think this place was lost on me."}
{"text":"Bar Buca is one of my go-to spots in Toronto. Although I have tried all three, this is probably my favorite of the Buca dynasty because it's just so versatile. You can come here at any time of the day (or night) whether it be for brunch, coffee, or some glasses of wine. It's refreshing to have a place where you can go for a coffee past six o'clock. It feels very European. The interior is sleek and modern with high ceilings. The food is simple yet elegant. They have a to-go counter as well. They are even open on holidays! 

Some of my all-star favorites:

--Uove Strapazatte: Mixture of turkey, goose and duck eggs with burrata cheese and truffles, topped with basil and served with grilled ciabatta bread. Spectacular.
---Bombolone: I like them right out of the oven, oozing with lemon & pistachio cream. 
--Zeppole: Again, incredible fried dough filled with pistachio cream 
--Schiacciatas (stuffed focaccias), especially the porchetta one. 
--Assaggi di Pasticceria: two-tiered pastry tower with various goods such as cannoli siciliani, biscotti alla semolina, torta cioccolatino, pizzelle etc. 
--Caprese salad: stylish and creative take on this classic tomato salad where the \"caprese\" is really the sauce.

Can't go wrong with this place."}
{"text":"The porchetta sandwich was pretty good! It had a good combination and balance of flavors. Service was subpar. The waiter couldn't remember our order and we had to confirm the drinks a few times."}
{"text":"Hey, bb. I'm never disappointed when I dine here. I may be inclined to say that they have some of the tastiest dishes around.

For example, last time we ordered the crudo, burrata di buck, polpette di capra, arancino and costolette di manzo. All incredible plates; each combination of textures and flavours outdid the next. 

You won't go thirsty either. Strong drink list.

The service is good: they try and pace the dishes and offer to bring out more garlic bread to mop up your extra sauce. 

I still haven't tried them for brunch, lunch or coffee and pastries. All the more reason to go back!"}
{"text":"We ordered the uova rossa, Nutella croissant. Cannoli, and zeppole donut

Uova rossa was amazing quality, prosciutto was crispy, scallops were tender, and the Orange zest just catapulted us into the stratosphere of taste. 

Desserts were amazing, Nutella croissant was so good we had to get 2

Bar buca be the bomb"}
{"text":"I went here with a group of friends that could not stop raving about how amazing this place was.  It was ok, food and service wise, but certainly not deserving of the word \"amazing.\"  The prices were reasonable, but if you serve a hot sandwich, cold, and then reheat it so that it is re-served hot and dry.. well, that is a pretty good indication that you don't care for my business.  I have no idea why we left $50 on a $110 dollar tab, but Bar Buca did not deserve it."}
{"text":"But of a hidden gem since it's not off king. Brunch was delicious and the server was soooo knowledgeable. Place is small so it gets packed! The cafe Miele was delicious."}
{"text":"I give bar Buca a 5 star with no doubt!!! First of all I didn't have to wait in the line in cold weather which is a bonus , the food was absolutely amazing!! They serve pretty fast too , will go back for sure"}
{"text":"PORCHETTA....so awesome!! I can't stop thinking about it!!  If you go, you must get, you will not be disappointed!!

The plates are small but very well priced.  Since we have never been there before, we asked the server to suggest some things and went from there.

Nodini - buttery morsels of bread knots 5/5
Brushchetta - I remember it being delicious, but it has been a few days since I went and I am having trouble remembering it...so that is why I am giving it a 4/5
Burrata di Buca - not too into cold cheese, so I probably should not have ordered it, but I noticed that the chef was making a lot of them so it must be popular, but due to my own personal taste, I give it only 3/5 but maybe others will give it a better score (My fault, I didn't look at the description closely enough, if I had realized it was a cold dish I would have not ordered it...I was expecting something warm)
PORCHETTA - 10/5 - so super awesome super delicious super duper that it tips all scales...best sandwich EVER, a flavourful sensational dish...I can't say enough good things about this dish
For dessert, we had the nuttella croissant, which was tasty, but nothing special. 

I will definitely return, and definitely try more of the dishes."}
{"text":"For my first brunch in Toronto this year, I decided to try Bar Buca. My friend in Vancouver highly recommended coming here, and after checking out the pictures online, I was sold.

We called ahead to ask if there was a line up, since it was a Saturday and just after 12 PM. There was none so off we went! We were immediately seated. The front part of the restaurant has an area where people line up for coffee and baked goods. Inside there are high tables for those who want a sit-down meal. There are also bar seats with a view into the kitchen.

Uova Strapazzate ($14): mixed variety farm egg, burrata, truffle, basil. My favourite of the two dishes. The fresh basil complements the egg and burrata perfectly. Comes with some bread to balance it out.

Uova Rossa: duck egg yolk, bay scallop, pine nuts, crisp prosciutto, scallion. Also very delicious. Scallops were a bit small, but there were plenty.

Nutella buffalo milk latte ($7ish): one of the best coffees I've ever had. So smooth and creamy. For the price point, it better be amazing!

The stuffed foccacias looked delicious and filling too, for only $8 or so. I'd be able to eat half of it only. I would get that next time, along with their bombolone (cream-filled donut!).

Service was excellent. The servers were always available and those who were not serving us were still eager to help. On two occasions, the waitress overheard us wondering what dish had just been placed on a nearby table, and she proactively came over and explained the dish for us.

I hope I get the chance to come back and try their dinner, or their brunch again!"}
{"text":"Fancy little brunch place that my friend and I discovered. The food is very delicious, and the atmosphere is cozy.

But this isn't a place for those who are seeking a large and filling meal! It's an upscale brunch place, and my friend was severely disappointed by her breakfast sandwich. Sure it was tasty, but the price + size just didn't seem to be worth it. We were still left hungry after such an expensive meal, so we went to Banh Mi Boys afterwards. lol 

So would I come back again? Probably not...it's just my preference to eat filing breakfast/brunch food, and if I want that, I wouldn't come here for it."}
{"text":"We have been coming here for 2 years now and it's still hands down one of our favourite place to eat in Toronto! Everything on their menu is phenomenal and the service is great. Nothing disappoints here. 

If you ever want to try the most amazing lattes, I suggest the addicting latte zenzero, which is ginger cinnamon coffee. This latte is to die for. Another favourite is the nutella buffala latte. You can't go wrong with either!

The nodini (bread knots) are small bites of carb goodness. A great starter. A must try is the burrata di buca with a side of fettunta (homemade bread). The burrata is smooth and creamy mozzarella cheese encased with pesto. A personal favourite. The bombolone burger is one of the best burgers in the city! Everything in it is made in great ratio in this beef and lardo burger. The goat and ricotta meatballs with pine nuts is great - I never liked the taste of goat but this is delicious! Their stuffed shelled pasta is a delicious combination of cheese and spinach with a beautiful tomato sauce. The porcetta stuffed focaccia is a bar buca specialty and their portion size of the foccacia is good for sharing. 

For brunch, I'd suggest the crespelle (citrus pancakes with cannoli filling) which is not too sweet, but addicting! Another brunch favourite is the uova strappazete with truffle!

Don't forget their amazing desserts before you leave! The cannoli, bombolone doughnut and the bread pudding make the end of the meal the perfect meal. 

For the price, it's a great way to try many different items on the menu without breaking the bank! A great place to hang out with good friends, have good food and drinks, in a chill space!"}
{"text":"Best espresso with sugar spuma!!!
Best Porchetta Focaccia Sandwich.
Best Sopressata Focaccia Sandwich but currently office the menu.  Please bring it back!!!"}
{"text":"Bar Buca is the more affordable cousin of Buca down the street.  With a small square footage, this restaurant can only cater to small groups that are no larger than four diners.  It's a more intimate space with a classy atmosphere and modern decor, so this restriction in group size is well compensated.  In all  fairness, it creates the perfect vibe for dates. 

I enjoyed the 10 dollar drink and appetizer menu.  For an affordable price, you can receive a few ounces of wine/liquor/beer alongside a pleasantly plated personal appetizer.  I tried the nodini, tigella, and dumplings with pig's head. The flavours were not overpoweringly rich and the textures were not too soft, two critical turn offs for me when it comes to Italian food.  Therefore, for someone who doesn't appreciate Italian food as much as she should, I was thoroughly impressed with the quality. 

The servers were prompt, but nothing's perfect. They mixed up both my drink and food selections after they were brought out. Fortunately, they apologized and gave my entire party a shot of liquor on the house to make up for the mistakes. This made  each member of my party smile after they were put off by the lack of attention. 

If I'm looking for a light bite to go with my alcohol and intimate conversation, I'll definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Best burrata in the city. The bread is FANTASTIC. The meatballs I didn't love . Overall I love the atmosphere and would 100% come back for some tasty wine and burrata."}
{"text":"What a great place to start your Saturday morning. What a great place to start your Saturday morning. This is our first time trying Buca for brunch. We ordered the Uova Rossa(scallops) and Caprese. They are both very good! But we both prefer the Caprese. Ingredients of Caprese are fresh and well balanced.  

I ordered cafe bombon. Its really good. I loved it. Its a shot of espresso with caramel like syrup at the bottom."}
{"text":"Brunch was excellent!! A great brunch for all foodies that would appreciate the finer nuances of the dishes that would be served here. 

Everything on the menu is made to share. They didn't mention how many people to share with, so our ravenous group of 7 might have done better with 2 of each dish - but we ended up with a good taste of everything. And surprisingly, with about 6-7 dishes, we were completely full at the end of it. 

The menu is divided into sweet stuff, savoury stuff, and panini like, foccacia stuffed sandwiches (which I noticed were also on their to go list). 

What we ate:

- Uovo Strapazzate - one of 2 egg dishes - fresh farm eggs with truffle oil. Like an omlette, but flat served on this pan. It was full of truffle flavour, but a little salty.

-*Uovo Rosso - duck eggs served with rock shrimp. Similar to the egg dish above, but infused with lobster. I think this would be a better choice, if you were to choose only one. 

- Ammaza Fegato - the offal sausage - it doesn't present itself very nicely, but it was good - and salty. Offal refers to a variety of organ meats ground into a sausage - so it's a unique taste.

-*Migliaccio - the tuscan blood crepe served with figs and chocolate - this was something really unique a treat. The crepe is made with pigs blood and it's mild savoury taste goes well with the chocolate and fig. 

- *Crepselle - must get. It's small, but there are 3 small hotcakes covered in cannoli bits and served with maple grappa - I don't know how they got the outside so crispy with the moist insides on such a small pancake. 

- *Carbonara schiacciata - get one of these sandwiches and you will not be disappointed. The crisp foccacia really made the dish. 

- Bobolone ($6) - we got this to end the meal on a sweet note. I don't know how I feel about this. The doughnut itself was great, and covered (and stuffed) with this apple cream. I think there was too much of it, and it was very sweet. Made it a little difficult to finish. Another option would be the pastries ($12)

Price wise, it was all of a very good value (and I usually hate tapas/sharing type places). Even the take out sandwiches were about $10-12 (and a generous portion). With everything we ate, it was a surprisingly $18 per person include coffees, and I expected to spend a lot more. 

Would I come here again? Maybe, but not in the near future. The dishes are quite rich, and although I loved it, wouldn't be a regular place for brunch for me, unless they changed up their menu. I would love to come and try dinner here though."}
{"text":"Perfect hub for a busy day lunch...

Service: 4.5/5....very speedy and at tentative.

Price: 4/5....decent

Food: 4.5/5.... Very delicious and appetizing

Parking:  3/5.... There are green P parking every where. Just require a little of parking..."}
{"text":"Why am I only now discovering this place? Cuuuttteeee! 

Didn't try the food but I've heard to come adventurous. The table seating is cafeteria style in the sense you may be seated with a group you don't know however, I didn't find this an issue. In fact, the group next to us only solidified me wanting to return for the food -- and more wine. 

Service was great and the individual was very knowledgeable on the menu and wine that he thought we'd enjoy based on others. 

A definite recommend for a small group prior to going out or a date."}
{"text":"Great service. Great food.  

We arrived without a reservation on a Saturday night and were able to get a table for 5 within 30 minutes.  The menu is tapas style so we got to try several items between our party.  They were easily able to make modifications and accommodate a vegetarian and allergy amongst the orders.

Only negative (although did not apply to us since we were a big party), is that there are no table arrangements for parties of two.  I noticed parties of two were seated at communal tables of either 4 or 6 guests in total.  Keeping this in mind, I wouldn't recommend for a date night (if you are opposed to communal tables like me)."}
{"text":"Love this chic neighborhood spot for brunch or lunch!  For brunch the uova rossa and uova strapazzate are both excellent as are the stuffed foccacia sandwiches.  One of my lunch/dinner favorites is the whole roasted eggplant w pistachio ... so delicious!!  They also have a nutella coffee ... Patio is a great place to sit with friends in the summertime!  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"We had brunch on a Sunday morning around 10:30 am. It was busy but there was a table available. This is a small version of their restaurants. It is all high tables and bar area only. Concrete, wood and steel decor. Similar to a cafe and bar. Has a lively trendy feeling like a neighborhood bar in New York. We ordered the pastry selection, zenzora latte, la grande colazione, bisteca tagliata. Pastry selection is a miniature version of the pastries they have at the front glass bakery counter. Tasty but high carb alert! Grande colazione arrived quickly after. However my steak and eggs came very late. After everyone was finished. Steak was quite rare but tasted great. Eggs sunny side up done to perfection. Loved my ginger syrup latte zenzoro. There are unique selections for espressos. Service was attentive and friendly. Overall great Italian quick stop for drinks and casual eats. Food and service is consist with the Buca chain."}
{"text":"The burratadi buca was the best mozzarella I've ever had! It had gremolata, Alia. Super fresh with pesto included. The mozzarella melted in your mouth. Definitely would recommend trying this with the baguette. This restaurant is tapa style, great for social outtings. You are able to try a bunch of tapas at once to experience food from each category. I also tried the other tapas such as the mortadella stuffed focaccia (great portion size sandwich), and crudo(attic char with squid ink salt). I felt that those were lacking flavour."}
{"text":"A lot of places say \"authentic Italian\" but its a dirty lie. Bar Buca is legit authentic. Awesome coffee with some kind of sugar creme to add that I've only ever seen in Italy (don't know what it's called). I had the truffle omelette with my latte. Holy crap its good."}
{"text":"A small and intimate atmosphere in the fashion district of Toronto.  The table space is limited at this highly sought-out spot and they do operate under a table-sharing policy if there are empty seats at your table.  Either it means you have to gossip a lot quieter or a great chance to make strike up some conversation at the table.

The service is excellent and the servers are very knowledgable about the whole menu, the drinks, and accommodating (we had a friend that was allergic to pine nuts).  They were timely and friendly with asking whether we wanted more food and to top off our drinks at the appropriate times.  The noise level is not overwhelming but there is a wonderful buzz that permeates the room that makes it feel very lively.

You won't find a pre-set menu online for this spot as I feel the probably rotate their menu as the seasons change especially with tapas-style dishes.  The highlights of the night was the burrata, marinated beef heart skewers, seared rabbit legs, homemade meatballs with a spicy red sauce, and the squid-ink calimari.  It was really hard to fault anything that came out of the kitchen as it was all freshly made.

I really enjoyed their version of a Dark and Stormy called the Tempesta.  They have a large selection of wine and cocktails but limited selection of beer.

Would definitely love to go back in the spring for another taste of their menu and to try some more cocktails."}
{"text":"I've only ever ordered from uber eats and every time I receive beautiful & delicious Italian pastries. I can't say enough good things about this place. You must try if you're looking for great pastries (cannolis, bambolone, cornuta, etc)."}
{"text":"This place is small and they only have bar seats so I wouldn't recommend for bringing kids. It has open kitchen concept so it would be interesting to sit at the counter to see whats the chef is upto. Everything on the menu looks so yummy!  Unfortunately, I went there alone and so I only ordered Porchetta Stuff Focaccia. It was sooooo delicious! I do agree with some Yelpers mentioning that it's oily and a bit salty but since it's delicious, who cares!? Its best to go in a group of two or three people so that everyone get to try different dishes. I don't live in Toronto and how I wish they have one in NYC. I love how serious the chefs were while preparing my food. These chefs really love their job!"}
{"text":"The porchetta focaccia sandwich was absolutely phenomenal. Very tender roast pork with an extremely flavorful sauce that really went well together. The focaccia bread was toasted a little too crisp (almost like a bruchetta), but I still enjoyed it very much. 

The crudo arctic char was also really delicious. Like a sashimi, the char tasted very fresh. Didn't taste the squid ink salt though. Again, the bread that came with it was overly crisp and too hard for my liking.

The merluzzo black cod was very tender, but felt it could have used a little more flavor. The portion was also very small, so didn't think it was worth the price. 

The arrosticini ewe meat skewer wasn't that special. Tasted like a regular kafta skewer, and didn't notice any special texture or flavor of the meat. Two tiny skewers for $10, wasn't worth it. 

The coniglio alla milanese rabbit loin was a disappointment. Didn't expect it to be deep fried! The meat was very thin and didn't taste like rabbit. Still tasty, but was like eating a veal schnitzel with an egg. 

The polpette di capra goat and ricotta meatballs was quite nice. But my meatball was still cold inside and had to send it back. Server gave us a brand new dish, but had to wait quite a while for it to be re-cooked.

The porchetta, crudo, and polpette di capra was definitely worth trying, the others, I would pass on if I had to order again. 

The wait to get our table was quite long and we had to share our table with another group. Too loud to have a conversation without yelling so the dining atmosphere wasn't that great. 

Our server was very attentive and professional. The chefs however could use a little more training and professionalism. Serving cold meatballs is inexcusable, they should know when the food is properly cooked. Also, on numerous occasions, I saw them wiping their nose while preparing the food bare handed. Another chef was eating some of the food while plating the dishes. This type of behavior should not be happening, especially with an open concept kitchen where the customers can see their every move. Sometimes it's better to just not know what happens in the kitchen... 

Although I really enjoyed a couple of the dishes, given the long wait time, loud and uncomfortable seating, and unprofessional chefs, it will likely be a while before I decide to come back and give this restaurant a second try."}
{"text":"(Brunch review) Was craving some eggs for breakfast so ordered the pomodoro and uova strapazette which are both egg dishes. Must say that I expected a bit more on the skillet for the price. Would have been nice if the plate included some other items such as potatoes or some roasted veggies or beans (or anything really!) as it was quite literally just a skillet of eggs with 2 small slices of toasted bread. The eggs were nicely cooked and runny but the uova strapazette dish was a bit under-seasoned. It includes truffle but I couldn't taste the truffle being integrated into the dish other than seeing some small pieces dusted at the top. I did enjoy the tomato sauce in the pomodoro as it kicked up the flavour.

Service was good and I liked the laid back rustic decor of the place. Not sure if I would visit again and if I do I would definitely be trying out other items other than the egg skillets."}
{"text":"I've came here for dinner and brunch, with a cute little patio out front, its a good space to sit away from busy king street. 

The dinner menu is much better. The sperlani fried smelts were ok, on the greasy side and could be crispier. The porchetta sandwich was good though, the pork was flavorful and juicy, and it got messy eating it as the juice and oil rolls down your hands. Would love to come back to try their pasta dishes. 

For brunch i got the ever hyped truffle eggs. The food came out really cold, barely any cheese although there a good amount of truffles. The pomodoro heirloom tomato sandwich was good but nothing special at all, felt like something you could easily make yourself. Their cannoli was soggy and didn't feel fresh, i was really disappointed in brunch. 

With so many other italian choices in the area, you can easily choose somewhere else."}
{"text":"Holy pretentious!  It's been a long while since I felt as put off by restaurant service as I was at this place.   The food was good, but I won't return.  Here's how it went down.   

We wandered in here on our morning walk looking for a Sunday morning breakfast.  We'd stopped at Starbucks a ways back and I still had maybe a 3rd of a refresher drink in my hand when we arrived.  We were greeted by someone behind the counter and told to sit anywhere.  So far so good.   And then it started.  First, it took quite a while for anyone to wait on us - to the point where we started to wonder whether they offered table service or we were supposed to go to the counter to order.  The server who finally came over was super-snooty, with his first order of business to change out the cup the remainder of my starbucks drink was in.  \"Simply can't have that in here.\", he said with a blasphemous tone.  Ok, fine.   

The menu of breakfast options was pretty limited and there were no traditional breakfast options, so we each went with the uova al pomodoro.  I also ordered a bombolone (no description on the menu, but Yelpers recommended it, so I figured I'd give it a try).  

Our original server was far more interested in playing with the espresso machine than actually waiting on us, so it took forever to get our food.  An entire table of people who came in after us got their food and the boyfriend was served a cup of terrible burnt coffee, and then our original server abandoned us altogether.  After several minutes of us staring at our food in the window, another server finally brought it out with an air of annoyance and a lackluster warning about the dishes being hot.  She returned to refill waters that had been empty for some time and offered the prefunctory \"how is everything?\".  I said \"good\" and the boyfriend said \"eh\".  She ignored both comments and walked off.  I actually did enjoy the meal, but the boyfriend was unimpressed with the combination and was longing for more meat than the couple scraps of prosciutto that were offered as a garnish.   

New server came to clear dishes and asked if we needed anything else.  I asked for the bombolone that I'd ordered up front and she seemed surprised.  Another very long wait while we waited for the crème to settle or something and it finally appeared.   It too was good, but by then, I was so aggravated by the pompous servers that it was hard to enjoy it.  I finished it and waited impatiently for the check, which (no surprise) took forever.  

Not ok, Buca.  Not ok."}
{"text":"Had the porchetta sandwich, it was so oily large grease stains were left on the newspaper I was reading.  Couldn't finish it as it was so greasy. The coffee required to wash it down was delicious however!"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on Sunday and it was way off the mark. While the ambiance is nice, it was moderately loud and you may be asked to share a table with another group. That didn't bother us really -- the fail point was that they were out of so much stuff and the waitress didn't let us know before we spent a good ten minutes with the menu. No steak. Shoot.

The other failpoint was how their trout brunch menu item is basically like a few bits of fish and citrus. It's definitely not an entree and more of an appetizer. While the waitress did seem to communicate that a tad, I think we definitely expected something different.

The egg dish with the bread was pretty good and tasty and the winner, but portion-wise it also wasn't super filling, but the eggs were perfect. My goat meat focaccia sandwich was decent and tasty -- but I left the meal a bit hungry..I do think maybe we got unlucky with the amount of things they were out of and I do think the chef can cook...I just think the more appetizer-y items should be more clearly labeled and explained."}
{"text":"Came in for breakfast around 7:30am. Was surprised to find several people having meetings over coffee! Immediately after walking in, the barista kindly asked me what I wanted to drink and after ordering, I seated myself on the comfortable leather high chairs at one of the tables. The place gets pretty packed if you want to sit down around 8am but the servers assume that you're there for just coffee. We had to try and get the waitress' attention to get served which was a little hassle. We ordered the al orno and uova al pomodoro and it was seasonedbeautifully (slightly salty), Itaian style, with perfectly baked yolk-porn eggs. Mmm mmm good! The coffee had a good shot of espresso but not too intense which was also lovely. Would come back for breakfast again, the pastries also looked delicious."}
{"text":"Bar Buca, the one year old spot by Chef Rob Gentile from the original Buca just across across the street, is serving a cool Italian-inspired take on brunch. Departing from the good ol' bennies and steak and eggs most outlets offer, Chef Gentile focuses his craft on eggs, using high quality ingredients and introducing new flavours and nose-to-tail type proteins to otherwise traditional egg skillets.

On the lighter side, one can find in the Uova Strapazette a subtle yet delicious take on eggs and cheese. Gentile carefully mixes fresh farm turkey, goose and duck eggs with burrata cheese and truffles, then tops it all off with basil leafs. Accompanied with 2 slices of grilled ciabatta bread, this dish was one of my favourites at Bar Buca.

Bar Buca updates their menu every so often, dishes come and go, but the flavour and technique always remain. When I visited this spot, I was privy to trying the chef's take on caprese-style eggs. These are farm eggs once again that are mixed with mozzarella cheese, a light tomato sauce and topped with crispy pieces of mortadella. Now I don't believe they have this item on the menu anymore, but at least you know you can always count on the chef to explore with new menu items.

The last item on the condensed Bar Buca menu we got to try was the Ammazza Fegato. A Tuscan offal sausage with faro (aka wheat grains), porcini mushrooms topped with a poached farm egg and crispy kale (cavolo nero). The dish is extremely greasy on the palate but has flavour and punch like no other. I'd recommend as a good hang-over morning meal.

Last but probably the most important part of our meal, the Nutella Croissant. A decadent, sweet and tasty treat to accompany any brunch meal. The croissant is fluffy yet crunchy, dusted off with chocolate powder and the nutella is lukewarm on bite. Be prepared for messy fingers and lip-licking goodness.

Buen Provecho,
Viviana."}
{"text":"Tried Bar Buca tonight for date night... ahhh delicious! We will be back for sure. Everything from service to share plates to flavour was spot on. We came at 5:30 and they have an Aperitif menu from 4-7 where you get a drink and a small bites plate for $10. We both had the Riesling and I ordered the garden vegetable in oil while my boyfriend ordered hand pulled mozzarela. OMG. The mozzarella was the best I've ever had. We asked our server for suggestions and she was very helpful.  We ordered burrata, porchetta stuffed foccacia, scallop and brussel sprouts. The burrata was amazing, portion was pretty big and it was so fresh. Great to share between 3-4 people (its a big portion so the 2 of us were quite full). The scallop, you could probably skip because it was quite small and not for sharing. The focaccia could be a meal on its own for 1... we kind of over ordered but we left full and satisfied and the meal was well priced! Cant wait to come back here again and try more dishes."}
{"text":"Can't say I'm a fan. Totally forgot to review but was reminded cause Winterlicious is coming up. I made reservations for 5 people a while back during Summerlicious promotion based on a phone convo with staff at the resto. They said they did Licious on weekend and I was surprised because I was told differently in the past. Thought, yay maybe they changed the policy this time. Nope. Not until we arrived did staff say no, it's only weekdays. I was like I asked and even double checked with staff when I made my reservation. Even told them to note that I am doing a Licious menu. So clearly that wasn't communicated or written down. Nothing was done about that, just a \"oh sorry, what do you want me to do?\" vibe. 

My dining party stayed because we made the trek to the resto but I already had a bad impression cause of this. It was basically embarrassing for me because my dining companions had to change what they were planning to order and adjust what they were going to spend. To top it off, food was very oily. Like tilt the pan in an angle and see 3 table spoons worth of oil come out. Had to use napkin to soak. I tried their regular menu item Stuffed Focaccia and Uova Rossa dish. 

We bumped into another table that one of my friends knew who were also misinformed by staff that licious would happen on weekend. So it was not just me, the staff who took calls during that time was giving wrong information out.

If you decide to go here for a licious event, please know they do not do weekends. If any staff tell you differently, please be sure to write down the staffers name with date and time of when you booked reservations so they can be held accountable."}
{"text":"You really have to be an adventurous eater if you check this place out.  I had the pig cheeks, head, beef hearts, some other stuff.

It was really tasty but we have to wait 30-40 mins when we were told 15...kind of put us in a sour mood but I'd go back and check it out again."}
{"text":"I've really been trying to go here and when we were in the area, had to stop by at least for dessert.

First, the patio doesn't serve alcohol. But that was ok as it wasn't what I was after. This americano though was fantastic, was a great apertif to end the night off.

But it was the cannoli I was after. They piped it fresh for us and it had these candied oranges sticking out of it, some nut within the ricotta. It was the perfect way to end off the night.

We also tried a few other desserts too, the Bombolone, which is just a fancy way of saying doughnut. The filling was green because it was lime flavor. I really liked it even though it was a doughnut, the lime flavor was fantastic.

Here is what stood out though. The waiter was really friendly, helpful in explaining all the desserts in words we don't understand. He came around refilling water and bantered jokes with us but not too intrusively.

It was a delight and I can't wait to try what else this place has to offer. If the brunch is as great as just the desserts, this will easily be a 5!"}
{"text":"This place is really nice and have awesome environment for date or friends hang out.. It has a super hip deco..

The only thing I would complain a little is just the price seems to be a bit expensive for the portion of the food they served.. The portions are quite small since this restaurant is mostly for people to come here grab a quick bit and drink.. 

But overall, it was a great experience, me and my friend had a really good time."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots in Toronto! Brunch is amazing. Definitely a coffee snob and this place has the best latte."}
{"text":"Great decor inside and in the summer it's nice to sit on the patio. Pricey food and drinks but it's expected. Not somewhere I look forward to going back to, nothing stood out. Nice staff though."}
{"text":"Good services quality food amazing opened kitchen fabulous wine selection and unique cocktail"}
{"text":"I went for brunch with my friends this weekend. It wasn't really busy, but we sat there for over 20mins until our waiter showed up to take our order. He messed up my order twice and still served the wrong food. I didn't even bother to let him change my food at the end. Another blond waitress was giving us cold eyes the entire time. 
My friend ordered salmon, the portion was just pathetic with an average taste. Really unworthy for $16 dollars. She then ordered a donut, but we got told that it was sold out after half an hour. 
The whole experience was irritating. I was left with disappointment as I was informed they would have great service. Also, hire people with a milder Italian accent so that it's easier to get what they are saying. 
The bar looked pretty neat and delightful. Their coffee was probably the only thing I didn't despise."}
{"text":"I've been to Bar Buca many times for both brunch and dinner. The food never disappoints and the service is generally pretty good. 

My friend and I decided to stop by for some after-dinner snacks. We were served by a young fellow named Jon, and I was very impressed with his service. He was very thorough with the menu and took the time to describe the dishes and make food recommendations. When we were debating over what food items to get, Jon helped to guide us - in terms of spiciness (my friend doesn't eat spicy), in terms of balance (we had initially unknowingly picked all bread-based items), and in terms of flavour (he explained what order the food would arrive in order for the flavours to not clash). I really appreciated his attention to detail and it really felt like he cared about our experience tonight. We had frequent water fills, table cleaning, plate changes, and napkin replacements (even though our napkins were barely dirty!).

We ended up ordering the nodini, nero di seppia, and zucca. 

The nodini are bread knots, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, drizzled with olive oil, rosemary, and garlic. I could eat these every day. They are a must-get item every time I visit Buca or Bar Buca. 

The nero di seppia is a dish of king oyster mushroom and calamari rings in squid ink with soft polenta and gremolata. This dish was delicious - the calamari was very tender, and the gremolata imparted fresh garlic taste to the polenta and squid ink. 

The zucca were battered and fried zucchini with buffalo ricotta and wildflower honey, with fried prosciutto bits. This reminded me of tempura zucchini, except the batter was much lighter and crispier. The honey added a nice touch of sweetness and was the perfect way to end our snacking.

(They don't have a dessert menu; they just have daily pastries and cookies.) 

Thank you, Jon, for providing such a stand-out experience tonight. We left happy and satisfied and will be sure to return again!"}
{"text":"Took a friend here yesterday afternoon to take her mind off losing her job in the morning...plus we had already planned an early evening here.

Two glasses of rose prosecco in everything started to look better....and the food was delicious. Had the mushroom and duck egg yold bruschetta, the fried artichokes...and a few other dishes. Everything was on point and the service was engaging and prompt. Love it!"}
{"text":"Came here on Friday and it exceeded my expectations. The cocktails are very delicious! And the food is amazing (at least what we had). We had the porchetta sandwich, this dish that had pasta shells filled with spinach, ricotta and tomato sauce on top and short rib skewers. Everything was fantastic. I also had a chance to try a latte and it blew me away. Probably some of the best coffee I've ever had. The service was great, knowledgeable and friendly. One thing I don't like about their set up is that all of their tables are shared tables. So basically if you're two, you will be sat with another two people at the same table. This pretty much guarantees no privacy and obviously not a good place to come on a first or second date. However, we got seats at the bar.. more privacy and a view of the kitchen. All in all, I would definitely return."}
{"text":"Amazing food....somewhat diverse....my kind of place.....and the zepolle....OMG....fresh baked and served to us warm!!!!!"}
{"text":"Not the most noticeable place, but it's definitely worth the attention! Friend and I got the baked eggs and we wolfed them down. Seems super simple to make! Definitely recommend. Their croissants also come in a variety of fillings, in every which way you would prefer.
Something interesting that I hadn't seen in many places: There's this espresso/sugar compote they have on the tables that are supposed to mix well cappuccinos and other drinks with foam, so it won't cut through the foam."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! Very small place which was very difficult to find when passing by. You have to really pay attention to the sign which is beside an underground parking.

You get to sit wherever you want on high tables and chairs. Staffs are friendly to greet and serve you. 

They have a wide selection of great wine to let you choose from. Most of their wine are imported so you can't find them at LCBO. They have a small open kitchen where you can see what's going on.

The porchetta focaccica was my favorite. Bread was lightly toasted. Porchetta well seasoned with full flavor when you take a bite into it. 

I would definitely suggest to give it a try if you're looking for a small place for good food and wine."}
{"text":"I will say the coffee and the in house, espresso foam sugar thing was fantastic. That is a 5 star coffee. I was quite thrilled by the java experience .*****

I came there for the food. Surprisingly, let me down on several levels. To begin with, they brought me the wrong order. The waiter apologized for it but the wait for the correction was excessive for both items. I was disappointed because although I had been occupied with working on something while I waited even then I felt like they must have forgotten about me. I don't think two oven baked dishes should arrive before I get an americano. That was a bit ridiculous regardless of how good a brew is. Even the gentleman beside me, who came after received his stuff before me.

When my Uva Pomodoro finally arrived. The toast it came with was charred. I could smell it. You know, when you have burnt toast and scraped it off? The crust was black. ( the bread on the original dish they brought was just fine so this char is not the norm). I pulled off what I could but by then I had no patience and lost my appetite. The dish itself was mediocre in comparison to the variety of baked eggs I've eaten. This fell far flat on flavour, expectation and execution."}
{"text":"Service excellent. Food excellent. Atmosphere excellent. 

Bar Buca is a recent Italian American addition to this area, made possible by the King Street Food Company.  Having previously worked for Jacob's Steakhouse, I know the level of standards for KSFC are set very high. You will know what I mean when you walk into Bar Buca and are immediately greeted by Bar staff. 

We ordered Manhattans, they came accompanied by excellent complimentary aperitivo snacks. The prices are what you would expect for the quality; reasonable, in my opinion. 

There is a lot of imagination in the design of this tiny space. They maximize the area very well, and use the materials of the building to create soothingly simple, visual effects. An example of this are the walls being exposed concrete. You can also tell they spent a good amount of time on the lighting and sound acoustics. Although there are plenty of hard surfaces, the noise remains at a pleasantly soft decimal."}
{"text":"Every time I've been to this place it's been amazing. Trying  their different dishes and tasting all the flavourful food is reasons to keep on coming back. Great place for a late night snack as well."}
{"text":"Came back to try the Summerlicious dinner menu $28 +$13 for a nice Chianti wine. We sat outside as it was pretty packed, walk-in only. ~30 minute wait. 

Starters - choice of 2. I had the albacore tuna crudo - nice presentation, prefer the arctic char crudo from the regular menu but still good. Polenta - glad I tried this! Fried, crispy, spicy bite sized pieces, topped with pecorino cheese. Not too soggy/heavy on the cornmeal. 

Main - Porchetta Schiacciata, a pork sandwich. Not a big fan of pork, but I loved the bread. Pesto-type sauce was nice, along with some sweetness from the apples.

Desserts - choice of 2. Torta Cioccolatino - loved this chocolate brownie! Soft, moist, rich and dense in the right way. Amaretti Arancione - an orange flavored almond cookie. 

Overall my favorites were the polenta and brownie - the surprises of the night."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Buca so obviously I had to try this place. There were two of us, and we ordered the bone marrow, baby octopus, meatballs, rabbit loin with egg, the arctic char and some wine. We were hungry, can you tell? I gotta say - from Buca to this is a pretty big change, it's not as good as Buca. They have a wide variety of italian wine and limited seating. The place can MAYBE fit 30 people. It's more of a place to have a few snacks and drinks, not so much for a meal. I think for the price, the quality was only so-so. I might be back for wine but not so much for food. 
I'd like to add, that I sat at the bar, and the waitress/bar tender was really nice and pleasant to talk to. She made our experience really pleasant so four stars for her, but food is closer to 3 stars.."}
{"text":"If you happen to be traveling alone this a great place for you. I've been here with lively groups but on my own I can sit at the bar where you can watch the open kitchen make magic. What a delight. This is truly one of Toronto's best. The menu changes every couple of weeks so it's always an exciting culinary experience! The staff can also recommend wine pairing. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Here's a recap of what we ate (I don't have the exact descriptions for all the dishes, sorry).

~ PORCHETTA STUFFED FOCACCIA: roast tuscan pork, mascarpone, apple mostarda, agliata
My friend really enjoyed this dish and the waitress told us it was one of the popular items on the menu. As for me, I found it way too salty. The salt level in the focaccia overpowered the pork and I couldn't taste any of those other elements. The focaccia was super crispy, which is always nice. But damn, the salt! I couldn't eat my half and only ate a quarter of it (\"Gasp! For shame!\", \"I know I know...\")

~ POLIPO (BABY OCTOPUS) SKEWERS: baby octopus, soppressata, crema di patate.
The octopus had a nice grilled taste to it. The soppressata (italian salami) was spicy and delicious. However, I didn't feel like the flavours were a good combination. They didn't complement one another and should just be two separate dishes.

~ EGGPLANT cannelloni stuffed with ricotta cheese in a tomato base sauce...? Sorry I forgot to note the description of this new dish down from the menu and it's not listed on their website. 
This dish took the longest for them to bring out... That, or they forgot to make it and remembered an hour later. We didn't like this dish one bit. The texture was too slimy yet stringy... And because it's soft cheese stuffed within a soft eggplant roll, it doesn't seem to make sense texture wise.  The whole dish was just MUSH. We weren't a fan of it. The waitress later came by and asked what we thought of it since it's NEW on the menu... Some feedback for the chef. We did tell her we didn't enjoy it. It's too bad.  Nothing was done about it though :o(

~ BREADING PUDDING DESSERT: I can't remember what was in it... But it definitely wasn't my favourite bread pudding out there. The flavours weren't traditional, but I also wouldn't order it again. It's not terrible or anything, I still ate my share. Unfortunately this was the only dessert they offered that night, excluding the pastries they had by the door. 

~ SERVICE: It started off really well. Our waitress recommended wines for us and seemed knowledgeable (more than me at least!). I should note that we arrived early on a Friday night at 5:30pm where the place was still pretty vacant.  Halfway through the dinner, we had to wait a long time for our eggplant dish and our waitress was difficult to track down. They also switched our waitress at some point too it seemed. The level of service was still friendly, but just slow. We left at 7:30pm in a rush to get to our theatre show; FYI - the restaurant was more packed but still had a few vacant tables. Who knew it would take 2 hours to eat at a tapas bar for a party of 2? That's how long the wait was for that eggplant... :o( 

~ OVERALL: This was my first time here, so I do I want to give them another chance as I've heard good things. The food didn't impress me all that much, but I might give it another shot. I much prefer Bar Centrale (sister restaurant of Terroni) if you're ever up at Summerhill. The tapas dishes there are really delicious and rarely miss the mark like Bar Buca did for me that night."}
{"text":"Super friendly people great breakfast and one of a kind coffee drinks. I had my coffee with elderberry honey which was super tasty.   What a gem!"}
{"text":"I'm usually not one for artisnal fare for breakfast, but I was convinced to stop in for brunch recently and I ended up being quite impressed. The prices were more reasonable than my prejudices has led me to expect, and the food was excellent."}
{"text":"get the beets, they are amazing. so are the desserts. so are the deep fried pigs head and porchetta sandiwch and the tiny garlic bread balls.

i'll stop yelling now, flailling my arms with enthusiasm and just say. it's really good. a wonderful spot for a nice casual dining and drinking affair."}
{"text":"On a previous trip to Toronto we visited the more expensive Buca just up the street from Bar Buca and we had a really positive experience since they were able to seat us with no reservation and the service and food was great. Wanting the same type of food but a little less expensive we tried Bar Buca and were pretty disappointed. 

The food was pretty good with lots of interesting options. However, the poor service overshadowed the good food and ruined our experience. We were seated right away since it wasn't too busy and there were free tables on the patio. But after being seated no one came to see us for a good five minutes. We didn't want to order a bunch of stuff all at once since we weren't sure how big the plates would be and we weren't too hungry. This was probably a mistake since it was very difficult to get anyone's attention. All the wait staff seemed to be ignoring us but were attentive to the other tables. They would come and clear the empty plates of tables right beside us, literally 2 inches away but avoid even looking at us. Wanting to leave I asked for the bill on the way to the washroom since no one was coming to see us even though we were just sitting there with empty wine glasses. When the waiter came with the bill he didn't even let us see it, instead he just punched in the total to the machine and handed it to us. He was quite rude even though I politely asked for the bill earlier. We got out of there pretty fast since they obviously didn't want us there."}
{"text":"One a week, forever I go here. Perfect at 7am or 7am. Prices are generally reasonable, though smaller fare (pastries) can be pricey relative to size but, I think, much is made in-house. Food is always flavourful

Get to know all the staff they are so friendly. Come alone or bring a group. I've never waited longer than 10-15minutes for a table."}
{"text":"Went for brunch. Had a tea, a Bellini, al forno (eggs, ricotta, pesto), and a cannoli. 

Everything was very very very good -- Bellini was okay. Would not get that again but would definitely re-do everything else. 

Staff were great. Attentive, professional and pleasant. 

Very clean dining area and kitchen. Bathrooms were also clean."}
{"text":"Great food at affordable price. Been here for brunch and dinner in the summer time. For dinner, tried the squid, meatball. For brunch, had the duck eggs. Both times were fantastic!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice now, and both times: post-gym + almost walked past it + went through the awkward exchange of \"sitting wherever there's a space but still letting a server know of your existence to get a menu\" + ordered the Porchetta sandwich. 

If you're in the area, don't expect great service or ample seating, but I'd say stop by for this delicious sandwich. On my first visit, I was running late for a meeting, had half of it packed up, and opened up my goodie box an hour later. One of the true hallmarks of a sandwich? If it tastes good later too, and this one passed the test."}
{"text":"Bumped into Buca by chance while walking around King St/Fashion district and had an amazing dinner...Definitely coming back! The albacore crudo and the orange salad were delicious! I ordered the vitello parmigiana which was also superb. The biscotti and chocolate tart where excellent and the right small size... paired with a cappuccino! Cool ambiance open kitchen bar and outside seating."}
{"text":"Thank you for a great late night meal. Service was pleasant. 

Zucchini flowers - yum!
Baby octopus skewers - yum!
Nodini - hot hot hot! Don't burn your mouth. My friend likes it a lot. 
n'duja  - hot hot hot - way to end late night snacking. 

Gotta love my partner in crime for finding a late night kitchen with me"}
{"text":"As a New Yorker spending much of his time in Toronto the last several years, I would call Bar Buca the best meal I have had in Canada. The entire experience was phenomenal and I would highly recommend. Some of my faves were the baby octopus, the beef heart, and any of the schiacciatas."}
{"text":"Went there by myself on a Friday night. Lovely place, sat on the counter which is great for going alone. I ordered a cocktail don't remember the name but it had gin and grapefruit, it was great! I ordered de focaccia with pork that everyone loves, the bread was absolutely fantastic and the meat too, what i didn't like was the sweet taste of the apple, it was too sweet for me, but overall it was REALLY good. I ordered for dessert the croissant with Nutella.. OVERATED! They served  it cold! It would have been a huge plus if they served it hot. The Nutella was good on the bread but the bread wasn't THAT great. I think the problem is that it is served cold, I could prefer to eat the one they sell in Starbucks served hot."}
{"text":"Intimate,  expensive and really good drinks! I stumbled (literally) in here during bar hopping Thursday on King West. At first,  I was a bit intimidated by the older, quieter crowd, but we decided to stay and check this place out. 

I've never sat on higher bar stools in my life. Short girl problems. I'm pretty sure I experienced 0.2 seconds of free falling when I dismounted my seat for a bathroom break. 

Our waiter was super friendly and knowledgeable about the drink menu. I ordered a bellini, made with prosecco and freshly squeezed peach juice, made in house. Apparently all of their juices are made in house too. And you could definitely taste the difference. My friends were also pleased with their drinks. 

I also ordered one of those friend donut things and to my surprise,  it was filled with a creme or custard that was really good! Bad thing was that the donut cost $4.00!

I definitely want to come back here to try the rest of menu, maybe on a special occasion or if my boyfriend pays. Ha!"}
{"text":"Now I'm sure their sandwiches look deleesh, and the nice ambience, date worthy and business lunch....but their sugar big donut with custard, just meh.

Maybe I expected the Boston Cream filling lol.

Nice guy though, he knew his menu."}
{"text":"I organized a bachelorette party two weeks ago in Toronto. I called a few places to try to make brunch reservations for 10 people and apparently reservations are hard to come by. I called Bar Buca and they guy on the phone said they don't take reservations but that there was a bar our group could hang out at while we waited. He was very friendly and totally influenced my decision to eat there with my friends.

The place was small and cozy and not crowed. The staff was overly friendly and the food was amazing. You could see the food being prepared in front of you and each dish was crafted with consideration. I got the eggs with burrata and truffle oil. My friends ordered breakfast sandwiches and it was all delicious. Every person in our group left full and impressed by the food and service."}
{"text":"Small and intimate setting with some delicious taps. The big reason is am giving s lower value is the $$. It is so high and, I think not worth it."}
{"text":"It is easy to overlook this place, but if you do , you will be missing a great experience. We went there for brunch. Simple short menu. Everything we ordered was original tasty and enjoyable. Items are coming as they are ready an not at the same time. The service was also professional and friendly."}
{"text":"Came here this past weekend for brunch. Their brunch is until 4pm so it's perfect if you had a late night the night before. We ordered the porcetta sandwich and uova strapazzate (eggs, burrata and truffle). Both were really delicious, and I would totally go back and order the same thing. The porcetta sandwich is pretty big, so would recommend sharing the sandwich.  I ordered a fresh orange juice and my boyfriend ordered the bicerin (espresso, chocolate and cream). Very good meal overall and will definitely go back and try other items on their menu."}
{"text":"I came here for a summerlicious dinner double date with my best friend about a week and half ago on a Saturday night around 6pm. They don't take summerlicious reservations but it was only about a 20 minute wait at that time, which we didn't mind at all. The manager was nice and introduced himself to us in the first few minutes we got there, he checked on us during the wait and even seated us when it was our turn.

We were happy with all the courses of our summerlicious dinner - only $28+ tax and tip per person too! We got one of each appetizer: polenta, testa (pig's head), albacore tuna and fruit salad. For entrees, we got the milanese veal and porchetta sandwiches, which were a good portion and filling. For desserts, we tried each of the cookies and biscottis. Everything was delicious!

The ambience was nice and they have many different types of wine as part of their decor by the open kitchen and bar area. Great experience here! I will definitely be back to try their regular menu at some point!"}
{"text":"I came here one morning after a spin class, my friend had suggested we go here. What a great suggestion!  The breakfast I had was beyond amazing. A sampling of savoury and sweet. Grilled truffled bread with egg, mushrooms was delicious. I still think about it, because it was sooo good!  There was also a selection of pastries and cookies. I topped it off with a latté. The espresso spuma sugar, I wanted to steal a jar it was so good. 

The servers were friendly,  the space even though small was open, warm and fresh. I'd definitely come back for a drink, hot, cold, with or without alcohol."}
{"text":"I don't know how one might not love this place. The combination of delicious food made of quality fresh produce and warm and personable service creates a great atmosphere and keeps me coming back again and again."}
{"text":"We ordered 6 plates to share between two of us. Our server was knowledgeable. The food was delicious. The atmosphere was warm and inviting. No complaints.  

And for less than $10, you can (and should) do yourself a favour and order the garlic bread knots and pig head. Mmm."}
{"text":"I came here for brunch with a few of my girlfriends on a Sunday. The place was not busy at all which was good because we didn't make a reservation. The place itself was hard to look for because the sign of the company was not very visible.

Precilla C and I decided to share the stuffed focaccia porchetta and uova strapazzate.

The stuffed focaccia porchetta ($12) had roasted Tuscan pork, farm eggs and mostarda. Good thing we shared this dish because it would've been too filling for one person! It's quite a heavy dish and I would suggest sharing it. We had porchetta in the past and we found that it was very dry. I am happy to report that this was not the case for this sandwich. The sandwich was delicious especially with the thin slices of apple to balance the savory meat. One thing to note is that it was extremely oily and I felt slightly sick after eating it.

The uova strapazzate ($14) was a mixed variety of farm eggs, burrata and truffle. This is a fairly light dish and great for sharing as well. It came with a very hard piece of bread but it was perfect when paired with the very wet dish.

I'm curious to try their other restaurant because I enjoyed the dishes at this restaurant so much."}
{"text":"It was just ok. I was so excited by the descriptions of the dishes but was rather disappointed by their bland flavours. We ordered the pigs head (too fatty tasting), ewe skewers (bland and chewy), squid in ink (ok but you got the feeling it was missing something), and baby octopus (best one as it was very tender). 

The patio was nice and quiet. It was a great place to chit chat with friends. We moved inside later and found it too smoky (they need to fix their exhaust!) and the music too loud to hear each other.

Kudos to the servers who were attentive and pleasant."}
{"text":"Hard to find, worth the search. 

We walked by this place 3 times. There is just a small sign in the window and this was only half lit on the morning we went. The breakfast portions were more than ample, especially if you plan to get any baked goods. I had a nice eggs dish with home made bread. Our waiter was very personable and helpful with the menu.

A unique espresso additive was their house made frothed espresso and sugar. It added a thicker consistency and subtle sweetness to straight espresso. 

We had a Nutella pastry that was really a Nutella bomb. It meant well but was a little too much for us."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and it's one of my fave places to eat in the area. Food is always excellent and service here is better than most places on King West - consistently friendly and efficient. Good cocktails, good wine, good food, good service, good vibe. What's not to like?"}
{"text":"I went there for winterlicous lunch with coworkers.  http://www.toronto.com/articles/bar-buca-winterlicious-menu/ For $18 I got 5 plates.


Food (4 stars):
Appetizers: 
  I got Testa (crisp pig's head with a few spices): 5 stars - very delicious
  I also got Nodini (bread knots with rosemary and garlic): 3 stars - nothing special
Main Course: 
  Nero Di Seppia (Quaid in ink with king mushrooms): 4 stars - it was good, I chose it since it was the only option with some meat. 
Desert:
  Cannoli Siciliani (5 stars) - amazing tasty
  Torta Cioccolatino (4 stars) - good, but cannot compare to Cannoli 


Service (5+ stars):
Very friendly and proper staff.  Very polite and knowledge about the food.  One of the people I was with was vegetarian, and the waiter came back after the order to let us know that Cannoli Siciliani is baked in pork fat, and asked if he wanted to switch the order.
The staff was always present and was refilling our water glasses on regular basis.  

Atmosphere (5 stars): 
Very cozy.  The place is not very large, so it is not great for large groups, but great for a few people to talk over small bites.

I would recommend it for a place to catch up with people."}
{"text":"I went for dinner and loved the atmosphere. The place was bustling but it was not overwhelming. I went there early on a Friday night and had no problems finding a seat. They do not take reservations!

As for the food, you HAVE TO get the Porchetta. If you go here and do not get this, you are missing out on life. It was the perfect balance. There was crisp from the roasted pork, the apple mostarda gave it a bit of tang and sweetness. I am drooling just thinking about it! It is a MUST.

Besides that, I got the beef short ribs shower which was also a hit! I got their sausage dish (I forgot the name), it definitely had the potential to be delicious; it had crispy kale, king oyster mushrooms and a perfectly cooked egg but the sausage was way way way way way too salty. I couldn't handle it. 

I would definitely come back just for the porchetta stuffed focaccia and to try their other items!"}
{"text":"Great place for lunch and dinner!  The porchetta sandwich on brunch is probably my favorite on the menu but everything is pretty good.  The appetizers at dinner are all delicious as well. Short ribs are great and the cocktails are fabulous too (they're best based)"}
{"text":"*the restaurant opens as early as 7AM and as late as 2AM (!), thus there will always be something here for everybody at any time of the day.

*I have been here twice at different times and the service has always been impeccable - very attentive and professional. 

*Though the portions were quite small, the food was incredibly fresh and the prices were appropriate for the quality and richness of the food.

-Caffee Bombon (Espresso, dulce de leche) - $5.50
If there's anyone who likes sweet coffee, this caffee bombon is for you. Normally the bombon is made with condensed milk but the barista at Bar Buca used dulce de leche instead.

-Uova Rossa (duck egg yolk, bay scallop, pine nuts, crisp prosciutto, scallion) - $13
The egg here is a bit more \"wet\" and runny than your normal omelette. Gently mix the egg with some scallop, then tops it all off with some crunchy prosciutto and pine nuts. Accompanied with 2 slices of grilled bread, this dish was one of my favorites at Bar Buca. Everything was perfectly seasoned and went well together, there was an explosion of flavors in my mouth.

-stuffed focaccia porchetta -$12 
It's quite a heavy dish and I would suggest sharing it as the sandwich would've been too filling for one person! Though it was quite oily, the sandwich had a perfect balance between savoury and sweetness. There was moist, delicious roast pork between crispy, fluffy focaccia with a tangy apple mostarda to balance the savoury meet. I am drooling just thinking about it...

-Cannoli - $2.95
The cannoli was also another reason why I felt in love with Bar Buca. It had a delicate, crispy shell with light yet creamy filling. There was also a lovely citrus hints from the candied orange and pistachio within the ricotta. It was the perfect way to end the meal!"}
{"text":"The food & selection (4/5): Nice and wide brunch selections.
    
-Uova Rossa (duck egg yolk, bay scallop, pine nuts, crisp prosciutto and scallion with bread): We started with this egg skillet. It's almost like an omelette and it wasn't too heavy even though it was mostly egg yolk. The scallops, prosciutto and scallions all worked really well with the eggs.
-Tigelle (bolognese skillet bun, pistachio mortadella, guanciale and agliata): It's like a little English muffin but better! The crispy exterior worked really well with the moist centre, especially with that runny egg yolk. It was just heavenly!!
-Porchetta Schiacciata (roast tuscan pork, eggs, mascarpone, apple mostarda and agliata on focaccia bread): It's an incredibly greasy dish but it was absolutely tasty. The focaccia was crispy which was perfect with the eggs and the juicy porchetta. Packed half of it to go since we ordered a tad bit too much, and it still tasted really good after reheating it in the oven. 

Cost (3.5/5): Around $40 for two. Considering we were really full and had to pack up some of our food to go, it wasn't bad.

Service (4/5): Staffs were friendly when we were looking for food suggestions. We had a much better sense of what to get in terms of the portions and the different choices after their explanation, and we were certainly not disappointed with what we ended up getting. 

Ambience (4/5): The interior is nice and spacious, and wasn't too loud. It's certainly a great place to hang out with friends on a lazy Sunday. They also have a nice little patio outside for the summer."}
{"text":"4 stars for the service and the cappuccino. 3 stars for the food. 

My boyfriend and I just tried this sleek new bar with the intention of trying the buffalo milk cappuccinos. The result? They were absolutely delicious, but pricey. A cappuccino is $3 and the buffalo milk is an additional $3, so two cappuccinos came to $12 before tax and a tip. Would I buy one again? Maybe. 

We also tried two dishes - the octopus skewer and the burratta with pesto. The octopus came with sopressatta, which was overcooked and overwhelmed the delicate flavour of the octopus. It was only OK.

The buratta was delicious - creamy, flavourful and a delicious treat for 4:30 on a Friday afternoon. 

Would we come back? Maybe - I'd probably stop by and try a plain cappuccino sometime if I was in the area."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch, ordered some eggs, and had some eggs. There is nothing noteworthy about this place besides paying $14 for just eggs. Would much rather hop across the street and go to Portland Variety for a much more authentic brunch rather than an artificial Italian experience. 

On another note I watched the bartender spend almost 10 minutes making a rather intricate and intriguing looking drink which I might just have to come back to try."}
{"text":"The porchetta sandwich is handsdown a 5 especially with the crackling. Got the 5 things in the fritti and it was okay. The best is the pork face, everything else is just okay. The beef short rib skewer was pretty good as well. Apparently it gets braised for 12 hours before it gets grilled up. 

Maybe it was just cause it was 6pm. But its a weird sitch where you kinda just grab your own table like at a bar. And if you want dessert, you go up to the coffee/bar counter at the front and check out what they have instead of looking at a menu. Not sure why that is, but it makes for spotty service."}
{"text":"This place has service and espresso down pat. Absolutely deliciously smooth espressos, and everyone is kind and pleasant whenever I go! I have come here for a meal as well, and my burrata dish was flavourful and well-plated, and my friend really enjoyed his burger. The one reason I won't give Bar Buca 5 stars is because my husband once had an eggplant, red pepper focaccia sandwich to go, which he said was just plain bland and boring. Otherwise, I would absolutely recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"Amazing brunch spot! Found this place on Yelp and it didn't disappoint. Would definitely would recommend the pomodoro and uavo strapazzate."}
{"text":"food selection is not huge but quality is good and consistent. a place I would visit again"}
{"text":"This place is over rated and very unsatisfying. I was with my supper club which consists of 6 people. We left Bar Buca after spending $300 and went to get Chicken Shawarmas for $4 each which left us much happier than eating at this restaurant. Everything sounds tantalizing on the menu with the combination of flavours and they way it is worded, but execution, sub par. Serving sizes were too small and not well priced, the same also goes for the drinks, with the exception of the Wine since I ordered a glass of Chianti for $10. We ordered the tasting plates: Gran Fritto Misto, Assagani - okay, but too small. The Testa, Burrata di Buca, Carcofi Crudo, Barbaietole, Insalata Siciliana, Cuore di Manzo, Mozzarella Spiedini, Arrosticini, Polico, Quaglia, Vongole, Involtini, Salsicce Ciociare and Poplette di Capra (which is the only one we actually like). Oh wait, did I just say the whole menu? Service was slow and the cocktails were sub par. The only good thing was the beautiful decor. Honestly, I would never go back again...oh wait, I was being honest. Big thumbs down."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: small little spot beside the entrance of a condo building, kinda easy to miss. Tall chair table and bar seatings, not spacious, might be sharing tables if the place is busy.

Service: great service, friendly and attentive (we were at the bar seating)

Food: came here for their weekend brunch, and got cappuccino, the Al Forno and La Grande Colazione. Portions were small, but heavy and filling.

Cappuccino - really small cup, tasted good, no complain.

Al Forno - the cheese and pesto in the dish were pretty good and heavy with 3 eggs. There were not much in the dish but the high fattiness made it really filling.

La Grande Colazione - loved the sausage, not too heavy, and nicely spiced. My favourite part was the peperonata, it was like lightly sweet tomato stew, loved it. Tigella was nothing special, might've been better if it was toasted?

Overall: would come again in the future to try their sandwiches (saw many people order them)!"}
{"text":"I am going with 3.5 stars. 

Since this Buca doesn't take reservations I was a bit concerned. Thankfully, there was ample seating, probably because it was 6:30 pm on a Monday night!

It's quite a dark space, and the menus are printed in a tiny grey font on quite a flimsy piece of paper. My colleague and I squinted hard to read!

We ordered the stuffed focaccia, grilled cauliflower and brussel sprout skewers. The brussel sprout skewers were my favorite. The sprouts were slightly charred and crispy with what I thought were cushy mushroom bits in between but in fact was actually lard (I believe)! I enjoyed the smoky flavors and the contrasting textures. The cauliflower was a bit bland. My colleague and I are both suckers for spice, and were impressed by the hot sauce that our server brought to our table. The stuffed focaccia with peppers, onions, zucchini etc. was very filling.

I had two glasses of Chianti. They were out of my original choice. 

Service was friendly and attentive. 

Bar Buca has a fun atmosphere. It's a neat place for a casual meal."}
{"text":"Thank You Yelpers! This place lives up to every bit if the HYPE! I came here for brunch the friendly waiter spotted me right as I entered and seated me to a communal style table and at that moment my eyes went into a spiral. On my left and right were delicious entrées!! I ordered the Uova Strappazete (farm eggs, truffles etc) and a Latte Zenzero (zing of ginger, Cinamon etc) along with Bombolone (pastery stuffed with the most decadents cream ever). 

This place is trendy, friendly, and yummy!! I can't wait to come back here again and explore their menu further!!"}
{"text":"We went to Bar Buca for brunch on a Sunday. It is definitely a popular place - the patio was already full when we went around 10:30am, but plenty of seats inside. When we left an hour later, the place was already full.

It was weird walking in since there is no reception counter, so I had to flag a waitress down to get a seat. Upon seating, the service was a tad slow and this was true from getting the order, getting the item and the bill itself.

We ordered a latte each, and shared the porchetta stuffed foccacia, and the bistecca tagliata (steak and eggs). The focaccia was a very decent portion, and it was delicious. We would have been satisfied if we just split that. The steak and eggs was presented very well and cooked perfectly - steak was tender and juicy, and we liked the sunny-side up eggs and greens with it.

Overall, the food here was great and the service could be improved. I would give this place a 4 star rating."}
{"text":"Good food, delicious red wine, friendly service.

They say the plates are small and meant to be shared but I was full after the awesome sandwich I ordered (the porchetta stuffed focaccia sandwich).

Lunch was great, dinner was ok. I got the same thing actually (porchetta sandwich), but dinner time it was way saltier than it should've been. It seems like it could be hit or miss depending on who's working the kitchen.

My first visit was a 5-star, the second was a 3-star."}
{"text":"We came here accidentally. Meaning, there is a bar that sounds similar and that's where we meant to go but we wound up here. It was pretty late on a Saturday night so we weren't able to sit outside, but we sat at the bar. We were immediately given menus and I noticed there are a lot of options and the wine list is pretty extensive. 

I ordered bistecca (steak) and asked for it to be cooked to medium. The host/our server looked at me as if I personally offended him. I get that some cuts of steak are best cooked to certain temperatures but the menu didn't describe the cut of the steak. If it said hangar steak I would have known not to ask for it to be cooked to medium. At any rate, his reaction definitely made me stop and just order something else. We opted for the short rib skewers and the garlic knots. The short rib skewers were good. The meat was super tender and flavorful. But $12 for 2 skewers is kinda crazy, and they weren't even long skewers. It probably was about 3 bites of food. The garlic knots were hard, maybe overcooked, so they didn't really soak up any of the oil they served it with.

The service was ok, but I got the impression that this is a place where they are bougie for sure. After we left we just scrapped the evening and headed back to the hotel."}
{"text":"Expectations were perhaps too high based on my experience at Buca's other 2 outposts. All the dishes sounded promising but we were underwhelmed by half of them. Don't get me wrong, everything was good, just no comparison to either of his other restaurants."}
{"text":"Started with a brunch cocktail. Hey, why not?! I like to try original menu items. So i ordered the Sweet Pea Spritz with sweet pea juice, prosecco, soda and bitters. I must point out, you should like peas if you order this, but its delicious. I have had something like this before so that was a plus. It was fresh, bubbly and the perfect starter. Then i went to the Crudo. A simple yet extremely fresh, delicious and well presented dish with salmon, seasonal veggies and a lemon dressing. It was a light lunch, but perfect. A bit pricey, but I'll def shell out for quality, innovation and atmosphere. Will def be back here, after I try the parent restaurant, Buca."}
{"text":"The best Italian casual! Everything is delicious... I'm a regular for coffee and brunch"}
{"text":"Coffee 5 stars

I think I found my favourite coffee place in Toronto!  Unexpectedly i came here late at night thinking a typical bar and was pleasantly surprised with a great cup of coffee, upscale reinvented Italian bar food, and great vibrant atmosphere.

Off of Portland, Bar Buca can be seen by the dark emerald circle.  Once you walk in, the dimmed lighting, exposed concrete walls, and amazing wall of wine bottles just adds up to a great vibe.  The music was just the right amount.  We heard it can get very loud.  Seeing how the place was only half filled, it was not loud.  We can still hear the conversation.

The service was a warm friendly smile who was very helpful to tell us their favourites on the menu.  We ordered a porchetta focaccia sandwich (WOW, one of the best sandwich I've had in a long time.  Juicy tender pork, zesty & sweet mustard, and creamy marscapone made for one hell of a perfect bite) and zucca (lightly battered and super crispy zucchini coins with a tangy goat cheese and ricotta to compliment... well done, though it was a touch heavier once it cooled).  I was incredibly surprised by the quality and flavours.  Just well executed overall and very reasonably priced.  I would love to return for a full meal instead of just a late snack.

The coffee blew me away... I wasn't sure what I was expecting but the flavour, richness, and depth was surprising.  I loved how it wasn't overly sweet and could drink without any additional sugar.  We got the caffè con zabaglione latte (espresso with italian custard ... sooo soooo good) and caffè con zenzero latte (ginger syrup, cinnamon, and espresso).  They did have soy milk as an alternative.  Wow... just the flavours were very good.  And the prices were about the same as your corporate bland starbucks around the corner.  Definitely my favourite place for coffee now... I can't wait to try the ice blends or even their simple latte.

For a last sweet bite, we grabbed a few of the bakery items.  It was late (11 pm) and I knew these items were sitting out for the entire day and perhaps that's why didnt they fully shine compared to the rest of the menu.  We had the amaretti (sweetest of the bunch but perfect sweet almond note with a softer centre with the crisp meringue like shell), pizelle (think upscale ice cream cone but masquerading as a cookie sandwiching chestnut paste.  Great cookie that isnt overly sweet), and cannoli (this is where it kinda went not so good... the shell was mostly soggy but the marscapone interior was very good.  Creamy, indulgent, good balance with the candied orange to let it shine... I just wish we didnt get it so late).

Overall, this is a wonderful place to get very good food and phenomenal coffee in a great atmosphere without handing over many bills.  Definitely coming back and trying more."}
{"text":"Amazing eggs!! I love the brunch here, they have a big variety of morning cocktails. The bread is delicious and the staff is super friendly."}
{"text":"What a nice little spot for brunch! The food and coffee was great, as was the vibe, service however could definitely improve.

We both ordered an egg dish, his was with the rock shrimp and mine was with the truffle and buratta. Both were served with some bread drizzled with the best olive oil I've ever tasted. I wouldn't say these dishes were \"out there\" or adventurous but they hit the spot for a nice Saturday brunch. We also ordered the sampling of pastries, absolutely delicious and well worth it! You have to order this!

My espresso bombon was delicious and the man enjoyed his americano (though he really wanted his drip coffee). Their espresso machine is beautiful :)

Service, however, was a downer. Though it was a small space our water glasses were rarely filled. We sat with empty plates for awhile, though the server was looking our way. We had to ask for new napkins. It's the little things, you know? Absolutely forgivable but with the atmosphere they're trying to create...they might want to try harder in the service department."}
{"text":"This was place definitely not what I expected it to be.
I gotta say when I saw pictures on yelp, the food items looks a lot bigger than it actually was. Not sure if it was because of the angle or the zoom, or if they actually shrunk the sizes of their food items (which I really hope is not the case). 

I tried one of the cocktails that was lavender flavored, can't remember the name but they had me a Lavender. It was horrible, I couldn't even drink half of it. It felt like I was drinking lavender oil. I've had a way better lavender flavored cocktail elsewhere. What's frustrating was the cocktail was pretty expensive too, around $12+, totally not worth it.

Zucca ($8)
Our waitress really recommended this, but it really was just fried zucchini topped with prosciutto bits. Nothing special.

Burrata di buca ($16)
Pesto stuffed mozzarella. This was just a huge blob of cheese - didn't even come with bread or crackers to eat it with. The waitress recommended us to order some fresh baked ciabatta bread to go with it but of course, at an additional cost.

Amazza Fegato ($16)
Tuscan offal sausage with king mushrooms served on the side. This was really disappointing. The portion was realy small, definitely not enough to share among 4 people. In terms of flavor it was nothing special either, totally not worth the price.

Prochetta Schiacciata ($14)
Of all the items that my friends and I tried that night, I would say this was the only thing that actually tasted good. It was a stuffed focaccia with roast Tuscan pork, mascarpone, apple mostarda and aglita. All the ingredients went well with each other, it was like a sandwich, nothing special but one of the better dishes of the night.

I must say Bar buca does have an interesting and unique menu, and the atmosphere of the place was nice but the food was just not worth its price."}
{"text":"I've been to Bar Buca a few times. And it really does have almost everything you need. Delicious boozy cocktails, crispy deep fried goods, aromatic coffee (highly recommend asking for grated cinnamon on top of all your caffeinated beverages), and unique dishes for main eats. 

Their service is pretty good, nothing ahhhmazing, but still above average. I love sitting at the bar and watching the chefs carefully create and plate each dish. I love their high ceilings and wall of wine hung high. 

It's a great place to go with a friend or two, but wouldn't recommend coming here for a full on dinner date unless you wish to share small plates or solely come for the cocktails (my favourite is the one with beets. It's zesty and refreshing!). A little on the pricey side if you're hungry, as it averages about $50 per person on a 7/10 hunger scale.

Would go back again though!"}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast, they have a more breakfast oriented menu before 11AM. I had the eggs with burrata but asked to get the crispy prosciutto added, which they did with a smile. 

If I had time I would go back for their menu after 11AM.

The pastries my friend got were nicely presented and also delicious. 

All the staff there are ridiculously good looking, I know it's a shallow observation, but it just stood out for some reason."}
{"text":"On layover at Billy Bishop and decided to go for a walk. Found this place. Had the sardina (fermented smelts on crostini). It was super flavourful: it had a real funk, which I love, but not for the faint of heart. The polpetti were absolutely gorgeous: tender, flavourful, and swimming in a delightful sauce.
Service very good and atmosphere trendy."}
{"text":"Best cappuccino in all of Toronto!! 

When I lived upstairs in the same building, I stopped in here for coffee and a croissant every morning. Honey and nutella croissants that are both delightful! All of their pastries are excellent. They have cinnamon sticks and a rasp behind the bar, so you can get freshly grated cinnamon on your drinks. In the mood for juice? You can see them fresh-squeeze oranges or grapefruits for you. 

Service in the restaurant is consistently pretty good as well, but it's their espresso I miss."}
{"text":"BEST. BRUNCH. EVER. 

I've been to Bar Buca twice now and it's been nothing short of amazing! Perfect service and perfect food. Their coffee is so smooth, best in Toronto. I had their uova strapazzate, focaccia pomodoro, cannoli, and cappuccino with buffalo milk. All were delicious and highly recommend!"}
{"text":"As usual I just walked by Bar Buca without noticing it as the sign of the restaurant is really low key and I never expected it to be sharing address with a condo complex.

I took my Yelp friend here as one of the stops to celebrate his 1000th review. At first he was a little skeptical but I think he is a fan after our visit to Bar Buca.

Our waiter was awesome. Really professional, friendly and attentive. And who said service is not important? He really made our experience enjoyable.

We shared:
 
Carciofi Crudi ($9) Raw Artichokes, Buffalo Yogurt, Bottarga, Senape - I still cannot get over how I enjoyed this! I usually don't like Artichokes but this dish really works with all the element which gave it an interesting complex taste and texture!

Stuffed Focaccia: Prochetta ($12) Roast Tuscan Pork, Mascarpone, Apple Mostarda, Agliata ($12) - Nicely done too! I love how the apple mostarda (which is really mustard and fruit preserves) balance out the roast pork. 

He drank his cappuccino, I drank my Theresianer Vienna.

We were both happy.

And I know I will be back...."}
{"text":"This is a brunch review - every so often, beef's side of the family does brunch and I'm forever on venue duty, searching for the next new spot that suits various generations and tastes. I've been to Bar Buca several times for cocktails over the years but never considered them for brunch until I took a look at their online menu and thought it had strong enough offerings to risk taking in-laws to a place I had only previously known for cocktails in late hours of the night. I'm happy to report that the menu really spoke to the overall experience! Really delicious and interesting food that everyone enjoyed.

My choice was chickpea flour crepes stacked with walnuts, crispy prosciutto and apple, and it was really quite delicious. Mr. Beef's choice - bay scallops with eggs - certainly rivaled my choice in terms of tastiness as it was perfectly cooked, tender and full of flavor. Everything else on the table looked fantastic as well.

Bar Buca also features, unsurprisingly, great Italian coffee and nice, unique brunch cocktails. I had a latte with Italian custard and it was great; beef's cocktail was also amazing and the table at large raved about the quality of the coffee.

The service was good, nothing really notable either way, and the ambiance is casual. The one very minor thing everyone complained about was that the place is hard to find from the outside, and it's true: the sign above Buca is quite small and not super well lit; complicating things is the fact that it's in the base of a residential condo complex and it's not super easy to spot. So keep your eyes peeled when you turn down Portland and you will find yourself something a bit out of the ordinary but entirely tasty for brunch!"}
{"text":"Let me start by how friendly and welcoming the servers were. This was a small place so we waiting for about 30 minutes for a table of 4 but that was ok because the food was amazing. I highly recommend the porchetta and the rabbit legs. First time I ever had rabbit and it was melt your mouth!"}
{"text":"For my last breakfast here in Toronto, and my first breakfast for 2017, Bar Buca was a great place to stop by. Moment I walked in, the overall feeling I got from the place was a rustic style barbershop, which is great. The place had stylish, simple and comfortable interior. Our waiter was very attentive, water and utensils very quickly. I had an orange tea and a frittatine. The orange tea was very aromatic and fragrant. The frittatine was very light and I chose the veggie option. Imagine a bite sized baked omelette. The service was well done and the Italian style small dishes give a great theme to the overall place. The chef offers great little plates and I'm sure much more at a quality price. I haven't had this type of food at this price in a while. Next time I come back to Toronto, I'll definitely be back! Cheers!"}
{"text":"Bar Buca is embedded in the affluent neighborhood of Portland. 

Instead of taking the streetcar to Distillery like I was suppose to, I went the opposite direction and landed on Portland. Perhaps it was my lack of direction sense, perhaps it was my olfactory, something lead me there that night. It was probably the best mistake I had made that week. 

Bar Buca has many unique offerings. It considered \"adventurous\" or \"daring\" in the Toronto Italian food scene. In Asian food world, it's another walk in the park. The pizza with housemade sausage was exceptional. Bigoli duck egg pasta, with duck offal ragu, venetian spices, mascarpone, basil ($21) was in a league of its own. The ragu was creamy. The gamey flavour of the duck complimented the mascarpone well. Desserts were wonderful. We thoroughly enjoyed the tiramisu, corn gelato, and crisp Italian pastry with cream and berry compote. Corn gelato is the least favorite among the desserts. It's lacking in the richness and smoothness of gelato. Tiramisu is our favorite dish of the evening. It's textbook tiramisu with a twist. 

The main departure between Bar Bucca and traditional Italian food is its portion size. My companion jokingly said, is the other half of the dish still in the kitchen? An Italian grandmother would have never let this tiny dish out of her kitchen. 

Aside from potentially offending an Italian mother, Bar Bucca is an awesome place to dine."}
{"text":"I usually don't leave reviews unless the experience was either really good or really bad. I had a great experience at Buca! I'm a foody and my friends and I enjoy eating at top notch restaurants asking for the total dining experience. We ordered the garlic bites, salumi and cheese platter and fried stuffed olives for apps. They were truly amazing. 

My entree was the Carbonera pizza (yes a carbonera pizza!) and it was like nothing I have ever tried before. It was a 5/5 pizza! Our wine was great, the service was fantastic and I would go back in a heart beat. 

If I had one complaint it would be the tiramisu. It did not resemble or taste like a tiramisu. Some things in its traditional form shouldn't be changed. It was a disappointment but I've heard others have also mentioned the same thing so I'm sure they will eventually fix that :)

Otherwise I highly recommend Buca on Portland :)"}
{"text":"I came here for brunch, and it was pretty excellent. Food was great tasting, though my porchetta sandwich was quite greasy and a bit on the salty side. On the bright side, my water glass was never empty. Service was on point - prompt, friendly and welcoming. I also had a cappuccino. It was quite good! Foam was light and espresso was strong. Ambiance is also cool. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Brunch here is fantastic. Food is full of flavour and the service is great. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Warning: be prepared to spend a lot of money even though it doesn't look like a high end bar from the outside. 

We ordered: mozzarella cheese, stuffed sandwich, strawberry salad thing, fried zucchini, and three beers and one cocktail for four people. And it came down to $35 per person. The food itself is very delicious although the portion is not that big. It's noisy and dark inside and it has a relatively small patio outside. 

Tip: to get the most bang for your buck, get the stuffed sandwich or mozzarella ball. Delicious and good portion."}
{"text":"Went to Bar Buca last week for a date night. Didn't know much about the place, or what they served so I didn't have any expectations. Finding the restaurant wasn't too hard, but there is very little signage to distinguish it, or if there is I didn't see anything. 

Going into the restaurant I was blown away at how small and empty it was. Very high ceilings with nothing on the walls, only a few tables, and a very interested wine display. None the less, the decor doesn't matter because their food is what you really go for. 

We sat right in front of their open concept kitchen and had 5 different plates which all came out in a very timely manner, without feeling rushed, and were delicious. The goat meatballs were delicious and the sauce was fresh and light. the stuffed mozzarella ball was creamy and full of flavor, and the pairings of the drinks with a small taster was interesting and fun! For dessert we had the cannoli which was the perfect size and the right amount of sweetness to end off the evening. 

We left full but not stuffed, and when we got the bill I was pleasantly surprised that the price we extremely reasonable for the food we had ordered. 

This is definitely a fun place to stop in for a few bites with friends, and a cocktail."}
{"text":"Admittedly we didn't have dinner here. But we were so impressed with our happy hour drinks and snacks (along with seeing what everyone else ate here) that we definitely plan to come back! First the service is excellent. I also really like the atmosphere and decor. It's not trying to be trendy, it definitely has a laid back European feel which goes really well with the fabulous Italian style food. You can tell all the ingredients are fresh and high quality. Dishes are simply prepared and not the standard pasta and pizza dishes. The prices are reasonable for the area too. For example during happy hour you get a drink and small snack for $10 per person. They don't take reservations but the turnover is fairly quick so there didn't seem to be a long wait. We were seated immediately at 6:15 pm on a Saturday. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of this place. It's open 7am -2am most days. Whether you want a fresh cappuccino and nutella croissant in the morning, a brunch spot on Sunday, or a wine bar for a date night on a weekend, this place is good for all. More low key and friendly than Buca, give this place a try. Food can be oily - especially the sandwiches. And they do have some experimental things on the menu. But all in all, it's a great option."}
{"text":"Great service and the food was delicious! 

Tried the Winterlicious menu which are also items on the regular menu. The Porchetta was delicious! The beets salad and tests were definitely amazing and I would love to come back for them! Would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Saw a recommendation on the website eatsabroad.com where they interviewed the head chef. He recommended trying Italian porchetta sandwiches in Toronto and mentioned he had one here on his menu. It is one of the more memorable sandwiches I've ever had. The bread was soft yet crispy. The porchetta was succulent. The flavors were just amazing and the sandwich was more than satisfying."}
{"text":"The croissant with egg and cheese are totally worth it to come here for a snack and a drink with friends. I stopped by for the first time today and I am considering this is a place for me to hanging out on the weekend, Monday is quiet here but I know they will be packed during the weekend"}
{"text":"Walked in ( because they don't accept reservation) with a couple of friends for Winterlicious lunch but when we arrived, we were told by the restaurant that Licious is not available for weekend lunch.  Oh well.....Ordered their famous porchetta from brunch menu instead. Pork, eggs, mascarpone, apple mostarda & agliata sauce on Schiacciata(stuffed focaccia) for $15. It was exactly same(jumbo) size and tastes exactly same as the one I had two years ago. Still very good solid sandwich My only complaint was I ordered my egg to be runny, but it was served well done  One of my friends ordered farinata;  chickpea crapes, prosciutto, apple mostarda & almonds($12) It was so damn good as well. At least for me it was flavour packed yummy weekend brunch, was surprised that this chickpea crapes were not dry at all"}
{"text":"Super lovely staff! One of those places that you feel you are well respected! The ambiance is nice and the food is unique ! We went there for brunch and we loved it! I can assure you that you won't be dissapointed!!"}
{"text":"At the very least you must go for take out coffee. Their Americanco is to die for, especially if you put the coffee sugar in your drink.

The brunch is great and the food is amazing. Its a staple in the downtown core!"}
{"text":"LOVE the porchetta sandwich - moist, delicious roast pork between crispy, fluffy focaccia with apple mostarda - delicious!  The duck egg yolk in a copper pan with perfectly cook scallops, prosciutto and scallions were also unique and tasty, and the cornetto with homemade strawberry jam was impossible fluffy with a very concentrated fruitiness.

Great casual atmosphere - I'd come here for brunch, dinner, or even just a glass of wine."}
{"text":"excellent food, great wine selection (had to get recommendations because couldn't recognize anything hardcore italian), my friend was impressed they had good amaro selection, narrow tables for an intimate feel same with the lighting and music. Great service. highly recommend."}
{"text":"Ordered the spot prawn crudo. Came with a fragrant olive oil, some herbs and flowers and some light horseradish yogurt. Everything was well-balanced which really allowed the spot prawn to shine. We could tell from the sweetness and delicate bite that the prawn was super fresh. Quick service, beautiful little place. Would recommend."}
{"text":"The place is very chill. I ordered stuffed focaccia (vegetable one, with roasted peppers, mushroom etc) . It's very tasty! A little bit oily, but I'm totally fine with that. Also, the fluffy crispy bun absorbed the juice and oil, so perfect! 

I heard their coffee is really good, too! I didn't try this time. 

Our waitress might have a bad day today, coz she was not happy at all. But that didn't affect us too much..."}
{"text":"Bar Buca, not to be confused with the other restaurant Buca (just down the street) is a great place for breakfast or brunch, especially if you're a fan of espresso or coffee in general. 

We ordered the stuffed focaccia and it was simply delightful. Coupled with a mimosa or other breakfast drink and you're good to go. The latte I ordered appears to no longer be o the menu, which is a shame, but it was great. I'd love to try some of the others.

The atmosphere and crowd are great, hip, young, old, energetic, fun, and classy. The service could be improved a bit - it's slow, but that may be due to the fact that a lot of people are crammed into a small space. If you come as a couple and sit at a table, don't be shocked if another couple is seated next to you. 

Next time we're in Toronto this is definitely on our list of brunch hangouts to visit again."}
{"text":"Came here Saturday lunch hoping to have summerlicious but was told they don't have it on weekends during a nch (dinner only). It would be nice if this info is indicated somewhere...So people would know ahead of time. We waited for about 20 -30min. However, the 2 items we got were tasty, especially liked the flat bread with tomato and cheese in the middle. This place is on the pricy side for the amount of food it provides."}
{"text":"I came here for Saturday brunch with my family. The service was good, as was the food. The menu is small but not too limited. We ordered 6 dishes so that we could try a bit of everything. The sandwiches were large and filling! The porchetta was my fave! Dining here is intended to be tapas style so the portion size of the other dishes were small. They bring out the food as it is made and not all together, so if your party does not plan on sharing plates do not expect your meals to arrive at the same time."}
{"text":"A friend recommended Bar Buca and I was looking forward to visiting. 

The ambiance is very nice and comforting. The bar is pretty small and it looks like some of the patrons need to share tables which can be a little unsettling. 

The service was okay, our waiter was attentive at the beginning of the night but towards the end he was no where to be seen. We purchased a bottle for the table of three and the waiter came around to pour the wine...He only poured for one of the three and walked away even though myself and my other girlfriend's glasses were empty."}
