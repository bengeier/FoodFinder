{"text":"This is my first yelp review. Loved this place! Beautifully furnished. Had a great breakfast sandwich and they also have a great selection of tea!"}
{"text":"Great food and drinks! Ambience can't be beat! A gem to treasure in Richfield. The gyros are the best in the area and the paninis are also great choices and of good quality."}
{"text":"I love the sandwiches at this place and even though it seems something less than 'gourmet' it is a worthwhile stop if you're sick of McDonald's or the Wendy's down toward Brecksville. I think the people are nice etc. and have no problem with it at all.

Here's the thing. I think we all have a responsibility to right wrongs in this world. If any one of us is slighted, we are all slighted. If any one of us turns a head on injustice, we all suffer and our world becomes something less. So much of the time we're just lost. We say, \"Please, God. Tell us what is right. Tell us what is true.\" And there is no justice. The rich win. The poor are powerless. Anyway I went to this place and asked to speak to the owner.

Sir. I said it to him. Sir. I have a hypothetical for you. He was confused but I kept on going. I wanted to see if he had changed his ways. I wanted to know if he had learned a harsh lesson from the caustic words of a reasonably literate former important customer. 

Sir. What would you do today if one of your customers, an oenophile say, with a business nearby, a coffee drinker who even brings guests here to drink coffee, lets say he has some employees. And one day, without warning one of this important guy's scrofulous employees rolls in, bypasses the restaurant altogehter, goes into your restroom and bombs the place with a day-old percolated black coffee and steak bowel movement that brings tears to your perky servers' eyes? What then, sir? Do you say anything when he of an altered gait moves reluctantly back out into the world? Without buying a coffee. What do you do?

He is deeply troubled by the question, \"Uh. Nothing?\"

So far so good.

And what about the next time the important man comes in and buys a coffee? Do you comment on the pipe-rattling shit his ragtag employee left wallowing paperless in the stall nearest the door, steam on the mirror? Do you, sir, say anything? Did I mention that this important man can use the internet and can access dozens of quotations and lyrics with a flourish of his keyboard? A renaissance man.

\"What would I say? Nothing I guess.\" Perhaps he has guessed right. Perhaps he has learned.

Good enough for me. Four star review avoided. We beat on. Boats against the current..."}
{"text":"Pedestrian at best. Maybe I ordered wrong? Got the Turkey Club Panini. The best part of the sandwich was the doughy flatbread that it was made with. The turkey was run of the mill and not much of it. Turkey bacon used vs bacon bacon. Add a small child's hand sized grab of Ruffles potato chip knock offs and you get lunch for $6.99. The service was fine, the ambience is nice - kinda coffeehouse-ish, since they have a large coffee menu. But food wise, I ever return, maybe Ill try some of the Mediterranean offerings."}
{"text":"I don't know how this remains a hidden gem. Good coffee, excellent food and a cozy environment. This is what coffee shops should be, not those noisy, pretentious Starbucks or Panera with it's mixture of old lad"}
{"text":"Average at best. I've been here many times when I get sick of what else is around (which isn't much). I highly doubt anything here is homemade. All the soups taste like they're from a can, sandwiches are all heated via microwave. Taste isn't horrible, but nothing to give praise to. For people who want something quick and plain."}
{"text":"Great coffee shop, fresh food, fresh coffee and two nice female waitresses! I stop in at least 3 times a week. Stop in soon!"}
{"text":"Being new to the area for work, I gave this place a try given the reviews. And oh buddy, just found a new go-to place! While I'm bummed that they no longer have lamb dishes on their menu, I had their chicken kabob and it was sooo good. I got my food to go but it looked like a well-maintained cute spot.  Can't wait to try other things!"}
{"text":"Delicious, healthy food (and I mean DELICIOUS) with great coffee too. Staff is efficient. I wish they had longer hours as there are very few places to eat in the corporate area of Richfield... 

The interior of the cafe is very cute as well - a great place overall."}
{"text":"This is a neighborhood place, lots of people come here for meetings over coffee to stop in with kids for a snack.  They have good muffins, specialty middle eastern food, good service.  Lots of regulars who come in and enjoy a chat with the owner and staff.  Its a nice place, if you have anything other than a good experience I am sure the owner would want to know so they can rectify it."}
{"text":"Great little spot for a quick breakfast and lunch. I love the breakfast sandwiches and their paninis. The staff is friendly. The place is cozy and clean."}
{"text":"Soup and sammich...
Chicken Noodle okay...Two steps above Campbells....
Chicken Teryaki wrap....Dry Even though it oozed chicken juice and teryaki...How does that happen?? 

I'll try it again though....Maybe I pretend to be too much of a foodie? But crap it was dry!!!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I spent 2.90 on the most sub par cup of coffee I ever tasted. That was a small too. Not sure why it's so expensive, but I'd rather never have a cup of coffee again in my life than drink this."}
{"text":"Cute little cafe with great food, good service, and excellent chai tea. Nestled in the heart of Richfield this cafe exemplifies small town charm with modern feel. I have never have had a bad experience here, and the food disappoints. I recommend the breakfast paninis and the bagel."}
{"text":"Been there several times now. The baklava is amazing and I meant to get a breakfast order other that the breakfast gyro wrap each time I've been there, but it's so good that I've gotten it each time! Love it."}
{"text":"This is a convenient spot for a quick breakfast of lunch. And there's a nice seating area with couches and chairs around a fireplace that must be absolutely delightful in colder months. 

Lovely staff!  Great chicken salad. (It's a bit overdressed for my taste but it was delightful nonetheless!) Coffees are fresh and made quickly."}
{"text":"Just had lunch here today with husband and dad in law. The owner sat with us and chatted a bit, very nice! The wait staff we're prompt and courteous too. The food is super good! For about $10, I had the Mediterranean plate, which has baba ganoush, hummus, tabbouleh, and some other things -- so fresh and delicious, quite stuff. Later on, had a piece of baklava and a coffee, also both delicious. The cafe has a comfortable ambience, spacious seating, and not too much noise. Seemed very clean as well. Lots of beverages, baked treats, and even coffee beans for sale. I'd definitely go back if lived anywhere nearby! Next time I'm in town I'd like to though."}
{"text":"Free wi if. Good smoothie. Great service. $4 minimum if you use a credit card. Ill try the sanwiches here sometime. I alos saw hooka's on the shelves so im assuming they have hooka hours.  Probably a good place to do work if you need a place.  Has that suburbia feel to it, since its the developing area of Richfield. Where summit meets Cuyahoga country. This area used to be really rural. Nice to see its come this far. I'll give it another review once I eat hear."}
