{"text":"Where are the cheese steaks??? They are sorely missed.  The whole purpose of Stack'd is that you can make your own burger with a variety of sauces & toppings. And it's a great burger! I'm not sure when the menu switched, but I enjoyed creating my own cheese steak with a variety of toppings.  On a related note of comparing the two Stack'd restaurants. Why are milkshakes more expensive at The Ave? All of the non-alcoholic milkshakes at Stack'd are $5, whereas some of the same milkshakes are $6.   I came the other night with a friend, hoping to make my own cheese steak. We were both disappointed when we realized that cheese steaks were no longer an option, and that The Ave is now using a set menu. I ended up getting The Ave salad (greens, apple, blue cheese, walnuts & raspberry vinaigrette dressing), which was pretty good.   Although the food was good, it just wasn't the same. I'll be sticking to the original Stack'd and creating my own food."}
{"text":"The Ave is kind of hit and miss.  I think you have to be in the right mood.  The cheese steaks are good, though I'm admittedly not a Philadelphian.  The outdoor seating is great.  I think Harris has the best with their patio, but The Ave is nice and large."}
{"text":"I went to Stack'd yesterday for the Tuesday burger special and they had these fliers that said The Ave has Wednesday burger specials, so I thought I'd try it out. It's 3.5 dollars for a burger and a bunch of fries. That's awesome, right?  Turns out, I'm having a very hard time believing that this place has the same owner as Stack'd. Stack'd makes great burgers, and considering that they're only 3 dollars on Tuesdays, it's really awesome. Burgers here are totally different, they taste completely different and overly salty. Also, I just realized today that yes, people can mess up fries.  So in terms of food quality, it's really meh. But maybe it's just this one burger and fries that they don't do well.  Most of the reviews here are talking about cheesesteaks, but they deleted that from the menu completely. They switched from making custom cheesesteaks to burgers and sandwiches some time ago because as they said, their cheesesteaks weren't selling that good. I've never got a chance to get their cheesesteaks, but I really feel that it was a bad choice. Pittsburgh doesn't have a lot of cheesesteak places, and there definitely ain't any good places around. They would have easily created a monopoly if they just waited some time for the reputation to start spreading.  Also, I had a very long wait for my burger today. This place is half empty, even on its half price burger night. I really didn't have a lot of competition in waiting for my food, but it took around 40 minutes. Usually Stack'd takes less than 10 minutes when there are this many people in the bar. This is almost the waiting time for Stack'd at its Tuesday peak.  I'm only debating giving this place a 3 because I like the atmosphere (which is pretty much a duplicate of Stack'd). They have TVs everywhere possible and that's awesome. I love watching 5 sports shows at once, but I don't think I'll be back, even on Wednesdays."}
{"text":"The ave is a great new spot on Ellsworth. They serve Philly cheesesteaks, as opposed to Stadk (owned by same owners as The Ave), which serves cheeseburgers. The place look great since being taken over by new ownership. It's a wide open space with a great crowd and fun staff. Definitely would recommend this to everyone!"}
{"text":"I came here the other night with my two friends for the first time. It was about 11:30 at night on a friday and we were trying to find a place that was not too crowded, but not sketchy looking. My one guy friend also wanted food. So with all those criteria we found The Ave on Ellsworth.   It was busy at the bar area, but there were some open high top tables right in front of the bar so we decided to sit there. I went up to bar and was able to get the bartenders attention pretty quickly, which was nice. We ordered a few rounds of drinks and my friends got the boneless chicken fingers with different sauces. All the drinks tasted pretty good and the food was not as bad as I thought it was going o be since we were are a bar. The bill also was not too high for all the food, drinks, and shots that were ordered, which made it even nicer.   I would certainly come back again and see if maybe this can be our new regular place to go on the weekends."}
{"text":"A few months ago some coworkers and I decided to check this place out after work. We've stopped in several times since, and I've always had a good experience.   On most occasions we have gotten drinks and wings. During happy hour all drafts (possibly all drinks!?) are half off. We have always had the same two bartenders take care of us, and they have both been really friendly.  I've had the wings a few times and they have been consistently good. Perfectly cooked and the Ave is generous with sauce, which I appreciate. There is nothing worse than wings with no sauce.   Not a bad spot overall. Friendly people, decent prices, and a good addition to the Ellsworth bars."}
