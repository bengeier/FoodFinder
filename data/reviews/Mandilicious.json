{"text":"Their food is hands down amazing! I ordered the lamb Haneedh and the rest of my family ordered the Mandi with chicken. They raved about the chicken dish! Both lamb and chicken fell off the bone and were so juicy, flavourful and tender! I've never had lamb cooked this well before and trust me when I say I always order lamb when it's on the menu anywhere. I'm so glad we made an impromptu plan to eat here, my heart is satisfied! Customer service was also fantastic, the guy cake by our table and asked how our meal was and told us some interesting facts about Mandi. If you're a meat lover like me, you gotta check this place out!"}
{"text":"Tried this place. Then I saw 3 stars and read some of the reviews posted. Whatever rudeness or cleanliness problem they had, it did not occur when I was there. I thought the staff were friendly. The cashier was wondering if I tried mandi before and tried to make a recommendation. The tables were clean.  The food is good and that to me is worth like 90% of the weighing. Their meats are indeed cooked to perfection. I had the lamb and it basically melts in your mouth. No chew required. The rice was delicious and complemented the meats. The meal came nicely packaged and came with sauces.  One advice I'd have for this place is to not call their \"small\" a mini plate. Frankly it's not \"mini\" at all. I am a fairly big eater and the so called mini plate is sufficient as a meal. You have to be pretty beastly even for a man to finish their \"regular\" size. So the value is not bad at all. It's a lot of rice so watch the carbs if you're on diet. But if I'm going to get fat, I want to get fat from Mandi. It's worth the carbs. Decent value if you consider the quality of the food."}
{"text":"Taste! Taste! Taste!  Honestly not any like it. Definitely value for money , amount and again Taste is def worth it.  Service btw was very up to standard and cleanliness was as well."}
{"text":"Great service  Food came fast  looked better than the pictures  Food is decent... not fully impressed  Seating arrangements are cool   Great place to bring your family"}
{"text":"Lets get the obvious out of the way. Their good is great and nothing compares to them. Chicken and Lamb slow cooked to perfection. Rice soft and flavored.  The biggest turn off was the hygiene and cleanliness of the establishment.  We used the sit down area. It was really visible that the sofas required immediate deep steam cleaning.  The bathroom was newly made buy really reaked. Too many paper towels all over the floor there.  The trash bin in the eating areas were overflowing and it was obvious that they needed to be emptied right 3.  My take itls that the staff or management is too focused on the food rather then maintaining the place clean.  A good restaurant covers all areas for the customer.  Also they really need to provide the customers with jugs of water."}
{"text":"Tried lamb Mandi... It was delicious. Portions are very generous, rice was really good too. Red sauce goes very nicely with the food"}
{"text":"Dropped by for a quick lunch. The food was mediocre. The rice was a bit undercooked. I didn't enjoy it much. It would of been nice if they gave it in a steel plate like they do in Dubai."}
{"text":"I tried this place one time, it s approximately what mandi should be, i felt strange that it s listed as expensive, it should be cheap, though a quality food. I ordered family chicken mathbi with other 2 friends, the meal was huge, enough for 6 actually. The rice was fluffy and well spiced, the chicken was juicy and tender, and the sauces were fresh and well seasoned. I recommend people who never tried yemenies food to try this restaurant, welcoming staff, quick service, clean and cheap. I gave it 4 stars because i haven't got the previous yemenies experience i got in professional authentic restaurant."}
{"text":"My team at work has Friday lunch outings. We have had some changes to how it works in 2018. We basically go out depending on what we feel like eating.  When it was Shrove (Pancake) Tuesday, I looked across the street and saw Mandilicious. I said to our group that we should go there. They all nodded in agreement. The problem? We have all been pretty busy since then that we couldn't get all of us there until this past Friday.  I drove our group of four over to the restaurant. It's in the same plaza full of restaurants. There was plenty of parking.  We got there at noon. It wasn't busy. We were greeted by the staff there. The woman working at the counter was wonderful at explaining to us what each food dish was, along with the two different sizes that you can order. You place your order, pay, and wait for your number to be called.  I went with the chicken mandi. You can also get lamb, but I am been on a chicken kick for a while. The chicken or lamb is soaked in traditional mandi spices and then steam-roasted. It also comes with rice and crispy onions are on top of the meat. The mini size is a generous amount of food for a single person. The plate size is for sharing.   I went with the mini and also made it a mandi box. The box consists of a house salad, a drink, veggie tabeekh (stew), and soup. Unfortunately, the place had run out of soup, so I got two portions of the veggie stew.  There was a ton of food! I actually had to box up half my rice with a bit of chicken left over.  The chicken mandi was flavourful and tender. It was to the point where I used my knife to move the chicken meat away from the bone. I could have simply used my fork to pull the meat off, but wanted to be more civilized than having chicken flying all over the place. It was incredible! You get tomato and yogurt sauces to put on your meat and rice. I loved the rice. It was perfectly fluffy.  The veggie tabeekh was so good. It had peas, potatoes, carrots, and onions, in a delicious gravy. There was some salt in it, but it wasn't so bad that my feet were swollen and I needed flip flops. I loved it. I am curious about the soup, so I will need to come back and give it a try.  The side salad was huge! I liked the toasted pita crisps on top of the fresh salad with an olive oil-based dressing with herbs. It was light and refreshing.  All my colleagues enjoyed their meals. One of them went with the lamb mandi. She eats lamb often and said that it didn't have any gamy taste or smell to it. Nice!  The decor is cheerful with vibrant colours everywhere. Our booth was big and comfy. We all stretched out and chatted after downing our meals. There is also complimentary tea. Two of my colleagues got chai tea, which was fragrant.  This restaurant is clean and inviting. I will definitely come back from more. The lunch special was cheap at $7.99 and is a good deal for the volume of tasty food that you get.  (185)"}
{"text":"Amazing service and well cooked food ! I had a chicken dish and It was baked to perfection. The people working there were kind ! They even gave everyone at the restaurant free dates and tea . Charming service !"}
{"text":"This star is strictly based on the service and NOT the food.. I didn't get as far as having food because I wasn't pleased with the way a staff member talked to me, really rude.  I understand they were really busy, it's a new establishment so I will be going back to try their food.  Again the star is just based on the service.. keep in mind I drove 40 minutes to get there so I was even more upset with the experience.  Interior was beautiful, really clean"}
