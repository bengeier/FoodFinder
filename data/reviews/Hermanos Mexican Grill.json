{"text":"Was craving some churros. We ordered the ones with caramel sauce. They were waaay over done, hard and doughy. I didn't even finish one. I haven't tried anything else on the menu, we be back to try the other stuff, but definitely not the churros!"}
{"text":"SUPER SUPER SUPER FRESH! I didn't quite feel like having the enormity of a burrito and I've seen this place passing by a handful of times so I decided to give it a shot today. Staff were super friendly and helpful. I don't normally eat fish but the Baja Fish taco was suggested so I gave it a try and it was awesome! I also tried the Chicken Tinga and the amazingness was on par with the baja fish. Try it out! You won't be disappointed. This maybe become a weekly trip......"}
{"text":"All I can say is, WOW! Amazing quality and sooooo delicious! I tried the hermanos chicken and Baja fish! Also ordered caramel and chocolate churros. I would stick to caramel for my next visit...which will probably will on taco Tuesday $8 for 3 tacos!!! All in all, amazing tacos for a great price! Yum!!!"}
{"text":"This place has made Tuesdays my favourite day of the week! Love the tofu and hermanos chicken. The churros are huge and delicious, definitely get what you pay for!"}
{"text":"Good assortment of tasty tacos.  The store is small and I had a hard time finding it.  The ingredient taste fresh and flavourful."}
{"text":"Wow!  Tofu tacos were of the chain!! I will not be trying any other variety protein tacos they offer since I'm a vegetarian, but honestly you don't need to.  It was very fresh and flavourful.  A little to much sambal sweet Thai chilli sauce and really no need for the crema which I will nix next time.  This is my new go to spot instead of burrito boys...sorry but not sorry. Even on a long weekend in Port credit it was nice to find a spot away from the crowds and the heat. Will definitely be back! Also,very nice service the gentleman behind the counter was very nice and quick.  Thank you"}
{"text":"I finally went to this place this weekend; note...I had walked by it many many times without realizing it was even there.  The food is amazing.  Out of this world!  Not fine dining by any means, but my mind was blown; these were the best and tastiest tacos I have ever had.  The service is friendly and i cannot wait to go back tomorrow for their Taco Tuesday special."}
{"text":"Would I return? No.

If you love tacos and have had some great authentic Mexican tacos don't expect to get that here. If u got a craving for  then sure it's alright.Also there are no restrooms, I asked if I could use there sink to wash my hands and they said no. Seems like it's more of a take out place than anything."}
{"text":"Fairly average tacos and nothing special . The service was not very warm and the flavour was nothing spectacular. I guess it's inexpensive hence the high ratings"}
{"text":"I wasn't impressed with the food or attitude of the employees.

The tortillas were from a package and when I tried to alter one ingredient on one of the tacos I was given attitude saying \"people try to ruin their tacos\". If they are so concerned with the artistic integrity of their product, they should be making better tasting tortillas in-house."}
{"text":"The tacos here are extremely delicious! 
They're inexpensive, yet such good quality and very flavourful. I bought the 3 for $10 and I thought they looked small at first but after two of them I had to save the third for later. Easily the best taco I've had in a while. 

Just one small thing, if you add extra hot sauce onto the spicy tacos, be prepared for them to come out as it spicy as goes in ;)"}
{"text":"Excellent food and with the use of Skipthedishes.com delivery was made on time and the food hot!  Great restaurant, would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Best tacos I've had in Mississauga! Love the chorizo and Baja fish. Wish they offered Al Pastor as well - they would just have to replace the chicken with pork on the Hermanos taco. Also wish they offered their hot sauce in take out containers - it's great sauce though! Adding guac to/on the side of the tacos would help with dryness. Overall, way better than El Jefe across the street, better priced and faster service."}
{"text":"I had the chicken, beef and fish. 
I found the chicken and beef were just to dry I did go as soon as it opened so not sure if it was the day before meat. But I was sadly disappointed after hearing good reviews from a friend. They were kinda bland and maybe could have used more sauce.  
The fish was less dry but still a little dull."}
{"text":"Excellent tacos. Quick service. Tried the chicken tacos and pulled pork tacos. Both were yummy."}
{"text":"3 for 10 is a great deal! The fish and pulled pork were the best.Recomended for sure.Warning the hot sauce is hot!"}
{"text":"Good tacos, Baja fish was tasty. The 3 tacos for $10 was a good steal. Staff were friendly. I'd recommend this place."}
{"text":"by far best spot for tacos in Mississauga in terms for flavour, value, portion size, and quality. a big yes for double shelled tacos and taco tuesday!!!"}
{"text":"Great tacos at a fair price. Best in Mississauga. I tried the pulled pork, barbacoa (beef) and, chicken Hermanos (my fave)! 3/$10. Tuesdays is 3/$8. Friendly staff, fast service. This is a takeout spot however there are counters for you to scarf down these tacos! Check it out if your in the Port Credit area! Shoutout to Caitlyn :)"}
{"text":"Insanely delicious tacos! LOVE the fish and the tofu, so good! These tacos fill me up and keep me happy for hours. The churros are also amazing! Nice little treat to satisfy my sweet-tooth. Super nice employees, too!"}
{"text":"I stopped by here to try three of their tacos the other day. I have to say, I expected more in the way of flavour. 

I tried the barbacoa, chicken Hermanos, and the pulled pork. All are essentially braised or stewed meats with a bit of fresh toppings (pico de gallo on the beef, a slight bit of mango on the chicken and a cabbage slaw on the pork). 

None of the tacos I tried were particularly spicy. The chicken had a mild hit of heat. The beef and pork had no heat whatsoever. I would say that I liked the chicken best for that reason. They did offer me a bottle of some hot sauce, but while the hot sauce had a nice amount of heat, it was way too smokey and overwhelmed the flavours of the tacos so I didn't really use it. 

The meats were, paradoxically, dry and yet too wet at the same time. I'm assuming they're braising too fast at too high a heat to achieve that disappointing result. A long slow braise at low heat would result in juicier meat. The interior of the meat, when you bit into it, was dry, but it was surrounded by way too much of the braising liquid. This led to really wet tacos which is definitely no bueno. Also, the meats (aside from the chicken) were just not seasoned enough. 

I make tacos or burritos at home from leftover braised meats and I season that meat up. I'm sorry but if I can do better at home, I think you are failing a bit at your overall purpose. I want restaurants to give me better food than I can make at home. I probably won't be rushing back here, but I would recommend it for people who like really wet and mildly seasoned tacos."}
{"text":"Pretty solid tacos.  Tried the Baja Fish, Pulled Pork and Chicken Tinga.  The fish was a standout.  I will have to go back to try the other ones."}
{"text":"pros: only good mexican place in the area. clean and fresh. better than the place across the street. 

cons: no authentic taste. cant blame them. as this part of town isnt ready for real mexican food. stuck up staff. 

mississauga likes border mx. so if that's good enough so is this place

too many 5 stars for this place. 3 is high praise."}
{"text":"Screw it, I'm updating my review. It's Cinco Di Mayo and you're eating anything BUT Mexican today, well you need to give your head a shake son. 

Hermanos honestly makes THE BEST Tacos anywhere west of Hwy 427. I've been everywhere and tried lots of tacos and this place time and time again rises to the top like the cream of the crop that it is.

What makes them so good is that they've stayed true to simple authentic Mexican ingredients but infused the tacos with one thing chubby Canadians and Americans like myself want - portion size. The tortillas are standard size but there is always so much filling you need two hands just to pinch the top closed, and good luck getting your mouth around them. Not a chance.

My favourite thing about these tacos is how juicy they manage to keep the meat without inundating it with crazy amounts of sauce. Many other Taco joints struggle to pre-prepare their meats and not have them dry out. Not at Hermanos!

Grabbed 4 on the go between meetings today so I could ugly eat in the car while I drove (bad idea), but I had the Chorizo, Barbacoa, Chicken Tinga and Pulled Pork (Carnitas).

Blessed. Every single one was blessed. I cannot wait to go back!

Happy Cinco Di Mayo all!

Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"Tried the taco tuesdays for the first time today. It was 3 for $8 so the price was fairly reasonable. I chose the fish, chicken and barbacoa tacos. A little on the salty side but for the most part delicious. The highlight of my visit was the churros."}
{"text":"Excellent tacos and choices. Great prices. Great location. Speedy service. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"Both the baja fish tacos and the tofu tacos were pretty good but the service was terrible - they were helpful but not friendly AT ALL. I asked to make substitutions and they acted as though they were disgusted with me. Thanks for that. No matter how good the food is - it's not worth being treated like crap."}
{"text":"My new favourite taco place! Excellent tacos, my favourite by far is the Baja Fish Taco. Crispy on the outside, flaky white fish on the inside; absolutely delicious. I have also tried the Barbacoa, Chicken Hermanos, Chicken Tinga and Pulled Pork. All are full of flavour and the toppings go perfectly. If you feel like something sweet afterwards you definitely must try the caramel churros, it's an addiction!"}
{"text":"Fish tacos, tofu tacos and beef were all recommended. An awesome place! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Not the most comfortable place to eat, but still inviting. The staff seems friendly and cool and you can see everything being grilled, or fried. The Baja Fish Taco, almost cried a tear when I took the first bite, fresh, and so flavourful! Worth the trip!"}
{"text":"I love Hermanos! I'm here at least once a week to get my fix, and I think I'm getting withdrawals as they are closed for the holidays xD. (Maybe that's why I finally remembered to leave a review), Ha!

Anyways, all the tacos are great. My personal recommendation would be the Baja Fish and Chicken Tinga, those are my favs! The prices are great and you get a big, crispy piece of fish which pairs nicely with the slaw on the Baja. Add a few drops of hot sauce and bam! Satisfaction guaranteed :)"}
{"text":"Although I have only been here twice so far, I will be returning for many many more tacos. The crispy tofu is to die for, I'm not kidding it's fantastic. Cute little place, nice atmosphere and artwork. My boyfriend and I love this place! My second favorite would probably be the pulled pork. And for only $10 you get 3 generous sized tacos. Unreal!"}
{"text":"Man, I feel bad for giving this review, but I was pretty disappointed. This place has the nicest servers too.  

I bought two tacos and a water for $8 I believe.  My issue with this place is:

a) I wanted a healthy vegetarian taco.  The tofu was deep fried.
b) The toppings were pretty slim.  
c) I finished both tacos in 2 minutes total.  

I would have preferred if they put some beans or something else in it.  When I spend close to $10, I expect to be decently full, but I was so hungry afterwards, that I went to eat pizza right after.  

I'm sorry. :-("}
{"text":"Food was excellent and fresh. Was disappointed that I couldn't substitute the toppings, as I wanted to get tacos for the kids. Would be great if they added a Kids Menu."}
{"text":"My good friend was kind enough to take me to this place.  Good company for sure, but forgettable food.   This is a great place, if you have never eaten real Mexican tacos.  I grew up in California, and lived in Arizona as adult.  I have eaten plenty of real Mexican tacos in US and Mexico.  I can tell you for sure real Mexican tacos do not taste like the ones I ate at Hermanos.   I ate the three tacos combo - fish, beef, and pork.   It was bland, tasteless and not authentic.  Meat on the tacos tasted fresh but extremely bland.   The topping on three tacos were forgettable - this is best way I can describe it.  It tasted like there was no real toppings that added much to the taste.  Where is radish?  Where is pico de gallo?  Where is chopped onions & cilantro?   Where is salsa verde or roja?  or Lemon or hot sauce?    Bottom line is that Hermanos tacos were like going on blind dates with girls who have not reached puberty yet.  Taste was so not authentic and forgettable that Hermanos should change their name to Hermans, to denote their water down yuppy suburban taste.

On the positive note, the food tasted fresh, clean and healthy compared to authentic Mexican tacos.    The tortilla that was used was very high quality and tasted healthy, almost organic.

But seriously, if you are going to make a living making tacos, you really have to step up the game, even if you are serving tacos to yuppy suburban white folks in a ritzy neighborhood.  This restaurant would not survive in competitive environment like Toronto downtown, let alone Los Angeles or Baja Mexico. 

Taste: TWO Star
Cleanliness and health conscious: Three Star
Overall: 2.5 Stars

P.S.  I encourage the owner to travel and taste real Mexican tacos.  If you can't make it to Mexico or South West US, at least go to downtown Toronto and taste real Mexican tacos and bring home the lessons.  Mississauga badly needs a taco joint that delivers on real Mexican taco taste. Someone please do it.  We will all love you for it!!!$$$!!!"}
{"text":"Been here consistently during the last year and love their 3 for $10 deal. The chips and guac are my highlights along with their damning hot sauce. 

Sometimes i just wanna sneak a bottle into my purse. ^_^

Sad they are closing down so went by today for 1 more tofu on corn tortilla. Bf had the chorizo and the chicken hermanos, good portions!

Not the best we've had but the good service, price and location makes it an easy choice!

Good luck on everything and hope to see your next venture in the new year!"}
{"text":"This is a great spot if you like real tacos. I tried the BBQ and chicken tinga, the BBQ chicken was good, the pineapple salsa was sweet and went well with the BBQ chicken. I liked how their hot sauce was on the side, and it was actually really hot and added a nice kick. I also really enjoy how they added a wedge of ljme. The customer service was friendly and inviting.  On tuesdays 3 tacos for 8$, a great deal. This is my new taco spot, I highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Amazing tacos in port credit. I was really impressed! You can get any 3 tacos for only $12 and they are definitely not stingy on meat. My tacos were full of meat, fresh ingredients and full of flavour! It's a small quick eating place with with take home style or if you can grab one of there barstool spots. They do not have tables to eat at, just bar stools and a ledges. But if you can find a spot, luckily you a right in port credit where you can simply enjoy your tacos right by the lake with an amazing view. 
I also had the churros, which is a must get. By far the best churros I have ever had. I definitely have to get them again when I come back!"}
{"text":"I'm so sad they're closing (due to rent problems)  - I've been looking for the best tacos in GTA and I can say with confidence these guys are it. Really hope they will open a new location soon..."}
{"text":"Abso-frickin-lutely delicious tacos! Now as a vegetarian I've only tried their crispy tofu tacos but they are truly outstanding and will certainly be back again and again! Topped with salsa, corn, crema and other goodness (I can't remember, I devoured them too quickly), you get three for ten bucks in your choice of corn or flour tortilla. Top it off with a squeeze of lime and their fantastic homemade hot sauce (careful, it's HOT) and boy, have you got yourself a taco. 

So that's about it, not much more I can say. I'm sure that the other options (pulled pork, fish, chorizo, chicken and a couple others) are just as delish and I would strongly encourage you to sample their goods. Grab some alongside a Jarritos or a Mexican Coke and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Stopped into Port Credit on a ladies weekend and had the chicken tinga, baha fish, and tofu taco.  All three were delicious and so fresh.  

Nice atmosphere too although there is limited seating.  Such a nice spot and tasty food.  Ladies that served us were good spirited as well since we didn't know what to order and took some time.  

Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I had the Baja Fish taco last Friday nite as I was heading home after another establishment in PC and I was still hungry.  Cool little place, I'm sure they will do well. Needless to say the Baja Fish taco was very yummy and inexpensive, $3.60.  I'm looking forward to trying more items on the menu.  I hope they open up a store close to Bloor and Jarvis where I will be moving to:)"}
{"text":"The fish tacos are EVERYTHING! I'm not a super expert in tacos, but one of my favourite vacation spots is Cabo San Lucas, the originators of the Baja fish tacos. I've been to Cabo 3 times and eaten fish tacos in the old authentic part of town, more westernized part of town and on the beach, these are soooo close to those tacos from the stall on the beach. Fresh and hot, crispy but not greasy. 
The decor here is great too, nice little take out joint. My recommendation: get 3 tacos for take out, eat them on boardwalk and you're transported."}
{"text":"I can't believe I had the tofu tacos ... and didn't miss the meat! I've been raving about the place since I left, 3 days ago! Finally, Queen street quality food in the 905! There's hope for the west end."}
{"text":"i am that very strange human that only ever has fish tacos, no matter what other tacos i get, nothing compares to a fish taco. so my review strictly for their fish tacos and their unreal hot sauce. i really do like theirs here! had it a couple times, their hot sauce is so bomb. i tried to ask if they would sell me a bottle once, they of course said it's a house secret, so no. i've tried the other tacos, they're not bad but they did nothing for me. again, that's just me! it's pretty small here, so it's very much, eat and go. they sell 3 tacos for $10 - at least when i went, not sure if that's gone up. if not, you simply can't beat the price, especially when you compare to downtown taco joints like la carnita or any of the playa cabanas. if you're around, definitely stop by!"}
{"text":"I stopped by at lunch to check out this new taco place in Port Credit. They had 3 tacos for $10. I had a Baja fish taco, a chorizo taco and a barbacoa taco. I had all three on a soft corn taco. They were all so tasty. There was limited seating inside, with a few stools at the counter along the window. I got my food to go. Service was fast and friendly. I will definitely be back again. What a great addition to Port Credit."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat in Port Credit! My favorite tacos are chicken tinga, tofu, and baja fish. The guacamole and chips are delicious too. I would also recommend the churros with caramel sauce, yum!"}
{"text":"CLOSED...  apparently another greedy landlord, too expensive to continue

CLOSED.
Closed."}
{"text":"Excellent, mostly authentic Mexican. Real fresh corn tortillas for their tacos. Best fish tacos I've had in Canada so far. 

If you don't insist on authentic, the pulled pork tacos, and tofu tacos, are pretty good."}
{"text":"Great spot. Great prices. No upcharges regardless of toppings and proteins. 3 for $10 

Fish needs seasoning however.. And really needs a sauce component. but batter is crispy and zero fishy taste. 

Would definitely return"}
{"text":"I would give this place 3.5. A variety of flavours for a reasonable price. The crispy tofu was a strange combo. Only order one as they are super sweet. The chicken Hermosa taco needed some texture. Maybe more red onions. If I can't make it downtown for tacos I would settle for this place but it is no Grand Electric."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a really delicious but fast taco, you should try this place out the tacos are scrumptious and they have really good service."}
{"text":"Tried Hermanos for the first time last night. I am not a fish eater and from what I was told before hand that was their go to menu item. Ended up trying an assortment of their chicken/beef selection and wow I was impressed. For what you can get in Mississauga this place holds the crown as of now. Looking forward to returning."}
{"text":"Ehhhh, I was expecting a little more because of the reviews but the hype didn't really live up. 

I got the barbacoa, Baja fish and chorizo. My girlfriend also got the Baja fish and barbacoa but got a chicken hermanos as her third taco. And side note, 3 tacos for $10 is a great deal. So I give them that. Bravo. Anyways the chorizo was ok it's a day later and I can't really remember what it tasted like lol so not memorable. My gf and I were both pleased with the barbacoa. That one was really tasty. The flavour was very stimulating, like yes this is what my tastebuds were waiting for. I couldn't finish it though. It was a very filling taco. I love fish tacos so I saved it for last but sadly it was pretty disappointing. My gf and I agreed there was something missing. Like a sauce or something? A salsa? Tomatoes in general? lol I dunno, but the slaw was not enough. The fish itself was blazing hot and juicy but the lack of sauce or something extra just made the whole taco seem dry.

Glad I finally came here though. to see what it's all about. Sadly I don't think I will return."}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal! Service is excellent, bare bones kinda set up is pretty cool and the food, value - and their house made hot sauce is off the charts good! The corn tortillas seem made in house and just the real authentic mexican comes through like crazy!! Love love LOVE this place!!!"}
{"text":"Good service good tacos. The location was easy to find and service was quick. Tacos were delicious, only wished that they had a variety of sauces available to put on other than the one hot sauce. Yum! I got the baja fish, chicken hermanos and chorizo, they were well topped and not dry at all."}
{"text":"Had read good reviews so decoded to check this place out.

The place was crowded like a fish market which was a good sign that the food was good. 

It's more of a takeout joint and if you don't mind standing whilst eating this may be the perfect place for you. 

Food was OKAY but the customer service left much to be desired. Food took around 30 minutes and what really disgusted me was that the cashier assisted the person preparing the food without washing hands or wearing gloves. No one excepting one employee  was wearing a hat and all three workers had long hair. I believe this to be against health regulatuons.

I asked for a fork, waited 15 minutes and finally gave up.

Please don't get swayed by the high reviews. I did and was bitterly disappointed."}
{"text":"Fantastic tacos, I had the 3 for $10 option and tried the Chicken Hermanos tacos which were a mix of BBQ chicken and pineapple/red onion salsa. Great kick of spice on the chicken and the salsa balanced it our beautifully with a refreshing sweet flavour. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I was in the area craving some Mexican food while I unknowingly stumbled upon Hermanos! Having heard some pretty great things about this place I was expecting some great things. To my disappointment I wasn't all too thrilled with my experience here. While the service was great, I could not say the same about the food. I wasn't a fan of their pre-chosen tacos as I found them \"too sweet\" and with the option of substitution not being available, I was forced to eat something I didn't enjoy 100%. Having said that, their selections might get you going so do definitely give them a try if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Delicious tacos!! This place is a gem, I don't know why I haven't discovered it, or been told about it sooner. The reviews here are likely to throw you off, some are negative and some positive but you'll know the real deal when you go. It is a takeout place, you aren't expected to dine in, so don't be surprised at the stools and minimal seating. The fish tacos were amazing, freshly made and steaming hot. The corn and flour tortillas are very similar. Don't forget to ask for the salsa!"}
{"text":"Easily the best tacos in Port Credit!  This place is fantastic.  Three tacos $10 and a Jaritos in any number of flavours, what could be better?"}
{"text":"It's Taco Tuesday. I love coming here for taco Tuesdays. 3 tacos on flour or corn tortilla for $10. They have the best fish tacos ever!!!!!!!!!! It's a crispy fish with a chipotle slaw and radish. I always add their habanero sauce. Just a few drops is needed. If you love spicy, you gotta try this sauce. 

It's a small place, so if it's busy, you'll have to do take out. They seat about 8 or 10 people. But their food is always fresh and tasty. And, the prices are reasonable.  You can get a taco for less than $4 each.  When it's not taco tuesday, you can get any 2 tacos and a drink for $8 plus taxes. 

I absolutely love this place. I've tried many other taco spots, this place is it for me."}
{"text":"This is our favorite spot for tacos, churros, and guac.  Absolutely amazing crispy tofu tacos!!  My daughter has tried all other tacos, and swears by them all.  
This is a very small place, not really set up to eat in...it's better to carry out.
You won't be disappointed with eating here."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the fish taco. Others are good also... My only complaint is the hot sauce. Can not get it on the side for Togo orders. Not good when you but enough for a family and have to put on hot sauce before you leave the store . We always get someone who wants or doesn't want it when there are just a couple left .. ..My only reason for not eating there more often. They should just sell the hot side on the side for to go orders ."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying I was super excited to come here based on the reviews. It even had a Narcity article written about it claiming that it was the best taco spot in the GTA. 

After having my first experience here, I can now say that both the reviews and that article were far fetched for a few reasons. 

1. The tacos were good, but nothing spectacular. I had the chicken tinga, Baja fish, and the other chicken taco which I can't remember the name of. My favourite was the tinga because it had the most flavour. I found all 3 of them to be lacking in sauce because they were all quite dry. Granted, I didn't put on any hot sauce which may have helped with the dryness but I think the tacos should taste amazing without the hot sauce. The Baja fish was overdone to the point where it tasted mushy. The coleslaw in the baja fish taco was basically just cabbage because it was so dry. All in all, the tacos were just average- the ones at Grand Electric far exceed these ones.

2. The service is what disappointed me most about this place. First of all, parking is scarce. I know this is not the fault of the restaurant, however it does contribute to the experience. Parking completely aside, when you walk in you'll be lucky to find seating because there's a total of 7 chairs (in a space which could easily fit 10). We wanted 3 sets of tacos (3 tacos in each set) with two sets being identical. We went to place our order and started off by indicating that the first two would be the same, which is when the girl said \"we do it by sets here.\" Ok? She basically said she couldn't make the order for the first two without us telling her both times what we wanted (even though it was the exact same order). She's the one with the screen in front of her, she can see exactly what we ordered and just duplicate it, right? So we ordered our tacos and waited a total of 25 minutes for 9 tacos. Now, if they were making the ingredients there, I would've understood the wait time. However, the ingredients were all pre made. All they had to do was put the tacos together. When they finally finished our order, they didn't write or tell us which box had which order. Not a big deal, but can be confusing for people who haven't been here before. She had already put them in the bag when she asked us if we wanted hot sauce. Initially we said yes, which is when she began to laugh and ask which ones we wanted the hot sauce on. She was laughing because she had to now unpackage them and put hot sauce on individually. At this point we told her we don't need hot sauce anymore and we left. 

Overall, a disappointing experience. If you're in the area and are craving tacos, go. But definitely, definitely don't go out of your way. You're better off going to Kensington market or Grand Electric to satisfy your taco craving."}
{"text":"Delicious! First time I tasted their tacos I almost blew my loads in my pants. They're so tasty, I recommend everything on their menu and you might actually blow your loads too."}
{"text":"Based on the reviews, was a huge let down

Had pulled pork, churizo, crispy tofu.

The only one worth trying is the pulled pork. Mind you for 10$ for 3 it's a good deal, would I eve go back ... nope ... but good if your passing bye. 

Guac was very lemon tasting and was almost fluorescent green."}
{"text":"Cheap and delicious tacos at great prices! The other week, I ordered the baja fish taco, chorizo and the chicken hermano (the 3 for $10 deal) - all delicious! I'll be back when I'm in the area! Free street parking after 6pm I think."}
{"text":"Great tacos & friendly staff! Reasonable prices. The staff was tripping on my \"southern twang\" as much as I was on their Canadian accent-lol. Good food and folk, go see them!"}
{"text":"Great little joint. Mainly take out. A few stools. The tacos are really fresh. I loved my chicken taco with diced pineapples,red onion and cilantro. Just a drop of their deadly and delicious hot sauce. Friendly service"}
{"text":"Good location in Port Credit.  Small well designed space with bar style seating, ideal for people watching as you are enjoying some delicious tacos.  The barbacoa tacos are real barbacoa, not gringo-style \"barbacoa\".  The baja fish tacos are excellent.  3 tacos for $10 is not a bad deal when you think about the quality.  A must try for anyone going through Port Credit."}
{"text":"Been going to this place for 7 months now and I'm never disappointed. Good pricing (3 tacos for $10) and friendly service. 

I've tried all of the tacos they offer, with my personal favorite being the baja fish taco by far. Even though it's fried It's not greasy, all of the ingredients work, and you'll finish all 3 before you know it! If you prefer something with meat, the chicken hermanos and chicken tinga tacos are also very good, and surprisingly the tofu taco is delicious as well. 

I do agree that their use of styrofoam containers for both eat-in and take-out is a bit questionable, so hopefully that is something they consider changing in the future. 

All in all, if you haven't tried this place yet, go for it, especially on Taco Tuesdays where you can get 3 tacos for $8!"}
{"text":"Fresh yummy tacos! There are about 8 types from pulled pork to chicken to beef but my favourite is the fish!  Choice of flour or corn wraps. And some interesting pop choices. Good value for the money (3 for $10). Very little seating (a couple of stools) so suggest takeout. Great addition to the strip!"}
{"text":"For what it is, a takeout for taco place, this place is so GOOOOD!  There is only counter seating at Hermanos and it's right beside Shore.  If you're walking by, you might miss it.  

(I didn't know it was a takeout until I decided to drop by during the MWF.  The line-ups at the Night Market were just too long for me, but according to a friend, they lines did move quickly!)

The staff were very friendly.  They noticed me looking at the menu and said that I was able to mix up my order of 3 tacos - BONUS!  After some recommendations, I ordered the Hermanos, Tofu (highly recommended), & Fish, of course, on a mix of soft flour/corn tortillas.

3 tacos/$10 and I would say that it was a great meal, on the lighter side!  I secretly asked if they would be doing burritos, and they said probably not as Burrito Boyz is down the street.  They may consider switching up the taco flavours and maybe adding bowls, chips&salsa/guac in the future.

Chicken in the Hermanos, which I thought was shredded beef was really good and well-marinated.  Fish taco was surprisingly light!  And I found the tofu just ok 'cause I'm not huge on the sweet chilli sauce and didn't expect the tofu to be cubed up and deep fried.

Finally a good joint in Port Credit to grab a snack/quick, tasty meal that isn't a slice of pizza or a huge burrito!!!  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"*Only counter seats - grab and go place
*The tacos are reasonably priced. They have taco tuesday where its $8 for 3 tacos

-Chips + Guac with Mexican Coke and Pineapple Jarritos
The chips were lightly salted which went well with the smooth and creamy guac. However I do prefer my guac to have a bit more lime and good chunks of avocado to give it more texture.

-Chorizo Taco
The chorizo was seasoned perfectly - slightly spicy but not in a burning hot sensation. A hint of saltiness from the tangy queso fresco went well with the chorizo and the pico de gallo added that dose of freshness to the taco. The flavor really can't be beat, and it's definitely a must try if you haven't already.

-Baja Fish Taco
fish was lightly breaded and still able to hold its shape. ! I appreciated how they kept the taco refreshing by not drenching the slaw in dressings and the fish was not oily at all. To blend everything together, just squeeze some lime juice and it was pretty much one of the best fish taco I have ever had in Toronto so far.

-Chicken Hermanos Taco
The shredded chicken with a super sweet and spicy sauce all nestled between corn tortillas with a sprinkle of sharp red onions. Topped it all off with some juicy and sweet pineapple to tone down the heat. Are you drooling?  I'm drooling.

-Tofu Taco
Since they used firm tofu, the small bits of crunchy tofu added a nice texture to each bite and I found the overall taco to be quite sweet? I was hoping for more spices or other toppings to balance the sweetness. Tien and I decided to add their house special sauce for more flavor and oh boy, it was HOT. Later we found out it was habanero hot sauce.. so add it in moderation :)!

-Barbacoa Taco
I found the beef to be quite tough and chewy, not \"fork tender\" like what I would expected from being braised for a long time. I also thought the beef was not as flavorful as others, but I really liked the fresh pico de gallo. 

-Pulled Pork Taco
On the other hand this taco was just..ohmygosh-so-good-bursting-with-all-the-flavors-pulled-pork. The meat was soft, succulent, juicy and had that \"fall-off-the-bone\" texture. Slathered in a delicious BBQ sauce and topped it off with some crunchy slaw - It. Was. Magnificent.

-Churros
Nothing beats a fresh, still-warm churro, with its crisp outer shell exploding with cinnamon sugar and soft, chewy inside that helps balance the cinnamon sugar sweetness with a light saltiness. I also loved how both the chocolate and caramel sauce had a mild sweetness to it - which was quite dangerous as I finished 2 churros in one seating .. oops."}
{"text":"If you are looking for great tacos, then do not go to Port credit! This place is just as bad as El Jefe which is directly across the street.  The tacos were mediocre at best. Nothing authentic,adding Hellmann's chipotle mayo doesn't make it a taco. No avocado are you serious? The best part of all the use farmed tilapia for their fish.  Then the guy making the tacos accuses me of being a spy from the other horrible taco place across the street. They must obviously be copying each other's shitty recipes. Save your money and go to La Carnita or  Seven lives and get a true taco experience."}
{"text":"One out of three tacos (the battered fish with cole slaw) might bring me back to this new Port Credit fast food spot. The chorizo and beef tacos were totally nondescript which makes me unsure what the fuss is all about?"}
{"text":"I made it a point to stop here based on the many glowing reviews. Perhaps my expectations were too high as a result but I found this place utterly uninspired. The various meats were all drowning in chafing dishes and once strained were flavourless and dry. We had the Barbacoa, Pulled Pork, Chorizo, Chicken Tinga and the other chicken, the name of which escapes me now. With the exception of the Chorizo they were all bland. 

I'm a big fan of these hip reinventions of various cultural foods, but the style here seems to be trumping the substance. Dry meat, bland flavours. Grossly overrated."}
{"text":"Great food! Probably the best tacos my girlfriend and I had. Fish tacos are def my favourite! Only reason why this isnt 5 stars is bc the portions could have been a bit more. But other then that, food is bursting with flavour"}
{"text":"My partner and I visited here last Friday and sampled everything on the menu. Everything was fantastic... from the Hermanos chicken (nice and spicy with a fruity salsa) to the Baja fish and even to the tofu (which I would normally stay away from).

I went back tonight - two tacos and a drink for $8 is fantastic value. I'd recommend the Hermanos and the Barbacoa.

Oh. And Pineapple Jarritos - maybe the greatest soda of all time."}
{"text":"I'm a fan. This is a taco take out place. Perfect location, if you ever worked on lakeshore this would be an idea place to grab lunch. The do have counter seating but I wouldn't classify this place as a sit down restaurant. When it comes to tacos, burritos or quesadillas I always resort back to burrito boys but this place really stands on it owns with their selections on proteins and toppings. I like that you can mix and match if you are feeling for a little bit of this and a little bit of that. I would say my favourite is the baja fish and chicken hermanos. The baja fish was so good that one if definitely not enough and I loved the flavour combo in the chicken hermanos. They also have churros! I've had so many bad churros it nice to finally have an edible one. I can't wait till they expand their menu a bit I'm excited for that. Try the hot sauce, it is AMAZING!"}
{"text":"Sometimes a hit or miss to be honest but mostly a hit! The fish is amazing though once I came by and it was soggy and not as crisp. The customer service is AMAZING. Really nice cute guys work there. I continue to come back here. Always have the tacos right away or else they become gross to eat after a they get cold. Other than that great job"}
{"text":"I got 3 Baja tacos, they are a 3 stars but I give 4 stars because it's cheap. Real nice prices. Terribly small place, couldn't enjoy more tacos, I felt squished. Probably won't come back because of that"}
{"text":"This has become my favourite taco place. They offer 6 different options and all are delicious. They have just the right ratio of meat to veg and for the indecisive, the 3 for $10 option is perfect. 

The location is small and only allows for counter seating for about 6 people, so if you come on a busy Friday night, plan on take out, or you may be waiting a while to get a seat. 

Looking for fast, delicious and budget friendly? This is the place!"}
{"text":"First time at Hermanos and it was Taco Tuesday (3 for $8). I arrived late in the evening and by that time they were sold out of fish and chorizo. Bit disappointed as those were the two I wanted to try most. I had pulled pork, barbarcoa, and tofu. I have to say I was a bit skeptical about tofu, but it was my favourite out of the three. The pulled pork was very flavourful and the slaw on it, was very tasty. The barbarcoa was a good but had a very strong flavour. Was good but not sure if I'd get it again.

Cute little location, minimal seating, catered more to take out. 

Definitely coming back! Delicious!"}
{"text":"Found this cute little spot in port credit overall first impression loved the decorations remind d me of my trip to Mexico.  I ordered a taco just one at first than added another for my boyfriend.  I was not given any guidance from the server behind the counter on how or what the tacos came with as far as toppings until she told me the fillings were on the board. I expected to be more welcomed as a new customer and informed on how the menu worked.  I was also not even told if you buy 3 tacos it was more economical.  The tacos were delicious but I was turned off by the lack of customer service and enthusiasm of the girl serving us."}
{"text":"If you're debating whether to go to El Jefe or Hermanos, you definitely need to check out this place first. There's absolutely no competition between the two.
After trying out all their tacos, you must try:
- Baja Fish
- Chicken Hermanos
- Pulled Pork 
- Tofu
I prefer them on a corn tortilla over flour.
Make sure you have a fork with you as well, they put a lot of filling! I'm definitely not complaining about that. 
I love this place because it's quick and fresh. This little joint is a great addition to Port Credit."}
{"text":"Located in Port Credit. This is a taco take-out place; thry have a few chairs for you to sit and eat if you choose to stay. Menu is simple but delicious. My favourites are fish tacos and Angus tacos; toppings are preset depends on which tacos you order. You have a choice of corn or flour tortilla. Their home made hot sauce is quite hot and yummy as well; burned the roof of my mouth a bit but totally worth it. 
One big down side is there is NO washroom here so keep that in mind"}
{"text":"Excellent tacos!   I had one chicken and one beef taco; beef definitely reigned for me.  Pretty quick service and delish food...throw some of their hot sauce on your eats to take it to the next level."}
{"text":"Yum. I got 3 tacos and some chips and guac. So...yum! Fish tacos are fab and remind me of California fish tacos, which are amazing. Place is cute - just make sure you plan on to go. There are a few seats at a counter but you are better to grab the yumminess and run. Lots of local parks if Mexican picnic is your thing. Otherwise bring it home and make some margaritas! Staff was helpful and friendly. Vine is fun. Food was so good. There was nothing lost in transportation. Meaning it was still hot and fresh and fab by the time I got it home. Definitely coming back - in fact you may want to head there soon and beat me - my new goal in life is to eat all their guac. Soooo delicious!"}
