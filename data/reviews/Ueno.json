{"text":"This place is so great! A friend brought me in to try the BiBimBap, it was my first time having it and it was good (it was a cold version). While I was there I heard a guy raving about the egg sandwich and everything looked really fresh at the sandwich bar.  They also had a daily special of chicken curry that  looked delicious too.  I went back to try the sushi and I am so glad I did. The rice is just perfect. Not warm and sticky, but firm and just the right amount. I was hooked. This sashimi is so fresh and buttery.  Oh and the people are so friendly, and polite they made me want to go back and give them by business. Coffee is really unique and they brewed me a fresh pot without having to ask for it. Miso soup was one of the best ever.  I went here for lunch 3 times in one week. And I'm a picky person."}
{"text":"A great spot for sushi. Good quality and reasonable prices. A little hard to find. Best sushi place in the area"}
{"text":"I've been walking past this place for years, and only just stopped in today. Let me tell you - I'll definitely be back. Ueno just knocked Nari Sushi off the top of the list for best lunch take-out sushi in Corktown.   Located just below street-level of 75 Sherbourne, the service was incredibly friendly, with the sushi chef describing the different pre-packaged sushi rolls on display. I chose a dynamite roll ($9.95 for 10 pieces), and took it to go. Included was a tiny square tray for dipping soy sauce - cute and functional.   Sushi was kept at an optimal temperature - chilled enough to dissuade any health concerns, but warm enough that the rice is still fluffy. You can taste the freshness of the fish, and the ratio of filling to rice is bang-on.   Four stars instead of five, because when I went at 1:30pm on a Wednesday the sushi selection was quite slim. A bit late for lunch hour, yes, but there also wasn't any sign that they were rolling more to-go boxes. I'll try them again next week at an earlier time. Very, very happy with my first visit to Ueno."}
{"text":"Really good sushi for a decent price, in an area with limited sushi supply. Also sandwiches but never tried them. Oh yeah, and their coffee is also really tasty."}
{"text":"Just discovered this out-of-the-way, hidden gem in my work hood.  And have been mildly obsessed ever since.   Located just inside the doors of 75 Sherbourne, this sushi bar (errr....more of a take-out stand) has super fresh, super delicious rolls and sushi. Items come pre-packed in take-out containers, but don't let this scare you off, its delicious.  My go-to order is a mixed box of sushi (today's included two pieces of salmon sushi, one shrimp, one yellowtail and one tuna) and 6 pieces of their dynamite roll. The rice is perfectly cooked, not too sticky, not too warm, just cooked enough to hold its shape and stick together. Its the best rice I've had with take-out sushi in the city. Fish is all super fresh, not fishy-tasting at all. Also have had their wakame salad and their miso, both were good. not amazing.  Prices: Not the cheapest take out, but also not super expensive. My order with a miso soup was $12. I'd rather pay a bit more for great quality than eat the crap they sell at the local grocery store."}
{"text":"Ueno is my go-to lunch place for a quick, satisfying lunch that won't break the bank. As other reviewers have noticed, they pretty much cover all the bases - sushi, rice dishes, salads, sandwiches and soups - all for around $10.  My favourite is the marinated chicken breast sandwich which comes with a side of fresh carrots. It hasn't let me down yet!  I find the service fast and friendly, and there is plenty of seating both inside and out, in the courtyard patio. If you're having a hectic day at work and want to unwind for a bit, grab something to eat from Ueno and chill out in the sunshine.   There aren't a ton of fresh, healthy-ish lunch places in the area, so Ueno gets my vote!"}
{"text":"I'm giving this restaurant 5 stars not because it is michelin quality, but because it is an oasis. They make good food at a good price, and there's nothing (except fusaro's) that's remotely as good in this neighbourhood.  The menu is all over the place with sushi (surprisingly fresh), salads, and then the special of the day which can range from risotto to turkey dinner. It's not a usual recipe for success, but in this location it works for the simple reason that they have cornered the market on basically every type of food you'd want for lunch. I enjoy going with thoughts of sushi and then seeing the special and thinking, damn that roast beef looks good. Affordable prices and everything is solid quality. Good ingredients prepared honestly."}
{"text":"Used to go daily, but stopped last year when they asked my boyfriend and I to give up our seats to the only other couple in the otherwise completely empty restaurant. They are usually polite as long as you don't linger, though."}
{"text":"I very rarely review anything but since I go here almost every day I might as well.  Their \"eggwich\"(a BELT with cheese) in the morning barely takes any more time than a McDonalds Egg McMuffin and is incredibly tasty for $5.37 including tax. It's right beside my bus stop so most days that's my breakfast.  Their sushi lunches are fresh and delicious despite not being made fresh in front of you, and their specials are always interesting. The staff is incredibly warm and welcoming and make me want to give them more business."}
{"text":"3.5 stars  Interesting cafe - Ueno serves not only sushi but salads, soups, sandwiches, lattes, coffees, teas and espressos. Apparently they also serve bibimbap and risotto but I guess they weren't serving them when I came in today! I like that it stands out from other cafes in its variety. However - I'm not too thrilled about the lack of freshness in their sushi - maybe provide the option to serve freshly prepared sushi for their customers? Not a fan of tall wobbly tables either. I do appreciate the complimentary tea though - gives customers a nice welcome to the cafe!"}
{"text":"Located heritage antique building very unique characteristic take out sushi / salad bar  with super friendly staffs .  Very fresh, not too salty or sweet . Perfect place to treat yourself healthy lunch. I personally enjoyed the daily special and soup .    Chef recommended me what's good today . My daughter loves the peeled off edamame. Perfect combination of old and new. Definitely visit again when I m near by."}
{"text":"This is such a good find. Really high quality sushi made ahead of time - perfect for a lunch or quick bite after work (get there quickly as they close early). Beautiful hidden courtyard in the back for a nice summer day"}
{"text":"This place is very hidden, the outside looks like a regular building but once you open the door it leads you downstairs and the sushi place is on your right. I just came by for the first time to buy some sushi for dinner on my way home. Sushi is affordable for the amount you get, I came around closing time and the sushi still tastes fine - it probably tastes much better fresh but I'm surprised it still tasted soft and not like it was sitting in the fridge all day! It's not the best sushi I've tasted but it's not the worst, I would definitely come back once in awhile. Server was friendly too."}
