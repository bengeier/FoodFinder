{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised.. When I first entered the restaurant and didn't see any Thai people working here I wasn't expecting much. I am a big lover of Thai food and the food was absolutely delicious.  I have been there 3 or 4 times always get the chicken green curry I order it hot and it is just the right amount of spice without being overbearing. I have also had the pad prig gao which is also very good and the sweet and sour chicken tastes like an authentic thai sweet and sour not a Chinese sweet and sour. It tastes great when ordered hot.  I just wish the price to add shrimp was a little lower. I haven't tried any dish with shrimp yet so don't know if the added price is worth it."}
{"text":"This is our go-to place. I love the Drunken Noodles and Pad Thai. It may not be the most authentic or anything, but for the price point, it is good. I always have leftovers for lunch the next day, which is a plus."}
{"text":"This neighborhood needed a place like this! The service is friendly and fast. I was so pleasantly surprise by the quality of the food. Me and my boyfriend are so excited to have a good Thai place close!"}
{"text":"Fast and fresh! Similar concept to Chipotle except this is Thai food and it's cooked to order. Simple menu with approximately 15 main dishes, 2 soups, and 3 Apps.   The food had great flavor, the service was exceptional and the restaurant was very clean."}
{"text":"This place is fast food Thai food! It's great if you like unseasoned, small portions and over priced Thai food!"}
{"text":"I usually only leave a bad review if the experience is really bad.   Thai rice was good as was green curry.  Pad thai was horrible. Beef tasted old, or was old. Soup was soso...  There are much better Thai restaurants out there... I assuming this isnt owned by a Thai family."}
{"text":"We eat here often and the food is generally good.  We did dine in earlier this week for lunch and it took about 30 minutes to get our food.  That was too long but I didn't think much of it.    This review is primarily based on my experience tonight and is a review of the wait time.  I ordered online and got a one hour window for the pick up.  I thought this was a bit long but let it be.  I showed up at one hour and was told it will be another 15 minutes.  I am sitting in the restaurant as I type.  There are 7 patrons and only one with food.  The rest of us are waiting for pick up.  I know there is a buy one get one free special so maybe this is the problem.  Even with this however I don't understand how difficult this can be.  I suggest they spend some time at Pei Wei or similar competition to learn how to manage a kitchen.  The food is good but this shouldn't take the time of eating at a fine dining establishment."}
{"text":"I love this place. The staff is always so friendly and the food is so good. Literally every single thing that I've had from here has been delicious and I've ordered several different entrees."}
{"text":"The food here is soooo good!  The only reason for the 3 star is that I just got a gift card from my sister that she bought at THIS LOCATION and I tried to use it.... I was told they just updated the systems so couldn't take my gift card.  I'm on a budget- and that was the entire reason I was eating here- to use the gift card!  It was embarrassing and nothing was offered as a way to make up for it.  Great food but if your offering a gift card- maybe make sure people can actually use them."}
{"text":"I used to go to Phuket Thai in the neighborhood. Since it is closed on Monday, I decided to give this place a try. Ordered my favorite dish pad see ew and it tastes too sweet. Spicy level is also way off for Thai food. Food is not too bad but go somewhere else if you are looking for authentic Thai food."}
{"text":"...no one here, sitting for about 15 minutes with no food in sight *sigh*  The food is excellent but if you are fronting as a \"fast food\" chain, you should up the speed of service a bit!  There's 4 workers in the front just standing around... kitchen sounds busy but its not turning the orders around fast enough.  3 stars is mainly for the service, if they can speed it up, i will come back and edit my rating!   *Panang Curry* YUMMY!"}
{"text":"This place definitely deserves 5 stars! My son and I stopped in for dinner and were very impressed.  I loved that the menu was simple.. it has pictures of each meal item and instructions how to personalize it for yourself.  The food was amazing!  I ordered Pad Thai which I have had many times before at many different restaurants, but this was by far the best I had ever eaten. The atmosphere of the place was so pleasant and the service was impeccable.  We will definitely be back.  I think we found a new GO TO restaurant for the area. :)"}
{"text":"My husband and I used to come here almost once a week and their service was always amazing and everyone was always so nice. Lately their service has been on the down side... and I think it's because they are getting busier and busier. I aways get their drunken noodles with half noodles and more veggies and after getting the same order over a handful of times it has now become an issue. I am very disappointed that they couldn't accommodate my request and I'm assuming it's because they were super busy. Which is not an excuse in my opinion esp when they didn't even offer for me to pay extra for the extra veggies."}
{"text":"Terrible food. I ordered a spicy eggplant, it's soaked in sauce, sauce is extremely strong salty with tons of soy sauce and lots of sugar. Terrible. Would not go there again"}
{"text":"Great food and excellent service! Everything is made fresh. It is nice to see a different option to the typical chain restaurant options."}
{"text":"My husband and I are obsessed with this place. Their curry dishes are so packed with spice and the soups have such a deep rich flavor.  This place is awesome. Plus it's reasonably priced and they deliver - how could this possibly be better! We will be back again shortly!!"}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place. When I walked in I was quoted a 30 minute wait. This wouldn't be a problem for me on this night as I had to make 2 additional stops. I returned 25 minutes later but my food wasn't ready. I waited another 15 minutes (40 minutes total). I asked when my 1 meal could be ready. I Was told it would be another 10 minutes (50).  At that point I canceled my order. I was given some lame excuses that the kitchen was short staffed. Manager was standing around the entire time I was there. Why not help out in the kitchen?  No real apology from the manager. He spoke softly to himself about his staffing issues. Not my problem. I won't be back. He made no effort to keep my business. Good luck!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed the location in Dana Park more. I had the chicken green curry here and it was so runny."}
{"text":"This HAS to be some of the best curry I have ever eaten! I just stopped here on my lunch break for the first time and the staff was super friendly, food came out quickly and tasted phenomenal! Like words do not do this food justice, red curry with chicken medium is where it's at! I love y"}
{"text":"Kinda oily but food was good. For $10 bucks I feel like I should get more food. I didnt get a drink with food they should at least add that."}
{"text":"This is amazing Thai food, to go or not. I wish there was one closer to my house. The menu is reasonably priced & the foods always good."}
{"text":"I love this place!!!! Food always so fresh and tasty. The coconut ice cream is to die for!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I just started to get into Thai food recently. I'm really liking Pad Siew. Been here twice and was impressed for it being \"fast food\". The first time I went i got food for myself and my wife. I got beef pad Siew and my wife got chicken pad Siew. Waited longer than anticipated. However, I think the front counter person heard us talk about the coconut ice cream and gave us it to try for free!! Got home and the meat was over cooked but the flavor was really good. Spring rolls were good as were the dumplings. The second time it was quick, and the meat was better prepared. I will be going back :)"}
{"text":"Please let me say that I would give the food 9.5 stars and the service tonight- one star.  This is my 12th time eating the food here. I have always liked this \"fast food\" Thai place!  Myself, like my fellow Yelpers, dine out a lot.  We are cuisine enthusiasts and spend a fair amount of moolah on food.  At my regular spots, I will take advantage of a loyalty program of some sort.    Apparently the employee who took my order did not understand the ins and outs of their program. That's okay, we all make mistakes.  The management on duty who wasn't to interested in saying sorry, did not fully corrected the mishap.   I will update this review if my loyalty account is corrected next time I visit here."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my lunch at this restaurant.  I had mild yellow curry with brown rice, and it was excellent!  It would be great if they offered some lunch specials, though.  Very clean restaurant with lots of seating."}
{"text":"Great Thai food. Inexpensive. Call well ahead if ordering to go as they can get busy."}
{"text":"Food is great for the prices but expect a 30min -1hr wait for food. They do warn you of wait times when ordering in the phone or in person though. I would like to give it a better review as they have legit Thai for the price but this location hasn't gotten their act together in terms of wait time and demand."}
{"text":"I ordered the green curry. I was pleasantly surprised that sauce was pretty on point. Although the chunks of chicken and veggies were way too big.  Made it very hard to eat.  The portion size was large, great for leftovers. For a \"fast food\" Thai joint...it was much better than expected.  Although I prefer authentic, this place isn't too shabby"}
{"text":"Just your  average Thai  place with limited menu.  Feels more like a fast good option.  Website  for pick up was not working at time of order."}
{"text":"Everything is good here and the customer service is phenomenal!! I love this place!! Bonus is they have a rewards program!! ;)"}
{"text":"Great place for Thai. However, don't be hangry when you get here because this is cooked to order and they do a great deal of takeout orders here. The interior is clean and stark just like the name of this place. Gucci Mane would probably not bring his trap queen here bc this ain't no high post type of joint see. Ok so the fried rice is bomb.the soup was really tasty and the pad Thai was delicious too. No complaints whatsoever. I thought the price point was high at first. But when I saw how they hooked it up with the meats and the portion size I realized it was quality you were being charged for and it made sense. Service was excellent and I really liked way the person behind the counter opened my bag up when he presented my order and CONFIRMED all the things ordered were present and accounted for. That was \"extra\" and appreciated. Defin put this one on my to rotation. Their logo is pretty cool too!"}
{"text":"Drunken noodle was flavorful and on point. Pad Thai is way too sweet for my taste bud. During peak hours (I was ther at 7:30pm) the wait was 30 mins. I ended up ask for a refund and left. It's convenient but way too slow for a self serve restaurant. Avoid the peak hours, this might be a place for you if you prefer sweet Thai food!"}
{"text":"I have been here for take out a few times. Last night I went ahead and ordered delivery at home.  Called to check on my order 40 minutes later and they relayed that they were not making deliveries tonight due to staff issues.  I told them that there was no notification on the online system that my order would not be delivered.  I arrived nearly an hour after my order and received cold and soggy food.  NO apologies from any of the staff.  LAME!"}
{"text":"I ordered one of the curry dishes and I was surprised at how salty the food was. I have not had this issue before with curry dishes.  It tasted like someone had dumped a table spoon of salt into the dish. I brought the issue up with the staff and they kindly replaced my dish with something else."}
{"text":"The chicken panang was pretty good but cannot comment on the spring rolls as they failed to include them with our order. Not a positive experience with this place. Tried to appeal for a refund via the website but the link does not work."}
{"text":"Did not care for this place at all. You can get real Thai food at Thai Rama down the street for less money then this place. Portion small. Tofu not cooked enough."}
{"text":"I have ordered Delivery from here twice. Both times the food was delicious and delivery is super fast. I will definitely order from here again."}
{"text":"While the food here is enjoyable, the amount of time spent waiting for food is too long.  We are here eating dinner tonight.  There were two groups of 2 eating already when we arrived and no other customers on-site.  We were told the wait if we decided to order would be 35-45 minutes.  Our last visit we were not given the warning of a long wait time and we still waited over 25 minutes.  The business plan may need to be reassessed because I have seen more people walk out without ordering in these last 30 minutes than I have seen choose to stay and spend their money here.  The team is pleasant but the business is still providing extremely poor customer service."}
{"text":"My husband I are big lovers of the original Thai chili in Gilbert, so when we saw this location open, we came immediately! Flavors are just as great as the original! Fast, delicious Thai food!"}
{"text":"This place has horrible customer service! They entice you with coupons, then don't honor them. Then role out new system to earn discount or free dinners, then do away with that. Now a new one.  Either entice your clients with special offers or don't...and if you do, honor the one you started when changing to a new one!  Take a hint from Starbucks and maybe you won't go out of business!  Food is fine just hate the customer service and Mgr doesn't care either."}
{"text":"I am addicted to the Pad Thai! I never had it before this place opened, but now I can't go more than 2 weeks without it. My husband loves spicy food, so he really likes that he can get anything he orders made super spicy. Portions are generous, and I get discounts through Facebook & email. I'm picky about iced tea, and I really like theirs. Great little take out place, but eating there is an option too!"}
{"text":"I love the dishes here. The flavor profile is a tad different than some Thai places. The quantity is great for the price. I appreciate that they use coupons and systems to reward frequency. My favorite is the pad see ew. The meat is a tad bit tough but I just cut it up for my littles. The tom yum had a yummy flavor. The workers here seem consistently nice. They seem like they will be around for a while which is great!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite Thai place.   Elisaha helped us and let me tell you- his great smile and personality was refreshing.   Food is always consistently delicious and establishment was clean.   If you ever have eaten here before, try it- you'll be pleased!"}
{"text":"This was my first time eating at this place . The food was good but we ordered mild and it was anything but mild. We like some kick but this felt like it was more of medium to hot level of spice. If you put mild on the menu you need to honor that. It was so hot for us that we didn't enjoy it as much had it actually been mild. Service was average."}
{"text":"My drunken noodle was bitter because of burnt pieces and charred bits. I tried to ignore and took a couple bites but it was so bad I had to send it back, which I have never done in a restaurant before. Service was super nice though, offered to remake but being traumatized by their stir fry technique I opted to try curry instead. That turned out just fine. So, I might come back because of nice service."}
{"text":"Great food and very friendly staff!!! I ordered pad Thai hot and it was really good. You can definitely taste that this food is cooked with a healthier oil. I will be coming back here again soon!"}
{"text":"Ordered pad thai with tofu ... Below average salty n soggy noodles with tasteless tofu !! Disappointed as was v excited to see this place near my place .."}
{"text":"I had lunch at this restaurant recently and ordered yellow curry with rice noodles. There is a choice of 3 meats and I got chicken. The taste was excellent, amount of food was fair, and the cost fair. The atmosphere was fast food like but aesthetic. As a restaurant  \"to go,\" I rate this as 5.  As a \" sit down\"  restaurant I would rate it a a 4 because of the fast food atmosphere."}
{"text":"The service was fantastic! Friendly, quick, helpful...   One important thing to know is that the \"Options\" list the spice levels alphabetically and not by spice level. So Thai Hot is actually the hottest even though it's directly under Mild on the list.  I liked my noodles well enough. I'd come back for sure!"}
{"text":"5 stars all the way! I've been here three times in a week and each time I was blown away. Their prices are fair and it makes ordering delivery with Uber Eats a breeze and cost effective. I've never tried curry before but I was so impressed with their Pad Prig Pao, that surely their curry would be good no matter what, and you guessed it, it is amazing. I say is because I am eating while Yelping. The establishment is nice and clean and the staff is fabulous. I told them I had never had curry, he recommend the red curry and I'm loving it. Spicy food lover unite because this place has TWO levels of hot. Hot and Thai hot. Thai hot is not to be joked with so if you are an avid spicy food lover, I'm sure this place will give you the warm fuzzies as liquid lava goes through your esophagus. Don't worry, they also offer a medium and mild. You bet I'll be back to try the other curries and anything else this place has to offer."}
{"text":"As the name implies, this restaurant is meant to serve \"good\" food fast, not fast food, with emphasis on \"to go\".   I saw a lot of \"order to go\". So my dinner took time to come out to my table.   The staff at the counter is polite & efficient. As I ordered my Pad Thai with chicken, I could see and hear cooks behind the counter work their woks.   My Pad Thai with chicken had the right amount of spiciness (medium), but the sauce was too sweet for my taste.   The water here though was straight out of the tap. Chandler municipal water, full of chlorine and other chemicals. Not drinkable. Sorry, but I am spoiled by my RO unit at home.   If I come back, I'll have to order a fountain drink. I am open to try other dishes here."}
{"text":"Fast casual. There is seating but it was full even a little after the lunch rush. Very large portions and inline with the price expectations ($9-10). The Pad Thai is very sweet, in spite of having ordered it \"Hot\" but that can be remedied by just ordering to the next level (in this case, \"Thai Hot\"). The Thai Dumplings were excellent. Worth a visit for quick Thai though the menu is limited then a full service dine-in restaurant."}
{"text":"Have eaten at Thai 2 Go many times. My wife and I go here whenever we are craving Thai food. Like the Green Curry or the Drunken Noodles."}
{"text":"Great price point and portion. I got the beef red curry and fired rice. Both are pretty good. The beef in the curry is just little bit hard, other than that everything was delicious. For the price, its definitely 5 Stars!"}
{"text":"So I am increasing my rating to five stars.  Portions are really good and now they have a loyalty program.  They did increase the prices recently, however there are always local coupons available.  The staff is also really nice and they have a very comfortable waiting area with fresh brewed ice teas.  I recommend panang curry as it has fantastic flavor!"}
{"text":"Pad thai was yucky, it just had a sour flavor. We asked for no meat, add eggplant to the drunken noodle dish, they didn't add the eggplant. Also stingy on the soup amount. This location has gone down hill since we started to eat here in 2016. Time to find a new thai restaurant."}
{"text":"I've been here several times and the food is always good. The service is excellent and they seem to have a pretty solid and stable staff."}
{"text":"We didn't eat in, but ordered the curries to go. The food came in a microwave safe plastic containers. It was very tasty and the price is right."}
{"text":"Pretty good Thai food, and quick. The portions are small and overpriced though in comparison to other full service Thai places in town, and they keep raising prices.  Their weekly emails used to have good discounts/offers, but now even those require you to spend a lot to get a little."}
{"text":"Placed an order via yelp's Eat24 for pickup, and everything was really good!  Food was ready and waiting when I arrived, staff was friendly, and the food was delicious.  Ordered a red curry with fried tofu, green curry just veggies, and fried rice with fried tofu, all medium spice.  Spice lever was perfect.  The green curry was a bit more spicy than the red, but they were both tasty.  They were both very rich, and a little on the sweet side as I think another reviewer mentioned.  The BF loved it all and said we should definitely order from here again."}
{"text":"Food was good, however they gave me chicken instead of beef. Even good restaurants make mistakes. Dumplings are good choice for appetizers."}
{"text":"So I went to Thai Chili 2go  in Chandler and wait was very long but for 2 cooks food was very good  Plus there's Promo for free dumplings and allot People there But over all it was New Year Day and 5Stars For Great Food!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This was absolutely the worst experience at a restaurant. We waited about 20min in the \"To go\" establishment for our food. They brought three of our orders out and forgot one. Then they said it's coming up. After 10 more minutes we still had not got the food. We asked for it and they kept saying that it's coming. They didn't seem the least bit concerned about much.... standing around talking. We asked for a manager and they said he is \"off\" we asked for someone in charge and no one was I charge. We told the girl behind the counter that we're going to be done eating by the time the order comes out. They didn't seem to mind. We then decided to ask for our money back for the order they said oh it's coming..... Wrong answer !!!! I'm Done!! So after some back and forth we got our money back for it. I'll never come back here based on the way these employees handled the situation. Very very poor display of customer service. That is the last $40+ dollars they'll get from me!! Do yourself a favor and drive by this place."}
{"text":"The only reason that I am giving one star is due to the food being decent and the courteous help (6.5 out of 10).   However, if you like waiting 20-25 minutes (if not longer) then this is your place.  On average, we wait less than this at Texas Roadhouse or Olive Garden.  On this last attempt, we waited 25 minutes and only my wife's order was brought out, with the help having no idea when my dish would be ready.  Needless to say, we went to the front counter to ask for our money back.  The manager was unapologetic and only offered excuses as to why our order took so long.  In addition, I heard one of the workers say that our order was forgotten.  Even though this location is by design a place to sit down and eat, it appears that all of the effort is for pre-order pick-up with little help going to sit down customers."}
{"text":"I'm a regular costumer and it pains me to see how quickly this place is changing profit over quality. They started to change real bowls to cardboard bowls and eventually just started giving out the \"to go\" plastic plates to people who dine-in. Would it really hurt you to have real silverware instead of plastic forks? The food is still really good but I wouldn't doubt it going cheap after a while. If your idea was to only sell \"to-go\" then you should re-arrange the place like a dominos establishment where there isn't dine-in tables.   Also there's this guy who begun working a couple of months ago. He keeps sticking his thumb in the bowls every time he serves them. I don't know how he even has a job still, that's gross!!!  Update 5/14/18: Weeks after I wrote this review I feel like they stopped sticking their thumb in the bowls. I think that deserves some recognition. The staff is friendly and the food is still of great quality.   They still serve the food with to-go plates and cutlery, which I do not like because the forks will easily bend at the tip from the hot food. They did change from plastic plates to some form of cardboard bowl I've never seen before. These new bowls do change the taste of the food a bit but not enough to ruin the flavors. They are a deeper than the plastic ones but also narrow, if you like adding your rice to your bowl before you start eating it might make a mess from spilling it."}
{"text":"Yummy, fast and always accurate. I order through Yelp and it's fast as well.  Ordering extra veggies is t worth the extra money but the regular portion is good.  Fried tofu is my fav!"}
{"text":"First time customer here, order to go take out for pick up for a $55 order. Curry and soup orders are put in paper containers and on the ride back home, the heat of the food ruined the paper containers and spilled the contents inside in the car. This is a huge issue - the company needs to invest in better to go containers. Not a good impression for first time customer. I called the he manager to let them know and to their credit they offered to remake our meals to compensate for the inconvenience. I'm not sure if I will take them up on this any time soon. The food was fine and Thai hot is really hot! Be warned on the Thai hot selection!!"}
{"text":"The tom yum gai contains too much lemon grass so it is quite sour. The service is pretty slow...look me 35-40 minutes to get a togo order that consist of tom yum soup and pad thai. There was me and 2 other families that were in the restaurant at that time. 1 of them families already was eating. Thai phucat on arizona ave and ocotillo to panda express is much better"}
{"text":"This was my first time trying this place and happy we did. We placed our work order online the day before and found their website to be easy to use. They have an option to choose how spicy you want your food. I chose the yellow curry which has carrots zucchini Bamboo shoots with my chicken as a protein. I went medium on the heat. We order 11 entrees for 11:45am. Everything was ready when we arrived at 11:45am exactly. They put names on each entree and added forks spoons chili sauce and chop sticks. Back to my curry it was wonderful the heat was perfect and the coconut flavor was light and not over powering and slightly sweet a good balance with the spice of the curry. The chicken was nice and thin and moist not dry at all. Overall I'm impressed and would be up for trying another dish. Glad they are close by. The portion is large also couldn't eat all and had leftovers for dinner."}
{"text":"I finally got a chance to try out this place!  I am extremely happy that I have the opportunity to taste their food. I read some of the reviews which are good or bad. But my experience was fantastic. When we first arrived, we inspected the menu. After about five minutes or so, the line was gone and we approached the counter. The older gentleman was more than happy to explain how it worked and give me a taste of the Pad Prig Pao. I ordered the Pad Thai Mild, Pad Prig Pao in medium heat and Thai Fried Rice.  The Pad Thai was flavorful and with the rice noodles.  The Chicken Thai fried rice had pan seared chicken in it and was very good too. The Pad Prig Pao with chicken and brown rice was absolutely intense. I'm not fond of the Thai Basil flavor, but it may be different here. I want try all the flavors every time I return."}
{"text":"Food was good, but the wait was longer than I expected.  Guess that's why they promote calling ahead of time.   Did seen weird that rice was an extra charge. I had Thai Basil and it was tasty however I was hoping for more veggies.  I'll go back, but call ahead next time."}
{"text":"This is hands down mine and my husband's favorite place to get Thai food! The quality and flavor of their food far surpasses any other place we've tried in the metro Phoenix area. Strongly recommend the beef panang! Their pad thai is pretty great as well. Their management is also A+. Super friendly, willing to help, and even remembered us from frequenting their main location. Only reason I didn't give five stars is because when I ask for no basil, they end up giving me extra basil. Wouldn't be a big deal if we were eating in-house, but 9 times out of 10 they get it wrong and it needs to be re-delivered. It's because of how it's worded in their system though and not really the fault of the employees. Not enough to keep us from coming back at least twice a month for the awesome food though!"}
{"text":"Food is always hot, fresh and delicious. Staff is very friendly and courteous. Prices are very reasonable as well. My family and I get dinner here a few times a month. Pad Siew beef and Drunken noodles with chicken are terrific!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for dinner twice.  Really wasn't to keen to the concept of Thai fast food but I was willing to give it a try.  Prices seem to be fair and they do offer specials via Valpak.    Ordered the Pad Thai at medium heat.  I usually can handle the \"hot\" level heat at other places but since this was my first time, I wanted to play it safe.  Glad I did.  Portion seemed small but that wasn't an issue as I was filled.  Peanuts were served in a separate container which is probably smart due to possible allergies  but I didn't like the fact that I had to ask for lime juice.  The wife order the Panang curry with shrimp and chicken which is her favorite type of curry.  It passed and stayed with it the second time we went there.  The kids ordered Drunken noodles with tofu and shrimp.  I waas impressed with this one cause it had a bunch of veggies and oh so tasty.  So good, I ordered it the second time we went there and this will be my go to dish going forward.    The location is very clean and it was not busy the 2 times we were there.  I have been told that lunch time gets packed so be ready for that.  Of course the real Thai restaurants will probably have more authentic food offerings, but this is close enough for me, especially on lazy nights."}
{"text":"Good food. Reasonable prices. Easy to order online. No complaints."}
{"text":"Came here with some co-workers and the food was really good. First time eating Thai food and it won me over."}
{"text":"I have only eaten here once, but it was really great. I had the red curry with chicken, added cashews which really enhanced the dish. I liked it so much I may go back tomorrow! I hope the quality stays over time."}
{"text":"I found that having my food already in a to go dish was great since I had just a limited time to eat.  Food came out hot and fresh.  I ordered pad Thai medium hot and it was too spicy for me to eat without a beverage.  And I love spicy food.  I will try again sometime and order mild."}
{"text":"Great food but can't stand the grumpy, low esteem and low morale employees. Very poor customer service. I cancelled my Togo order with so much of attitude behind the counter. Food was not ready at committed time for the 4th time in a row. I would not be surprised if this place runs out of business soon. There is a fine dinning Thai restaurant (Phuket Thai) just couple of miles away with superior food, superior service and courteous staff."}
{"text":"It was an okay Thai meal.  I've had plenty and this just wasn't the best.  Underneath everything there was kind of a weird after taste, and the pad Thai had an odd barbeque flavor. I will say did enjoy the Thai spring rolls and dumplings. I probably won't order from there again."}
{"text":"I tried Thai Chili 2 Go a couple weeks ago. I love the concept. It's like a Thai food version of Panda Express. It's good and great if you want some quick thai food.  I wouldn't say it's the best thai food I've had but I would definitely come back.  My husband and I tried the chicken curry and pad thai. He can take spicey food pretty well and we both though the \"medium\" had a kick. I had to load mine with rice because it was spicy for me."}
{"text":"I have to give a huge shout out to both Thai Chili Chandler and Mesa. I ordered thru Yelp and ordered from the wrong store. I called and they transferred my order no problem. They were both so kind and friendly about it. Thank you! BTW the food is DELICIOUS! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This restaurant would be much better if they had a better cook. My family and I decided to eat from this restaurant a few weeks back, and at first we were excited to try the food, until we noticed how obnoxious and rude the cook was! I have never witnessed such rudeness before at the establishment. He was making snide remarks, which I felt highly inappropriate. Because of the cook's crass and distasteful attitude and actions, we will not be back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Like the yellow curry with chicken. I've tried the spring rolls, sweet & sour chicken and the spicy basil chicken. Tonight, I had the Pad Siew- Stir-fried fresh rice noodles with broccoli (substituted for mushrooms) , eggs & soy sauce. All fantastic tasting.   We eat in & the portions are good. Haven't tried take out yet, waiting for the Gilbert location to open as that will be \" take out ONLY\"! This Chandler location & the others ; you order at the counter, pay then they bring your food to the table \"of course they offer take out as well\"! LOL Drinks are served in to go cups & meal served in a decent size bowl.   Prices are fair $10 bucks for the curry $9 bucks for the other dishes-, shrimp options tend to be a little more in cost. Appetizers are generously priced."}
{"text":"Amazing eggrolls to start. Got a sauce noodle dish that I couldn't prounounce and it was great! The hot had me sweating but the thai tea cooled me down enough to keep me going. Hot lovers should probably go to the next level but I loved it."}
{"text":"A favorite lunch spot! Friendly staff and quality food. Gets busy right at 12 because of the businesses nearby, but if you get in just before or after the lunch rush, it's perfect. I recommend the green curry or pad prig pao. Not sure what to try? Ask, staff answers questions. Be warned, spice levels are Thai levels. So Mild still has a kick to it."}
{"text":"Very clean, simple decor, plenty of tables.  All of the staff that interacted with us were friendly, helpful and willing to answer questions.  I had my curry \"hot\" and it was the perfect amount of heat.   Both the curry and the drunken noodles were tasty.  Portion size was good, I left full but not overly full.  Brown rice was tender but not overcooked.  We did not opt for any of the extra add ins so that we could get an idea of how the base meal was.  Next time I will probably add a couple items.  They told us that with the exception of a couple items their menu is glutenfree and even those items can be made without gluten.  This will be good for one of our friends.  While we dined in this time the on-line system looks well put together so will probably use that in the future occasionally.  Looks like a good way to order and pick up on way home from work."}
{"text":"I ordered \"Drunken Noodle\" aka Pad Kee Mao, it taste so good. It was just the way I like it.  Definitely going to suggest this to my friends ."}
{"text":"I decided to give this place another try a few nights ago, but at a different location. The food is great, don't get me wrong! Something that I think this company needs to work on is the way that they allow some of their employees to present themselves.. I've seen food establishments allow their employees to wear ripped jeans and show their tattoos, but something that they need to check with is sagging pants!! Families bring their kids to these places to eat!!!!! I sure wouldn't want my kids to be exposed to a grown man's bare bottom! I don't want them to think that this is an acceptable way to present yourself because it is NOT. I'm writing this review to let everyone know that I will not be coming back to this location. I loved the food (especially the red curry), but I will take my business to one of their other locations if this is the case. This is the second one star review I have written for this company!!!!! What the heck!! Once these issues are fixed I'm sure it will be a better atmosphere. 2 stars for great food, but poor presentation."}
{"text":"Super delish and gives me all the feels!  I have tried many of the dishes and they really are good.  The only 1 con i have is the spring rolls.  They always seem to be greasy and soggy, so that sucks, but the flavor is there.  Just fix that one issue and its a 5!!  The fried rice is awesome and so is the panang, one of my favorites in the valley."}
{"text":"This has become my recent favorite go to place. Best thai food for the price and very clean. I love their mushroom clear soup with rice noodles and also their veg fried rice! Definitely Love this place!"}
{"text":"Granted we tried this place during opening week having received a coupon in the mail...it does not excuse the fact that each of our meals were charred. My husband stuffed down his chicken fried rice, but neither my sister nor I could get past the taste of burnt food. I had the drunkin' noodle and she had the pad Thai. We'll continue making the trek to Thairama, thanks."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch, food was great but the time waiting was ridiculous. We waited for over 40 minutes for 4 bowls.  Other orders were brought out before ours.  This is the first time the wait has been this bad, hoping it was just a bad day."}
{"text":"I was hoping for much more with Thai Chili. My Chandler family loves this chain but my aunt noted it can take forever to be brought out. When they want it, she'll call ahead to order and by the time they arrive it's only a few minutes before it's brought out. Sooo that was a bit of a red flag as I was going thru the menu. Of note too, their website isn't terribly mobile-friendly.  My go-to for Thai is yellow curry or Pad Thai. Both options on the limited menu ( a positive IMO for those not terribly familiar with standard, non-QSR Thai restaurants). They only have 3 heat options- mild, medium, and Thai hot.  Everything is $10 or less, also a positive for wanting Thai food. However, my yellow curry wasn't that great, but it wasn't bad either... just kind of meh. I ordered it medium since I normally go for 3 on a 5 scale. It was a little too spicy for medium and coupled with the fact the curry soup wasn't as creamy nor sweet as expected, I couldn't finish it. Didn't bother to taste my brother's Thai hot bowl since his nose was running. Since it's a new-ish chain, maybe they just need more time to figure out their menu & food logistics. IDK. At least the value of the hefty bowl alone was good for the $10 paid."}
{"text":"Checked this place out for dinner. I liked that I could see into the kitchen, and it was clean. Also I thought it was great to see every member of the staff was hustling and working together.  On the subject of food... I had beef with spicy basil sauce and rice, which I would not recommend. The beef was super chewy, tasted like it was not fresh, and had been microwaved. My boyfriend got a curry with chicken, which was pretty good. We will be back to try other menu items... just without the beef."}
{"text":"SO GOOD! I wasn't convinced about wanting to try the place. However, my boyfriend did so off we went.  -staff was SO FRIENDLY and helpful -the cashier explained everything/gave free samples of Thai Tea/Coffee (HIGHLY recommend trying) -I would honestly go back just for coffee :)  - I ordered the Pad Prig Pao with Tofu/ Bf had Drunken Noodles with Beef  both of us were stuffed- I had to save 1/2 for later & the both of us can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Love this place. Usually.  The guy working the register on 7-1-2017 was an absolute jerk and a moron as well.  He was heavyset with glasses. Everything was an issue for him. He was miserable. He should find another job. He makes the dining experience bad."}
{"text":"I like Thai food a lot and even though I prefer going to authentic Thai restaurants, I think Thai Chili is a damn good standby and because they're always sending out coupons or posting coupons on Facebook, I come here often. I like a good deal, y'all. Anyway, I either order from this location or the one in QC but I prefer this one but it's always packed so I'd advise you to order ahead if you're pressed for time; I learned this the hard way. I always order drunken noodles with no zucchini, bell peppers, or carrots and extra bamboo shoots. Their spring rolls are really good but their Thai dumplings are everything. The dipping sauce they come with is delicious and now I order an extra sauce to pour over my drunken noodles. I took a chance and ordered their yellow curry before and it was way too sweet but the curry flavor was there but now I don't stray from my go-to order whatsoever. If you like good tasting food, Thai flavors, and like a good coupon, I'd definitely recommend Thai Chili. They always have coupons on their Facebook or in the little penny savers that come in the mail every week."}
{"text":"We have been here 4 times already, food has been excellent each time.  They will throw together whatever it is that you like & are nice about it! They have China Mist iced tea, & Stevia sweetener to go with it. Also like that they have a rewards program, for every dollar you spend, you get a point. Once you reach 100 points, you get $10.00 off your purchase. Portions are generous, I usually take 1/2 home and eat it the next day."}
{"text":"Always the fastest service and the food is packed with flavor! Get the dumplings you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"I have ordered food from here a few times via UberEATS and I must say, what a great find! Vegans should be careful here though because they say they're vegan friendly but only a few items on their menu can be made vegan; found that out the hard way. Sadly, none of their curries can be made vegan, only the spicy eggplant, spicy basil, and friend rice. The curries all have fish and oyster sauce in them. I wish this wasn't the case because I LOVE Thai curry so very much.   Anyway, I recommend the spicy basil but make sure when you place your order you tell them you're vegan (if you are of course). I have also tried the spicy eggplant which I didn't really care for as the eggplant was hard and kind of chewy. Overall though, this is a pretty good place that offers a lot of customization and good tasting food."}
{"text":"They screwed up our Uber Eats order, missing one item when it was delivered.  I called them and they basically said there was nothing they could do except make us the dish that was missing...but we would have to come pick it up. Ugh.  I understand the process of Uber delivery and that it would take another 45 minutes for a duplicate delivery/order but the fact the guy wouldn't do anything else was frustrating to me.  I know there wasn't much this person could do, and I'm not looking for a handout but if you want repeat customers and good reviews you need to make this right at all costs.  Food was good though."}
{"text":"Honestly kind of unprofessional, as I walk in I should be greeted and shouldn't see two employees at the counter carrying on a loud conversation about cars exploding... took about 2 minutes to actually ask if I dining in or carrying out. They continued to talk as my food sat on the counter... overall for a Thai 2 go place service was slow."}
{"text":"Hate to downgrade, but after tonight's problems, it's necessary. Ordered online. Received text back that pickup would be ready at 5:51. Arrived at that time. Food was ready at 6:10. They were slammed, with inside customers coming up to the counter saying they had waited 35 minutes. Got food home, Thai dumplings were cold. The rest was okay. If they are going to be popular and busy, they need to get their act together."}
{"text":"We order here through ubereats often and they've been pretty consistent with flavor and spice level. We love it! It's our new go to Thai restaurant. Today I got the sweet and sour chicken and I thought it was going to be some plain generic puffy fried chicken with bright funky red sauce with some veggies but nooooo, it was so much better and sophisticated and amazing! The chicken is grilled and not fried and the veggies and pineapple are also char grilled and it brings so much good flavor to the sauce! The sauce isn't overly tangy either. I usually never order sweet and sour chicken because I always say those are for the boring people that don't know what else to order but wow this is a new fave! The tom kha gai soup is always good and so are their spring rolls. Their spice level is pretty on point too! \"Hot\" is pretty damn hot and \"Thai hot\" is crazy hot."}
{"text":"Yo honestly this is one of my go to places when I'm too lazy to even move so I order it on UberEATS.  Thai food is delicious but, Thai food in the comfort of your home when a stranger delivers it is out of this world.  Side Note: As I continue to write Yelp reviews, I wanted to grow and make my reviews stand out so not only will I rate with the normal Yelp star rating system; I will continually trying to develop new ratings to describe my feelings towards the reviewed restaurant.  BB Rating: LAZY GOOD"}
{"text":"I love this place. The portions are pretty large in my opinion and the flavor is amazing! I've had then pad prig pao at least 5 times and it's better every time. I also appreciate that you can replace meat with 3 veggies for no additional charger. Everyone there is friendly and the food is always made to order!"}
{"text":"yummy for lunch just order ahead, really helps out if you only have a small amount of time. this is my second time here and I'm hooked"}
{"text":"Ok, I did not know about the rewards program...I'm very likely to return to this business, here is why: called in my order and it was ready in under 10 minutes (I'm effin' hungry now, you know), the to-go container/plate was very cool and durable, thank you, the Spicy Eggplant that I ordered (with chicken) was so delicious, you not belief!!! - and it came with a box of rice, of which you can choose white or brown. The price was QUITE reasonable (I think around $8.75 out-the-door) and I was enjoying hot and delicious Thai flavor at home in only minutes. Also, there were the options of: mild, medium, hot, and Thai Hot - I went with the hot because I didn't know what to expect but it wasn't bad so next time Borg is going full-Shizzle Thai Hot. Beaucoup dinky-dow! Haha! If you come here, make sure to pick up their convenient full-color mini to-go menu which has photos and the price breakdowns are denominated in whole numbers (with none of that $0.99 added onto the end of every price...wtf is that all about anyway? Is this some kind of \"clever human\" trick? Totally not working. I like that this place puts a stop to that useless nonsense, let's see more of that.) Everyone is reviewing this place, no one is saying anything bad, so make sure you visit and don't just take my word for it."}
{"text":"I am not a big fan of any Asian fast food restaurant. I dislike Panda Express or Pan Wei....and now a fast food restaurant that serves Thai Food in Arizona? That's the first. Since I was too lazy to cook and we received a coupon in the mail for this place, I figured I would give it a try.  The restaurant is definitely spacious, well decorated, and the menu is easy to follow. The guy who works at the counter is super friendly. He quickly introduced the menu to us. This particular menu allows you to choose (1) curry, noodles or other Thai dishes, (2) choice of chicken, beef, shrimps or tofu; (3) no spicy, mild, medium or hot. I ordered a drunken noodles with beef (medium spicy) and ended up with a drunken noodles with chicken. I wasn't going to say anything until the guy came up to us. I told him the order was wrong but I like chicken just as much. Even though I didn't care, I saw him checking the order receipt and notified the manager right away. On our way out, he even offered to give us another coconut drink for free. We didn't accept the offer, but was happy to see how much they care about their customers.   I have to admit - their drunk noodles dish is as good as the one I have at other Thai restaurants. The noodles are very favorable covered with delicious seasoning. Chicken portion is so generous I ended up taking the rest back home. The coupon I received offered free dumpling (regular price $5). It is a little blend for my taste and I probably will not pay to order that.   This place also has free delivery service if you live within 5 mile radius of this store. I cannot be more happier to have this Thai Chili 2 Go opening in my neighborhood. I'll definitely come back here again to try other dishes."}
