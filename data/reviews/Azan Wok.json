{"text":"This place was awesome! Fast friendly service and the food was delicious. You HAVE to try the pineapple shrimp. We will be back. And SOON!!"}
{"text":"We went here for lunch and as my husband and I were cutting our chicken it was raw and the waitress called the owner and they wouldn't refund our money or give us a new meal. Absolutely nothing. Never will eat there again."}
{"text":"Wow, this place really exceeded our expectations!  The basil shrimp was excellent, the seafood hot pot was very good...and the sushi!  What a nice presentation with a fresh taste.  I'd gotten the salmon roll with apple and it looked and tasted great!   This place has something that I've never seen anywhere...light-up sushi!  That's right, a flashing LED light in a cup surrounded with sushi!  This is really great for kids or kids at heart; what fun and tasty novelty!  Great experience all around."}
{"text":"I've never written a review before but I felt it was necessary to go out of my way to write one for this restaurant. I dine and order take out from here often. This is by far my favorite place to order sushi from. Been coming here since it opened. Sometimes it seems like they have newer waitresses unfamiliar with the menu but I'm always patient with them. I always order an orange dragon roll which i believe is off the menu, they still honor my request however which is so sweet! The location and freshness of the sushi make this place just perfect for me. The specialty rolls are pretty large and creative.  Also, the spring rolls are the best! Always crunchy just the way I like them."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant several times, both for lunch and dinner. I was extremely disappointed on my last visit for lunch. Lunch menu is now very limited, good size portions though. Our waitress's English was obviously lacking and it took a lot to have her understand our requests. The most upsetting was my friend paid in cash and never received her change, when we realized she wasn't coming back with her change, I did not write in a tip on my credit card slip....as my friend took care of both tips with her check!! Was not our intent!! Waitress needs to be able to have a better understanding of the English language. Some of my very favorite items are no longer on menu also, very disappointing. May have to travel back into Monroeville's China Palace, never have a problem there."}
{"text":"Amazing food for affordable prices. Truly a diamond in the rough. 2 amazing dinners for under 30 dollars with leftovers for tomorrow. Amazing service and exceptional food. It may be made to order but based on presentation and taste."}
{"text":"This was our second visit and we were delightfully surprised that they had a trio entertaining that night. The place was full and the wait staff were working hard. Our food was very good. The only downside was that when they took my bottle of wine it came back with pieces of cork in the bottle. The manager apologized and I requested a spoon to fish out the pieces of cork.  The second glass was fine. I was very surprised that they still charged me the $5.95 corking fee. My date asked me to not make s big deal about it so I didn't."}
{"text":"This restaurant could easily grace an international destination city. Fortunately, they are nearby in Plum. The service is attentive and unobtrusive. The timing of the plates is smooth, and the presentation is polished. The calamari appetizer was far from the usual bizarre surprise offered elsewhere. The sashimi plate was arranged in an artful display. The glowing lotus lamp on the plate was amusing and unexpected. Pairing these with an informed flight of sake rounded it off nicely. Why do so many suburban Asian restaurants have high-end German cars parked out front? A new Porsche Macan S? I doubt it belonged to the customers I saw. Somebody's doing well."}
{"text":"Great place for good Asian food in the area.  The restaurant is always clean and decorated beautifully. Service is always friendly and usually very prompt... however, they can get very busy around lunch. That said, the one time I was there and the service was very slow, they went above and beyond and offered every customer a card for a 'free sushi roll or appetizer' as an apology for the wait (and i never even complained!).     I really like their Pad Thai, Lo Mein, chicken with broccoli, and chicken with cashews."}
{"text":"Their roll with jalape√±os and cilantro was great. Otherwise nothing about this place stands out. It's good though and not over priced."}
{"text":"The food is OK. We would order there for takeout about once a month. However, they messed up our order on Valentines Day. We called right away and they said that they would credit our account and they took our name and number. We recently called to order again and NO CREDIT on our account. Needless to say they lost major credibility with us, and our business as well. Management could have made an exception, but instead we will tell everyone we know about their poor customer service."}
{"text":"One of our favorite local places to go for sushi, friendly employees and awesome service. Lunch and diner specials are amazing and not very expensive. I would not hesitate to recommend to family or a friend."}
{"text":"This place is a diamond in the rough. My husband and I enjoyed (way too much) the options Azan Wok had to offer. We chose crab rangoons (filling was delicious), ginger salad with the perfect amount of dressing, egg roll, spring roll, 2 large sushi dishes, 2 small sushi dishes, and my husband ordered general tso's chicken. Upon being seated, you are given those fried, crispy won tons with a dipping sauce that resembled duck sauce. The food came out rather quickly although there was only one server for the entire restaurant. When the food arrived at our table, it was the perfect temperature- hot off the stove. I enjoyed the general tso's chicken, although it was a bit sweeter than most versions I've tried. I also enjoyed the sushi roll that had jalapeno inside. I can't remember the name, but it was unique, crunchy, and FRESH. Our waitress did her best and was friendly, although she was extremely busy and we could have used more refills and napkins during our meal. The quality of food overall was amazing. If you're looking for a new sushi place or just want to branch out from your normal place and try something new, Azan Wok is your answer."}
{"text":"Really good sushi, very fresh. I had the dragon at the Beach app and the salmon roll. Great start. For entree I had the Mongolian beef which was good but not as good as the sushi I thought, but still better than your avg Chinese restaurant. Will be back, also very fair prices!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch, because the place had a good yelp rating and I felt like sushi. The place is real dark inside and has no outdoor seating, which is a bit sad on a warm, sunny fall day. Ordered the sushi bento box, which comes with a miso soup, house salad, spicy crab salad, 4 pieces of California roll, sushi or sashimi (or both) and rice. I had the sashimi, which was three pieces of fish. I was disappointed to discover that the crab salad and California roll were made with surimi, when it said crab on the menu. The quality of the sashimi was also not overwhelming. Service was good. For a wick work lunch it was OK."}
{"text":"It is hard to find anything wrong with this Resturant , at least during lunch. My benchmark, hot and Sour soup, was Excellent. When I first tasted it I noticed it was thinner than most, but,  it only enhanced the flavor. I had Szechuan Chicken, fried rice and an egg roll. All full of flavor and looked good. (See pic). The Resturant was decorated with umbrellas hanging from the ceiling and neat looking lights above your table . Very inviting !"}
{"text":"Ordered take out. The food was good. One of the things we tried were the dumplings and they were exceptional."}
{"text":"The sushi is pretty good, and they have good prices for large portions. Takeout wait is fast. Super nice staff. Good job."}
{"text":"We ordered Azan Wok for the first time to take out for a quick dinner with grandkids.  The gentleman on the phone was very polite, he asked me to hold I could hear he was busy with a customer and another call. I usually take that as a good thing. He return to the phone and politely took my order and gave me a price and time to pick up.  We can on time to pick up. Everything was packaged nicely.  When we got to our grandkids just up the street in Holiday Park, we went right to the table to eat.  Not as hot as I would have liked. I like my chicken in a white sauce. This white sauce was very bland, lacking any taste. Next time I will try the brown sauce. The kids loved the Generals.  It just lacked something I can't put my finger on.  The egg roll was good. A lot of cabbage for my taste but it was good in flavor.  I would recommend. We will try again seeing that the kids enjoyed theirs and it is close to their home."}
{"text":"While this restaurant offers cuisine from several countries - namely China, Japan, Thailand - the best eats for me (vegetarian) have always come from the Chinese dishes.  They have great Lo Mein and tofu/veggie entrees.  The waiter brought out a carafe after taking note of how quickly I guzzled the first diet pepsi haha"}
{"text":"Conveniently close and service has improved since they opened, but wish they'd add more of a variety for their sushi menu."}
{"text":"This has become my go to place for both Chinese and sushi.  It is close to home, so I've dined here at least five times and have yet to be disappointed.  Service is fast and attentive.  The waiter remembered I drink a lot of water so he brought me two glasses right away without me even asking.  Food is flavorful and fresh.  The menu has a fantastic variety of Chinese and Japanese and a good range of dishes ranging from small appetizers and salads to large rolls and full entrees.  The Sushi rolls have clever local names like the golden mile, the plum role and the pittsburgh role.  I highly recommend Azon Wok.  Make sure you check in - you'll get a free soup or egg roll."}
{"text":"Weirdly, this time the fried rice was great! I got the basil fried rice, and when I opened it, my heart sank a bit because it didn't have that nice browned look to it, but it was actually pretty good! I like pleasant surprises.  Also got singapore-style noodles and crab rangoons.  Both were awesome, and just what I was looking for.  Plus, the guy working behind the counter was really nice.  But one thing that I did notice was that the place was empty when I went there to pick up my food! Come on, folks, go eat there!"}
{"text":"This has very quickly become my favorite Asian restaurant around! I've never dined in, always ordered carry out, and they're so quick and my food has always been perfect! And almost everytime I go, there are at least 2 or 3 other people there picking up orders as well.. Apparently my opinions are shared!  I LOVE that they offer such an extensive sushi menu!! My husband can get his typical \"Chinese food\" fix, while I'm able to have my beloved sushi.. and it's really good! My favorite is the Crunchy roll.. soooo good!"}
{"text":"I have lived in Florida for the past 10 years right outside Orlando so the restaurant choices were endless.... I just moved back to murrysville and ordered from here and this is without a doubt the best general tso chicken I have ever tasted... Will be coming here on the regular... Large portion enough for 2 or 3 meals so the 14 dollar price is well worth it.... Thanks for a great dining experience"}
{"text":"I didn't actually eat in the restaurant, I ordered take out. However, my family loves this place and the sushi and seaweed salad that I ordered were fresh and very tasty! I will definitely be ordering from there again."}
{"text":"LOVE Azan Wok!! I order from here often, both take out and eat-in. Their sushi is wonderful, fresh and super delicious. My favorite is the Philadelphia roll. Also the best crab Rangoon around. Seriously... It's amazing. My favorite entr√©e to order is the chicken pad Thai. They also always have coupons for $5 or $6 dollars off and sometimes even a free egg roll if you sign up for their emails."}
{"text":"Had szechuan shrimp for lunch. The shrimp was good, but I'd have liked more variety in the veggies. It only had julienned carrots and celery. The egg rolls are pretty good, and portions are great for the price."}
{"text":"This is barely a mile from where we recently moved so I think that gives it major props already. My company orders from this place quite a bit so I've had their take-out and dine-in experience. The staff is a little slow when it comes to understanding coupons and the dinner prices are too high to always go, but I would recommend the lunch specials. The newsletter signup gives you the occasional coupon, so it's worth it to get the deals. The presentation and food tastes pretty good. I especially like their bento boxes."}
{"text":"This place is alright, the portions are pretty big though the amount of rice they give you is pretty small; my main issue is the lack of flavor. Recently, I had ordered the Szechuan noodles and even with all of the chili oil it tasted like plain spaghetti noodles with the other stuff thrown on top and didn't really taste very mouth numbing (like most Szechuan dishes) until I put some sriracha on it at home. I probably wouldn't eat here again."}
{"text":"Another slightly more upscale restaurant comes to Plum.  (Along with Uncle Buckles.)  My daughter and I got some sushi, an egg roll, general tso, and beef rice noodles.  I always judge a Chinese restaurant by the quality of their general tso chicken, and Azan Wok passed with flying colors.  The chicken was light and crisp, not heavy at all.  The other food was very good as well.  The only negative was that our waitress must have been new, since she seemed somewhat confused and generally not particularly helpful.  But overall, Azan Wok was a pleasant surprise.  We will be coming back."}
{"text":"I have visited this restaurant many times since they opened several years ago.  I never had an issue until they got a new person answering the phones for take out orders.  I called a few weeks ago to order Tri Sizzling which I always get.  The guy said he didn't have that on the menu.  After going back and forth about 10 times I finally just hung up and went somewhere else.  Tonight I ordered the Tri Sizzling (he found it!!!!!) and asked for white rice and brown rice.  Got home and got only brown rice.  I hope your business doesn't suffer from this change in personnel.  He really has a hard time understanding what you want to order.  What ashame!!!"}
{"text":"Udon noodles were delicious, as was the spring roll. My husband had the special, coconut chicken, it was very good."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in the area.  Consistently good food....I wish I lived closer!  Sushi is great too."}
{"text":"I want to like this place more.  The inside has a nice warm atmosphere.  I know a lot of chinese restauraunts are trying to cover more asian cuisine than just chinese.  I got the Pad Thai.  I also know that good Pad Thai only comes from a good Thai restaurant.  This Pad Thai was close to being really good.  It was very heavy on the noodles, I like noodles, but it was missing the crunch of the sprouts, they were very few.  It was very sweet with very little spice even though I asked for extra hot.  It was not terrible, I'm guessing Thai dishes are not the strong dishes to get.  I plan to return to try something else, probably sushi or a roll of some kind."}
