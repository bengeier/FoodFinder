{"text":"I woudn\"t eat here if you are hungry. I specifically got the 3 chicken enchaladas instead of 2 because I was hungry. They give you this extreamly thin enchaladas with a little rice and beans. Looks like alot when they bring it out but like I said hardly no chicken in the enchaladas. I had to order another basket of chips and salsa to get filled up. Food is fair nothing to write home to mom about that is the little they give you. I guess they figure the less food they give you more profit for them. First time there but I won\"t be going back."}
{"text":"The food was very good and the wait staff were very fast and friendly. The drinks were refilled before they were empty."}
{"text":"I guess my opinion is in the minority on this one. The server did not really understand the menu and wasn't really interested in going to ask anyone to answer any of the questions we had. My wife ordered a vodka lemonade and was given a well vodka for a premium price without being asked for a preference. Make sure that you let them know what liquor you prefer. No refill on soda I was drinking, just not very good service. I asked for green sauce to put over my tamale cuz it was kind of dry and they charged me $2 for a small side. Mexican restaurants I go to the sauces are complementary. The tamales are are delicious but the carne asada was dry and tasteless, and the guacamole that was included with the carne asada would have fit on the head of a dime. 15.99 Carne asada ordered medium rare came well done.  Very disappointing experience overall.  The hostess was great, and her authentic outfit was cool."}
{"text":"This is one of the best restaurants in Henderson! The staff are all extremely nice and the food is incredible! They will not let you leave disappointed."}
{"text":"Awesome food. I am so glad Casa Don Juan has a location for the Henderson area.  Our server Jose Quintan was great.  Outstanding service!  Awesome food.  Taste just like the original location on Main St.  I will definitely be back!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place was great. The food and service were both fantastic. Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"What a great experience. Cesar our server and Julian and Luz and whoever made them selves known at are table were beyond amazing. The food is some of the best in Las Vegas. Thank you for the great experience. We will be back."}
{"text":"Just discovered this jem. Service: great. Food: muy bueno. Ambiance: way cool. I am a fan of Frida Kahlo. Try the machaca and eggs! Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"While our server and assistance we really super nice, our food on the other hand was not.  My husband and I ordered the same meal, with the exception, he changed the filling in his enchilada.  My meal arrives, and is barely warm.  I know it had been hot at some point as the cheese was melted on top of my beans and enchilada. I should mention we arrived well before the usual dinner crowd, and there are maybe half a dozen table filled.  I'm hungry and decide to go ahead and eat it (I don't care to make a fuss in a restaurant).   Beef taco: the meat is barely more than room temp and salty, the fried shell is soft and greasy. Beef enchilada: I asked if they offered a green sauce.  Our waiter said \"yes, its a bit spicy\", perfect. The enchilada was basically the same as the taco, except rolled with the cheese on top.  Soggy, oil dipped tortilla, barely warm meat and no flavor what so ever to the sauce. Chile Relleno: had to most off putting fishy taste! Both mine and my husbands. Our waiter ask \"how is you dinner?\" We tell him the relleno's have a very odd fish taste and we can't eat them.  He apologizes. The manager comes to our table.  We explain the odd and off putting fish taste. He asked if we'd like different ones or something in there place.  We say \"no thank you, please remove them from our bill\".   He says \"okay\". Our bill arrives with no adjustment.  I took the bill to the cashier and explained that the manager was to adjust our bill.  She said she would take care of it.  Fifteen minutes later our waiter returns to our table with our bill and apologies, the manager has taken 10% off our bill to address the issue with the relleno's.  We feel that this doesn't reflect that 30% of our meal was inedible.  The manager returns to our table for what basically becomes an argument over what he thinks is fair and what we think.   End result, reluctantly he removed one of our dinners from the bill after what was a unnecessary conversation about how the relleno's where horrible.   There are a lot of Mexican restaurants in this valley to choose from. Poor service I can overlook when the food is excellent.   But poor customer relations, we will not be returning to this Casa Don Juan, nor will my husband and his company patronize the one downtown."}
{"text":"I'm always looking for a good Mexican restaurant, but I've been spoiled by good homemade food.  I had the fish filet and the tilapia was overcooked.  The Diablo sauce was weak.  When I asked for a hotter salsa, it was a habanero sauce that did not have a good blended flavor.  To add an insult, they charged me extra for it.  The beans were mushy and the rice was overcooked and under flavored.  I asked about tamales, but the waiter said they were the kind with thick masa like the rest of the low cost Mexican places.  The salsa that came with the chips was quite watery.  To be honest, it's not any worse than other Mexican restaurants in Henderson.  Perhaps people here have never had really good Mexican food.  There are at least two takeout places here that are less expensive and have better food.  That said, the ambiance was good and our server was superb."}
{"text":"Best Mexican restaurant in town!! Try it you will not be sorry. Fantastic food, friendly service, and we always leave satisfied. I am from Texas and miss my Tex-Mex style food, but this restaurant really hits the spot. Have to come at least once a month. We recommend this restaurant to everyone that comes into town and have always heard great things."}
{"text":"Disappointed. The service is good and that is where it stops. The red sauce is so sour it ruins the taste of everything it touches. The seasoning on the shredded beef taste rancid. The rice taste like the box mix you get at Walmart. The funnyman waiter needs to go."}
{"text":"This incarnation of Casa Don Juan's in the Southeast valley is virtually the same cuisine found on the original location on Main and Charleston. If you have visited that place before you will be happy to know that this new location, formerly known as Jaliscos is now the nicely redecorated Casa Don Juan's.    Three of us went there yesterday after reading about the new location as it was in our neighborhood and therefore very convenient. With a pitcher of the house margaritas to start, we then had a lunch too large to finish. Bonus food for later!   Carlos our waiter was affable and humorous, so we recommend asking for him.   With all the Mexican restaurants in this city, of which a good number of them we have tried, I have to say that Casa Don Juan's is the best of the best.   You will enjoy you yourself.   Also they have a huge area for large events to accommodate  seating for at least 75 in one room. Banquets, social events, weddings all could be done there with ease."}
{"text":"Lunch was great, the new waiter was super nice...  but... he could not remember the orders to split the check  the worst part was the happy hour margaritas, the are advertised as 2 for 9.99 this a great list of flavors! However when u get in and order all of the flavors are not an option, only the standard flavors are. Totally messed u the plan, it's all good though cause the food was delicious!! But sadly no margaritas"}
{"text":"I love this place. In fact, I love it so much I drive 30 miles to get there. We sit in the bar and the service is always awesome. The drinks are 2 for 1 after 2PM (M-TH) with a great deal on happy hour food. My favorite is the chimichanga - made just how they are supposed to be. I have never been to the downtown restaurant, and even though the reviews reflect that the place on Sunset doesn't match up, we have always been happy when we leave."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to give Casa Don Juan another shot since our last experience was not a pleasant one.  I was welcomed when I walked in and they sat us right away at a booth.  Cesar was our waiter and he is awesome! He has such a positive attitude and really welcomed us. I ordered the pomegranate margarita and requested the pomegranate pieces since that's how I've had the margarita in the past. The bartender made the margarita exactly to my liking and it was delicious.  My husband and I ordered carne asada dinner and Cesar suggested we order the one with cheese enchilada which was the same price. The carne asada was very flavorful and tender. It was one of the best pieces of carne asada I've had at a restaurant in a long time.  I've always seen the dessert display and never ordered but this time I asked Cesar if there was Tres Leches. He checked to make sure it was fresh and moist. The tres leches was absolutely delicious and very flavorful.  I have to say Cesar really made this a great experience and I will be back again!!"}
{"text":"Most Mexican restaurants offer several versions of combination plates in which you can get one of each kind of enchilada on one plate or you can get several items, such as enchilada/taco/ tamale/relleno on one plate.   Casa Don Juan does not. They actually have an extensive menu, but it does not have the flexibility to allow customers to get the exact combination they want.  The quality and taste of the food is excellent. The food arrived quickly and the service was good, although the servers have a tendency to hover and grab your plate as soon as you put down your fork."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying one of these restaurants here in the valley. I have to say it was great food and the atmosphere was very bright and colorful. I loved it here. The pricing is a little on the higher side, but I would say it is definitely worth it. Going a bit earlier in the day also helps you avoid a lot of the lunch/dinner crowds."}
{"text":"We go here often since it's close to home. Food is consistently good and service is also. Recently we arranged a dinner for 20 with management and they cared for us well and accommodated our needs. Our waiter was Raul, very attentive and helpful. He really worked hard to make sure we had what we needed and were happy. He and the rest of the staff took great care of us even though such a large party. Kudos and thanks to Raul and his helpers! We are pleased Casa Don Juan moved into this Henderson location on Sunset and remodeled it so nicely. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday dinner, and was excited to try the food and the homemade tortillas, unfortunately the tortillas did not taste homemade at all, very disappointing. They also  sing a bday song and give you a sombrero to wear but I thought they would at least give me a complimentary dessert... Nope. Sadly, the mission to find a good Mexican sit down restaurant in the Henderson area continues."}
{"text":"We went to Casa Don Juan late in the evening close to 9 pm and were still able to get seated. The place was pretty empty tho. We were greeted warmly my the host and our server and the chips and salsa were amazing as were the margaritas, and very well priced. The decor is very cute and it's so well decorated in there.  I got an enchilada and taco and it was really good. Definitely nothing too special or better than any other Vegas Mexican restaurant but still tasty. It was a very large portion so I was super full after.  The only complaint I have was service beginning to decline as the evening got later. I know you want to go home but if you're open late you have to keep helping us. We kept having to physically go find our server to get us another margarita or to get our check. We thought they were just closed because no one would help us but then we saw more tables get sat. It was confusing. Overall I enjoyed the experience and would come back for the good food and affordable prices."}
{"text":"This place was excellent. Food was delicious and service was perfect. I would definitely come back and I would recommend. The mole, tamales, chile rellenos, rice, beans, and Salsa were on point. Glad to have this restaurant in our area. Coming from Los Angeles you have so many good Mexican restaurants but here you have a few in glad to have casa Don Juan in Henderson."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, great food, decent prices!  Staff is very friendly and accommodating. Bean dip and salsa served with chips. Cinco de Mayo with live Mariachi group! Great performers!   Convenient location at Sunset and Pecos."}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican food! Delicious! I can say this brings back so many amazing memories of great, home cooked Mexican food. So glad I found this gem   1- ate the #17 Steak was cooked to perfection with grilled onions on top.  2- the mole dish was super yummy. A little on the sweet side - reminded me of pumpkin pie. So good !   3- wet chicken burrito for the teenager. He said yum!  2 for $10 happy hour margaritas hit the spot!  Had the guacamole and the cheese dip for appetizer. The guac was just a tad too spicy for the kids. The cheese was super yum.   Celebrating a birthday! They came out to sing and put a hat on my friend. They gave him a shot of tequila and shook the sombrero right after !!   Love the decor! Everything Frida and Diego! This place is home for Mexican America families !!   Fernando was our server! Much love to an awesome guy!! Great job!  See you again soon"}
{"text":"Really good Mexican food and the service was excellent; our server Cesar was great and had great recommendations! Really good margaritas! Must check it out!"}
{"text":"We tried it for our first time a week or so ago and the staff was great & food was excellent... I would highly recommend anyone trying it if you are looking for authentic Mexican food.."}
{"text":"Jalisco Cantina fan here. That's right, I was a regar patron of the Mexican restaurant that used to occupy this space.   All I can say is: Bring Back Jalisco Cantina!  The menu is almost the same, except prices are 40-70% higher. On everything!   The decor is almost the same, except now the papel picado is personalized with the Don Juan name and logo.  Speaking of Don Juan, get ready for a LARGE side of sexism and machismo with your chips and salsa. All the servers are male, while the females have been relegated to lesser roles of hostess.   Also? The route to the bathroom makes no sense and feels like you have to cut through the kitchen.   The kids meals cost $7-8, are tiny, and no longer come with a free scoop of ice cream.   The menu says you get one and only one basket of chips and salsa for free. However, they gave us multiple baskets for free.   Keep your fancy skirts, your personalized papel picado, and bring back the decent prices we had with Jalisco Cantina."}
{"text":"First time eating here.  Food was fabulous.  Authentic Mexican and great service.  I'm usually skeotical about rice but this was fluffy and the beans had some great and flavorful.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Came here thinking it was the previous restaurant we used to come to.  We had breakfast and ordered Chilaquiles Rojos and Huevos Rancheros   The sauce for the huevos was very watery and bland. The rest was just okay."}
{"text":"LOVE this place!  Food is amazing and staff is super friendly!  Our waiters Isreal and Raul were the best!  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Ate here at this location for the first time and was very good ! The food itself is average Mexican food but service was amazing!  This location is very nice and smelled great walking through the doors ! They have a very large selection of food ! The guacamole is a little on the bland side and could use salt , pepper and garlic ! The bean dip and salsa was good ! My wife had the cheese enchiladas and they were really tasty but the beef taco was very soggy and average! I had the carnitas and it was cooked perfectly with just the right amount  of char!   Our servers were super nice and on top of our every need ! Did not take pictures as feel they would not bring any value but you will get plenty to eat and have a great experience!"}
{"text":"I had the shrimp tostada and she had the enchilada & chile rellenos. You can always use the condiments at your table to touch it up but a little too Bland For our taste buds but the service is exceptional, the restaurant is very nice and very clean including the bathrooms."}
{"text":"Very authentic! They greeted us en espanol and seemed genuinely happy to have us there and to serve us. They sang happy birthday to a table nearby and actually seemed very excited to wish the gal a feliz cumpleanos. The food was pretty good which is why I gave 4 stars. Cucumber margarita was great! Burrito seemed the best thing that our table ordered which I believe is their speciality. The decor is great! I would go back and I would also encourage people to go! All around great spot."}
{"text":"While exploring Nevada I found this resturant on Yelp, initially i was drawn by the pictures of the inside of the resturant as it was beautifully culturally decorated.  When my friends and I got there it was very inviting and colorful, just like it was featured online. The first thing I went to was the drink menu - I was drawn toward the Mezcalitas, similar to a Margarita but with Mezcal, and it was offered in 5 flavors: I had jamaica initially. My friends had the tamarindo, mango and cucumber. The best flavor was tamarindo! The rim of the glass has salt that derives from a mezcal worm - don't ask, but it was delicious.  For lunch I had the breaded fish - it was very tasty and filling. We were all very satisfied with the food, drinks and hospitality. Margarita was not our waitress but she took care of us and was very attentive. This establishment should be really honored to have someone like her working there."}
{"text":"Great food highly reccomend. Great for drinks as well. By far my favorite preparadas that come in a frosty glass mug.  And the location is great cause once you eat and drink youre already downtown and can visit all the shops on main street."}
{"text":"We were disappointed. The bean dip and refried beans were delicious, that's it! The guacamole wasn't very good at all, wasn't a chunk of avocado in it! My carne asada was way too greasy! I sent my flour tortillas back because they were stale and tasted like lard. Waiter brought me the tortillas, not eatable. My husband said the red enchilada sauce tasted like it came from a can! The service was great but we won't be going back."}
{"text":"Went to Casa don Juan Mexican food for my father-in-law's 80th birthday there was a group of us about 25 the service was excellent the food was hot and yummy would go there again"}
{"text":"Every time I come to Casa Don Juan no matter what location the food is always delicious. We visited the location on Sunset that is fairly new and were a little bit disappointed to find that the service was not up to par like it is in other locations. The restaurant was fully staffed and it was very busy. Upon walking in we were greeted by the manager and a hostess who both had no smiles on their faces. Instead of a warm greeting, they presented us with irritated faces. We disregarded the greeting as we thought maybe they were busy and overwhelmed. Once we were sat at our table we were greeted by the server and his assistant who both smiled and were very welcoming to us. Dinner was served promptly and the dishes looked appetizing. As the night went on I noticed that the manager was in the way of the servers a lot blocking the doors that go in and out of the kitchen. It seemed like he didn't care that they were working so hard and just wanted to stand in their way. Servers and bussers were forced to manuver around him in order to get their jobs completed. This was disappointing to see and made our experience just a little bit negative. We hope to see more of the crew smile and enjoy their job a little bit more on our next visit. We hope that management will be more friendly and inviting next time. We also hope the manager will change and become a team player rather than a posing peacock hindering service."}
{"text":"I've been to the one downtown but it's been years. The place is easy to find, food was delicious and servers were very attentive.  We had cheese and chicken enchiladas, carne asada burrito, margaritas and a red beer.  The green sauce is a little spicier than I was expecting but then I was also earing the chips and salsa and that is also spicy.  I thought the prices were fantastic, $12.99 for a 2 enchilada combo plate.  We will definitely be back. I'm excited this has opened in the Henderson area!"}
{"text":"Another dicing adventure for myself, my ex and our friend Polly.  The die chose this restaurant from the list of over 600 Vegas restaurants.  First time here.  The Decor was nice and we asked for a booth and had no issue with that, I rolled and Polly had to choose an item off a section of the menu for me that the die chose, Unfortunately it chose a whole fish dish--Yeah, I am sure some people have no issue seeing a dead lifeless fish staring up at them from the plate but for me it was not something I was looking forward to.  My ex had to get a drink of The die's choice and he ended up with coffee which he says was good.  Friend had to get a drink of my choice and i stuck her with an agua Fresca pineapple flavored which she liked but she liked my strawberry agua Fresca much better as did I.  The waiter was friendly in patiently explaining a couple menu items to us but that was when it turned and went downhill.    The food came out and I started shaking--Panic attack?   Overwhelmed by how gross the plate looked?   Maybe its that I am 99% Vegan, though I doubt it because I am doing this for health reasons not because of the animals (though subconsciously maybe)    Anyhow, Friend took a bite out of curiosity and then I took the bite I had to take per dice living rules and it tasted ok but I just could not handle seeing it on the plate so we asked for a to go box--The waiter seemed surprised but brought it out, I ate the beans and rice and the tortillas which were great, asked for extra salsa and chips but he kept coming over asking if we were finished yet...We still had plates of food so I would say, No...This happened 3 times...  Then at the end when he took my plate, he hands me the bill, no..would you like dessert?   would you like an after dinner drink *we dont drink but still...Just here is the bill.   Was he offended that we wanted a box for the fish?   Maybe we ordered it for the cats--I mean..why does it matter, we werent rude about it!  Oh well, Polly liked it but said that she probably wouldnt choose it again as she likes to keep trying new places, neither of us would try it again either.     Bathrooms were nice and clean.   :)"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service! So glad to have one on the south end of town now! Their white queso dip is my fave!"}
{"text":"We went to Casa Don Juan for Valentines dinner. Waiters were very polite. The salsa that goes with chips was phenomenal. I ordered the chicken and steak fajitas. It was so good. Chicken and the steak were cooked were cooked perfect and they throw peppers onions and tomatoes on it. 2 modelos later. I forgot the flour tortillas are hand made and so tasty, I had 4 with my fajitas. The serving size was borderline 2 person meal. I highly recommend eating here if you are in the Henderson Las Vegas area."}
{"text":"We are regulars here. Good food and great service!  This particular location has beautiful displays dedicated to Frida Kahlo.   https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.bbc.com/news/amp/entertainment-arts-44466102  Appears I can't create a link to the segment but it's from the BBC News website. I wish I had seen this before eating here the first time. Really impressive dedication."}
{"text":"Service was very good, and the place is very festive and attractive.  Unfortunately, the food was very bland, not at all outstanding, and the use of microwave ovens is obvious in the texture (rubbery) and quality of the servings.  I was very disappointed, and will not be returning."}
{"text":"Service was great. Very friendly and informative on the items I had questions about. Food was excellent and large portions. Will definitely go here again."}
{"text":"I don't usually go to Mexican Restaurants when traveling. Nothing against them but i would rather not be disappointed. However, my wife and kids wanted some tacos. Luckily this place was awesome! I ordered the ceviche and seafood cocktail. My wife ordered the carnitas plate and my kids ordered different types of tacos. Everyone enjoyed their meals thoroughly. I would recommend this place without a doubt!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is very nice. Not terribly loud. Kid friendly too.   The food is excellent. They have one of the best salsas I've had. Just enough heat, but not over the top.   Staff are friendly and kind"}
{"text":"Excellent ..... I'll be back often.  Caesar is an excellent server, food is great, and the drinks are not disappointing."}
{"text":"It's understandable that on a super busy night you could possibly become that one table that may get a little neglected?? Or not!! We came here on a Friday night the place was kind of packed but I've seen worse. We got seated after a 15 wait, and soon there after chips, salsa, and frijoles were placed on the table. After approximately 20 minutes we were wondering if ever we would be offered any drinks!! Another 10 minutes goes by and the waiter finally comes to the table for drink and food orders, at this point I was ready to go the bathroom and drink from the faucet!!!  It took no less than 15 minutes for 4 out of 6 of the drinks to arrive, 5 minutes (most) of the good we ordered arrived.  The food isn't terrible, but certainly nothing to write home about. This 1 star review is about the service only.  I even complained to manager (something I've never done!! EVER!!) manager didn't seem to care. I asked the waiter what happEned here and he said \"I have no control over the bar or kitchen\"...  place is a joke when they're overwhelmed with customers trying to give them money!!!"}
{"text":"If you've been to the downtown location on Main St, prepare for utter mediocracy.   This location is tucked away in a strip mall on Sunset near an abandoned Jack in the Box (turned Starbucks) that I saw two homeless people living in front of. What a glorious sight.  Upon entering the restaurant, it is completely different from the Main St location. Very small and cramped, not as friendly. Tables are all visible and obviously trying to stuff as many people as possible in a small place. This place used to be another Mexican restaurant, which was very mediocre also. Casa didn't do many changes to it to make it their own.  Food was not nearly as good as Main St. location. Even though we live less than .5 miles away, we will be driving the 25 minutes to the Main St. location in the future."}
{"text":"love it here. great food. best mole around!  always great service too!"}
{"text":"Delicious authentic Mexican food. Their food is so good and the service is great. They pay attention to every detail during your visit. The food really never disappoints! Love this place!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious Mexican food. Definitely a local favorite. The staff is friendly, timely and attentive. If you like tacos, you'll love theirs. My favorite are their lengua tacos."}
{"text":"Our new favorite Mexican restaurant. We have been looking for 3 years for a really good Mexican restaurant. We finally found it.  The food is excellent. Service excellent, fast and friendly. Manager very nice. Clean. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We have been going to SuperMex and Jalisco for years, the food has always been amazing. We saw it has changed to new management and decided to try it out with our family of 5.   I'm in the service industry and understand both sides but we had hands down one of the worst servers ever!   Our food sat in the window for about 15 minutes while the waiters goofed off and never got refills for our drinks, we left unsatisfied.  After sleeping on it, my mothers as still displeased with service and decide to modify the manager, Denise. Denise said she knew exactly what waiter we were talking about and will make it up if we gave the restaurant another chance.   Went in there tonight, a party of 2, and Denise made it up by giving us a whole 15% off!   I will never go back to the restaurant EVER again. We still took care of the bartender Evian because it wasn't his fault.  Chapala and Lindo Michoacan are much better choices for service and food.   HORRIBLE CUSTOMERS SERVICE."}
{"text":"We used to go to the down town location. So glad they are in Henderson now. Love, love this place. The food is fresh and delicious. The service is always amazing. I was surprised at how weak the margaritas were this time but not the norm."}
{"text":"The food was really good. My husband had a carnitas burritos and I had 7 sea soup and my friend had a tamale and enchiladas. All was hot, came out pretty fast and the service was good. I like how they decorated the place. I will be back soon."}
{"text":"Used to go to casa Don Juan in Las Vegas excellent food New location in henderson food is just as good Excellent Cadillac margaritas and excellent posole"}
{"text":"Food is great service is awesome I've been going to the one on Main Street ever since I was a kid I now have one up in Summerlin that I go to quite regularly I highly recommend the watermelon jalapeno margarita it's actually quite excellent"}
{"text":"This place is amazing great service and fresh food !"}
{"text":"My first experience with Casa Don Juan was at the original location in downtown. One that I had no idea it was one of the oldest Mexican if not the longest standing one in Vegas. So once my friends went with heard they were opening there three location near there house. It was the perfect spot for get together with the same friends plus another group of friends visiting from 808.   One thing that at times can be hit or miss with franchises or multiple locations consistency of the food. I had wonderful experience on my first visit. Thankfully my second visit would honestly say everything was on point again. The fresh cooked chips and fresh salsa had all the same characteristic. One of the best chip and salsa start with before order. My second visit decided to go with4 enchiladas de pollo cestilo michoacan. I went with the hotter salsa or green one. It was deceptive come to the heat. You might not taste it at first but the burn will come. One thing about Mexican food can count on is getting bang for your buck. The amount of food you get is no joke. My plate was completely full more like mound (the shredded lettuce on top just above covered everything) you could not even see the enchiladas. The mixture of flavors from the hot green salsa, refreshing shredded lettuce, and the enchiladas was devine. I pretty much destroyed the whole thing!!!  The menu always fan of the diversity. At Casa Don Juan slightly ridiculous see menu eight pages or more long. Beauty of it is could go back few weeks or would say month not eat the same thing twice. Just saying. lol.   The staff was just as awesome. Friendly, attentive, personnel, and awesome. The interior not as much stuff packed all over the walls. The parking situation is great cause in little shopping  mall and really in better area then the original one. It right off sunset rd so easy get to from anywhere in the valley. Unlike original one it has two separate areas bar and dining area. Still had the margarita chalkboard outside, dessert display case for the cakes, and got that Casa Don Juan vibe. The walls definitely not the same personality but still like the interior.   The food is totally legit. Now with three locations around the valley. If you pass one, never been, need to get your Casa Don Juan fix in!!!!"}
{"text":"César is amazing!  Great food great service!! I like the one downtown but this place is fantastic!"}
{"text":"In my 4 years of living here all that I had heard was Casa Don Juan had the best Mexican food in Vegas so I was so excited when I saw the sign that Casa Don Juan was going to open where Jalisco's once was. Maybe my expectations were a little high since after eating here I realized that for me this was not the best Mexican food in Vegas.   The good: Salsa for the chips was amazing. I think I could of drank the bowl it was so yummy. Super fast service. Diet coke tasted extra good. Grilled (?) tortillas on the tacos rather than the normal store bought crunchy kind.  The not so good: Rice tasted stale and had very little flavor. Beans were ok. Cheese enchilada was ok but nothing real special.  The worst: Beef taco, after taking the first bite I thought I was going to throw up. The meat was disgusting! Tasted like dirty dish water.   I will probably try this place again since it has only been open a few weeks but I was not impressed at all. I left so disappointed and missing Jalisco's."}
{"text":"So we tried this joint out last night. The ambiance was ok. They kept most of the same furnishings that were there when the restaurant was Super Mex/ Jaliscos. The theme is Dia De Los Muertos now, which was cute enough. The staff is dress in traditional Mexican clothing which I liked. The hostess must have been keeping with the theme of Los Muertos because her lack of personality and zombie like stare was a bit creepy. She seemed bothered that we wanted to sit in the bar area,  once we were in there I realized why. It must double as the employee lounge, because that's where they were all hanging out on phones, the young lady who I assumed was management was so laid back she could have been ready for a nap. Now the food.... Honestly it was mediocre at best. The guacamole was lacking in flavor, the salsa was very watery. The queso dip tasted more like warm crema rather than cheese. On to the entrees... I had a combo plate with a taco, enchilada, and Chile relleno that came with rice and beans.  The taco was OK, I think the shell was an Ortega premade or similar, the enchilada was ok as well, it was probably the best of the 3 items, the Chile relleno was disgusting, so much so that I brought it home for my mom to sample, as she is a relleno connoisseur. She agreed it was the absolute worst attempt at a Chile Relleno she'd ever had. The entree was priced at $16 it was worth $6 at best. The menu has over 100 items on it, so it's hard to believe anything is made fresh. Also, the order arrived within 5 minutes, so freshness or made to order is NOT possible. I'm tempted to order their 1 dozen TAMALES for $40, but going back there seems like punishment. I will say this, our waiter was very polite, as was the kind gentleman who held the door for us as we made our exit."}
{"text":"To me the first impression of a great Mexican restaurant is the salsa. They only had one offering and it was meh. The service was extremely good. However, the food lacked depth. The enchilada sauce actually tasted like something Chef Boyardee would have made. The rice and beans were lackluster. The menu was large, but it was just a mix of the same 4 or 5 foods. I miss Jalisco"}
{"text":"Went with to casa Don Juan Henderson Sunday 5/13 around 5:00 for Mother's Day To celebrate with my family party of 9 there was a hostess unfortunately I did not catch her name wearing a lavender/purple skirt we were waiting outside patiently and she called my family in said the table for nine was ready I and my sister stayed behind while everyone went inside, she stood by the door with her hands on her hips  being very rude asking  if we were part of the party of nine I said yes we were we will be there in a few moments she said your table is ready will you need a highchair? I said no we do not and she was very upset at the fact that we had stayed behind pressuring us that we all needed to be seated at the same time I went inside a few moments after she called my family and I noticed once I came inside my family was still standing there I said what's going on I thought that she was going to seat us? My family was just standing there while she ignored us and seated other people at their tables, I approached her and I said I thought you said our table was ready and she said no it's not ready it's going to be another 10 to 15 minutes I said But you just pressured us to all come inside that our table was ready ? But she wouldn't listen , I said I don't want to talk to you anymore I want to talk to your manager so she called her manager and he came to talk to me , right away when I started explaining my situation I said she has a very bad attitude and needs better customer service he defended her and said well she said that she told you guys it was gonna be another 15 minutes I said no that is not the case she told us that our table is ready , the Manager said I'm going to be honest with you your table is not going to be ready for another 15 to 20 minutes Please calm down  it's Mother's Day and try to have a good time I will let her know to please try and control her attitude mean while The same purple skirt hostess sits my family down at the correct table for 9 I told the manager look she is sitting us down  now we are going to sit down at our table, and he finally says OK  have a good dinner sorry about the inconvenience, not even 30 seconds later as we were all sitting down at the table the manager himself comes and starts yelling at us saying hey hey hey that is not your table !!!why are you sitting here ?!!! and my family said the hostess just sat us down he said no this is a table for nine you guys are a table of 14 !!! I said no we are not  14 people we are the table of nine and he mentioned my brothers name and I said correct that is my brothers name this is our table he completely humiliated us in front of all the customers every one was looking at us ,we felt like we were being scolded like little children when they do bad and we didn't do anything we were about to get up and leave but being that it was Mother's Day and we were there and they had sat us down we decided to stay the remainder of the time the waiters were great both of them were helping us we didn't have to wait for anything, the problem was when we arrived the treatment we had was horrible hostess who thinks She can treat people like trash the manager needs to always hear the customer side first before he makes a judgment in this case he defended his employeeright away and that is unacceptable I am apalled at the way people get treated I know that you could be busy but you have to have good customer service I will not be returning to this restaurant and I will not recommend it to anyone save your time don't come here go to other Mexican restaurants  in town not worth it"}
{"text":"was just as good as the one on main street....delish! always excited to find good mexican food...even their chips and salsa and bean dip are good!"}
{"text":"Saw the Now Open sign and decided to stop in for some lunch with my work colleagues. I have been to their other restaurant on Main Street and loved the food.  Bottomless chips with salsa and beans free upon sitting down. The albondigas soup is very good. We ordered the lunch special wet burrito and beef fajitas. We also ordered a cheese quesadilla with rice and beans.  The servers are very attentive and within 5 seconds the straw wrappers were picked up. And waters were refilled instantly.  Food comes out very quickly The beans were nice and hot and the quesadilla was warm. The wet burrito was delicious to the last bite. The fajitas didn't come out on a sizzling skillet but was quite tasty.  Good prices for lunch specials $8.99. Will definitely add this to our lunch rotation.  Much as gracias Casa Don Juan!"}
{"text":"The service here is second to none. Period. The food is authentic which makes the service even better. Only thing they could do further is wipe my mouth for me or lead me to the restroom."}
{"text":"...and the search for a real Mexican food restaurant continues. We came because of the food reviews but left disappointed with a half eaten plate of not-so traditional tacos. Hard tortilla, greasy beef, with lettuce and American cheese on top. The best thing was the guacamole and habanero salsa, which you have to pay an extra $2.99 for. The service was also good. The staff is extremely friendly and made for a good experience, excluding the food."}
{"text":"This place is incredible. Liz at the bar took great care of us and the food was amazing. Constant care and consideration, with great service."}
{"text":"Mention mexican food in downtown Las Vegas and people who know the best locations always blurt out \"Casa Don Juan\" right at Charleston and Main.  Now the owners of Casa Don Juan have branched out and brought their delicious food and margaritas and desserts to Henderson, right at Pecos and Sunset in the old location formerly occupied by Jalisco.  As expected, Casa Don Juan's food was delicious, the combination plates (all 40 of them!) are generous in size, and the fried ice cream dessert (that me and my wife always have as our appetizer) was cold and creamy, and deep friend with fruity pebbles all around it!  Our server Miguel was on top of his game, always anticipating our needs and being there always right when we wanted him, and the overall experience terrific.  The chips and salsa and beans that they give you when you arrive have a light but flavorful salsa that we devoured before even dipping a chip in the creamy beans-it was that good.  The menu is huge like the \"Casa Don Juan\" Machado burrito that I had, so I know we will be back in the future!"}
{"text":"I feel that they are way too expensive for simple and average of that Mexican food. They nickel and dime you on extras. Asked for hotter salsa and they charged us $5 for it without warning. Much better places that I'd rather spend $50 for dinner on. Go elsewhere"}
{"text":"It's a colorful, friendly restaurant with beautiful art. The menu is colorful with lots of choices. The food!!!! Wow! The shrimp cocktail was ALL shrimp with some pico and a lot of avocado. $ Prices are a little high, but (big but) the food and friendly staff are well worth it.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Finally got it right! From Super Mex, to Jalisco, to Casa Don Juan- this is the best yet! Food is great, service is great. The interior is finally great. Not to mention, Evian in the bar area. This dude is awesome! Such good customer service AND makes the best margaritas! Very friendly, polite, and actually remembers customers. I would highly recommend this place and especially Evian."}
{"text":"Happy Hour Mon-Thur 1-6pm  Happy Hour Specials are 2 for 1 margaritas  Came in on National Margarita Day for happy hour.  Their happy hour is 2 for 1 margaritas.  No other food or drink specials at this time.  The bartender said they would be adding to the happy hour menu in the future.  I look forward to that.  Even a couple bucks off apps would be nice.  The margaritas were excellent.  They have 12 flavors.  We had a peach, coconut, strawberry, watermelon both frozen and on the rocks.  Think watermelon was my favorite but hard to choose.  We shared a carne asada nacho.  I got a combo plate with a taco and enchilada.  Hubby got a pork burrito.  Portions are huge.  Food was delicious.  I think I have a new favorite Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"This was a first time here. We were so impressed!  The food was fabulous and the service was outstanding !  They were very attentive and took very good care of us.  The atmosphere was warn and inviting.  Jay was our server and we would highly recommend him.  We will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Oh my, where to begin???This is a new location close to my home and we decided to try it out.  I have never been to any of the other locations and I am kicking myself for it.  Everything was amazing.  The Decor is so bright and beautiful, all of the wait staff were fantastic, our drinks and salsa and chips were never empty.  Then there is the food,  oh the food!!!  I had a tamale plate and my husband had a burrito plate.  Everything was so flavorful and delicious!! Definately come and try this place.  Im sure you wont be disappointed.  We will be back again and again."}
{"text":"I've always liked Casa Don Juan but because it was downtown, I rarely went.  I was thrilled when they opened a second location near my home.  I've eaten there three or four times, and have loved everything I've ordered.  Their red sauce is delicious but not too picante.  It's been a long time since I've enjoyed cheese enchiladas, but theirs are fabulous, as is their Chile Relleno. The tamales are different (thick, delicious masa with off-centered, well-seasoned meat) from any I've ever had, but they are addicting.  When I ordered mixed fajitas, I had enough leftovers for two more flavorful lunches.  The atmosphere is wonderfully Mexican, the service has been excellent, and the prices are reasonable. My only two disappointments: 1) I didn't pull the taco off the plate quickly enough and it got soggy from the enchilada sauce. 2) A woman was running tabs at a cash register right inside the door, and she ignored customers coming in.  When the hostess got back, it was clear it wasn't the cashier's job to greet us, but it felt unfriendly.  Luckily, everything else turned an initial poor impression into a positive experience."}
{"text":"OMG!! I'm an old school Mexican woman and I'm so impressed with the food here, as authentic as my gramma would make, homemade tortillas with your meal, beans and salsa served with chips , A MUST TRY!!"}
{"text":"Food is just as mediocre as the previous restaurant in this location, but now the prices are significantly higher. I had two bland and boring tamales and a drink that cost $20. If I'm going to spend $20 for lunch, it had damn well be better food than this:( I won't be back."}
{"text":"RUN! The worst Mexican food and worst service!!! Do yourself a favor to save money and a headache... go to Taco Bell. Your meal will be more enjoyable."}
{"text":"The service is terrific, and the food was good, but not fantastic. The a/c was blasting and SO cold that we had to leave. We took some cheesecake with us to try.  Yum"}
{"text":"Food was good but when you order a chicken tostada one expects a chicken tostada and not a chicken with lettuce salad. We asked about that and apparently if you order a chicken tostada at dinner it is not the same from lunch and thus you do not get a crispy tostada with beans and chicken and letruce and all the fixins you just get chicken and lettuce. Service was really good and all the folks were friendly. We may give them a try again don't know yet."}
{"text":"Our first time at this new location, plus it's closer to our home which is a plus! Food was amazing, cooked perfectly, fast an accurately, now the staff is on point. Every person who walked by asked if we needed anything or just came to give refills."}
{"text":"We had lunch here. We sat at the bar. No gaming yet. Very good service by the bartender Very good top shelf Margarita and street tacos's  Best Mexican food in this part of Henderson. Wish it was closer to where we live"}
{"text":"We had such a great time ! From the awesome server Jose and amazing manager Julian-everything was exceptional- the food was delicious  too!  The restaurant has a wonderful and fun ambiance with beautiful decor. Thank you for a great evening!"}
{"text":"We went in and sat down and literally were not approached by any staff for over 15 minutes and in the meantime realized how dirty it was inside and the restrooms should just be off limits.  When we left, we still had not and we're not acknowledged."}
{"text":"I ordered some flautas, they came out basically looking like taquitos and were crunchy and bland. I wasn't terribly impressed with the rice and beans either. It was kind of expensive, considering the fact that we walked out a little disappointed with the food. The salsa that came with the chips had a great flavor, but it was really runny and didn't stay on the chip. I had high hopes but unfortunately won't be back."}
{"text":"Really really good. We came because we enjoyed jaliscos (formerly in the same location). We were very impressed. Even better than Jaliscos. Our food came out incredibly fast. They have multiple people wondering around making sure everyone's drinks are full and garbage is picked up. This means your drink is never empty and there is never anything in your way. I got a combination plate which was delicious and my wife got a beef quesadilla which she said was one of the best she had ever had. Would recommend 100%."}
{"text":"The food was good. It's pretty normal cheap Mexican food. It does cost a bit more than I thought it should. I had a chicken taco and a chille rellano. The taco was good and the rellano was a little wet. My boyfriend got 3 enchillads. The enchiladas were decent.  The rice had very little flavor and the beans were flat.   We did get served very quickly and our server was fantastic (Rene?). He was personable and cracked jokes, and that was the best part.   However! The managers were like hawks. They just stood in front of our table and continually watched every thing. They came to our table multiple times and we were only there for like 45 minutes for dinner. It was incredibly awkward and I couldn't wait to leave. I know their job is to make everything run smoothly but having them just stare at the employees constantly was frustrating.   We will try them again at some point."}
{"text":"Went in the other day for dinner, around 5 pm.  Ordering was easy, the waiter was friendly and attentive.  Getting more chips was easy peasy and refills on waters easy as well.  The food was great and fresh, the cook even brought it out himself. Portions were generous, I had to get a to go box.  I liked the atmosphere, we sat in the little side room with Frida Kahlo all over the walls."}
{"text":"We ate here for lunch and had a great experience. We asked our waiter for a recommendation which he gladly provided and we accepted. He was right, it was delicious. The service was great and the food was very fresh and tasted wonderful. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"They had great food, service, and margaritas. I had a carnitas burrito ans my husband had a combo. Had a groupon and would definitely co me again!"}
{"text":"Second time here for lunch.  Very good traditional Mexican food.  The service was very good and the atmosphere was comfortable.  I had the cheese Tamale with a Chile relleno's combo.  The Chile relleno's was excellent with a sprinkling of white Mexican cheese. So far I haven't had a dish that makes me excited but it is good to have a traditional Mexican restaurant in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I'm from San Bernardino, CA. and was in the local area servicing equipment, I needed to grab a lunch so I stopped by Casa Don Juan, they had mentioned it just opened a few days earlier when they seated me.  Wow what an awesome restaurant, from the moment you walk in the décor and atmosphere are just what you want in an authentic Mexican restaurant.  I travel to Mexico City D.F. frequently and this restaurant is comparable to the ones I frequent when I'm down there, Don Casa Juan restaurant is that good and authentic.  I already told my wife next time I bring her to Vegas I'm going to bring her to this restaurant.  Stop by and have a lunch or dinner, the décor alone is a treat, to top it off there's a beautiful image of \"Our Lady of Guadalupe\" right in front of the restaurant when you exit.  Ben"}
{"text":"First time to visit the new Casa Don Juan's. Beautiful building, food is good as usual. Raul and Billy are excellent host. This location is bigger than the Summerlin location. Lot of atmosphere like the Down Town location. We will be back. Good luck on the new endeavors."}
{"text":"Booked a party of 20 into the private room . Last minute they changed it  and didn't tell us until we arrived . They made NO concessions .  The food at their original location was good , here ... marginal at Best . When you want Mexican , go to Lindo Micheocan ... they are less apt to back stab you ."}
{"text":"Not impressed and over priced.  Margarita was good. Bathrooms smelled of awful cleaning chemicals."}
{"text":"Great restaurant delicious food  Service is great people are so friendly  Great location  I will definitely regimented ti everyone"}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant 9 or 10 times. The food is pretty good, but mitt great. The policies are terrible. I was there once for lunch. I just wanted a beverage, soup and a salad. I was not provided with chips and salsa. When I asked why not, I was told I did not order an entree, even though what I ordered cost as much as an entree. Today I ordered fajitas. After eating my meal I still had leftovers to take home. I asked for a couple of additional tortillas and was told two tortillas would cost me $1.95. That is poor service. I am done going here. For a few cents of food they have lost my business."}
{"text":"Love this place. The atmosphere and the employees are truly there to serve you the best food experience.  There was a bit of a miscommunication mixup on our reservation when we arrived - but they were quick to fix the situation and in 10 minutes we were led to our tables.  Keep in mind, we were a party of 35 people!  As soon as we were situated, like a choreographed team, the waitstaff were there to get drink orders at every table and deliver chips, salsa, & bean dip. All in one swoop!  I was actually impressed with their ability to work cohesively.  After, our food order went in when our cocktails had been delivered - btw, I highly recommend the Mango Marguerite!  We all sat and talked and soon after our food came out.  Hot and smelling delicious, we were all ready to devour.  Tortillas were fresh, my tamale was hot and everyone else's food look pleasing from the looks of their platters.  After we ate our food, and keep in mind, the portions are more than enough, we all settled into a food coma.  We were so full from the dishes we had ordered that many of started to sink in our seats! LoL  If you are ever in the arts district in downtown Las Vegas, seek this place out for you and your group- I'm sure you will enjoy the experience!  From what I understand, if you're a large company wanting to reserve a guaranteed table, there is a required deposit-not sure how much, but it helps to call on advance, come here and try some good Mexican fare.  You may enjoy the same experience we had!  Enjoy! :)"}
{"text":"Tried this restaurant based on recommendations, pretty decent Mexican food a little pricier than most. Margaritas are just ok they use a mixer instead of fresh squeezed lime."}
{"text":"Wow! Great service and outstanding food. Their Posole is fantastic.  I would highly recommend this restaurant ."}
{"text":"I am impressed!  This restaurant looks great from the moment you walk in.  The food and service was exceptional. The staff couldn't be more accommodating.  Take the whole family and relax. The renovation to the inside are very nice. I felt like I was in Mexico. Try it you'll be glad you did"}
{"text":"Very  good  food, excellent customer service.  Little bit pricey. There are plenty of Mexican restaurants here that serve the same food a lot cheaper!"}
{"text":"Went today for lunch and although I had been here a few times several years ago, this time I noticed that the margarita I ordered had NO alcohol in it and was 14.99.  Entrees are too expensive for that area of town 12-18.00 for rice, beans and combo plates...nothing I hate more than a place that cheats its customers.......we are not all stupid consumers and word of mouth travels fast.... Buyer beware...."}
{"text":"Four of us went here tonight and I must say it was incredible. We all had different meals and no complaints including drinks and dessert. Service was perfection."}
{"text":"This business space always seems to cycle through its share of Mexican restaurants. Back in the day I believe it was a SuperMex, then came Jalisco's. Now you're entering the house of Don Juan.  The downtown location definitely has the livelier atmosphere, but rest assured the signature Casa Don Juan accoutrements are still intact at this one -- every bit of space is thoughtfully decorated. From the sprawling Frida Kahlo collection to the colorful papel picado banners, it's a visual feast indeed. So even if the service is not as upbeat, the beautiful interior and more open spacing still lend itself to a pleasant dining experience.  Complimentary chips and dip to start. Who can complain? I had a jamaica drink (yum) and the flautas platter (3 pieces), which comes with rice, beans, and some salad. My bf got the tamale and taco plate, but the tamale was a little spicy for him. Note: their lemonade leans more on the sour limey side rather than sweet lemon."}
{"text":"Amazing customer service and food. This is my daughter favorite place!! They also have great happy hour prices and the drinks are delicious"}
{"text":"Phenomenal homemade tortillas -- they have a specialized area in the restaurant where the tortillas are made from scratch.  Guacamole was excellent also -- first time seeing where the price of guacamole is \"by the day\" which says they watch the season if avocados and price accordingly.  Margaritas are decently priced.  Overall, the service we received from Raul, our server, was very professional, courteous, and friendly.  Hope we have him as our server next time we return."}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday dinner and it was really good. Love this place so much more then the place they replaced. I'm giving 4 stars for huge portions, great service, especially the people who did the bday song and cleanliness. Missing one star for the prices. It was much more expensive then the previous owner. Definitely couldn't afford to go as often as the last."}
{"text":"Delicious food and excellent staff! I've never had a bad meal or a bad experience here. The margaritas are delicious!"}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast! The chips and salsa and homemade tortillas are amazing. Its a great place to sit back and enjoy some breakfast lunch or dinner"}
{"text":"Such a disappointment with this restaurant. I had ordered the chicken quesadillas and they tasted like they came from a can of something disgusting. Never. Coming. Back. Again.   I have rather had them keep Jalisco. Jalisco was better service, better food, chips and salsa were off the hook, and atmosphere was great!"}
{"text":"If I could give this place zero stars I would. The food was very bland and tasteless. Some of the worst Mexican food I've had in years. I don't get the hype. Our waiter was a pompous jerk. He took 20 minutes to take our order and hardly checked on us. I will never go back."}
{"text":"I ordered beef toquitos and they were very bland. The rice and beans had no flavor either. They literally put a teaspoon of sour cream and a teaspoon of guacamole on 6 strands of lettuce. Completely overpriced for what you get. My husband ordered 2 cheese enchiladas with green sauce. They brought it to the table with red sauce... exchanged it... the green sauce tasted like lemon juice. The salsa had so much cilantro, its all you could taste. The service was so-so. Our waiter seemed distracted... like he was in a hurry to get out of there. We were so disappointed.  Definitely won't return."}
{"text":"1st time there. My gal had heard good things however the experience was far below our expectations.  Ordered a #4, cheese enchilada and a chiles rellenos with rice and beans. Also ordered a #14 after asking for a beef taco and a chiles rellenos and being told we would have to order it ala carte. Rice only.  The 14 came with rice and beans(was supposed to be rice only). The 4 came with beans only(was supposed to be rice and beans). When I pointed this out, the waiter ran off like he was going to take care of something. He came back with no solution so I told him to just bring us a side of rice.  The food was WARM, no flavor and the beef taco was greasy.  I had a 7-Up that tasted like it came out a dirty well pump.  Food was served in under 5 minutes. May explain because it was warm and not on a hot plate.  Won't be going back"}
{"text":"The food was delicious. The service was greaeaeat...Cesar and Edmundo made a great team. Keep up the great work guys. This location lived up to their parent restaurant on Main Street."}
{"text":"Our server Renny is the man!!! Customer service is his specialty...You can't go wrong here because everything on the menu is delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Came here for a Mother's Day dinner expecting it to be just as good as the casa Don Juan down town. Welp it definitely was not. We waited a long tome to get our drinks ordered and to order food was another 15 min wait. I ordered an Horchata, please don't order the horchata it was thick and slimy    Thank goodness for the server Fernando. He was the only one that noticed how bad our service was from the other waiter that he ended up taking over our table as well even tho he was in another section.  The food...oh the food. I ordered the breaded shrimp. They came out oily and definitely were over cooked with fries on top that were not crispy. Seemed to have been cooked along time ago and I just happened to get the last batch. The tortillas were under cooked and still floury, you could feel the flour on your hands.  The desert was sopapillas. I had hope for these but again I laughed when the plate was placed on the table and I saw 3 packets of Heinz honey laying atop of the sopapillas.   They have authentic in their name and this location is definitely not authentic.  Hopefully things get better. ?"}
{"text":"Ummmm, Yummy! Order the lavender Margarita. You won't be disappointed by the hand crafted cocktail. Salsa was delicious as well. Not your run of the mill pre dinner salsa."}
{"text":"I walked in and the place was packed. Got seated at the bar right away, friendly staff. Food was authentic and tasted just like home! Drinks were good. Price was fair. Overall a great experience and much better than the Mexican restaurant that was there before. 10/10 would recommend."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch and it was busy. Got sat in the bar. Bartender came right over took our drink order. Food was great! My boyfriends burrito was just okay but I loved my dish. The red sauce is killer if you want a mild taste. Will be back"}
{"text":"This restaurant is a gem. Stopped in today as I wanted to give it a try since it used to be Jalisco and they always had good food there. However Don Juan has out done themselves. Upon entering a hostess seeing I was a party of one asked if I prefer a booth. I agreed and was seated immediately and as I was handed a menu I was asked if I wanted the complimentary chips and salsa. Yeck yeah!! Within seconds a server asked me for my drink order. Wow that was fast. I looked over the menu which is quite extensive and decided on Carnita's. As I enjoyed my chips( not packaged by any means)  I noticed in front of the kitchen area there was a women preparing home made tortillas. She smiled and seemed to be enjoying her job. Refreshing to watch I must add.  My food arrived and my server was very polite. All I can say is WOW the food was amazing. My platter came with rice and beans,A jalapeno pepper,  Pork Carnitas and corn tortillas. Also a small side of guacamole and pico. I made my tortillas and the flavor exploded in my mouth. Warm, just the right seasoning and all I could ask for from true mexican prepared food. When they say authentic, they mean authentic.  I really enjoyed my dining time with them and will be back."}
{"text":"Great authentic Mexican food ( I know my Mexican food, I'm from L.A.!) Very generous margaritas and the staff are very friendly. I've been to both the original and the location in Henderson and both were great."}
{"text":"Very delicious Mexican food. Great chips and Salsa. We are picky eaters and we loved it!  They do have vegetarian options too. The service was excellent. We thought it was cool them brining refried beams with the salsa. Great prices. Free chips and salsa where on the strip they charge you. Oh and the guacamole was fresh and tasty too!! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This is the best full-service Mexican restaurant we have tried since moving to Vegas. Their fresh bottomless chips are amazing. My husband loves the bean dip, while I love the cheese dip. The wet burrito with the Verde sauce is huge and oh so good. I  always take half home. The atmosphere is on point as well."}
{"text":"We had a great time here. The drinks are cheap and the food was excellent. One our waiter was a really nice guy. He was always there for us when we needed drinks the most. This restaurant rates and easy five stars and we'll be back again tomorrow for another fun Saturday."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been anxiously awaiting Casa Don Juan in the site of the now closed Jalisco (before that, Super Mex).  We were so happy to find out that they had at long last opened and that they were also open for lunch.  We went on Friday (9-1) and were seated in Cesar's section.  Never having been there, Cesar was very patient with us, explaining the daily specials to us and a few minutes later to our son, who joined us after we had arrived.  We loved everything that we had, from the Margarita's and very fresh chips and very flavorful salsa to our meals.  Husband and son ordered enchilada/taco combos and I had the carnita's lunch special.  My lunch came with either soup or salad and I chose the Mexican macaroni soup which was very yummy.  The restaurant is very nice and bright and most importantly (to me anyway), very clean.  All the staff were very friendly and attentive.   What more could we ask for???  We enjoyed it so much , we made a return visit on Sunday for dinner.  Cesar was not working that evening, but Pedro was and he was also very good, friendly and patient.  Another terrific meal was had.  Looking forward to the next time we are able to dine there."}
{"text":"Super pleased with this place. The staff is really nice and attentive and the food was tasty. They have a fun selection of margaritas too. I tried the pomegranate and my friend had the watermelon and both were delicious. My husband got the cheese and jalapeño tamales and I got a shrimp ceviche tostada. I believe my friend also ordered tamales and she enjoyed her dinner as well. There was like a 7 piece Mariachi band that night and they were wonderful. The place was upbeat and comfortable. It reminded me of Mexican restaurants back home in California."}
{"text":"What a wonderful surprise! We thought we were going to Jalisco and discovered this new restaurant in their former location. The difference is substantial. The decor is nicer, the staff uniforms are way better (and cute!), and - most importantly - the food is amazing! We unknowingly arrived during happy hour and our excellent waiter made sure we got our two-for-one beverages. Highly recommended!  Tl;dr - Great atmosphere, wonderful service, excellent food. Come eat here!"}
{"text":"This is our new favorite Mexican restaurant. All I can say is wow!! I heard great reviews about the location downtown but had never gotten there. The Henderson location was worth the wait. Everything on the menu is homemade fresh on site. The complimentary chips are served warm with bean dip and a green salsa, light, delicious and not too spicey, with fresh cilantro and chunks of onion and tomato. For something with more kick, ask them to blend you a batch of habanero salsa, with a creamier blended sauce consistency. We used it on our red rice too - it was amazing! We got a heaping order of nachos (enough for 4) with guacamole (chunky and fresh), house creme, jalapeños, tomatoes, onions, and melted shredded cheese. The burritos were overstuffed. The order of carne asada fajitas was huge, served on the traditional sizzling skillet, with grilled onions, tomatoes and mixed peppers. On the side were refried beans, rice and tortillas, made fresh at a tortilla station near the kitchen. While we were there a birthday girl was surprised with a dessert and song from the waiters. The dessert case was tempting! Save room because they have homemade flan, cheesecake, fried ice cream, cakes and pastries. It took a while for us to read through the menu. They have appetizer sampler platters and more than just chicken, pork and carne entree choices, with fresh fish, shrimp, and more than a few delicious looking salad options. They also make homemade tamales (chicken, pork and sweet) for sale as a dinner or larger takeout option. And we weren't rushed through dinner. The hostesses were welcoming, the waiters and busboys were so attentive.. we never had an empty glass, and our silverware was even changed between courses. We met the new manager, Julian who was super friendly, constantly watching over his waitstaff and customers. He was totally professional and still hands on making sure his customers were all satisfied and even helping his waitstaff.  We spoke with him for a moment and you can tell he's super proud of this restaurant and invested in its success. We're very picky about eating out. This restaurant was a winner! A+ We'll be back soon!!"}
{"text":"I am happy to have tried Casa Don Juan (new Sunset location) tonight despite the noise level inside the restaurant. And yes, it was quite loud. I don't know if it always is but it was tonight. There were a lot of people talking loud enough to hear each other which made the noise level higher which meant they talked even louder. Ita a vicious cycle. Plus there was a family with a screaming 2 year old near us. And there was a birthday at another table that had the entire wait staff singing. I was shocked when about half way through dinner I heard music playing over the PA system. I wish I had heard more of that and less of everything else.  With that off my chest, on to the food. It started, as so many Mexican restaurants do, with chips and salsa. They also served beans. Both the salsa and beans were thinner that I like but not bland or watered down by any means. Both had good flavor and spice. I prefer a chunky salsa that I can scoop with a chip but flavor trumps that.  For my meal I ordered a tamale meal number 4. That comes with a taco, an enchilada and a tamale served with rice and beans. It was all delicious. The taco shell was light and crisp. The chicken insde was moist and well seasoned. The enchilada comes with a well balanced sauce. It is not too spicy and not bitter like some enchilada sauces I have had. The tamale looked small but was rather plump. The masa to chicken ratio was a little high but I like it that way. It helps that the masa was not dry. It was mixed with the chicken and spicy green sauce. It wasn't soaked in sauce and I appreciate that. I don't like my tamales to be swimming. The beans seemed like simple refried beans but man oh man did they impress me. I picked up some salt and maybe some garlic. They were different than your run of the mill refried beans. I at them all which I typically don't do. I do typically eat all of my rice and tonight was no exception. The rice itself was good. Not great. A bit standard. But good.   Service was great. Everybody was attentive. Management came by a couple of times even from early on to see if everything was going OK. They all seemed to care. Where they faltered a little bit, and this is so minor I hesitate to mention it, but they kept trying to refill my iced tea with water. Both were served in a red cup with a wedge of lemon. It was difficult to tell the two apart. Aside from that, great service and good food. I am so happy this opened up not too far from home. It gives me a nice casual dining Mexican restaurant as opposed to myriad taco shops around town.  A quick side note; if you are a fan of Frida Callo, the have you covered with the decor."}
{"text":"Service was outstanding, everyone was so attentive and the food was amazing! The decor and set up is much more comfortable than the one downtown."}
{"text":"I hosted a large party for 35+ people on a busy Saturday night and everything was excellent. The manager was attentive and helpful throughout the planning process and she made sure everyone was allowed to order off of the main menu on the day of the event. When we arrived they made sure to confirm we liked the table set up, and were very attentive to the seating changes we needed at the last minute. Once guests arrived, they made sure to take everyone's order promptly and the food came out roughly at the same time and all tasted great. My guests were very impressed with the whole night and especially with the level of wonderful hospitality that the restaurant gave us. We were an active and loud group and the servers worked hard to make sure everything still moved smoothly. They even let us store our cake in their fridge, and led the party in a lively and fun singing of happy birthday to my daughter. I highly recommend Casa Don Juan for any big party or event and I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Great fajitas, had enchiladas which had lots of chicken inside and the taco was over filled with beef. Wonderful"}
{"text":"Came here three times to get the carnitas. First two times was great. Thought I found my new place. Third time was dry and hard. Won't order here again."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere and the food hit the spot. Chips and salsa was tasty. The menudo was just right. Will be back again."}
{"text":"I grew up traveling between the US and Mexico. As a child my favorite thing to eat was beans from the pot. As an adult I have never been able to find some as good as I can remember until today!!! The best in Las Vegas!!!"}
{"text":"Arrive at 11:45 am sat down and was greeted by a friendly waiter. My order was taken and within 10 minutes our food order was at our table. Fresh, warm, and tasty. The hostess brought us an order of guacamole and chip which was fresh and tasty.   I ordered mix seafood tostada that was a generous portion for a good value price. My wife ordered the carne asada plate which was really well done and great in flavor.   The waiter kept checking in on us and made sure we were taken care of.  I will return and tell my friends about this place."}
{"text":"First time trying this restaurant last night at this new location with the Alumni Ass. Of TISOH. Service was excellent and food tasted great! The manager even stopped by to check and make sure everything was going smoothly with our experiences. I also like how traditional it feels especially with the design of dresses for the female servers. We are thinking about throwing a future mixer here."}
{"text":"Amazing food and staff at the new location on Sunset. The food here is delicious. The atmosphere and staff are both incredible. The carnitas is off the charts! It's a mirror of the downtown location! If you are looking for great Mexican it's a must."}
{"text":"Great food at decent price. Service was very good and the food came very fast. The margarita was good. They just need a drink menu, so you can read the different options they offer. I will be going back."}
{"text":"I love Mexican food and am constantly trying different places to find the great ones. Casa Don Juan is great. Good service. Nice decor ( for a Mexican restaurant ). The salsa is mediocre but they also give you warm bean dip which is a great touch. I rarely eat tamales as they are boring. They are just a lump of corn flower dough with a little piece of meat hidden inside. But, at Casa Don Juan I noticed the menu seemed to feature tamales so I thought I'd try one. Great move. The tamale was moist but not soggy and very tasty. It was packed with meat. By far, the best tamale I have ever had. I will order a tam ale every time I visit, which will be often. Don't hesitate in going to this place, you'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"Customer Service is so so good. They treat you like family.  Preparadas, pozole, mole, muchacha all amazing choices.  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best Mexican restaurants I have ever eaten at ever. Definitely,the messy in Las Vegas. The seating was quick, the service great. The menu (as far as this gringo know) seems pretty authentic. They had tongue dishes, so there you go! The decor is Frida Kahlo centric, with lots of her work, (self?) portraits of her, some Diego Rivera, and lots of mirrors. (as an aside, I visited her and Rivera's house in Mexico City a few years ago) The chips, salsa, and guac (oh so good with great flavor and texture) could have made a meal. My date had puerco chili verde and I had the beef (shredded) chimi. Both were excellent with large portions...we ended up taking home the left overs. The pork in the green chili was SO tender it almost melted in our mouths. Casa Don Juan is HIGHLY recommended."}
{"text":"Great food, great service! They pulled out all the stops for my Birthday. Sombreros, maracas and a free shot. Will be going back, sans kids to check out the bar area."}
{"text":"I had lunch here this week and ordered the cheese enchilada and chile rellano and refried beans.  The chile rellano was tough and swimming in sauce so that the coating just slipped off and the enchilada was about 1/2 inch thick and the cheese wasn't even melted.  The salsa, bean dip and chips are good as was the service but I'll eat a meal elsewhere next time."}
{"text":"This is what we found in our dinner our first try at this restaurant as we were told it was amazing. Service was so slow. We waited and a party of 2 went ahead of us and we were there first and it was just us 3. The server never came back to refill our drinks water. Food was not great at all. We will not be back. We were in the back room. They need to work on some stuff.   On top of this my husband is not feeling well as the food was so over powering in sauce. The server he was very rude as well."}
{"text":"New to the neighborhood. Friendly staff and efficient service. Large menu offering and many different margarita flavor choices. Try the enchiladas with red sauce yum!"}
{"text":"Waiting a long time for this place to open.   Worth the wait. I had custom made tacos as I am a picky eater. They NAILED it. Perfect, fresh and yummy.   Service was prompt and curtious. I will be back"}
{"text":"Had a vegetarian burrito, chips, salsa, dinner salad and Cerveza.  Amazing service; very polite and attentive!  Excellent food. Chips and salsa very good. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We have eaten at the Main Street location and always thought it was pretty good. The Sunset location was very disappointing. Service was good, but almost to the point of being bothered. Food was not good. My wife took one bite of chicken taco and put it down. Chicken was mushy. Pork in green sauce was a lot of sauce and very small amount of tuff pork. Flavor was fair at best. Rice and beans where bland and almost tasted like it had been sitting around awhile. I had 2 beers,wife had a margarita. I thought $48 plus tip was pricey for the portions and quality. Good Mexican food in Henderson seems impossible to find. I predict they won't be around long. Bad food and high prices usually spell doom!! Amazingly it seems like Mexican restaurants in Henderson survive & flourish with mediocre food at best."}
{"text":"They refused to service us because we brought in ice coffee from Starbucks. I've eaten at so many restaurants and they have never been told to through out my coffee. The last time we at there the ceviche had no flavor and the food was cold."}
{"text":"Not really happy  with my camarones ala Diabla  or with camarones al  mojo de ajo  they look like cocktail shrimp  I prefer la mojarra loca. The shrimp looks like popcorn shrimp and was to over cooked they should change the small shrimp with bigger shrimp al mojo De  ajo and  they should make garlic  sauce instead of only garlic powder."}
{"text":"I love Mexican food and am always trying to find a great Mexican restaurant. Everything about Casa Don Juan was really good. You get salsa with the chips and the salsa is good, not great, but good. They also give some bean dip which is a great perk. Service was good and the decor is normal Mexican restaurant. I rarely have tamales as they are the most boring of Mecican foods. But, it looked like they were a specialty so I tried one. OMG! Their tamales are the best I have ever had, the \"corn dough\" was moist and flavorful and they were stuffed with meat. I am now a Casa Don Juan tamale junky. This is my new favorite spot displacing Juan's Flaming Fajita's. if you try this place, you must have a tamale. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This location is fantastic and has ample parking! The servers are friendly and all of the food is homemade, just like the other location! The menu is the same as downtown. I've eaten everything from the shrimp fajitas to the chimichangas and carne ranchero. I've never been disappointed in any of the food! Check out the Happy Hour for a great deal on margaritas!"}
{"text":"Change of dinner plans since another place was too busy. The place used to be called Jalisco's, but I'm not sure if it's under new management. The place is very closely and decorated with charming cantina decor. I was greeted right away and was taken to a table. She was still setting up the placemats and asked us if I wanted to start ordering. I haven't even sat down yet, but ok. The waitress asked if I wanted to start with a cheese dip or avocado. I asked how much it was and it was $7.99 each. I went with the cheese dip and by then I was able to actually sit at the table.   The waiter came by and asked for drinks and orders. I went with the pork in green chili sauce with corn tortillas and my S.O. went with the al pastor quesadilla. The cheese dip that came out was room temp and portion was very small for the price. Asked if the cheese dip was supposed to be hot and waiter said yes. Informed waiter it was not hot and he took it back to reheat. The pork in green chili was tasty, but only had a small amount of meat and the rest were onions and bell peppers. The al pastor quesadilla was good though.   Overall, the atmosphere is welcoming and bright. Service started a bit off, but the rest of the service was good. Some menu items would be worth trying again, but for the price, the value could be better."}
{"text":"It's great to have it close by us, here in Henderson. We love the Main St. location, but I'm not sure if it was opening week but we felt the food was subpart in comparison to the Main St location. Nevertheless, it's still one of our favorite Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"What a hidden gem, came here once a long time ago when it had another name and decided to give it one more try since I didn't like the place at all. I can't say anything negative, the food was great and the margaritas even better! Service was very good as well. The tamarindo Margarita was just what I wanted."}
{"text":"Holy fish! I can't think of a Mexican restaurant I've been too with better food and service. We shared the large seafood plate and it was Amazing!!! Our 5 and 7 year olds loved the fried tilapia more then their kids meals. We will definitely be back when we are in Vegas again! PS we got salsa to go to share with our family"}
{"text":"The food was preaty good but they drop the ball with the salsa they need to get it together with the salsa they need some salsa de arbol"}
{"text":"My first thought was that it was expensive compared to Jaliscos. In their favor though I thought it was a lot of food. None of us finished our meals    The decor was refreshed and I loved the blue walls in the side room.   Hostesses were super cute in their Mexican attire. I did notice though that all the servers were male. What's with that?  Mexican food is my favorite and while this was decent it wasn't anything to rave about. I wouldn't go out if my way to go back like I did when it was Jaliscos. My favorite is still Cabos at Sunset Station."}
{"text":"It's hard to find a really good Mexican restaurant in Vegas.  We tried out this one yesterday.  The service was ok. The hostess looked like it was way to much effort to even try to crack a smile.  The waiter was very friendly and efficient. The food came quickly but was somewhat disappointing.  The taco was good,  but my relleno was under cooked,  my tamale was dry and tasteless.  Two dinners and two margaritas and the bill was almost $60.00. Pretty crazy for mediocre Mexican food."}
{"text":"Went for lunch and the place was deserted. Service was very fast and friendly. The salsa served with the chips was very good, but that's about where it ends. Ordered a chimichanga and it was mediocre. Not much to dislike or like about it. This place is better than some other Mexican restaurants in the area, but not worth a special trip."}
{"text":"This place is pretty awesome!!! I love my fried tilapia ..flavor and crispness was just right. The servers were also super sweet and attentive. They took care of all their customers the same way. I will definitely come back and check our their lounge area and try more of their dishes."}
{"text":"Food was good, nothing has been super good just ordinary for a Mexican restaurant. But then again I'm used to authentic home cooked Mexican food on a regular basis so maybe I'm just bias  lol service has always been great, only thing I didn't like is that they charge you for refills on certain drinks (it adds up) other than that it's ok, I would go back again when I'm not in the mood to cook."}
{"text":"I would give them 3.5 if Yelp allowed it. The carne asada was very good. My wife had steak ranchero which I tasted and they flavor was great but the steak was a little fatty. My father in law had enchiladas and liked then. My kids liked their quesadilla and chicken fingers. I have 2 minor issues that I hope will be better next visit. 1. The adult plates were not very hot, I hope this was only because it's their first week in business. We all like hot plates at Mexican restaurants. 2. While they did have reasonable kids meals at 6.99, they charged $2.50 extra for kids drinks. Most every other restaurant includes the kids drink in their kids meals. This could limit how many times we visit each month."}
{"text":"Not too happy with the food except the quesadilla , staff are not as nice as they should be specially in this busy and well known restaurant. Been there 3 times in the new location on Sunset and totally disappointed"}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place, very disappointed. I had a chicken tamale, it was very dry chicken was pink not how I like my tamales. Also order the grilled plate with sea food and beef, didn't get the beef told the waiter he brought me my beef stk but charged me for it. Rice and beans had no flavor. Only thing I enjoyed were the chips and green salsa."}
{"text":"So happy the new location on Sunset & Pecos opened.  It is exactly like the one downtown that we all love.  Fresh tortillas, delicious salsa, great tamale 's,  and the perfect margaritas.  Service is always good and friendly.  Great place to hold a birthday Party or Special Event in their side dinning room."}
{"text":"This is an over priced place. The food doesn't taste fresh and they defiantly need to fix the AC for the summer time. This place need better lighting  and fresher food!!"}
{"text":"The food was absolutely amazing!!!!  Just the amazing, authentic, flavorful Mexican food I've been looking for. Pretty sure their even tastier than the downtown location. Glad to have this spot in my neck of the woods. Bomb!!"}
{"text":"The food and service were excellent! I had a crunchy beef taco $3.50 and a chicken enchilada $3.99. The sauce and seasoning were delicious. I will definitely be back. I hope they keep it consistent! Fingers crossed."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere of this place and the hostess in their traditional dress , plus this place is updated from the older Mexican restaurant that was there before it became  Casa Don Juan. The waiter was very nice and polite and  the food I had for lunch was great! I had the taquitos served with rice and beans, very good! They also give you salsa  and bean dip with chips before the meal which I loved, so delicious, I hope this restaurant makes it because many of them don't. Goo Luck and I'll be back. The bar area is also very nice,check this place out folks,the prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"I'm not a Mexican food purist but I'm repulsed by people who say \"Taco Bell was better\" like synthetic textured vegetable protein is better than even a low grade of real food. Casa Don Juan's main menu items are what you would find in many traditional Mexican restaurants, where they stand out are the many well executed Mexican regional specialties they offer, similarly to Viva Zapatas.  But because of too much eating out recently, I'm sticking to something not so fattening. I had the shrimp fajitas dish. Fajitas are really a Tex/Mex dish with origins in 1930s in the ranch lands of South and West Texas. Throwaway items such as such as skirt steak were given to the Mexican vaqueros (cowboys) as part of their pay. The shrimp fajitas at Casa are a mound of Heaven- fresh shrimp and veggies flash grilled and expertly seasoned. I have learned to quickly move the shrimp to an adjoining plate otherwise they'll continue to cook at your table as you assemble the tacos and you'll end up with curled up tough shrimp. The usual condiments are provided-fresh guacamole, lettuce, and pico. A side plate of rice and beans which were perfectly prepared and seasoned, an absolute must in any Mexican restaurant. Our group also had fish tacos and ceviche which they inhaled with great satisfaction.   We took advantage of happy hour and hit the margaritas hard. Their house margarita is very tasty but could be a little stronger  My only reservation are the corn tortillas - which are hand made, thick and wonderful at the downtown location. Here they're thin, fresh and tasty but not really worth the starch load.   Service was outstanding, friendly, welcoming, and anticipatory -  meeting our every need and meal preferences."}
{"text":"Why can't there be a fresh and outstanding Mexican food place in the Green Valley area?    Lindo is bland and loud so we only go to Desert Inn location.    Carlitos is due another chance since they moved to Sunset but the new location there proved not to be as good as their original location.  Had been to Don Juan around downtown and wasn't impressed but someone told us the new location on Sunset was better.  Overall the food was okay.  Nothing that would drive us there on a separate trip.    Pro: pork tamale was good as was the cheese enchiladas.  Get the tamale enchilada style.  Extra 3.50 otherwise will be too dry. Beef taco had decent seasoning. Beans and rice pretty much standard fair, nothing special.  Chips standard fare, nothing that was unique or fresh about them. Salsa was was probably the weakest of all.  Watered down and not real appealing.  They served bean purée that had no seasoning at all.  As an ice tea drinker, the tea was so weak, just tasted like water.  Switched to a Coke instead.  My friend had same opinion on his food.  Would I go back?  Possibly if in the area, but someone please open a great Mexican place in the Green Valley Anthem area.  Could be a goldmine.  Us Gringos need a Spanish fix once a week!"}
{"text":"This place is great!! Food is delicious and the staff is AWESOME!! They had a woman making tortillas out on the floor and the margaritas are good and strong! We had 2 birthdays and our server (I'm an a**hole and I don't remember his name) made sure that it was celebrated! I live in Southern California and this place is great! Definitely coming back next trip!"}
{"text":"Exceptional! The service the decor the food. The salsa. We interacted with 4-5 people from the phone to the host etc. everyone was genuinely kind and friendly. I had the tamale Chile relleno and pork carnitas taco and my husband had the chicken and steak fajitas. We both enjoyed everything thoroughly. Can't wait to come back and try one of their drinks."}
{"text":"Couldn't be happier with our food and service. From Southern California and have found a new favorite. Thank you Jose!"}
{"text":"Excellent carnitas and bloody Mary's. The service is top notch. The best Mexican restaurant in Henderson."}
{"text":"This facility is by far my favorite one.  Awesome bar, incredible music, the environment is super chill and casual.  Evian and Xavier at the bar are extremely accommodating and great company.  The bar is a must sit in experience! Thanks guys for all the memories we make weekly. Cheers"}
{"text":"We had PBR's, Patron and Margaritas at happy hour. 2 for $6 happy hour.   Slightly remodeled inside since it was Jaliscos. I love Mexican food and Casa Don Juans does it well so I don't really have anything negative to say. Service is great, food is great, drinks are great. What else do you need? I like to sit in the bar side. Full food menu and tvs.  They just opened a week ago and the place is jumping. Good to see it doing well."}
{"text":"So. Good.   I came for lunch by myself and was greeted and seated pretty quick. The staff was friendly and very quick with bringing everything out which was GREAT because I was starving lol I got chicken enchiladas with a side of guacamole and chips . Vegas has a lot of Mexican restaurants but not all of them are good. Casa Don Juan is definitely a favorite of mine. I am coming back with my family next time"}
{"text":"Good authentic Mexican food without breaking the bank. The service was awesome, they wait wasn't long and the food came out fast."}
{"text":"My new favorite Mexican restaurant. The food is truly authentic. My favorite plate is chilaquiles con steak. The customer service is outstanding. And the fresh aguas frescas truly delicious, Not the \"klass\" powder you buy in the supermarket."}
{"text":"I order chicken fajitas I asked for a couple more tortillas they charged me 75 cents. Are you kidding me just give me a couple tortillas."}
{"text":"Excellent! I had the Camarones, (shrimp) a la diabla. My husband and father in-law, enjoyed shredded beef tacos and enchiladas. Definitely coming back and inviting friends!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service!  Amazing salsa!  Reasonably priced.  Will definitely eat here again while visiting Vegas!"}
{"text":"There isn't much to notice about the building, but as you approach the restaurant the colors start to pour out, flags, paintings, wall art & the uniforms of the staff make you feel like you've just walked into an authentic Mexican restaurant. We were promptly seated & brought water, wonderfully fresh chips, a small side of beans that were warm & creamy along with fresh salsa. So delicious!  We had a mango margarita, a house margarita on the rocks, and a lemonade. All were extremely tasty & refreshing.  Being in the mood for surf & turf, we ended up with 2 folks ordering steak & shrimp. The steak was a thin flat iron steak cooked until it melted in your mouth. Shrimp grilled to perfection. Our third person ordered fish fillets. It was so delicate and the flavors were amazing. Even though the food was amazing, the real experience came from the staff. Everyone was attentive, caring, funny, warm & inviting. It was later in the evening and we could've been rushed or snubbed for being close to closing time but we were welcomed and very well cared for. If I lived in the area, we would be here often! Don't miss out on this gem!"}
{"text":"We were so excited about the prospect of a good Mexican restaurant in this area, so we impatiently waited for Casa Don Juan to open. The interior decor has been updated, and the servers have new uniforms. The server was very attentive but the atmosphere was not relaxing at all while dining. Unfortunately, we felt that the food was mediocre at best. I got tamales, and they were very difficult to open. After that was accomplished, the tamale itself was like a ball of flavorless paste with almost no filling inside. It was awful and I did not eat them. The beans and rice lacked flavor, and even the chips and salsa were very bland. Hubby's fajitas had a sparse amount of very tough beef and the prices were high for the quality of the food. We will keep waiting for a good Mexican restaurant to open in our area."}
{"text":"To start with sincerity and fairness the food was fresh and tasty. The overall environment gave the illusion of friendliness. The resturant was clean.  So why only one star...??? Well, unfortunately as one saying goes, it only takes one bad apple to spoil the entire bowl.  Customer service is key.  In a competitive world of Mexican restaurants and servers are also alway looking for work this review may be something to consider. A Sunday at 3pm it was relatively empty restaurant. We were a not a small table but not an extremely large party either. We had placed our orders which seemed to take an extended period of time. At least 2 refills of chips and 2 drink refills.  Then finally our food arrives!  Then 3 of the plates were incorrect. The first one to notice sees it right away. Tells the server CARLOS. He instantly replied with \" I know what you ordered this is it\". Then they told him, \" ok I was wanting an item that sounded just  like this can we please get that instead\". He again replayed with \" no, in know what you ordered and it was this\". He had his hands on my shoulder as he is telling me this. Which I am taking very aggressive now. He then moves on to serving others leaving this plate and no assistance to correct it.   I then as my husband  to ask him can I please get the other item. To which CARLOS places his hands on my shoulders again and says \"no I can't. You ordered this understand. So, if I exchange it I have to pay for it out of MY PAY.\" I did not misunderstand what CARLOS said, I have 5 witnesses to sign off on this.   Then we have to order another plate of what was originally wanted AND PAY ADDITIONAL for it.  Plus, the other two plates that were mixed up, CARLOS tried to pull off as the people at the tables fault again. He even tried to give one person a bitten into item of food to swap plates.( Due to the fact you would not know until you open the food what is inside) Ok so that is one part but then CARLOS tells a blatant lie. When asked the table is asked if they want desserts. One person said sure are they complimentary? He said no. She said no then.. I just thought maybe you were giving us a special treat of a complimentary dessert or something. To which CARLOS said \" You can talk to the owner. She is up front with the Mexican dress and flowers in her hair.\" Pointing to a hostess. Now after completing our meal. Approaching and asking the hostess if she was the owner she stated, \" Me,No. She is bartending if you would like me to get her.\"   The owner bartending was never up front where he pointed or alluded to. She was in the bar the entire time he mentiomed her and you cannot see inside the bar from the area we were in the resturant. So, could she be considered up front...sure, if your trying to be condescending and look to be a liar if someone actually asks.  Summarized: As stated at the beginning the food and cleanliness were great. Service from CARLOS negative 0. Why? Defensiveness before apologizing  Never trying to correct the problem Never bringing management over to correct the problem. Touching a customer when defending yourself.   Especially placing your hands on top of their shoulders while seated and your behind them. That is aggressive behavior towards a person. Intentional Misdirection to a person of authority or management.  I believe that can sum it up enough. So sad I cannot reccoment such a place to anyone with such an employee. The food was so good."}
{"text":"Like its predecessors this place is ok but not great.  I had high hope heard the other location was good.  From start I was annoyed with comedian waiter.  Hello my name is Juan but not the Juan.  Take you drink order?   Yes diet coke ok Dr pepper...  And every time he came let me get you a Dr pepper refill.  Haha great except the time you actually did bring me the wrong refill.  I ordered a tamale that was very hard to open.  And it was like no tamale ever had in past was more like a ball shape.  No filling just made.  The rest of the meal was ok.  Not great but ok.  But after Super Mex which turned to Jalisco (same owner)  I almost expected this to be the same average food and it was just slightly pricer.  Will I be back?  More likely no."}
{"text":"Amazing food, and incredible service! We've come several times since they've opened and everyone always greets us like we're returning family members. The food is just as awesome! Tried many parts of the menu and it's always been consistently the best food in Vegas. Could not give a higher recommendation and I look forward to coming back with my family over and over again."}
{"text":"We have always like Casa down town but they have recently opened this location in the old Jalisco mexican restaurant.  The Inside has been completely redecorated and very very festive.  Our service was very on point and someone was always walking by the tables constantly removing plates, refilling salsas or chips and making sure your drinks were filled.  Our food was on point with decent portions compared to the prices and very tasty. We find the food here a little better tasting and $1-$3 cheaper per plate than the Lindo chain. Our only complaint was when we asked for some spicy salsa for our meals we were told there was an extra charge.  We will keep coming back.  Also take note, many times you can find a groupon for the down town location that's a pretty decent deal."}
{"text":"Yep, a personal favorite.   I'm new to the area and I love this place.  The pomegranate margarita on the rocks alone is worth the visit.  I get enchiladas with the green sauce which are delicious!  The rellenos are also yummy.  I definitely recommend!  Plus the staff is awesome."}
{"text":"So excited for Casa Don Juan to open in Henderson and it didn't disappoint. Same great food and attentive, wonderful service. Love the queso and thrilled to have another choice for Mexican food in Henderson."}
{"text":"$14.00 FOR ONE DRINK!!!! I get it that Grey Goose is a little more expensive but seriously $14.00 a drink is a little excessive for a restaurant OFF THE STRIP.. We got a whole plate of food for less than that.. However, the food is great and they are friendly."}
{"text":"Great food, Great Atmosphere, Great service.  Me and my wife split the Steak and cheese enchilada meal.  Excellent!  Had a Michelada and a peach margarita BOMB.  My kids where with us and they were a pain, but the staff treated them as equals.  (they wanted ranch instead of salsa, had an issue with the food, and made a mess).  Its nice to have a sit down Mexican.  Its a rare breed these days."}
{"text":"The wife and I wanted to try this tucked away Mexican restaurant for awhile and we finally did.  Love love loved the service, the food, and the tea.  This was a little pricey but totally worth it.  Felt like I was back In San Diego eating Mexican food.  In fact just writing this makes me want to go back.  The portions were big so bring your appetite.  Highly recommended from friends and they were not wrong.  My only downside was why did we wait so long to try this place.  Stupid me!  Go and enjoy a great meal."}
{"text":"We had an excellent experience, delicious food good margaritas, and great service from Jay. All of the staff was friendly and helpful. We would definitively go back"}
