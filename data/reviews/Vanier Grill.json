{"text":"A diner with an updated look inside.  I had an excellent steak and egg breakfast.  Food served hot, quick service, nice presentation.  Will definitely return."}
{"text":"I bought one of their club sandwiches because it was advertised as the best in Ottawa. There was only two pieces of bacon on it, in an 'x' formation. The first bite was tasty, but once you got past that edge, it was disappointing. Won't be ordering from them again."}
{"text":"After seeing all these good reviews, i decided to give this place a try. I ordered onion soup and a rare new york steak. The onion soup was so salty and mushy that after only taking 2 sips, i had to throw it away. The steak was so blend, greasy and dry. The mash potatoes that came with it tasted bad and felt like they came from powder mix's that you buy at Walmart.  It clearly wasn't worth the amount of money I paid considering that they're quite expensive.Anyway, it was quite a disappointment dining experience and i would not recommend it."}
{"text":"I went here with a colleague to grab drinks and to get  a pizza to go. After 10 minutes, I left to go to store across the street. As I walked out o saw whom was later identified as the owner walk out onto the bar area.  My colleague was sitting at a table with his foot up on a chair. The owner or manager told him he was not \"f-ing\" house and he needed to put his foot down.  I have a few golden rules, and one is \"I don't pay for Bad Behavior, nor service\".  I cant tell you how the food is because we never recieved it. I can tell you that if you are drinking mixed drinks or shots, you better measure it because the pours are thin. More importantly, they are far better ways to communicate with people, especially when you are an owner or manager.   They get a rating of one because Yelp does not allow anything lower.   I don't recommend this bar."}
{"text":"We placed an order on \"SkipTheDishes\" and this was the fastest delivery i have ever seen! We had a medium hawa√Øenne pizza with garlic bread for a total of 29$! How fun is that!!! The cheese on that pizza was soo good! And the garlic bread was perfect  big"}
{"text":"Cute little spot,  had to try the winning club and it was good! The pizza was also good and I would recommend that you come on Tuesday for a pizza night it's half off.  Not a big place but cozy for some drinks or brunch."}
{"text":"Came here for poutine cuz that's the only thing my niece wanted to eat. Ordered from the car in the parking lot across for pick up, waited 10 minutes and went to pick it up. It was ready and waiting, and packed in a free large ecological shopping bag.  Albeit it was pricey for 1 small italian poutine, 1 large regular poutine, 1 chicken burger plate with a side of gravy and 2 cans of coke (43$ before tip), it was still pretty damn good.   My dad (being Italian) was not impressed with the italian poutine stating the sauce tasted suspiciously fresh out of a can. My mom loved the chicken burger platter. And the gravy. And for my mom to like a gravy...well that's saying a LOT.  My niece and I shared the large regular poutine and the portion was huge! The gravy was fantastic...and while the cheese was too melted and thus probably some kinda mozzarella instead of curd cheese (like it should be)...it was still delicious and filling!   The place was really cute and cozy too...I will definitely be back to have a drink one night and again one morning too for their breakfast!"}
{"text":"My wife and I are always on a quest to find the best greasy-spoon breakfast deal in town and I finally think I found it. It is the Vanier Grill on Montreal Road, in the Vanier area of town. Vanier is a no-nonsense, lunchbox district that has its sketchy aspects, but is all heart. My wife and I were out and about in Vanier when we spotted this awesome sign in the window of the Vanier Grill - breakfast special: eggs, ham or sausage, toast, coffee and jam for only $2.99!!! Now, we have been scouring the city for months seeking the best deal and this is, indeed, the lowest price we've seen. Now, Vanier Grill is a no-frills kind of place, but you will get the true greasy spoon experience."}
{"text":"Great family owned and managed restaurant. Awesome service and even better food. Go there when you're hungry. Great value on the breakfast and the Eggs Benedict is to die for. Easy to get to. Always parking. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Really disappointed with them. I love their breakfast and I was super excited to wake up in time to order it today for new years and the guy was very rude to me. When I asked him how much my meal was going to be he said. \"Idk, I work in the kitchen\" so I said ah okay and he then said \" Don't give me a hard time, it's New Years\" I felt super uncomfortable and just hung up. Thanks for ruining my New Years breakfast"}
{"text":"Unpretencious place with unpretencious prices. It's certainly not haute cuisin but everyone I went with really enjoyed their meals and the club I had was good by pub standards. Some of the other patrons are certainly colourful but everyone keeps to themselves and it has a nice big patio. I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Use to come here minimum once a week for years  then the service got extremely slow ..waiting for an hour fir pizza when dinning inn ? Seems a little excessive but hey the food was good so we would still come but not as often . One Tuesday we decide to go in the Tuesday pizza deal Half off and we order water cause it's a hot summer day so we decide to have water the waitress proceeds by telling us we can't order water we must order something else to drink keep in mind no where does it state we have to purchase a drink to even get the pizza deal so I no worries on the drinks then we'll just have the pizza then the waitress says well u can't have the pizza so I simply said ok then we shall go somewhere and get up to leave and she say we are still getting a deal to Wich I said yes but no where does it state u must purchase a drink with the pizza so I say that is called false advertisement then she had the nerve to scream at me in front of my children calling me a cheap skate  ...altho I use to come to spend money in that restaurant no matter if it was in house or delivery at least 2-3 times a week and even after all the  slow service I still have them my business once every week or two nice way to treat loyal customers never again   Good food is why they even get a star out of me horrible service horrible waitress  worst part is they always got 4-5$ tips on orders of  only 12-17$"}
{"text":"This is a modern day grill with excellent food.  The interior is nice; the service is quick and friendly.  The food is delicious and reasonably priced, and drinks are a good price too."}
{"text":"The delivery guy from skip the dishes was mad that he couldn't find the house on the crescent. First time this has happend. Delivery guy should make an honest effort to drive the entire crescent to find the house. The food was poorly packaged and the food was placed vertically in the bag. Like I pay 27$ for a service and they can't keep food in the bag properly... the poutine was downsized tremendously compared to last time. This is will be the last time I order from Vanier grill."}
