{"text":"This was my families first ever hibachi experience about 6 years ago & it was amazing THEN . Went today and they give u about 5 lo mein noodles and one egg in fried rice for 4 people ! And my daughters had to do the share charge for theirs as they're 16 & 13 but do t eat close to what an adult eats . They used to give both fried rice and noodles and now it's 2.00$ more for fried rice ! And that's why we left a small tip and won't go back ."}
{"text":"The food was alright. Not good. Not bad. And considering the portion, the prices weren't bad either. The service, on the other hand, was terrible. Severely understaffed. Three hours order to check. Worst of all the chef put cooked lobster tail back into the raw shell to serve it. Avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"Where do I even start. The rice was so under cooked it was hard enough to stick in my teeth. Mentioned twice we wanted our steak very rare, got it medium well to medium at best. Timing was awful, rice came out first and veg last. Chef drowned everything in butter, so much it was sickening. Waitress sucked and was MIA mostly. Everything was terrible. My stomach feels heavy with butter. We did not stay for our Desserts. Awful. Awful. Awful. I cannot even put it into words what a sorry meal this was. Don't waste your money. You'd be better off ordering pizza."}
{"text":"I travel a lot and have eaten at a lot of Hibachi restaurants. I happen to have a project in the Pittsburgh area and was looking for a Hibachi place to take my co-workers. I read several reviews on other Hibachi places and they all sound the same. The typical they are so busy the service sucks and they rush you in and out to turn tables quickly.  I found Sapporo and was very pleased! It is in an odd location but once you step inside, you feel the ambiance of cozy and family style. My party felt the staff was very friendly.  I had ordered the filet and shrimp with fried rice. The others in my group ordered chicken broccoli, and the Sapporo Deluxe which consists of lobster, filet and shrimp. We all got started with the soup and salads, which was a pretty good size. I didn't want to finish it all because I wanted to save room for dinner. Our Chef was one of the most personable Chef's I have encountered. He was very talkative and really wanted to get to know us. My file was delicious and the fried rice was excellent. They make their fried rice from scratch. It's not prepared ahead of time like I see at most Hibachi places. I can definitely tell the difference. My friend Sam who ordered the chicken broccoli could not stop raving about the sauce that they used. It is unlike soy sauce or teriyaki sauce. We asked the Chef about the sauce and sure enough it is one of a kind. Dan, who ordered the Sapporo Deluxe was very pleased with his meal and couldn't even finish it. Actually we all needed to-go boxes. The portion amount here is incredible. You definitely get your money's worth here!!  I would highly recommend this place to Hibachi lovers because this place is surely a secret in Pittsburgh. I can not stress how different this place is compared to other Hibachi places. I think this restaurant is family owned and not a chain which I can always appreciate.   Thank you Sapporo for a great Hibachi experience!! I will be back for sure!  Anh"}
{"text":"Weird to find a Hibachi style Japanese steakhouse out in the distant hills of western Pittsburgh, but here it is. It was rather empty on a Saturday night, and it's admittedly weird to have a white guy doing your hibachi cooking but he was real friendly and chatty and did a fine job preparing everything. The kitchen and servers did forget my steamed rice and had to be bugged for it, however.  The food was fresh and rich with flavor, and despite the highish hibachi prices the multi-course meal felt reasonably satisfying. They did leave me hanging an inordinately long time on paying the check, though, like they forgot I had yet to pay. The service overall was unduly lax, even though the cooking was great and they were reasonably cordial.  I gather the options in Pittsburgh are thin for hibachi, so if you're really craving it it's worth a trip, though in general it's not a destination."}
{"text":"Sapporo is my favorite Japanese restaurant, period. I've found other places that come close, but for me, this is the place I like to spend my money when it comes to hibachi cuisine.   Sapporo is an unassuming place right next to Steubenville Pike's hottest tourist attraction, the Pittsburgh Motel. But don't let the location fool you. Step inside and enjoy a cozy atmosphere. There's a bar at the front, some tables to the right, and the main dining area to the left. There's also that karaoke machine I've never seen used in all the years I've gone here.  Unlike other Japanese restaurants like Saga (great stuff) and Ichiban, the cooks at Sapporo aren't all about giving an extensive show while cooking. Each of the chefs have a few of the basic crowd pleasers, such as the knife and spatula toss and the onion volcano, etc., but really it's all about the food, which is fine by me. I do sometimes miss when the chefs toss the pieces of shrimp up in the air towards your mouth to catch, but only because no one ever likes to participate in that but me and it's fun to look like a goofball while trying, but that's neither here nor there.  The food here is excellent. They've introduced a new look to their menu recently. I don't know if they scaled it down, as I often always order from the same section. I did notice they have a couple of sushi options available. They used to have a full sushi bar, and you can still see that when you walk in, but I'm not sure if they're using it for anything other than just what's on the main menu, which would be a shame if so, as their sushi was always great and you could order it from a separate menu. Again, this may be something they still have that I'm not aware of.  At any rate, the starter soup and salad is great. I love the bits of onion in the soup. It's a very strong broth, but not overpowering. The ginger dressing on the salad is something you either like or loathe at any Japanese restaurant, and here I really love it, but I tend to like it everywhere I've had it, so I'm not a real stickler when it comes to that.  Usually I order the filet mignon and shrimp with fried rice for my main meal, though last time I got the deluxe version of the dish which also includes lobster tail and ice cream for dessert. Either way, it's a great dish. I've also had the chicken and shrimp and have enjoyed it as well.  Now, my favorite thing here is the shrimp sauce. I call it the \"magic sauce.\" It's of the light pink variety and thin consistency. I'm always disappointed when I go to other Japanese steakhouses and they either don't have shrimp sauce altogether or they have the thicker, mayonnaise-based version, which is OK, but doesn't come close to the awesomeness that is the magic sauce. Apparently it's a secret as to just what goes into it. On one visit our chef joked that its main base was strawberry Quik, which one of the fellow diners at my table believed.  So if you get the fried rice here, dump some of the magic sauce on there. It's amazing. Use it for your steak or chicken as well. I find myself doing that and then saving the darker sauce for my grilled veggies, which are also top notch here. Terrific grilled onions and ripe zucchini as well as mushrooms and broccoli. I don't care for broccoli personally, but the rest is excellent.  Sapporo has also started throwing in noodles to the mix. According to the owner this is because other restaurants started doing it, so patrons who came in started asking why Sapporo didn't have them as well. I think they were doing fine without them, as it just adds even more to an already large amount of food, but they are good, if unnecessary.  The steak here is great. I've had the sirloin as well as the filet. I always get mine cooked rare, and it is of the melt in your mouth caliber. The shrimp never taste fishy, and the lobster tail is similarly excellent. All around, you get a great meal here for the price.  I'm not sure which nights are more crowded than not anymore. Sapporo's a funny place in that some weeknights you'll drive by and it's packed and then other nights it will be quiet. I'd suppose weekends draw the biggest crowds. Yet even when it was \"packed\" I've never had to wait long to be seated at a table.  So if you haven't been, give Sapporo a try. It's been there forever. The owner and staff are super nice and they really do care about serving you great food when you visit. They don't do lunches anymore, so it's strictly dinner meals, so be looking at spending at least 20-30 dollars on up for adults, and around 10 or so for kids' meals. It's not some place you would go frequently if you're on a budget, but that makes it all the more a treat when you do go."}
{"text":"Where do I start? We went in there wanting to eat sushi and in instead we decided to do the Habachi. The waitress was nice and took our order consisting of filet and their proclaimed \"largest steak\", including a sushi appetizer. When the tuna appetizer came out, I couldn't believe how disgusting it was. I love tuna and couldn't even finish it. It was definitely previously frozen and had probably been sitting in their freezer for months. When the cook came out and started chatting with us, I had asked him where the restaurant got their meats from and he answered \"GSF, I think \" which is all previously frozen foods (never fresh). Then the cook took the steaks out, filet and their \"biggest steak\", both were the same size and definitely not the described cut. We asked for it medium rare and both steaks were cooked well. The scallops were the most disgusting and sickening looking scallops I have ever seen. Overall, this has to be one of the worst restaurants in Pittsburgh and I eat out a lot! I really don't understand how it is still open and wouldn't even recommend giving leftovers to your dog. THE MOST WAIST FULL $125.00 I HAVE EVER SPENT!!!!!"}
{"text":"Really great hibachi! I have had hibachi all over, and this place really stands out!  Very friendly, great show and awesome food.  Shrimp was very fresh and steak was perfect!  Goes so well with an ice cold Kirin beer!  I try to come here every time I am in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"I'll be honest, the food is great. We went for dinner one night this summer and they were actually cooking for the Chicago Cubs. HOWEVER, I made a reservation for last night and upon arrival was told there would be an hour wait. I said we made a reservation! Didn't matter. At least then tell people you don't take reservations. Very poor customer service! I was very disappointed with the experience!"}
{"text":"My favorite Japanese Steakhouse in the Greater Pittsburgh area. Staff is great, and food is fresh - always! Larger portions than most steakhouses will give!"}
{"text":"We decided on Sapporo after reading so-so reviews on Ichiban and Benihana's.  This was a nice surprise. Yes, it is not in the best looking area, and yes, the restaurant may not be as nice as a Benihana.  But the food was quite good.    We had our doubts at first.  We went in the middle of a Sunday afterfoon and the place was empty.  And service seemed to be a little disorganized and distracted.  But once the chef came out and got to work, it was great.  The salad and soup were veyr good, the soup being a little more beefy in flavor than what we were used to.  We then had the fried rice and got a HUGE portion.  We needed a little more soy sauce that what the chef used, but he gladly provided more and the rice was delicious.    Then we moved to the main entrees.  Wife had the Chateaubriand and I had the Tenderloin and Scallops.  The meat, although cooked  just a tad past medium, still melted in your mouth,and the scallops were absolutely the best I've ever had!!  Again, huge portions of meat and vegetables, plus a large portion of noodles. Definitely a plateful.  We did not get the requisite show you get at this kind of restaurant, but we've seen it so many times, it's kinda boring to me.  Instead, we had a nice conservsation with the chef about the Pittsburgh area.  All in all, this was a very pleasant meal, and I'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Hibachi spot in all of Pittsburgh. It's right on 60 near Crafton/Ingram and Thornburg. It is family run and they are great. The décor is a little dated but I go here for the food, people, and prices. They are a little cheaper than nakama, saga, and ichiban. The service is outstanding. I like the fact the give you rice and noodles. They make you feel at home and I like that better than all of the chains."}
{"text":"Yes it's expensive but it's the best Japanese steakhouse in Pittsburgh a real hidden gem fresh seafood and delicious sauces. You get what you pay for here perfection."}
{"text":"Been to many hibachis, this one is very clean, the building is a little older but the family that runs it does a wonderful job.   I came here and got the chicken. Spot on, I loved the beef stew it came with- I always think the salad at hibachis are real alright- but the sushi was delicious and the hibachi was wonderful with delicious noodles , veggies, and rice- best I have had in a while because it ain't too salty- many times for me it's too extreme on the salt.  Free edamame with check in so that was a plus.   Reasonably priced delicious Japanese goodness- seemed like it also had good drinks.  Will return."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I are practically Hibachi connoisseurs so when we visited Pittsburgh for the weekend the first thing we Yelp searched was.. you guessed it, Hibachi! Sapporo was highly rated so we went for dinner on a Saturday night.  The restaurant is located in front of a dimly lit motel but don't be discouraged by the facade because once you step inside the door the atmosphere is warm and inviting.   We were greeted by the owner's daughter who sat us at an empty table while we waited for the other guests to join us. The owner's son brought us menus to look over and informed us that Sapporo is a family-run establishment. The table quickly filled with regulars who said that Sapporo was their favorite Hibachi restaurant in Pittsburgh, one couple even said that they come for dinner every single Saturday evening. The owner himself came over to our table and began cooking our meal!  I ordered the Hibachi chicken and broccoli in Sapporo special sauce and my boyfriend ordered the Hibachi shrimp and chicken, both with fried rice. Both meals were good but the special sauce on my chicken was absolutely delicious! Definitely one of the best Hibachi chicken variation that I have tasted and my boyfriend really enjoyed how flavorful his shrimp tasted. The chef, a Korean war veteran, was engaging in our conversation and made you feel as if you were over a friend's house for dinner.  We both agreed that we will definitely return to Sapporo the next time that we are in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"What a disappointment. First and last time coming to Sapporo. We thought this would be a fun experience for celebrating our son's birthday dinner. After and hour and 15 minutes we had only beverages, soup and salad. Then they apologized saying it would be at least another half hour for a chef to begin our meal. We said that was unacceptable and could not wait any longer. Giving 2 stars for the free edamame appetizer and the fact they did not charge us for the beverages/soup/salad. Too bad this wasn't what we expected."}
{"text":"Fantastic as Always. Portions are generous, and service is prompt. Always treated like family here. Try the scallops, they are DELICIOUS."}
{"text":"Kay loves Japanese cuisine. I love reviewing the previously unreviewed, exploring the uncharted if you will. So you know I was thrilled when I found Sapporo after doing a simple internet search and was even more thrilled to find that their food and service is stellar.  When we got there, we saw that it's next to a seedy motel, seedy motels being a fixture in the landscape of Robinson. Thankfully this was no harbinger of bad dining.   When we walked in, there was no one in sight...for a few minutes, anyway. Finally, a fresh-faced twentysomething fellow seated us around a hibachi. After dining on their excellent Sapporo salad with its sweet ginger dressing and savory, mushroom-laden Japanese Onion Soup (this wasn't the Miso I'm used to), out walked our culinary samurai.   \"How you guys doin'? Been here before?\"  That's the Far East by way of Pittsburgh.  Friendliness and earthy demeanor aside, he was a true, steely warrior, wielding his knife, fork, and spatula as if they were ancient, mystical weapons, slicing, dicing, frying, and fileting like Miyamoto Usagi taking on a cloud of Komori ninja.   There's something about eating food prepared right in front of you on a large, broiling, rectangle. Fried rice is depressed onto the grill like a burger, caramelizing it, the butter that is copiously added making it rich, soy sauce darkening it, making it even richer.  Eating a hibachi-cooked meal gives one the opportunity to see how beautiful raw meat and seafood can be. My Land 'N Sea combo came with a scarlet tenderloin that became mouthful after mouthful of velvet after it was cooked. The white scallops turned golden, shimmering before and after service, my teeth lovingly, vampirically sinking into them, relishing their seaborne sapor the same as I did the shrimp.  If I were wealthy enough, I'd put a hibachi in my home, if there was room for it. Imagine breakfast as...an event, daily!  Kay ordered the Sapporo Marina, which gets you shrimp, scallops, and strips, not rings, of a calamari so beatific, having it tempura-battered and fried may not be enough for me anymore, calamari taking on a whole new dimension of taste and tactility when floured and placed on a broiling flat iron plate.   Oh yes, what hibachi meal would be complete sans the grandeur of the Onion Volcano? First came the oil and vodka, then a jet of alcohol-charged flame, and finally a spire of steam.   Even simple kitchen tasks were artful. Frying an egg was akin to a dance. The chef's spatula clanged against the shakers while he seasoned our food as if he was making ritualized music before battle. A spectacle it was for the eyes and mouth alike."}
{"text":"Great prices, huge portions and friendly environment. Great place!"}
