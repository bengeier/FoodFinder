{"text":"Excellent ambiance. If this place was in a slightly better location they would be unstoppable. Regardless they do so many things right. Excellent food, and old school bartenders that actually take pride in the cocktails they prepare. Very impressed."}
{"text":"Ugh the mussels verde were disgusting. Small portion with three mussels and even delivered with one closed! Good service though. It was comped but very fishy"}
{"text":"The scallops are the best I have ever had.  The OMFG salad is amazing.  Bob was our server and was the man.  The service from everyone was top notch.  Great experience."}
{"text":"This seems to be a happening place, but we were able to make reservations about an hour before dinner on a Saturday night.  I had a couple of cocktails (the grog and something barrel-aged; forgot the name), both of which were better than I expected.  For dinner, had a few apps--the fondue, the mac and cheese, and the chia tuna. I don't think you can really go wrong with fondue, so that was fine; the chia tuna was decent and I liked the rice it's plated on. The mac and cheese though--WHY would you put tomatoes in mac and cheese?! You're desecrating the dish! It does NOT work. When I ate around the tomatoes, the mac and cheese was great! I don't get it.  Otherwise, I think the restaurant was worthwhile, and I'm glad we stopped by."}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant with amazing food!! Sam, our server, had such great recommendations. We had the burrata for starters, original chopped salad, braised short ribs, and for dessert, cocoa jar and financier. Omg. Amazing!!!! Our host, Lex, was awesome keeping up to date with the World Series score (since there's no tv's here). He's awesome too. Love love love this place. I will be coming back, especially when the speakeasy opens. Yeay!! So happy with new finds :)"}
{"text":"Wonderful food and atmosphere, great service.  Will definitely be coming back sooner than later hopefully."}
{"text":"I loved the chopped salad, the buttermilk chicken, and the peanut butter dessert.  So many different flavors that blended so well.  The service was AWESOME, with a perfect atmosphere.  You won't regret coming here!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner as a party of three.  I absolutely LoVeD the Original Chopped Salad!  Enough to check out and \"like\" its very own Facebook page.  I ordered right.  Five stars for my choice.    We weren't terribly famished so we ordered a couple of sandwiches and the appetizer crab cake and decided to share.   The gourmet grilled cheese sounded wonderful.  Meh.  None of us were impressed  or even satisfied.  The mashed potatoes really don't belong there, and their choice of cheeses was way to strong for us.  Presentation however was five star all around. The fried bologna was a yum for two of the three of us and the crab cake was good. Service was good.    Maybe we need to come back and order something off the dinner entree menu.  That bring said, definitely order The Original Chopped Salad and try an entree!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like Citizen Public House because the reviews are so amazing, I thought it was ok.  It always bothers me when I sit down at a table in a nice restaurant and the table cloth is dirty and my plate was not clean...  On the plus side, the service was good.  It was a nice surprise to have the chopped salad, that's a favorite.  I had duck and it was good - it came with sweet potato hash and greens - both good also, could use a little kick - but I like really spicy food!"}
{"text":"Had the Pork Cheek small plate, it was well balanced withe the pickled fennel and sweetness of cranberries.  The Barron's and Thieves cocktail was brilliant.  Rye Whiskey and Aperol cocktail that was bitter, sweet citrusy."}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant with another couple. It happened to be my birthday the next day. The service was superb.  Have you ever had pickled okra? It's very good.  The chopped salad was light and refreshing.  When in doubt go with the chicken. I'm glad I did. The chicken was flavorful and comforting. Others at my table had the tuna and the braised beef.  I was so satisfied I had no intention of having dessert. But they brought out a chocolate brownie with ice cream and a candle. How can I refuse that? The waiter was smooth, and surprised me!!   Thank you for a wonderful dinner. I'm definitely going back."}
{"text":"Chopped Salad was fabulous, as was the lamb burger. Service was top rate."}
{"text":"Delicious meal & original cocktails   Pros: - nice menu but fairly limited for vegetarians  - awesome cocktails w in house spirits - good wine selection & reasonable prices - great service - super attentive & fun  Cons: - Ono was slightly over cooked  - hummus not very flavorful"}
{"text":"Amazing food and great service!  The server did a great job of describing the food choices and made great recommendations."}
{"text":"Interesting cocktails, tasty popcorn, good hummus plate, and fondue was so so. Came during happy hour and it was empty. Good service sitting at the bar."}
{"text":"Not reviewing the food or atmosphere, just the management at CPH:  Went with a large group of 40 or so people - given the private room upstairs.  Due to what was apparently a miscommunication, CPH only wanted to allow our party to order from a set menu.  Many of us were not interested the set 4-course meal, and wanted food/drinks from the regular menu.  The management was not willing to allow this - since we didn't order from the fixed menu, they charged our group a $500 surcharge.   So, CPH got $500 from our group (instead of the much larger fare had they allowed us to order from the normal menu.    But that will be the LAST penny CPH will ever see from me.    Saddle House, on the other hand, took great care of our large group at a moments notice.  We ate and had drinks there all night, including some freebies thrown in because they appreciated our business."}
{"text":"I love this place the food is awesome especially happy hour and I especially like the soft shell crab sandwich and the steak kabobs! I"}
{"text":"In town for a conference, so decided to grab dinner here with a couple of friends from work. Looking at the menu ahead of time, I was drawn to the bacon fat popcorn and figured either this would be awesome or it was going to be an absolute bacon-trend disaster of a meal.  It was outstanding.  We arrived and the place was fairly busy.  Definitely energetic but not to the point where one couldn't carry on a conversation without shouting.  Started of with some of the house cocktails and bacon fat popcorn and the kilt lifter fondue.  Cocktails were strong, yet balanced and flavorful.  The popcorn was ridiculous, not greasy or over-the-top, with pieces of crisp bacon scattered throughout.  The kilt lifter fondue was equally tasty.  We decided to try several items off the starter menu- waffles and fried chicken, pork belly pastrami, and the original chopped salad.  My co-worker went nuts over the fried chicken and waffles, saying it was some of the best he's ever had (must have been good because he's from the south and knows his way around a fried chicken).  Now, I'm a guy who knows a thing or two about pastrami and making pastrami with pork belly just didn't seem, well, kosher.  If there was ever a case to plead for allowing pork to become kosher, this would be the dish you'd have to serve the Rabbi.  It was insane and would make even the staunchest Rabbinical authority issue a blessing.  I didn't try the chopped salad, but the person in our group who ordered it said it was outstanding.  Overall, solid choice and will be back next trip to Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Great place for a romantic get a way! Food and service were great! Only suggestion would be to expand on wines by the glass!"}
{"text":"Cute and fancy. Cocktails, wine, and selection of foods topped off the day.  The wide availability of pork bellies reminded me of Houston grade food  institutes, but it kept a very Northern Californian vibe and soul over all.  I hadn't seen this venue included in the \"places to get cocktails\" circuits yet, but it would place well in that categorical."}
{"text":"Bradley was RAD! This was our first restaurant and meal in Scottsdale after having just got off a flight and it was such a phenomenal experience. I ordered the short ribs which were coffee rubbed with an amazing cherry sauce. Brad brought us bacon fat popcorn as a surprise and suggested the best menu items. The Original Chopped salad was out of this world, same with the Mac N Cheese!! We had such a lovely evening and he didn't rush our meal at all. It was a very relaxing and enjoyable meal. Thanks Brad!!!"}
{"text":"It was my first time here, i had a good experience but i thought the food i had was ok.  Maybe i dont have a very sophisticated palette, but i thought the fondue was ok.  The cheese didn't have a very appetizing taste to it.  I ordered the short ribs which were awesome!! They fell right off the bone and had great taste.  they pair it with a mashed potato that had a weird spearmint taste that overwhelmed the dish.  I had a drink called the moscow mule, very refreshing and it doesn't feel like you are having alcohol.  My fiance ordered the chopped salad, supposedly one of the best salads she has had.  I had a bite and agreed it was very good.  The ambiance it nice, a little dark, but was cool how it felt like you were in a house.  I will go back, but hopefully have a good all around meal."}
{"text":"I left a tip, but a further review is necessary. I have to start out by saying that I was skeptical about coming here. But my wife hyped it so much for the bacon-fat popcorn. I was excited that they had chicken and waffles(as being a huge fan, and eating at many chicken/waffle places, i.e. Roscos in LA, LoLo's, etc.) I must say, honestly... pathetic. the chicken was over fried, dry, burnt and thigh meat to top it off. The waffle was a tiny 3inch square, with not syrup, but honey. And rather bland as well. Upon stating my dis-satisfaction to my waitress, she offered me my choice of different food from the menu. I chose the AZ BLT, per her request. And, I was blown away. the bacon was orgasmic(for lack of better terms), it buckled my knees with its perfection of tenderness and semi salty flavor. As a man who loves crispy bacon(almost burnt), this was a dance of flavor that is matched by few. The combination of the fresh greens, campari tomato, carmelized french bread and aioli mayo made this \"basic\" classic dance on the tastebuds. Total redemption was achieved, and I would recomend this place to anyone. Also, having happy hour 7 days a week does'nt hurt either. good prices and drinks."}
{"text":"This is a great place for sophisticated, but reasonably priced food!  We've been here a couple times and everything that we've ordered was delicious.  You can't go wrong with the scallops and the duck.  We will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"This place was absolutely fantastic! Great ambiance and fantastic food. We got the Pork Belly Pastrami, which was like an inside out Ruben, wonderful. Chopped Salad, very good, especially with the smoked salmon. Gypsy Bacon Sandwich, the bacon was unbelievable, along with the sandwich innards made it refreshing. Lastly we got the Duck. This was probably the best. It had a great \"millet\" (like grits), and it went so well with the perfectly cooked duck.  The only thing I would suggest, it to NOT get the Pork Belly and Bacon Sandwich together. There was just a bit too much bacon/pork flavor, it detracted a bit from the meal. It would have been helpful if the server had mentioned that.  Overall, I would highly recommend Citizen Public House. It is a bit pricy, but just getting the sandwiches would definitely help keep the price down."}
{"text":"After a day at the Grand Canyon, we arrived late & not at our prettiest with kids in tow. Fondue excellent as was chicken & waffles. Prices very reasonable and portions surprisingly generous. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Really loved this restaurant. My fiancé surprised me and took me on a date here and we both were so impressed. Not only was the food amazing and different, our waiter (wish I could remember his name, maybe Josh?) was so informative and attentive. We definitely plan on coming back here."}
{"text":"This place reminds me of one of those hip/cosmopolitan restaurants in Manhattan I used to walk by when I was a student at NYU that I couldn't afford. I like that look and, after feeling good about the reviews, decided to join three old friends for dinner.  Everyone is dead right about the chopped salad. Damn! I'm not a huge salad eater but I could have this one every day.  The perfect starter dish.  On to the main courses.  I had the Truffle Grilled Cheese sandwich. Meh. It was OK, not great.  Two of my friends ordered the filet mignon. One loved it, the other - not so much. She said it was OK but they smothered it with sauce. At $32 I'm not sure why you'd do that to a perfectly good piece of meat.  Another friend had the lamb burger. She said it was fine but probably would order something else the next time.  Bottom line - mixed reviews on the main courses - go for the salad!"}
{"text":"Recommended by my fellow foodie and brother, I made reservations and they were flexible with last minute changes. Ecstatic for AZ restaurant week, it was amazing and hands down best dining experience in Scottsdale. Happy hour was exceptional and the ambiance and customer service were on point!"}
{"text":"All was good until the beef short ribs arrived and were very dry dry, not good at all and we made a compaint. Gary, never said I'm sorry. Never, ever had any concern for our experience and was a total complet jerk. Said \" I didnt cook it.\" He was irritated that we complained and was rude from that point forward. What an awful experience. Also, too loud in there. Can't even talk without shouting."}
{"text":"Okay the best chopped salad I have ever eaten and they give you the recipe.   Go figure.   That was our starter and my friend and I shared it.   That was my only regret. I had buttermilk chicken with a sweet corn Butterbean succotash and roasted Brussels sprouts.   Absolutely delicious.   And the desserts off the hook.  . This place is a keeper.  Only wish it was closer to Los Angeles."}
{"text":"Meh, it's OK. The world famous salad is just OK. Service is good though."}
{"text":"The food was sooooo good my party and i went speechless.  We tried the mac n cheese, pastrami, salad and chicken with waffles appetizers.  For the main course, i ate the scallops with grits.  I did get to try the meatloaf and both were excellent.  Get the  scallops medium rare.  It basically melts in your mouth.  Can't wait to go back and attack the menu again"}
{"text":"Wow, incredible experience.  This has been on our wishlist for some time and thanks to Yelp Eats for getting us down there.  Just a wonderful evening.    Stellar ambiance, just the right lighting with a spacious main dining room but felt very cozy much like an old inn.  Loved that the bar is the center of the space because energy emanates from the bar to the tables, creating a real sense of communal dining.    Our server Gary was dynamite.  He walked us through the menu, focusing on his favorite items, and explaining in detail the ingredients and preparation and he was very influential.  Myself and a friend took his advice and thoroughly enjoyed the scallops, which were perfectly prepared.  My husband ordered the short ribs and he really loved them, especially the dried cherry BBQ sauce.  I was fortunate to steal a bite and they were delectable.  Our other friend loved the pork loin, which was also cooked perfectly.    We finished the meal with to-die-for donut holes with three dipping sauces - key lime, blueberry, and caramel-coconut.  So good!!!  Cannot say enough about Citizen Public House, and it is a must-have, and a must-return!!"}
{"text":"Great spot to wind down the night. Craft cocktails and unique food menu. The hummus, tzatziki, and fresh grilled pitas were filling and flavorful. Services is quick and the staff makes you feel like family. We were served the house salad ON THE HOUSE!  Thanks Michael.."}
{"text":"The Good:  The Duck and steamed buns appetizer The cocktails ( second generation was smooth, light refreshing for the AZ heat)  The Average: The scallops which is supposedly their top dish, was average at best.  The Meatloaf was dry and taste more like a Salisbury steak.   The bad:  Service was the worst. The appetizers came out quick, then the waitress forgot about our drinks, entrees for a good 40 mins. She finally came around and realized that we were not being served and finally got our meal which was room temperature (because she didn't pick up when it was ready). She was serving a larger party as well, and was tending to that table the majority of the night while neglecting us.   Not sure what all the hype is about, but you can easily get a better meal elsewhere along with better service."}
{"text":"We had two families visit Citizen Public House last weekend - the first weekend for Spring Training. It was super busy, but I had made reservations over a week ago. When we arrived, we were seated right away. The waiter and staff made sure we had waters, drinks, and answered any questions on the menu.  What we had: PORK BELLY PASTRAMI - Good, but it is different since the pork belly is \"cured\" BERNIE'S MAC 'N CHEESE  - Good, but the Gorgonzola was a bit over the top GRILLED OCTOPUS - Portions we a tad small, but it was tender and flavorful THE ORIGINAL CHOPPED SALAD - Loved it! Must have starter. FAIR TRADE SHORT RIBS - Loved it! SEARED CHIA TUNA - Loved it! NIMAN RANCH PRIME BAVETTE STEAK - Loved it...and need to order again!  Overall service was good. Checked on us often, water glasses were always filled."}
{"text":"This is one of my favs in Scottsdale. Everything was superb!  I had the lingcod. One of the best dishes in s long time. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great food, and legit old school cocktails.  Service was a bit spotty (busy night during restaurant week) so after another visit I will hopefully be upping that rating."}
{"text":"Great food! Great service! Highly recommend the grilled cheese.  Who would have thought to put mashed potatoes in a grilled cheese sandwich.  Only compliant is the acoustics aren't so great so if you're looking to have an intimate conversation, this isn't the place to go."}
{"text":"Good ipas to go with the lamb burger. The lamb burger (comes with tzaziki sauce and a bunch of vegetables) and fries are a good portion and quite filling. Good service."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere, and delicious food!! I had the white truffle grilled cheese and their Filet Mignon. I think that was the best grilled cheese I had, EVER!! Definitely recommend getting that. You can't really go to wrong with a Filet Mignon, so it was delicious- nothing too special."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and the chopped salad was delicious!!  I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"I love the Vibe and staff. Thanks Drew, this is a yummy hangout ... I plan on returning. I ate Pulled pork and fries, plus cookies! Drink and eat here. Downtown Phoenix has a lot to offer downtown, there is a big revival. On weekends the local produce market is in the parking lot too."}
{"text":"Last week I had the extreme pleasure of dining at the Citizen Public House.  We did not have reservations but had no problem being seated.  The food was outstanding!  As good as the food was the waiter:  Gary Harris made the evening.  This guy is the Babe Ruth of waiters. Professional, fun and good looking.  He described in detail all ten items on the menu. We let him decide and we a GREAT dinner. I live in Bend, Or. and hopes he moves here and runs a restaurant.  Thank you.  Tom O."}
{"text":"I love love love this place! We went with a rather large group and the server really took care of us. The food was amazing, you must try the pretzel fondue! My husband and I split the meatloaf, again, amazing!  It's such a fun atmosphere for large groups or even a date night! There was a guy singing solo, but was great. Very social setting and great people watching. Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Yelp is a swindle! You can give every review you want they choose them! Don't waste your time with this site!"}
{"text":"Wonderful anniversary dinner. The food was excellent. We really enjoyed the chopped salad and the scallops. Our waiter (Gary) was fantastic and very entertaining. We will  definitely be returning."}
{"text":"I'm writing this review before I even finish my dinner. This place just does it all well. Came here solo on business, sat at the bar. The Chopped Salad is unbelievable--perfect texture and variety of flavor---and the Meatloaf hits the spot with a great balance of flavor. Beers are great; cocktails look even better.  And the SERVICE really sets this place above and beyond. The bartenders check on me and keep my water filled every few minutes. They give me tactful recommendations and explain my beers to me when I ask as if they've worked at a brewery for years.   What a great evening experience."}
{"text":"We have gone to citizen's about a dozen times and they never disappoint. Great service and exceptional food. The drinks are aways creative and excellent. We always have to get the original chopped salad. The tender belly pastrami is amazing. This time we had the trout which was good but probably not great. However it the first time I could say that about any of the food. The rubbed spare ribs are incredible."}
{"text":"This is a fun place for Happy Hour. We sat at the bar and tasted some of the cask specialty drinks and sampled some of the HH eats. The food was tasty. We enjoyed some of the specialty drinks off of the regular menu as well. I loved the cocktail choices because they were unique and very tasty! The staff was knowledgeable, friendly, and entertaining! This gem is not your typical HH joint! It was top notch!"}
{"text":"Quality food and awesome service from waitress Jordan made snobby eaters from New York City very happy!"}
{"text":"This is a fun place for drinks and food. The bar is in the middle of the large dining room. The restaurant is well-located in a hip lively area of Scottsdale, near the art walk and canal area. The food is pretty good for a gastropub, but what I really love about this place is the interesting mixed drinks..and oh by the way, food is decent too. Other reviewers have hit on the high food notes such as chopped salad, lamb burger, and scallops. I could settle for the apps, Midwestern Manhattan, and the atmosphere."}
{"text":"You must order the chopped salad! It is amazing! Fun atmosphere and great cocktails! Dinner was delicious. I will return!"}
{"text":"Awesome place, great bar staff, cool happy hour, and the bacon popcorn and rosemary roasted nuts are phenomenal !"}
{"text":"Delicious food, great service. Restaurant is very dark inside, which seems to be a common theme in Scottsdale, and the AC made it really cold. But, we had a lovely table on the patio. Try the OMFG salad... it's SO good!"}
{"text":"I was a solo guest at the bar. I ordered the buttermilk chicken and a beer. 2 beers and a glass of wine later I had a buzz on but no food. 45 minutes went by and still nothing. Guests that sat and ordered after me got their dishes. Staff was cool about it and comped my drinks but something tells me Chef has no clue in the back of the house. I hear he's a Cowboy Ciao alum. Another spot I had a horrible experience at last time I was in town. So I will probably not be making it to Gladys next time I'm back either."}
{"text":"Loved this place!  We sat at the bar for a glass of wine for quite a bit, then ordered our entrees.  The bartender was SUPER friendly, and allowed me to try three wines before I ordered.  He made eye contact and didn't act rushed.  The service was excellent, food even better, and we left a very very very happy couple.    (Unfortunately we had almost the exact opposite experience at our next stop- the Side Bar).    Highly recommend the Public House.  Classy, yet casual.  Anything seems to go here.  Sequins and Sweatshirts.  I woke up this morning, yes, wanting my scallops entree AGAIN.  For breakfast. That is kind of gross, but you get the picture."}
{"text":"Just ate the short ribs based on the waiters recommendation. Not a huge short rib fan and was planning to go with the sea bass, but so glad I did. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Came here yesterday for my birthday. Party of 9, 730 reservation. Greeted at the door by Sam, who ended up being our table's server. Shook my hand, asked my name, wished me a happy birthday, told us the table was ready but to have a drink at the bar and let him know when we were ready. Excellent welcome.  The place was busy, no empty tables except our big table in the semi-private corner. Ordered a Manhattan, girlfriend had a mule, both great versions of classic cocktails. The rest of our party arrived, ordered drinks and the hostess showed us to our table.  Great table, excellent service, Sam had great recommendations and bought me a bday shot of blended tequila. Everyone at the table enjoyed the food; scallops, ribs, mac&cheese, chopped salad, one of my guests is a chef, he ordered a chef special and he left impressed. This place has it all covered. Excellent. 5 stars."}
{"text":"Super duper place in Historic Downtown! Service was excellent. No one in our party of 7 had  empty drink glasses. Then again, it was Monday night and there were probably only 2 other parties seated. Cheese Fondue was excellent, melty and creamy. I had the grilled cheese of the day. I don't remember what the cheese was, but it had chorizo in it, not just small chunks of it, but slices of it. I am in love with the Grilled Cheese of the Day concept. I would probably order it every time. I had the Korean pear salad to go with it: spicy arugula, pecans, Asian pears with a very light vinegarette. Prices were decent, atmosphere was classy, service was great! I would go back again...except I live in Surprise."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar to eat.  Great bar area, although a bit suspect given it doesn't have one television (it is a pub, right?). As has been said before, the food was great.  I had a friend meet me, and then his girlfriend,and I think we pretty well covered the menu from appetizers to entrees.  Was surprised by the rosemary roasted nuts (simple concept, fantastic result) and the duck was excellent (millet really complimented the meal).    Great place for a date or to grab a drink.  I am a male and a heathen one at that, so for five stars I'd like to see a television at the bar."}
{"text":"Great service, reasonable prices and a lovely atmosphere.  I'm giving it three stars because the menu was a bit limited and I wasn't entirely happy with any of our food. We started with the pastrami appetizer. The flavor was great, but the meat was a straight up slab of fat. I mean, it was the type of fat that you cut off your meat and push to the side of your plate. I would never knowingly purchase a slab of fat, so it was pretty disgusting. When I asked what was in the chopped salad, they explained to me that it had salmon. Since I like Salmon, I ordered it for my entree. The problem was that the salmon was not the grilled kind, like I had figured it would be, but the smoked slimy lox and bagel type of salmon that I hate. It was all mixed in my salad, so I just did my best to eat around it, but it was pretty hard to do that and it ruined what seemed to be an otherwise great salad. I think they should tell diners what type of salmon is in the salad. My husband ordered the lamb burger and his response was \"Meh.\" When I asked him what was wrong with it, he just said \"It tasted kind of bland, like something was missing. That said, the prices were good and I really wanted to love this place. I just don't think I'd go back, unless they changed their menu since everything we ordered left us a little disapointed."}
{"text":"So disappointed - this has been our \"go to\" restaurant to celebrate special occassions - Last night was our first not so great experience here.  We waited an unusually long time for our dinner.  The waitress finally came over and said \"I just checked on your dinner because I felt like it was taking long and they are getting it ready to bring out\"....an additional 20 minutes later, our dinner arrived.   I was so looking forward to the duck that I have ordered at least three other times.  I guess I didn't read the menu closely because they changed the dish....and not for the better - instead of warm, creamy millet or grits under the duck - the duck sat on top of luke warm diced \"sweet potato\" hash that tasted like it had been prepared hours ago and not a cherry in sight.  Now an amazing dish is just average and I won't order it again.  One of our guest had the short rib and it looked as if it had sat under a light for a while - dry....he said it was ok.  I felt bad since I encouraged him to order that dish based on past experience.  The meatloaf was the only consistently good dish this time.   Then, since it was a special occasion, we ordered the chocolate brownie dessert....I love chocolate and brownies but this was over the top sweet - I had one bite - our two guest the same and my hubby finished it because he didn't want to leave it.  We will probably give CPH another shot to redeem this experience but it won't be for a while and I certainly won't order the duck if it is still prepared with the hash."}
{"text":"I was not impressed with the hype about the food.  It was too many flavors and combinations.  The mashed potatoes don't taste like what I would expect with my filet.  Nothing is substantial  A bit of this and that  Still hungry at the end of the mea  Duck was tore and had to go back.  Spareribs  the specialty , too fatty and not enough mea.  Went back, too.  Pricey and just not as good as the hype they're giving out."}
{"text":"So we've been looking for gastropubs in the area and the first to pop up on yelp is this place. We decided to drop by the place after a not so wonderful experience at a concert and this place really made me feel a lot better. The food and ambiance are great! We got here pretty late so I was surprised they were willing to seat us.    We had the 'Tender Belly' Pork Belly Pastrami, 'Kilt Lifter' fondue, and we were intrigued by the \"Pig in the Orchard\" Bread Pudding so we ordered that as well. The prices are a bit high (every thing we ordered averaged $10), but everything tasted great so no complaints about the price from me. The service is a bit hit or miss hence the minus 1 star but I will definitely be coming here again."}
{"text":"Great stop for a nice meal. Excellent selection of nice cocktails and a changing menu. Definitely a higher price, but you get a high quality meal for the price."}
{"text":"Was a solo diner walking in for dinner. Sat at the bar at servers were very friendly. Solid drink/beer selection. Ended up ordering the olives plate and the lamb burger. Olive plate was solid for the $5 price tag but the lamb burger was incredible. Could tell from the first bite that it was grade A meat and the burger itself was somewhat of a gyros style flavor. House ketchup was also really good. Definitely a place that I would go to again and recommend to those who enjoy good drinks and quality foods."}
{"text":"Great place to hangout. Food is not bad. I had the Kale Caesar which was not as flavorful as I expected. The starters are very delicious. The atmosphere is a 4 star if you are looking for a casual dining experience with a flair.  Does have a bat and outside patio that's fun."}
{"text":"Chopped salad was fun and delicious. The scallops stole the show though! They were cooked perfectly and paired so well with the rest of the dish. Also, try the Citi-Zen cocktail. It was tasty and strong and the rock candy surprise was fun!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere, presentation, service levels were all GREAT..... We had a group of 11 who ordered 5 or 6 apps and 4 of the different entree options (we ordered 9 entrees, but some were duplicates). I tried everything we ordered. Dishes were very sexy looking and were detail oriented. The only negative was some of the dishes (about half of them) just didn't have \"knock your socks off\" flavor. Gizzards (9/10), Chopped Salad (9/10), Crab Cake (9/10), Mussels (5/10), pig Pastrami (7/10), scallops (7/10), short rib (9/10), meatloaf (6/10), fried chicken (5/10), I think that's all of them. I would definitely go back, great cocktails as well, the restaurant deserved the food to be slightly more aggressive..."}
{"text":"The bomb.com Loved it! Perfect portions, delicious food, and fun drink options!!! I will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Our service was excellent! Very attentive!  The food was also pretty good for what it was, and the prices were decent.  We would however not return because the food is just not our style. While looking at the menu, nothing stood out to us. We literally didn't like the sound of anything on the menu. We did order two dishes, and they were good, but I guess it's just nothing we would ever crave.  We were here for a friend's birthday, and we did look at the menu online a few days earlier. Even then, nothing jumped out at us.  Our friends did seem to enjoy their meals though!  I would recommend looking at the menu first. If the dishes sound good to you, then I'm sure you will enjoy your meal!"}
{"text":"I was very happy with my experience at Citizen Public House.  The service was great.  My friend and I sat outside on the lounge area while waiting for the rest of our party to arrive.  The area was small, but pleasant and the staff was very accommodating.  After our party arrived, we went inside for our meal.  The dining room has great atmosphere.  It was casual, but you still felt like you were at a nice restaurant/bar.  The pork belly pastrami was awesome even though my friends complained the appetizer dish was too small.  I mean, how much pork belly can one really eat?  For entree, I got the pan seared scallops which were great.  The portion was a bit small, with just 3 scallops.  I did not mind it as I was not very hungry, but others may have a problem with that.  For drinks, I had sangria, which was tasty.  My friends got the Citi-Zen which they enjoyed.  They guys were not too thrilled about The Persian cocktail because they claim there was not enough alcohol.  Overall, 5 stars because I had a really good time and all the food that I tried were good.  -1 star for being a bit too pricey for what they have to offer and also some others in my party were not completely thrilled with their food/drink choices."}
{"text":"There's nothing less than great about this restaurant. It's affordable, the food is unbelievably good, and service is impeccable. It's one of two places in the Phoenix area to try the amazing chopped salad, which I would recommend to anyone as an appetizer. Their bar snacks are great and at certain times, half off. The heirloom bacon popcorn is my favorite.  Their dishes feel traditional but offer twists with consistency and ingredients. For example, their truffled grilled cheese is stuffed with wonderful mashed potatoes."}
{"text":"CPH is a very hip restaurant with a lot of eye candy! Went on Saturday night after a Giants game and it was packed. The square bar in the middle of the restaurant was overflowing with patrons(mostly women).  Had reservations, so we were seated fairly quickly.  I had the kale Caesar salad and the chicken and waffles.  The salad was good and the chix & waffles were tasty also.  Both were off the appetizer menu and were $12 & $10 respectively.  I had a few friends order the chopped salad, and they really liked it.  If you like good food at a good price, and some window dressing, it can be done here."}
{"text":"Original plan was to try FNB, but their hours are weird.  Place was open till 10pm on door and on yelp, but the kitchen closed at 9pm.  Well the lady there said to come here.  With very low expectations I decided to try it.  Sat at the bar.  The bartender was very friendly and she explained the menu and drinks.  They had a great selection of premium Scotches.  They also had 5 barrel aged cocktails.  I tried the Pacific coast and it was awesome.  For my entree I had the lamb burger cooked at medium.  Wow was it good.  I actually wanted to order another one, but I resisted.  The burger came with fries and some pickled carrots.  You must try the lamb burger.  Service was exceptional. Both bartenders made the dinner experience pleasant.  Service is a big deal to me, and they did a great job."}
{"text":"We absolutely LOVED this place! We made reservations through our hotel and were seated very quickly after we got there. Our waiter, Gary, was AMAZING... and I don't use that word frivolously! He was friendly, fun, outgoing and totally made our visit exceptional. Note to other waitstaff - THIS is how you earn a big tip! The offerings on the menu all looked so good so we asked Gary for his recommendations for both our drinks and between a few of the entrees. He was very knowledgable about everything and went into detail about our options, asking us what we liked and making suggestions accordingly. Even though he was obviously very busy, he took the time with us to make sure we got what we were going to love. He even offered to get us new drinks if we didn't like what we ordered.  Anyway, for food we ordered the meatloaf and side of mac n' cheese to split between my friend and I... per his suggestion that it would be a lot of food. They even split it on two plates for us and it was more than enough food... and I'm a pretty good eater! The meatloaf was absolutely awesome! I really liked the mac n' cheese too but my friend didn't love that it had a kind of spicy salsa topping - but that could be easily omitted.   Sadly, we were too full (even after splitting an entree!) to order dessert! So bummed we missed out on this since everything looked so good. But we were going out dancing and didn't want to be stuffed.  Can't wait to go back when I'm in Scottsdale again! Thanks Gary and the rest of the nice staff!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Great food and amazing cocktails!  I've never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Just met two of my co-workers for drinks and appetizers...only intended to stay about an hour...but Kent,  our \"waitress\" (haha!) was so engaging, we lingered for two! He helped steer us in the right direction for some great, share-able apps, and we really had a memorable evening! Will DEFINITELY return...thanks from your Irish girls :)"}
{"text":"What a great addition to downtown Scottsdale dining! The location gives diners on the small patio a fantastic quiet and quaint streetside view with white lights, trees and the occasional horse-drawn carriage clomping by. Loved the list of handcrafted, unique cocktails. My Citi-Zen hit just the right note of tanginess with a hint of ginger, sweet and sour and pear vodka. Our server treated us like old friends with some great info on the cocktails and dishes. We felt like we were in an established neighborhood joint and not some corporate clone place! Started with the incredibly addictive bacon popcorn and then moved to several starters - the crab cakes were light and full of crab, not filler, with a tangy slaw; the fondue is really fun and rich with a combo of apples, sausage and bread to dip. The lamb burger reminded us of a very fancy gyro - rich lamb flavor tempered by the creamy sauce and a fantastic bun. Overall a fun, tasty and satisfying experience. If you don't want a big dinner, there is a long list of bar noshes and starters along with full entrees."}
{"text":"100/5 yessss 100/5. Been to many restaurants in this area and best overall experience I have EVER had! I usually will substitute good food for bad service but this place had both.   Went to happy hour first for a great happy hour! Their cocktails were great and only 5 dollars! Michael the bartender was amazing! Free samples and since it was me and my girlfriends first time there he ordered us their famous chopped salad on him! The dinner and server was also great ! Definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for awesome food, fantastic service, and ambiance!"}
{"text":"The Pork Belly appetizer is to die for!!!  My husband and I were visiting Scottsdale and went to Citizen Public House based on Yelp reviews.  We loved it so much we went back the next night and got the Pork Belly a second time.  You must try it!  Service was great as well.  We'll be back next time in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"If you go here make sure Gary is your waiter. What an incredible person. Kind, enthusiastic, and personable. The food was also great. The chopped salad is a must!"}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this place! Brought my family of 8 here with a reservation. Great ambiance and service. Loved our waitress who was from Michigan. Everyone enjoyed their meals, the chopped salad and chicken entree was the group favorite. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I can't think of a bad experience here. The food, the staff, the vibe is always good. I recommend Citizen Public to anyone that asks for a place in old town. I have even dined solo here in the bar after work and that's something I wouldn't normally do but this place is chill. I've come in with large groups as well and they are so accommodating. The management is on point!! There chopped salad is a must order every time and the seared chia tuna is probably my favorite thing on the menu. Try the Pub Beignets for a killer dessert. CPH never disappoints..."}
{"text":"We went Saturday night, and although the place was crowded, the service was great.  And the FOOD!!!  Please may I have some more crab cakes??? We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Citizen public house has a classy atmosphere,  great food, and fantastic  service. The speakeasy  upstairs  is a hidden gem. We love this place and always take out of town guests for the experience."}
{"text":"The Lamp Pizzeria-the best secret in North Scottsdale.  Excellent salads (healthy) pizza, zucchini cakes and eggplant parmesan on earth.  Great service and a very good Sangria also.  Ask which one is better that day-the bartender, James, will tell you.  Both are usually good....:)"}
{"text":"The best place in Scottsdale to grab food and an even better place to grab a drink. If you are in Scottsdale, this place is not to be missed! Best Moscow Mule ever!"}
{"text":"Lamb burger was terrible.  Bread was too hard, the lamb burger patty lacked flavor and all you taste is salt.  It came with a home made ketchup which was too sweet.  Fries were great.  Good wine selection.  My colleague had the meatloaf and he thought that was excellent."}
{"text":"Meh. Mediocre at best. Service was horrible. It took 20 min to get drinks and then we were asked if we would like to order appetizers.  I may have enjoyed the food but I was turned off by the service."}
{"text":"fun environment and menu. food and service was, meh....just ok. drinks weren't as strong as what we paid for."}
{"text":"Food was good. I got the lamb burger, and my fiance got the meatloaf. The lamb burger was delicious, and the patty was thick. The burger was on a cibatta bun, which was also really good. The fries were good, but nothing to write home about. The house made ketchup was really good...it tastes nothing like heinz, but I really liked it.  The meatloaf was a good size and was served over a mashed potatoes. The portions were excellent for the price. I would come back for sure. My only gripe was that the waiter was a bit pushy."}
{"text":"Amazing, amazing, amazing. Did I mention this place is amazing. The food was just spectacular, along with the wine pairings. If you are in Scottsdale, this is a must visit restaurant!"}
{"text":"Too loud. Don't go by address on website. Actually on Craftman. Mushroom tart too chewy. Tuna appetizer unimaginative. Helpful wait staff. Overall, a 3 out of 5."}
{"text":"I think we just caught the waiter on a busy night. Had a very large table and us. That aside. Food was average drinks were reasonably priced. Not the best I've ever had. But very creative. Seems like they are trying very hard. Cool vibe and a great atmosphere. I would try again."}
{"text":"Came with a big group and had excellent pre-planning and assistance from Stacie with menu planning and all the things we needed.    We were seated promptly and given terrific menu suggestions, specifically the chopped salad and the scallops.  Our server was attentive and helpful.  The restaurant was lively but not crowded and seemed like a great scene.  The beer and cocktail selection was great.  A nice mix of whiskies and local craft beers on tap.  Delicious!  Can't wait to visit the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing!! My husband and I wanted a nice restaurant with good food for our last night visiting Scottsdale. This place was perfect!! Our waiter Shawn was very knowledgable about the menu and a pleasure to talk to. The filet mignon and the scallop dishes are to die for! They also have a great wine list. The place has a very hip yet romantic feel to it and is great for a date night!"}
{"text":"Great ambiance.  My friend and I stopped here for dinner on a Wednesday before meeting up with other friends in Old Town Scottsdale. Service was great and friendly.  Food came out super fast and was delicious.  We had a veggie sandwich, scallops, and the peanut butter push pop. Yun!"}
{"text":"Awesome Food and staff. Swanky spot with unique Menu. The Almond Tequila is the best!"}
{"text":"Consistently a great dining experience with a creative menu and a cool vibe. If it's your first time, definitely start wih the Chopped Salad, no matter what you think of salad. It's the best. I had the scallops over a corn risotto and cola glaze. My wife had the buttermilk chicken, which had a surprisingly nice, spicy kick. Both definitely delivered. Fun, helpful staff as well. Can't go wrong with CPH."}
{"text":"Absolutely lives up to the hype. Service is excellent and efficient; very attentive without hovering around too much. The food was all fabulous; I tried the popcorn, local field green salad, and pan-seared scallop dish, with a Craftsman to drink. Highlights include the clearly fresh-made salad dressing options (lemon mint vinaigrette and mustard fig vinaigrette are incredible!) and the scallops were cooked perfectly, and went nicely with the creamy corn grits and bacon on top. The bartenders mix a nice cocktail too! Definitely recommend and will be back!"}
{"text":"get ready to break your diet with a bacon fat heirloom popcorn! So delicious and full of flavor! I highly recommend to eat here the service is very wonderful"}
{"text":"AMAZING!!!! Ask for the grilled cheese with mashed potatoes.  It's not on the menu but it is delicious!  BEST GRILLED CHEESE IN TOWN!  The doughnut bread pudding is a piece of heaven!!!"}
{"text":"This has been a favorite of mine for years. The only reason Im not giving it a 5 star is that I think they could perhaps add some new items to the menu and the service isn't as stellar as it used to be. With that being said, I really would give it a 4.5 star! The food, the food , the FOOD is simply the best. I would recommend this place to anyone who likes THE best chopped salad and burgers in AZ."}
{"text":"Excellent. I had the venison and of course the Chopped Salad. Service was great and the food was amazing. One of my new favorites. Can't wait til next time."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful.  We arrived during happy hour (Sundays until 6 PM) so several of the drinks were half-price as were several of the Appetizers. We had the original chop salad which was fantastic (rate it a 10) and was tossed at the table. We also had the butternut squash gnocchi which I would rate an 8.  We also had the Barada which is an eggplant, mozzarella,  grape tomatoes, kale and breadcrumb dish which i would rate a 9. The only negative of the entire experience was the pork belly pastrami which we found to be very fatty and had to return. Our waiter Sam was absolutely excellent and added to our experience greatly. Overall great Experience."}
{"text":"Below is an e-mail that I wrote to the establishment a few months ago on behalf of my experience. I thought I would share it on Yelp, so I copied and pasted...    I first want to apologize for taking so long to write to you to tell you about my experience. I was there for my birthday dinner on May 10th, 2014. My boyfriend had called to make reservations and get everything squared away without my knowledge. He couldn't keep it a secret anymore, and about an hour before the reservation, he spilled the beans and told me that we would be going to Citizen Public House for dinner. Right away, I remembered that this nice guy named Sam, who we had met through the gym, said he had worked there. I don't know Sam very well on a personal level, but we do say hello in passing at the gym. I suggested he call to see if Sam was working so we could sit in his section. Sure enough, our request was accommodated and we were seated in his section. He recognized us right away and was pleasantly surprised that we were there.   Sam had asked us if we had dined there before, which we had not. I immediately made a comment about how everything on the menu looked good. Since he somewhat knew us, he asked if it would be ok for him to remove our menus from the table and allow him to surprise us throughout the night. I was stunned, and accepted his offer without any hesitation, giving him our full trust. He knows that I like eat healthier, so he informed me that he would be making some adjustments to the foods he would be choosing. Regardless of healthy eating, we splurged a bit, and Sam bought us tasters of some wine so we could choose a bottle. I enjoyed the options so much that I could not choose! ... but I did :) and it was wonderful!  The first thing Sam brought out was your famous Chopped Salad. I have no words to describe this, other than the fact that I could probably eat this salad every day for the rest of my life. This was the one thing I was told about Citizen Public House, and was told that if I went, I had to try it! He brought it for us to split as an appetizer and I was happy with his selection, as we had wanted it right from the beginning. For the entrees, Sam brought us modified versions of the Buttermilk Chicken and the Amaro Meatloaf and described them fully upon arrival. We definitely would not have gotten the meatloaf off of the menu if we had chosen, but both were so amazing!! I couldn't tell you what he did to modify them specifically, but they were made to cater our health requests just a tad. Un...bel...ieve...able. To top off the night, Sam asked if our special food needs could be catered by a nice desert, because he said he wanted to celebrate my birthday with us. We hesitated, but then decided that we can't say no and would make an exception this one night! I am so happy that he asked before, rather than surprising us with dessert (yes, I know it usually goes the other way around), but it showed he cared about our requests. I don't think this dessert was on the menu, but it came in a jar and I think it had some peanut butter something in it... amazing, candle lit and all.   Overall, my experience was beyond amazing. Not only was the food, drink, music, and ambience great, but Sam was exceptional. I don't think he took care of us just because he knew who we were... I truly believe that that is genuinely how he is as a person and a server! His knowledge is incredible, he is calm and confident in his performance, and he is willing to take a step above to make his guests happy. The funny part about this, is that I am also a server/bartender at a mid-high scale restaurant... and I can honestly say that Sam blew me away. I don't think any of our servers are up to his level, not even myself. You have a great employee on your hands and you should be proud to call him one of your staff members. I have been in the industry for 10 years now and I have never gone out of my way to write about how amazing someone is, but Sam is really that great!! We will definitely be back, and Sam is no longer just a guy I know at the gym, but he was one of the reasons why I had such a fantastic birthday this year and I will never forget the role he played that night.  Thank you so much for the amazing experience!!! I refuse to keep my mouth shut about your amazing restaurant and Sam's service!!!"}
{"text":"We split calamari, steak and the chop salad. Steak was the most \"standard\" but really good. Calamri and chopped salad both unique and amazing. Wish we lived here so we could go back more often so I could try more and definitely eat the items we just had again"}
{"text":"Everything about this place was beyond perfect. The food was incredible, service was awesome, great ambiance! I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"A few friends and I came to Citizen Public House last friday evening for a late dinner around 9:15pm. Even at this hour, CPH was still pretty well filled up. The decor is nice, but you can definitely tell it used to be an art gallery with the way the walls are set. CPH made good use of the space however, and lighting as well, with lots of clean lines and dark woods.   Our server, was absolutely fantastic. He came with good suggestions for wine pairings, knowledge about the menu, and timed our food to an absolute T. I ordered the chopped salad, which was to die for. I've never had smoked salmon in my chopped salad before, but the array of flavors and colors was just beautiful in this dish. Looking at the menu there literally isnt a dish on the menu I wouldnt try. I cant wait to go back and dig in again.   The sole snafu of the night was with our bill, they accidentally charged my friend 3x for the total bill, which was expensive for 6 of us. Rich (one of the managers) was quick to try and fix it, but come tuesday morning it still wasnt fixed from friday. My friend went back in on Wednesday to try and have it fixed, wherein another one of the managers was present and apparently took a lot of attitude with my friend. Despite the snafu with the bill, we will still come back."}
{"text":"Pure yummmies! Went for my birthday dinner and had the scallops with corn grits - blissful! Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"On our way out of town, my wife and I stopped by Citizen Public House for dinner. What a wonderful end to our trip. A true high note. We only had an hour to eat before our plane left so we quickly ordered the legendary Chop Salad and 2 hot dogs (they were a special on the menu that night). The salad is famous for a reason. It's phenomenal. And the hot dogs? Crazy good. Just great attention to detail in every aspect of the experience (including the great music mix on the stereo). Our server (Dina? Gina?Sorry) was all class and good humor and very knowledgable. At the end of the meal Bernie, the chef and owner, came out to say hi. We probably freaked him out with our excitement level but it was all genuine. We live in the SF Bay Area, a mecca for food, but I would I would gladly trade a few artisanal pizza joints for a Citizen in our neighborhood. Here's wishing them all the best with their impressive new venture."}
{"text":"We went here for my hubby's birthday after one of the phoenix open games.....I had a great experience and thought food was fantastic (smaller portions).... Steak....probably not the best place, but the rest of their menu is fantastic. Price per dish is a bit higher than it should be comparatively, but I went there once and would probably go back! They have a good selection of wine at a pretty descent price!"}
{"text":"I have beeen wanting to try CPH for months, eyeing the menu online and waiting patiently to indulge. So when I finally did my expectations were exceeded. This place does not disappoint; from the friendly and professional service, classy yet laid back ambiance, and the more than amazing food. Theyalso have unique hand crafted cocktails and a well selected beer and wine list.  I really enjoyed the crabake starter which had a great, fresh taste and a delicious slaw. The Kiltlifter cheese fondue was perfect to mingle with the sausage, bread, and pears. The short ribs are out of this world good along with the parsnip puree. The \"Tender Belly\" pork loin was as promised, very tender and served with a sweet potato spatzle, goat cheese, and fig and mustard sauce that made me feel all good inside. You can tell that all of the dishes are well thought out and perfectly composed. Now on to dessert... you can not leave this place without getting the \"Pig in the Orchard\" bread pudding (bread pudding with apples and BACON) Just incredible, I want this for breakfast please. I can not wait to try more of the delicious food. I will be back, maybe today."}
{"text":"Great concept, definitely one of Arizona's best restaurants. The handcrafted drinks hit hard and are delivered in style. They have a beautiful private upstairs for parties. The food really works here. It is a dedicated chef driven restaurant, so quality is all they send you from that kitchen. Some personal favorites are the Pork Belly Pastrami, Flat Iron Steak, Scallops, and Burrata. I recommend this spot for anyone in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"The chopped salad, burrata, and filet are flavorful and the best meals I've ever had. Id get the chopped salad everyday if I could! I always take my friends from out of town here, you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, classy but not snobby -- we had just gotten off a plane and they (kindly) didn't blink at our jeans and tshirts. One of the few places in Scottsdale open after 9. Appetizers were good, not great, but redeemed by the lamb burgers, which were the best we've ever had - juicy, perfectly cooked, lots of flavor. Service was friendly but spotty (we asked for bread, none came; we had a loooonnnnggg wait for our entrees despite being one of only 4 tables). I think this is probably a 5-star place when humming on all cylinders."}
{"text":"Made an 8:15 reservation on Yelp for a late Vday dinner with the Mrs. last Friday. Wanted to check out Cowboy Cio, but then saw the reviews about CPH and decided to give it a try.   Got there at 8pm and was greeted with a smile. Our table was still at 8:15, but the hostess said we could hang at the bar or the stinky patio. Had quick service for a glass of Pinot and Tanqueray and tonic ($20 without tip). OK pour.   Short wait and we were whisked away to a table for 2. Was greeted by Clark who quickly got us more drinks and asked if we had any questions. Good guy, very helpful and honest about his choices. We switched gears to a Lagunitas IPA ($5) and sangria ($8), which was served nicely.   Read about the Pork bellly Pastrami app and the Citizen Chop Salad, so we ordered both. Clark hooked it up so we could have each in courses per say. Pork belly was awesome! C'mon - rye spaetzle, Brussels sprout sauerkraut = goodness. Citizen Chopped - chayote, snow pea greens, grape tomato, heirloom popcorn, grilled halloumi cheese, cucumber-onion salad & parsley-garlic dressing! Very unique tastes and refreshing. Would like to have that salad in the summer for sure!  Main courses - The Mrs. had the Short Ribs ($28) and I ordered the Meatloaf... yeah, I know... I was hoping for something epic in meatloaf, but it was good. Nuthin special. The Short ribs on the other hand were EPIC! It is served with this dried cherry bbq sauce that you would not hesitate to lick the small bowl dry! The short rib had a dark right out the BBQ pit look. It was AWESOME! Comes with roasted parsnip puree & seasonal veg.   Dessert - \"DONUTS & COFFEE\" ($10) - Bourbon glazed donut bread pudding, vanilla sauce, cafe au lait ice cream, brown sugar streusel... + More AWESOME! If you go, get it!   Overall, A good experience. I want to give it 3.5 stars. Service was prompt, Food was good, but it was the surprises in the ingredients that made it fun. Good mix of people too. The price is a little high by a few bucks for items in my opinion. I mean a $20 meatloaf should have been effin epic - Right?!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and food and gluten free options were amazing. Chicken & waffle appetizer (gluten free) was awesome. Fish was large portion and delicious. We would definitely return and recommend to friends."}
{"text":"I attended the Yelp mixer here courtesy of the elite Little Lady, so although I didn't have full dinner service I did like what I saw.  I think the place could best be described as the owner put it:  a \"modern tavern.\"  Pros:  -They have Guinness on tap and pour it CORRECTLY.  A definite rarity in AZ. -Nice menu options and really reasonable price points. -Great patio that doesn't sit on a busy street -I friggin' love the concrete floors, need to find out who refinished them so they can do my house!  Cons:  -TBD, none yet  I can't wait to have a full dinner service here, from what I saw they've put a lot of effort into the place--from menu and drinks to decor and service.  Maybe an actual long-term winner in Old Town???"}
{"text":"Had dinner here for the first time this past Thursday.  Food was terrific.  Wait staff was a C and totally overshadowed by the food, as well as the extremely friendly hostess.   I had he pork belly pastrami as an appetizer and it was amazing.  Then had the coffee rubbed filet, what was equally terrific!   Loud but fun atmosphere.  Very friendly hostess and bar staff.  Our server just seemed disinterested..."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing.  Of the top five meals I've had in my life, this place gets a spot. Starting out, the cocktails are amazing. Thomas and Richie Mo behind the bar consistently deliver some of the most innovative and tasty concoctions in town. The appetizers are to die for. My girlfriend dreams about the pork belly pastrami and the chopped salad is second to none.  Then there are the entrees. Hoo boy. The duck leg is some of the finest around, and their nightly specials can't be touched. Top it off the service is all around amazing. I cannot recommend this place highly enough. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try CPH for awhile, so when a friend suggested we go for a joint birthday celebration I jumped at the chance!  The interior and vibe is cool, although I did find it to be a tad on the noisy side, but that is not the reason for the three stars.  I only gave three stars because I was really disappointed in the food, maybe my expectations were too high, but I felt let down.  We started with the Pork Belly Pastrami, and while it tasted good, we weren't blown away.  I love spaetzle, but I found this version to be dry.  We did enjoy the chopped salad, I wasn't sure that I would because I am not a fan of salmon, but it was by far the best dish we had, but I didn't love it enough to warrant a return visit.  I had heard such great things about the seared scallop dish, and it was served with things that I love...bacon...spinach...grits...it should have been a winner, but it was not!  The scallops were really mushy, and the cola gastrique was overwhelmingly sweet and overpowered everything else on the plate.  I didn't even bother eating the third scallop....it was sad :(  By friend ordered the Pacific Rockfish, it was cooked fine, but it was bland and the other stuff on the plate really didn't add anything or make it taste any better.  Since we were celebrating, and still hungry because we didn't eat all of our sub-par entrees, we ordered dessert.  We got the PB&B Bread Pudding, it was rich and delicious, with banana ice cream, peanut butter and chocolate all swirled together.  We enjoyed the dessert a lot, so it made up for our lackluster dinners.  Maybe since it was a Wednesday it was an off night, but I would be hesitant to try it again anytime soon."}
{"text":"Incredible menu and every bite was delicious. The pork belly Rueben appetizer was phenomenal.  Our group of 10 included a 9 year old who was head over heels for the \"really fun\" fondue - it kept her busy while the adults could enjoy a glass of wine and their meals. Don't hesitate to take a well behaved older child, but not a place for toddlers."}
{"text":"This place is great! The atmosphere is modern and chic and the prices are reasonable given the high quality food. My husband and I shared the chopped salad, mac & cheese, and heart of caramel. We were stuffed by the end and spent less than $20 per person! What a deal!  I have never had a salad as original as the chopped salad at Citizen Public House. The presentation is beautiful and the salad is tossed table side. I honestly can't describe it, you will just have to try it yourself!  The mac and cheese was made with Gorgonzola cheese and topped with a tomato chili relish. It is decadent with a hint of spice. Very filling!  The heart of caramel should be called death by chocolate. It has a great smooth texture and is served with salted caramel and white chocolate ice cream. What a great finish to the meal!  Had to go back a second time. Got the chopped salad, meat loaf, and butter cake. The meat loaf was good, but not great. The butter cake was really good, but a little small for the price. Still love this place!"}
{"text":"Nice place. Staff is friendly. Food taste great. I tried grilled octopus and cod fish. Both taste great."}
{"text":"Cruising around Scottsdale for a change, stopped in for a Baileys and coffee with dessert. It was a Tuesday, LOUD (I think it's the acoustics of the place), the bread pudding was average and our bill was $40. The ambiance which we had expected wasn't there even though it had been a friend's recommendation"}
{"text":"Dinner here was great. The chicken, short ribs, and chop salad that we ordered were  so so good. The menu also marks gf options and our server was very helpful about modifying the chop salad so it could be gf."}
{"text":"Oh my. This place is really special. Great food. Reasonable prices. Nice ambience. Started with the chopped salad (amazing), continued with short ribs (awesome flavor) & ended with Black&tan dessert (delicious). Definitely a great place for a business dinner or an evening out."}
{"text":"Just Ok...probably would not come back.  Chicken wings were \"Asian chili glazed\" came out with the sauce on the side that tasted more like tomato than Asian chili.  Meatloaf was decent and flatbread with hummus was very good.  Nice atmosphere and excellent service."}
{"text":"This place is awesome...food,  service,  atmosphere, everything! I will definitely be eating here everytime I visit Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I love this place! Perfect for date night and the food is amazing! Try the Amaro Meatloaf, delicious!"}
{"text":"Excellent chopped salad. Lived up to the reviews."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great service, great drinks, good food. Yes, the chopped salad is amazing. Lamb burger is solid, but the other entrees at my table (meatloaf and scallops) weren't anything to write home about. Would definitely come back to sit at the bar for a cocktail or two and try some more of the apps."}
{"text":"Awful! The variety wasn't good and, besides that, their nasty chicken gave me food poisoning! I would strongly recommend to not go here!"}
{"text":"I think everyone is drunk who tries their food and leaves a review. I have no idea how right now they have 4.5 star rating and 426 reviews. Maybe it's the service in the dining area, but we weren't allowed to sit there. They made us sit at the bar even though there was a lot of open tables with waiters just standing around. Now the food was pretty bad. The lamb sandwich was ok, but the french fries tasted like they came from the frozen food section. The grilled cheese sandwich was a greasy mess that did not taste good at all. I guess I should have ordered a beer and it would have tasted better, but I just got water and the food was definitely not very good."}
{"text":"We came here at 5:30 on a Friday and it was dead...that was fine with us! We had dinner reservations at 7 PM with friends but we were too hungry to wait at home haha. The drinks are STRONG, just FYI. You can't complain about that ; )  I love Moscow Mules and they were strong and good here.  We sat at the bar and had the hummus and pita just to curb our hunger. It was good and seemed fresh. We left and decided to walk around Old Town a bit....when we got back at 7PM it was PACKED. Thank goodness we had reservations! And it was LOUD!! I have never been in such a loud restaurant. That's fine with me, but just be prepared for your waiter to have to get close and speak loudly to you.   Yes, the chopped salad is as good as everyone says. How? I don't know! I think it's the large couscous, salmon, dried fruit/seeds, and buttermilk dressing combo. Ha. I ordered the scallops which were AWESOME and I am not a huge fan of scallops. We finished with the PBandB Pudding Jar. YUM!!!   The prices are a bit high but you are also paying for the location right in Old Town Scottsdale. And FYI, you will be surrounded by some $30K millionaires. Ehh, it comes with the territory. This place is popular so make a reservation for sure!!"}
{"text":"great good. amazing cocktails. fabulous service. CPH has got it all. enough said."}
{"text":"Nice bar...but know there are no tvs or music. Food:  *watermelon and beet salad- 5 stars. Light and fresh *burrata salad-4 stars. You will def need extra bread *mac and cheese- 2 stars. Not very cheesy, Luke warm and odd spicing plopped on top. *veggie burger- 3 stars. Veggie burger itself was 5 stars but to only have the option of extremely bland, boring potato chips for the price, leaves you feeling taken advantage of. Not to mention you barely get any of them! *drinks- ok bartenders that are friendly. Total bill $130. Definitely not worth that...at best half!"}
{"text":"Delicious menu and great location in old town Scottsdale! I'm a big fan of the Buttermilk Chicken and of course their famous chopped salad."}
{"text":"The food at Citizen Public House was some of the best I have had in a long time.  As a gluten free eater I often have to settle, but CPH had some of their best options that were completely gluten free, including two dessert items and neither one was ice cream or creme brulee.   Our server was also incredibly attentive and informative helping us pick great cocktails and providing his recommendations."}
{"text":"Really good cocktails, food is decent.  It wasn't the best but I'll probably be back"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is definitely on the loud side.  The food was unique and tasty but, there wasn't a lot of dishes on the menu that interested me.  I wouldn't seek this place out but wouldn't be opposed if someone suggested it.  The service was wonderful."}
{"text":"i tried the chowder that tasted like a ingredients simply dumped in water and served."}
{"text":"Will was an outstanding bartender. Made me one of the best Manhattans I have ever had.  The crudo and the mussels were also amazing."}
{"text":"So good! I had the bacon-fat popcorn and loved every kernel. I went there to get he Original chopped salad, which I had at Sky Harbor Airport at their sister restaurant. It's amazing!! I definitely recommend both items!!"}
{"text":"I fell in love with the food, came back twice, and loved it some more.  The atmosphere is  boring and oversized but the food makes the back drop not matter.    The first time I had the duck breast, and it was one of the best duck breasts in the Valley.  Plump, tender, crispy... it had it all.  The stuffing and cranberry were extra yum. I can't remember what I had the second time.  Never a great sign.  And the second time the service was terrible.  Really bad.   But I still want to go back... soon."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite in Old town Scottsdale. The restaurant is elegant and service is amazing. Be ready to eat for sure if you come here! We tried the chopped salad and mac and cheese which were to die for. By the time we got our meals we were full. It didn't matter though because when we each took out first bite, we were instantly rejuvenated. Our stomachs opened up, and we kept eating the killer meatloaf, short ribs, chicken, and crab cake. Thank you Citizen Public House. You are a must-return to place whenever we're in town with people."}
{"text":"This place has been a mainstay of mine for years.  The quality of food and service is always exemplary.  For the price, this place is hard to beat!  My usual is the burrata and/or the chop salad.  Their Manhattans are the best I've ever had!"}
{"text":"I'm sorry but this place is just good for apps & drinks. Way overpriced. I had the scallop entree and it was 28.00 for 3 scallops. Their chef salad is a copycat from cowboy ciao. I enjoyed their citizen drink but I should for 12.00! The food is nothing special. Good ambiance to meet friends for a drink- relabel bar."}
{"text":"Upon walking in the door, we were immediately greeted by a charming staff.  The menu provided a multitude of creative selections, accompanied by inspiring and delicious cocktails made by professional mixologists. The food was to die for."}
{"text":"I rounded UP to 3 stars because, and solely because, of the chopped salad - definitely the best salad I've ever had at a restaurant.  Now that I've gotten the only redeeming quality of CPH out of the way (our server was pretty good, too), let's discuss the negatives:  1. The tap water is nasty. I work in downtown Phoenix. The water downtown tastes like the CPH water... in desperate need of filtration. At my workplace, we use Sparklett's delivery because the water is unpalatable. CPH needs to address this issue at once, especially since, as I read in an earlier review, CPH apparently won't let you bring in \"outside water.\" So, you're forced to drink swill prettied up in a silver pitcher, or buy a drink (it would be ironic if they had bottled water for sale).  2. The pork shank was REALLY porky, and REALLY smoky, and the fingerling potatoes were way overdone. By the third bite, the dish was no longer enjoyable.  3. It's 2016. Foie gras and veal?   4. If you look at their online menu and think, geez, can the prices get much higher? The answer is yes. Yes they can. And they just recently rolled out a new menu with new prices - they haven't even updated their online menu yet. Their meatloaf is $2 more, chicken dish is $4 more, and that incredible chopped salad is $1 more.  I would come back for the chopped salad over and over - but maybe I'll try it at the Gladly (CenPho tap water is much easier on the palate)."}
{"text":"SO good! Nice little mingle spot and good food with pleasant service! All around- GO! :)"}
{"text":"Owner/Chef Bernie Kantak (formerly of Cowboy Ciao) is definitely in his element at Citizen Public House, putting creative spins on classic pub food to create something new and interesting in the Scottsdale area.   The room is welcoming, cleanly styled and has a personal touch to it typically lost in the Scottsdale restaurant scene. Sit bar top and be treated to one of the expert mixologists creations. If you're lucky partner/mixologist Richie Moe will be experimenting behind the bar with some of his crazy equipment (certainly not meant for bartending, but making tasty libations none the less!) and let you sample the results. Be sure to sample to Bijou and Sazerac - both traditional cocktails given due reverence here.  The staff is pleasant, warm, knowledgeable and professional. Nuff said.  The food. Be sure to sample the Pork Belly Pastrami, the Scallops, and the Mirliton Chop Salad. This isn't a suggestion, it's a demand.   Overall a great addition to Old Town Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"I made a reservation for 2 parties of 8 for my wife's birthday well in advance and received a call 3 days prior, telling me one of reservations was lost!!!???? Then told me host shouldn't have made the reservation... The manager, Owen, lied to me! I confirmed the information again and they were not willing to honor my original reservation unless they put us in a private room with a minimum charge per person!!! This restaurant has no regard for its clientele or ethical conduct. Don't ever eat here!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing!  Chopped salad is a must!  We tried to order a different salad and our waiter changed our mind.  Thank you!    We ordered the short ribs and the scallops.  The short ribs were cooked to perfection.  The cherry bbq sauce simply wow!  The scallops all I can say is everything is a little better with bacon.  Oh and the scallops paired with roasted corn grits - I can't wait to come back - dreamy.  The only minus was the Moscow Mule.  Served in a big tin cup. Liked the drinks but did not like the cucumber in the drink.  Wasn't a big deal - removed the cucumber."}
{"text":"Good food but staff forgot about my niece & me for approx 2 hrs, so, our food & drinks were free."}
{"text":"We have visited twice, one time with clients and the other with family, and had delicious food and absolutely superb service each time.  Do not miss the Original Chopped Salad - justifiably famous.  Don't split it - get one all for yourself!  The bar has an excellent beer list - the Goose Island Matilda is always a treat.  Get over there!"}
{"text":"Bryan was the most amazing bartender! Took care of us, had the best time! Cocktails were amazing and so was the chopped salad! It is life changing! He was amazing! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is the second time I've been to this great place not far from Scottsdale Stadium. A welcome difference from all the loud, crowded bars along N.Scottsdale Rd. The place opens at 3 PM, allowing for \"bar bites\" and many wines, beers, and cocktails at a reduced price. This makes it ideal for post-baseball day games. The drinks are very creative, and they have many premium wines and beers. Five of us had a variety of appetizers and entrees that are again, creative, and generous in terms of portion size. I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I went to Citizen to try it out... I have been hearing great things so I wanted to check it out for myself.. I was not disappointed... food and drinks are outstanding...  for sure I will be back !!!! go and check it out !!!"}
{"text":"Very innovative and original . Great staff and unique drinks ! Get the scallops !"}
{"text":"The Original Chopped Salad is stupid good.  Seriously.  I almost laughed when I saw the salad has it's own Facebook page.  After I ate it, I knew why.  And I \"liked\" the page, lol.  My friends and I loved everything we had, and be warned - the cocktails are potent!  I had the salad as my meal (and shared two desserts with my 4 friends), and was comfortable (not too full, but not hungry still).  If you're a big eater, you might want to order something else along with the salad.  But order the damn salad."}
{"text":"Tried for the first time tonight, and was not disappointed by anything we ordered.  The meatloaf and short ribs were awesome and I was told that the scallops were the best in town ( I don't eat fish, but wife assured me).  Bread pudding for dessert was devine.  We will be back many times"}
{"text":"This place is extremely loud but we sat outside on the front patio and that solved the problem.  The female server was top notch and unpretentious.  I would recommend the fondue as an appetizer, easily serving 2 or more. I had the meatloaf and it may be the best I ever had.  My wife had the asian beef wraps and loved them.  With the appetizer these were more than we could finish.  The drinks are expensive and my wife was underwhelmed with her designer cocktail.  I stuck to Guiness.  Overall we had a wonderful time and would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"We frequent CPH and enjoy the food, drink and atmosphere each and every time.  Eric is always welcoming and professional.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Meatloaf was outstanding and I don't like meatloaf!  Bartenders were very good and drinks were a bit of a trow back. Great!"}
{"text":"Citizen Public House is a great laid-back restaurant with good atmosphere and fantastic food.  I've eaten there twice in the last year, and I've been very impressed with the service and the quality of the food both times."}
{"text":"Great gastropub!  Loved the mac n cheese and the crab cakes.  Pork Belly Pastrami was crazy good.  Meatloaf just a hair dry, but the sauces were outstanding.  Great service.  Would definitely come back again next time we're in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"The only reason I'm giving four stars is because last time I was there, the bacon bread pudding was NOT on the dessert menu.  Srsly guys wtf?  Otherwise everything is delish and the service is great.  Kale Caesar, homemade sausage, pork belly pastrami, BACON POPCORN (can't stress that enough)!!!!  And order a Moscow Mule if you haven't had one.  Yum.  Go there now."}
{"text":"First off, I really enjoyed the atmosphere here.    The chef knows what he is doing.  He takes an already buttery delicious treat like popcorn and adds bacon to it, awesome.  For a main course I had the duck, medium rare, and it was cooked perfectly with the skin crispy and the inside a nice pink.  The only bad thing for me was it was a bit salty but still amazingly good."}
{"text":"My favorite place to grab a cocktail and appetizer at the bar. Food is always good. Chopped salad is amazing!"}
{"text":"Citizen Public House is one of my most favorite restaurants in Scottsdale and definitely on one of my tops just overall.  I had been taken here by some colleagues who are more local to the area and I've gone back a good 3 times because I just like it that much.  Every time I go there I am always pleased with the waiting staff and they always make the experience that much more delightful.  The first time I went there I had their meatloaf, which some people either hear as \"Ew\" or some go \"I only eat my mom's\".  I do not want to knock any mother's out there, but this meatloaf was absolutely phenomenal!  Our server, Gary, recommended it to us and I've never viewed meatloaf the same.  My boy, Gary and my boy Sam are both super legit and just awesome servers, you should ask to sit in their sections.  I usually look forward to off menu items as well after getting an off menu lamb shank.  For those looking to start the meal off right you must go with the Original Chopped Salad.  It is mind blowing!!  Also for those looking for a vice, my drink of choice is the Import which is Jameson with Port, Guinness Foam and Tobacco Bitters, I make sure to always get that every time I go.  Citizen will not disappoint, if you are visiting and have no idea where to eat, you must eat here.  I make sure to always bring out of towners to Citizen for a good meal.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Short ribs, crab cakes and chopped salad, and wait let's not forget the pecan bars with chicory ice cream, all outstanding as was the service"}
{"text":"Always a pleasure to dine at Citizen Public House! Great service, delicious food, and relaxing atmosphere... equals an exceptional dining experience."}
{"text":"Visiting Scottsdale for the week for work and found this place while walking around Old Scottsdale. I had an early dinner and wasn't that hungry so I ordered two appetizers for dinner. The chopped salad was excellent and very unique. It has smoked salad, roasted corn and an really great house dressing. I loved it. I also had the pork belly pastrami. It comes over rye spetzel and a tasty slaw. It was. It as good as the chopped salad, but it was very good. Service was excellent. The resturaunt has a cool vibe and an excellent bar / drink menu. It is not a 2 $ restaurant. The bill was $37 with tip and 1 beer. Despite that I would recommend it."}
{"text":"We were enticed by the filet minon tacos but they weren't serving them on Sunday night.  We tried a few cocktails, the short rib, burger and a dessert.  The Manhattan was incredibly smokey, tasted like tar and was hard to drink, but the French Quarter cocktail was nice.  The boneless short rib was good but pretty burned and beat up on the outside.  Service was spotty even on a slower night, so we ended up having to ask our busser (who was kind) for help on most things."}
{"text":"The service here is great, always on top of everything. Food is phenomenal I recommend the ribs. Moscow mules are fantastic! Trendy vibe!"}
{"text":"Best Moscow Mule I've had in a long while.  Have been here a few times now, and it never disappoints. Everyone knows the drinks are fantastic - I doubt you'll find better mixed drinks anywhere in Scottsdale except for upstairs at R+D.   What surprised me was the food. The mixed salad (the one with its own Facebook page) was great. Awesome mix of things, with just enough meat to give it substance. The hummus was well prepared with tasty pita wedges. For the main course, the coffee-crusted short ribs are can't miss. It comes with a tart cherry sauce that sets the whole thing off. The scallops were amazing as well, perfectly cooked which can be hard to find.  After dinner we went up to Citizen R+D where the drinks are on a whole other level."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place, the service was fantastic, I liked the decor, but the food was just 'Meh'...in my opinion, where my hubby thought it was outstanding, so I will go with 4 stars and tell you my tale.    We were at fashion square doing some Christmas shopping and needed dinner, and we desired a 'gourmet' burger, when we did a yelp search this place came up. With the 4.5 Star rating we decided to try it, before reading the reviews. We called and were able to get a 9 pm reservation, which allowed me to do some more shopping. Perfect!   We arrived and were immediately seated. However, we kept getting the wind from the entrance. We asked our server if we could move, and he was more than accommodating, and we had a new table in just a couple of minutes, even though the place was very busy. The new server was just as great. You can tell, they focus on providing an awesome dining experience through service. I LOVED THIS!  This is what I didn't like - the place was so loud, that we couldn't have a conversation. In fact, I got a headache before our food even came out. There are two factors at play - the bar is in the middle of the restaurant, and when people drink they get loud. Also, they have high, open ceilings, without anything to 'absorb' the sound, so the loud laughing and all conversations, bounced off the walls. This esculates as the place fills up and when it is full, like it was last night, everyone is talking and laughing louder than normal, to the point where I heard people almost screaming. All this is bouncing off the walls, giving me one large headache. So there we sat, in silence, texting each other and facebooking because it really was too difficult to have a conversation.    After looking at the menu, and asking the server if they have hamburger, we found out they only had lamb burgers. While the reviews are good, they really aren't our thing. So much for Gourmet Burgers. We felt the menu was limiting, and our eyes were more focused on the desserts than anything else. The appetizers also looked better than the entrees, it seemed that there wasn't that much I liked, or if I did I felt it was overpriced. However, we were hungry and you yelpers love this place, so we decided to try a couple of entrees. We ordered the Chicken and Waffles appetizer (for the kid), while we split the scallops and the buttermilk chicken entrees.   We also ordered bread, which brought my attention to the fact that there were no salt and pepper shakers on the tables. I happen to like a little salt and pepper in my olive oil for the bread; which tells us, as foodies, the chef thinks that everything is prepared to the perfect seasoning and you don't need salt and pepper shakers. I will tend to disagree. I probably should have asked for them, I am sure they would have brought some, but I didn't.    Our food came. I got 3 scallops for $24. They were fantastic; however, 3 scallops and some greens, no matter how good, is not worth $24, maybe $14. Thank goodness we split the entrees! I thought the buttermilk chicken was good, but not outstanding and liked the corn, it had a bit of a kick. However, I will say I do not like brussel sprouts, and I liked these (A+ for those). I sampled the kid's chicken fingers and I LOVED it! You can tell it was prepared in-house. The kid didn't care for the chicken fingers all that much but he loved the waffle, it was gone in about 30 seconds. And I felt the $10 price was spot on. The hubby actually didn't care for chicken fingers, but really liked the buttermilk chicken and he also loved the scallops.    Because all the desserts looked amazing we had to try them. Again, I was a bit disappointed; they all had great flavor; but nothing I would crave again. The pudding jar was such a unique dessert, but I felt like I was eating peanut butter out of the jar, and I was hoping for something a bit lighter...a pudding consistency. The apple pie was good, but it was all crust, it needed more filling. The gingerbread pudding - very good! (I was not disappointed, even the ice cream was awesome).  So, has you can see, I am torn in the review because there were some things that were truly outstanding, where others fell short. I liked the concept, I like what they are trying to do with the menu, I like the décor and I LOVED, LOVED, LOVED the service. I wish there were a few more entrée selections. I would not rush to go back here, but I do want to go back. Also, I wouldn't recommend bringing your children, especially if they are picky like mine is!"}
{"text":"Great Yelp find!  The pork belly pastrami was the highlight.  Great service and great vibe."}
{"text":"I write one review- if that- about every year... This restaurant deserved this review.  I can say with out hesitation they left nothing to be desired. The atmosphere was warm and comfortable it was easy to pull up to the bar and spend hours talking and enjoying the different offerings. The service was spot on- both bartenders were there when we needed anything and both were genuinely friendly people. The food was absolutely perfect, good size portions, the flavors were excellent and at a good value.  We had the popcorn bar snack, the chopped salad, scallops, and the chocolate jar dessert as well as their bread pudding. The only thing I probably won't do again is the popcorn- but I am not typically a popcorn kind of girl. Every aspect of the food and presentation exceeded my expectations.    Am so glad they participated in yelp eats week- it motivated me to make it a point to eat here. I live in central Phoenix  and I am not sure I would have trekked over to Scottsdale for dinner over eating somewhere closer to home before. But, I can gaurentee I will be back often, it is well worth the extra drive."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. I eat here every time I'm in Scottsdale AZ. I love their steak, pork cheeks, mac n cheese, etc.... it is so hard to choose."}
{"text":"Fun, classy atmosphere with bar and outdoor seating. I do recommend having the chopped salad, it was my favorite dish there and different from any other chop salad I've had before. The scallops were average, but it was the roasted corn grits that blew me away and made the dish! I could have just eaten a bowl of the grits! The brownie desert was good, very rich."}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere amazing bartenders and amazing food. If you are in the are for sure try this place. I  currently driving across country and can say this has been the best dinner on the trip. I had the filet and it was amazing!!"}
{"text":"So good I almost have to go back and lower the ratings of 5 star restaurants just to emphasize that this place isn't playing around.  Service, food, drinks, atmosphere, and location this place had it all. Being the foodies that we are my wife and I picked our hotel in Scottsdale not based on how close it was to the event we were attending but based on the surrounding restaurants. This gastropub did not let us down, we started off with the pork belly it was so tender and perfectly seasoned that I almost contemplated ordering another one for my entree. But the rest of the menu looked so appetizing and our waiter was so enthused about the rest of the food that I went with the duck and my wife went with the restaurant week prix fix menu."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the food.  Loved the chicken and waffles."}
{"text":"Everything is delicious! The chopped salad has so much flavor you will find yourself craving it. We went to eat here twice in a three night stay in Scottsdale. The drinks are wonderful. My husband tried a variety of them and enjoyed each one. I loved the wine offerings. The grits are outstanding and so are the creamy parsnips. We will definitely be back on our next visit to Scottsdale."}
{"text":"A self proclaimed gastro-Pub. This was a great find. Thank you Phoenix magazine! Service was great, atmosphere nice, drinks well poured and food was excellent.   I had the duck with sweet potato hash. Duck was tender with a crisp outside moist and Cooked perfectly. Great meal I will be back."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my visit to Citizen Public House last night  ....  We had a handful of yummy apps.  My favorites were the WaterMelon Argula Salad & Crab Cakes.   Not to be overlooked, was the adult beverage menu.  I was sold on the Persian Cucumber cocktail.   #Yum  My friend ordered the Bacon Brittle to-go, from the Desert Menu.   Do yourself a favor and skip that.   It's a slippery slope to lighting bacon-flavored candles in your home.  Certainly going back.  Good Service & nice Atmosphere."}
{"text":"We came for a combo birthday and a total of 8 people. We made reservations. Service was great! Happy hour food and prices were just amazing!  Some of us got entrees. The pork shank can feed 2 people very easily! It tasted like ham and was just spectacular! It has potatoes for a side, they were ok. Felt like an after thought. We just scooted them to the side and had our way with the shank. Still had left overs between 2 people.   We also had a burger! It was perfect.   Definitely try to make it for happy hour!! They happy hour food is definitely something you can make a meal out of."}
{"text":"You must go here.  Went during the \"Yelp Eats\" promotion.  Everything we experienced was remarkable. The service, food, drinks, and ambiance were all spectacular.  First, the drinks. There are numerous specialty cocktails, an extensive wine list, draft and bottled beers, aperitif, digestif, single malt scotch, and almost every type of alcohol you could expect. Even unexpected libations that I rarely see elsewhere, such as dessert wines. We had to try their signature cocktails because it seemed to be the right thing to do at CPH. Good booze & good bartenders; can't let those go to waste. We had to have something with gin, so we opted for Aviation & Count Negroni. Both were what we expected. Strong & unique. I don't see anyone disliking Aviation, but Count Negroni is for specific tastes. Try this if you like strong orange and cinnamon flavors. The Campari in this drink makes a statement.  Second, the food. We ordered the \"Smart Chicken\" and the Berkshire Pork Loin. The chicken had a nice crispiness on the outside and had the flavor of lightly fried chicken without all the fat. The risotto, mushrooms, and onions that came with it were amazing.  Now, the pork. The pork! This experience made me fall in love with pork all over again. We all love bacon, but the bland white pork that comes from industrial farms has destroyed its reputation with people who love pork for its flavor, not for its leanness. Granted, I have never had Berkshire pork before this visit, but it was absolutely amazing. They cooked it perfectly. Pink and moist on the inside. The meat was so sweet & tender and the fat was so flavorful. This is due to the quality of Berkshire pork, but also the proper preparation. The stone fruit compote complemented the sweetness of the pork perfectly, as did the pistachios. The gorgonzola/white corn spoon bread was awesome. And the broccoli rabe/chard (couldn't tell exactly what it was) was steamed perfectly with great seasoning and flavor.  Third, the dessert. The bread pudding was fantastic! Like the best apple pie you've ever eaten...only better. The ice cream that came with it was great as well. I ordered a cup of coffee as well, from Roastery of Cave Creek called \"Black and Tan.\" One of the better cups of coffee I've ever had. Even my girlfriend enjoyed it, and it had no cream or sugar. She usually loads up the sugar in coffee but she said that the coffee has so much flavor that it doesn't need anything.  Fourth, the service. Our server, Brian, was very knowledgeable and very courteous. He answered every question we had, gave us the proper attention, and made sure we enjoyed our experience. I can't remember a recent experience with better service than we had here at CPH.  Overall, everything you want in a restaurant. It's in a great location, in the middle of Old Town Scottsdale. I can't compliment this place enough. Just go!"}
{"text":"Came in on a latish flight to the area last week and ended up here as just a random search near the hotel.  It actually was not the kind of place I'd normally really choose to go to, and I kinda felt weird about the crowd when we pulled up outside but it ended up being better than expected.  Despite the name, it is a very chic kinda wine bar small plates kind of place which is what I was surprised about, but out of real options and starving we went in anyway.  They had a decent but pretty small-ish sized selection of craft beers.  That said, I ordered the lamb burger and I'm really glad I did.  It came out and it was just perfectly cooked, a perfect, juicy medium rare, with incredible tzaziki sauce, delicious cucumbers, all on a quality ciabata type roll.  It came with good fries and homemade ketchup.  I really don't remember much else because I scarfed down the whole thing but remember it being incredible the whole way through.  Anyway, I don't know that this place is my scene overall but I do think that the lamb burger at least was definitely worth a stop in to try.  As a side note, it was also romantic than you'd actually expect from a restaurant with that name too."}
{"text":"Wow! We went on 4/20/11, and were appetizer and drink hopping around Scottsdale. On our way to dinner we came across this wonderful place. Nothing much to look at from the outside, but were pleasantly surprised, open and comfortable. My husband and I sat at the bar, ordered a few appetizers: Pork Belly Pastrami and Crab Cakes w/ brussel sprout slaw....sorry, I drifted off thinking about how outstanding and delicious they were! Thomas our bartender who knew EXACTLY how every dish was perpared and expaining w/ such passion, we can tell he loves what he does! Next time the reservation will be here! Looking forward to trying EVERYTHING! Hope Thomas is working!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Food and ambience is great!"}
{"text":"One of the best meals I've ever had! Great atmosphere, very knowledgable and friendly staff, and dinner with a bottle of wine for about $65. Do NOT pass up this spot!"}
{"text":"Holy cow the chopped salad is delish. There is a reason why it has its own Facebook page!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious but drinks were horrible!  Our table got the lamb burger (bun/bread way to much), buttermilk chicken and scallops.  We had to ask for everything and they have to little servers working.  I was shocked that the bartender did not know how to make drinks.  I mean so bad I could not drink them and sent them both back and mind you they were two totally different drinks :/   P.S. Definitely not kid friendly!"}
{"text":"Service: very knowledgeable but unpretentious. For whatever reason, invalid or not, I don't generally get the best service in Scottsdale but the waiter here was excellent.  Food: perfectly grilled scallops. Their chopped salad has a Facebook-- but LGO has a salad similar so dismiss that hype. Still very, very yummy. Bacon fat popcorn, macaroni and cheese also things you must try.  Drinks: I had one cocktail and I got my ass swiftly kicked within about 30-40 mins. Be careful around that Manhattan. Smooth as butter, but beware they are very generous bartenders!"}
{"text":"Love, love, love all the beer on tab selections! The food was absolutely amazing too. Definitely will be returning and can't wait to try all those delicious beers!   Nothing to complain about here, did I mention the great service?"}
{"text":"Impressive interior, service, food and reasonable prices for such a delightful experience. The buttermilk chicken dish was really good as was the tuna starter. It gets a bit noisy during peak hours but that is hard to avoid at a well run restaurant. It is a little tricky to find as the entry faces East so you access the front door from Craftsman Ct instead of 5th Ave. But the experience is worth the hunt for the door. What can I say? GPS only gets me so close and then I have to figure the rest out for myself!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Chopped salad was great. Lamb burger was far too gamey and fries where mediocre."}
{"text":"BELIEVE the hype!!!  I was doubtful when planning a large business dinner here, but we went away RAVING about the service, the food, and the entire experience.    What we ordered: 1) Pork Belly Pastrami 2) Bacon Fat Popcorn 3) The Original Chopped Salad 4) Chicken & Waffles 5)  Burrata 6)  Grilled Halloumi Cheese 7)  Everything Bread Pudding 8)  A variety of cocktails, including The Persian  I highly recommend EVERYTHING listed above to order for the table.  Share with each other, have a bite of everything--it's worth it--it's DELICIOUS!!!  The Pork Belly Pastrami is incredible--the flavors are amazing and you don't feel too guilty eating a big piece of fat as it's disguised with the condiments and pastrami flavors.  The Bacon Fat Popcorn--as one of the ladies I was with said, \"An orgasm in her mouth!!!\"  I kid you not.  We ordered extra bowls after plowing through the first couple.  Citizen Public House does an amazing job with this popcorn--fresh, filled with flavor, and just the right amount of delicious bacon bits on top.    The Chopped Salad--not exactly worth the rave reviews listed on Yelp and FB, BUT...it was very good, and a solid option.  Certainly made us feel better to have something \"healthier\" while indulging in heavier gastro-pub food.    Chicken & Waffles--TWO THUMBS UP!!!!  Much more \"savory\" chicken versus the chicken at Culinary Dropout.  Delicious, delicious, delicious!!!  Only complaint--needs TWO waffles instead of just one.  Ratio of chicken to waffle is not equal!  Burrata--DELICIOUS!  Generous serving of burrata.  Can't go wrong here, just had carb overload and probably could only stomach the cheese at this point.  Grilled Halloumi Cheese--one of the best grilled cheeses you'll have ever tasted!!!  A LOT of bread, though...better to share the plate with the table, or you won't have any room for dessert.  Everything Bread Pudding--To Die for!!!  A little dessert bowl of heaven, something in there for everyone to enjoy!  Cocktails--great!  The Persian was an interesting color and flavor, a bit sweet for my liking, but still enjoyable in the warm Scottsdale weather.  Folks, you'll enjoy this place!  There is something for EVERYONE to enjoy, and the meal will leave you raving for weeks on end afterwards."}
{"text":"The dinner and drinks at Citizen Public House were out of this world! My dining companions drank the Im-port, made with house made tobacco & leather infused bitters-- seriously???  They raved about it!  My club soda was also poured to perfection.  I think they should make it a feature on the menu. As an appetizer we had the pork belly pastrami, which is served with rye spaetzle, and brussels sprout sauerkraut.  It was delicious.  I had a little of the chopped salad.  It was delicious as always.  It is originally from the Cowboy Ciao menu, and has been a favorite of mine (and everyone else) for years.   The soup of the day was the tomato bisque, and it was very good too.  The scallops were perfectly cooked.  I sampled some of the beef short ribs.  They were some of the best ribs I have eaten in years.  I would definitely order them the next time I dine at CPH.  For dessert we shared the PB & B bread pudding.  It was the only thing that I didn't love.   It was a little dry."}
{"text":"We had a great experience here.  First, a great bartender while we waited for our table.   After seated, the great service continued.  Our server was one of the best.  We made sure to share this with his manager who was also great.    Food: scallops were excellent.  So was the meatloaf.    I highly recommend this place!  I will return if I'm in the area again."}
{"text":"Food was great, drinks were even better, but service was subpar. We walked in with a reservation but weren't seated until much later. Restaurant seemed understaffed."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Have not had anything bad here.  Consistent on the food quality.  Steak tartare is amazing - when it's on the menu."}
{"text":"The food here is outstanding. I've tried most everything on the menu, and I can't say enough good things about the scallops, steak, chopped salad, all of the salads really...  OH, and the drinks. AMAZING! One of the best places in town for a drink. Everything is fresh, real juice etc.  So why four stars? On the multiple times I've been to public house and on only about 1/2 of them has the service and wait time been good. The other 1/2 of the time the service has been extremely slow. This is especially annoying when you are getting take out or looking for a quick meal. Last time I went to public house I sat for 1.5 hours waiting for only a chopped salad. My friend who was with me waited just as long for her watermelon salad. In spite of the wait times and the service, Public House has wonderful food and is def. worth a try! However, I would not go if you are pressed for time."}
{"text":"We arrived around 6:15 for a 7:30 reservation planning to have a drink at the bar before dinner. We had no idea that their hand-crafted cocktails would be so impressive. In fact, we were so taken by the drinks that the bartenders convinced me to let them pair cocktails with my meal, forgoing my usual wine pairing approach. I wasn't disappointed. I started with the pork belly pastrami which they paired with a bourbon cocktail. It was a fantastic pairing. For my entree I went with the lamb loin which was fantastic. They paired it with a mint julep. Smart, classic choice. Not only were the bartenders great, our server was as well. We enjoyed the food, the atmosphere, the service and the cocktails. What more could you ask for? Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Wowzers!  Tried this place last night based on the awesome reviews on yelp but, holy cow, were we in for a surprise!  One RAW sandwich wrap + one RAW salmon salad = $65 worth of potential salmonella!  And no offer of a refund!  I am completely befuddled by the bulk of these reviews."}
{"text":"My girlfriend is a regular so she insisted I try it. Generally I'm a Old Town Tavern person. Nice atmosphere, friendly staff, good food & drinks!"}
{"text":"awesome dinner here for my friends birthday!!  the bartender kris was great and showed off his mixing skills and flaming shots (delish) our server gibb was a blast, super fun and knew a ton about the menu so he didn't steer us wrong in what we ordered.  love the mac n cheese, chop salad, scallops and the short ribs...just the right amount of food for 3 of us to share.  can't wait to come back and we'll be sure to spread the word :)"}
{"text":"This is the second time here over the past year. I ended up ordering good comfort food with the meatloaf dish paired with Yukon potatoes. My girlfriend loved the ribs. The waiter was around alot. He had many suggestions. We took him up on a few. A little loud in the main room but overall an easy place for dinner. They did seem to like to push their cocktails but if you are into that they have some cheap deals earlier in the day for 'happy hour'."}
{"text":"My husband and I love dinning at Citizen Public House.  Great ambiance, food is delicious and the staff is awesome!  Every time we have been here no matter how busy it is, the service is fantastic.  The staff always explains the menu and really takes the time to make sure you feel good about your choice.  We love coming here for dinner because it is guaranteed to be a great experience."}
{"text":"All the staff, from the front host, to the bartender on break, and to the waiter who came over to talk to us but we weren't even his customers - everything was fabby.  Thank you Thomas, at the bar, who gave impeccable service with a smile (I think he chews Orbit Gum).  Bacon Popcorn was terribly good, and the mini fondue was to DIE for!    and, BTW, thanks to ALL who treated my daughter so outstandingly and made her laugh the whole time!"}
{"text":"Great experience at Citizen last night. Ryan was an excellent server - friendly, quick, and great with the recommendations. Everyone says this, but you really should get the chopped salad to start. It's delicious- crunchy, salty, a little sweet - total yum. And the catfish appetizer (totally big enough for an entree) is an unexpected gem - fresh fish, super crispy. Perfect craft cocktails too."}
{"text":"Make sure you make reservations.  We were lucky to get a bar table.  Even though the place was empty when we got there in 15 minutes every table was gone.   Food is spectacular and drinks are excellent.  Had the famous Salad.  I don't think there is a better salad that exists.  Place is worth it"}
{"text":"Awesome food and drinks. I have been here many times and I am always pleased. My favorite is The Chopped salad."}
{"text":"The duck was fantastic. The chicken & waffles, and the pork-belly pastrami were also both excellent. The beer selection was a bit thin, but made do. Pretty good overall, though it was difficult to hear in the establishment as the acoustics are pretty terrible."}
{"text":"We were really excited about trying this place on our trip to Scottsdale and were a little dismayed to learn it was Restaurant Week when we arrived (in Denver, Restaurant Week can sometimes mean a decline in food quality and service...). We decided to order off the regular menu and everything we got was so delicious. The burrata was great and was served on top of an eggplant puree--I hadn't burrata served like that before, but really enjoyed it. I ordered the rockfish which was great; however, the curried millet with okra that it was served with stole the show for me. I seriously could eat that every day and might have to try to recreate it at home. My husband ordered a fish that was the special for the evening. I can't remember what it was, nor did I try it (isn't this review incredibly helpful??) but he did say he loved it and ate every bit, so that can't be a bad thing ;) Peach and berry pie for dessert was great, although it was heavy on the berries and light on the peach. But who can really complain about that? The service was great; our server was attentive and the food was timed nicely. Overall a great experience!"}
{"text":"Dined here this evening with my husband. Gary was our server and he was just out of this world. He had such a great spirit and was so very vibrant, making our experience that much better. I had the swordfish and my husband the filet - both excellent choices. Can't wait to return to try some of the other menu options. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  I'm new to Scottsdale so I am making a point to go out, check new places out and explore my new home.  I went to this place for dinner and they were amazing.  The chicken I ordered was probably the best tasting chicken breast I've ever had. The ambience and bar are really cool -- it's trendy but relaxed at the same time and not overly done. Just the right amount of everything. And the service...is next level. I swear the water chick was a machine -- 2 sips and she'd be pouring more.  That's attention to detail.  This is going to be my go to spot when people visit, a hot date or just want to hang in Old Town.  BOOM!"}
{"text":"Bar tender billed more than stated tip - appeared on credit card at a later date. Disappointing."}
{"text":"It was a nice place but it was sooo loud. My girlfriend and I had to yell to each other and we were about 2 feet apart. I didn't account that into the rating, just want people to know that its super load in there on a friday/saturday (can't remember) night.  Our waiter was awesome. My food was really good, I got ribs with a coffee rub and a delicious sauce. They were perfect. However, my girlfriend got chicken and it was bland and overcooked and a much smaller portion than my ribs. The drinks we had were also delicious. One had ginger and cucumbers in it which sounds weird but was surprisingly good. Kind of expensive but thats old town scottsdale."}
{"text":"I received a gift certificate to Citizen Public House for my birthday so I decided to take a few friends. The food was great and the service was even better. They even gave me a drink on the house for bringing people in. The cocktails are good but not the best, the drinks are much better upstairs. Highly recommended to anyone looking for a good place to eat/drink in the Old Town Scottsdale area."}
{"text":"Happy Hour fondue, sliders & wine-all were great & and ranged in price from $4.5 to $6. Service was excellent. Fondue was accompanied by bread, pears and sausage, oh my!  Wished I had room to try the crab cakes that sounded delish."}
{"text":"Excellent; been there many times.  Especially like the chopped salad and the buttermilk chicken.  nice bar.  nice buzz."}
{"text":"I thought this place was good! Great atmosphere, but not sure what the hype is about. Maybe I ordered the wrong plate (roasted chicken for restaurant week). The famous chopped salad was really good. I will give them that.   I would come back to CPH, but I won't race back."}
{"text":"great service especially at the bar with great happy hour menu. best chopped salad (same as at The Gladly) that i could eat every day for the rest of my life"}
{"text":"I have eaten and drank at Citizen's many of times. They have AMAZING cocktails and their food is super fun and yummy. I personally always choose the bar but the overall atmosphere is great all around."}
{"text":"Unimpressed. Had the beef short rib, it was dry and tough. Turnip mashed was decent. Veggies were cold. Decent atmosphere but food overpriced for what it was."}
{"text":"My husband and I been here several times for dinner and drinks. The food is excellent, different, fresh, and oh so flavorful.Thats what keeps us coming back. We had one oops experience sitting at the bar on our very first visit to Scottsdale. We selected to try this shot of Tequila because the bottle it came in was pretty cool looking. Come to find out that shot was $25 a piece, but that was more on us and if we had known we would have savored the taste instead of downing it."}
{"text":"The food and cocktails were great. The service was exceptional!  Highly recommend this place, we will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Rosemary roasted nuts - sweet and nice. Fondue - a little floury, bread was toasted a little too much but the sausage was wonderful. Burrata - if you only get one thing, this should be it. Short Rib- presented on the bone with a new coffee rub and a cherry vinegar sauce on the side, a parsnip puree as the base - cloying without the vinegar. Duck - thick sliced, I suggest ordering medium plus (the medium order was a little rare), excellent quality, nice flavor. Flourless chocolate cake, very nice but I think I've seen them at AJ's.  Nice selection of after dinner drinks.  Ok wines by the glass.  Great cocktails.  Loud loud loud, mostly tables.  Really good service.  Reasonable prices.  Ok but not awesome.  I will return but only for happy hour fare."}
{"text":"Citizen Public House is a great addition to the Old Town dining scene. I love seeing restaurants crop up in that part of town that aren't just catering to the bar scene and making the food an afterthought. My girlfriend and I made reservations for Friday night expecting Bernie Kantak's new restaurant to be packed. Much to our surprise when we arrived, the place was pretty dead with tons of open tables. We purposely arrived early to enjoy a cocktail at the bar and even though we could have been seated right away, we pressed forward with our original plan.  At the bar, I ordered my usual cocktail while the GF ordered a sangria off their cocktail menu. We also ordered an order of the bacon fat heirloom popcorn from the bar snacks menu. My cocktail was perfectly made and my GF loved the sangria. The popcorn took forever to come out, but when it was delivered they also brought out an order of the calamari compliments of the chef. The popcorn was a little bit burned and we both thought it could have used some salt, which was surprising since we thought the bacon fat would have provided that flavor. The calamari was perfectly cooked and not greasy in the least. I enjoyed the pickled fennel on the side, but my GF isn't a fan of fennel, so she didn't try it.  After we finished our cocktails at the bar, we moved to a table for the main event. In an unusual move for us, we skipped wine and stuck with beer and cocktails, but I did eye some good finds on the concise wine list. For our appetizer, we ordered the sausage of the day, which was a beef based sausage with a cabbage casing. It was very unique and we both really enjoyed it. For our main courses, the GF ordered the AZ B.L.T. and ordered the Pork Tender Loin. The B.L.T. had tons of perfectly crispy bacon on it, but we both agreed that it was really good , but not great overall. The Pork Tender Loin, on the other hand, was excellent in my opinion. I loved the figs and the sweet potato-chevre strudel. Of course, you could put chevre on anything and I would like it.  When it was time for dessert, we knew that we had to try some of Tracy Dempsey's latest creations. We normally split dessert, but decided to each get our own. The GF got the cookies and milk and I had the chocolate toffee bread pudding. The cookies are delivered in a bag that you can take home, which is great because you probably won't down the generous serving of cookies in one setting  unless you're sharing. My GF was quite happy to take home a little bag of cookies to enjoy later. My bread pudding was awesome and I wish I could have purchased a gallon of the Maker's Mark ice cream to take home with me. I'll definitely be craving this dessert in the future.  The atmosphere of the restaurant is a little austere, even for my taste. It just seems like they could a little bit to make it a little bit more warm and inviting. Service, while extremely friendly, was a little bit uneven throughout the night starting with the snacks at the bar taking a long time and continuing with confusion over what tables plates should be delivered to. Keep in mind the restaurant has been open for only a week, so these are things that can be worked out.  We were really surprised to see the restaurant so empty on a Friday night, so I hope more people give it a try. Citizen is a really good neighborhood restaurant that has the potential to be great. We look forward to trying it again to see how it improves and evolves. I'm really hoping it's a successful staple in Old Town for years to come."}
{"text":"This restaurant is really amazing! I love that it has a small menu. I love that it only has a couple dessert items but they are tremendous! The beer selection is perfect.  The wine selection is great.  The service rocks, Gary handled our large table with ease, thank you Gary! Even the manager Steve came over to greet us and ask us how our meal was...a top notch restaurant in old town Scottsdale.... Eat it, love it, live it..... I had the chopped salad, perfect. I had scallops, prepared to your liking. I also really enjoyed  their spinach and garbanzo bean soup (best tasting soup I've ever had and the recipe was done by one of their servers, excellent excellent Dish)!  Yum yum for my tum tum :-)"}
{"text":"Returned as promised, tried some additional items and increased my rating.  Had the barrel aged Makers Mark cocktail which was excellent.  Snacked on the rosemary roasted nuts (beware they are sweet not savory) and the hummus plate.  Both were outstanding."}
{"text":"Took a large party here a little over a month ago and loved every minute of it.  The menu offers everything from their famous chop salad ( you seen it before at cowboy ciao) to amazing short ribs.  The cocktail menu is quite unique and the wine list offers a lot of range.  Great HH or CPH as they call it 3 - 6 daily.  What I like best is the size of the menu and the fact that you can spend anywhere from 10 to 25 on an entree depending on your mood.  It's a little tough to find tucked on a side street but do not miss this great addition to old town Scottsdale.  Matt C"}
{"text":"The OMFG salad is the best salad Ive ever had in my life! We also tried the cheese fondue, it should have had more sausage & less bread/pear. We got the swordfish for our main course but it was just ok. The ladies next to us ordered it as well & theirs was raw in the middle.  They sent it back & got a new piece that was about half the size. Just got and order the salad it will complete you"}
{"text":"Sam really made the night exceptional. His knowledge and enthusiasm guided an unparalleled dining experience. Loved the short ribs and of corse the DeLeon Tequilla."}
{"text":"This is the perfect date night location! The mood and feel is calm and upscale. The food was too notch! I ordered the lamb burger and was a happy camper. Definitely going back soon. The servers were outstanding and friendly."}
{"text":"When I review restaurants . . . service, atmosphere and food get weighed almost equally. Maybe it was an off night for CPH, and perhaps based on previous reviews, my expectations were too high. I so wanted to give it five stars. I took a friend from out of town there for the last night of Arizona Restaurant Week.   The Pros  Food - (5*) The menu choices were fantastic -- something for everyone. We both ordered the Original Chopped Salad and the Scallops. Both were delicious. (FYI - I had the Kantak Chopped for three nights in a row now, twice at Amaro in Cave Creek. It is my new favorite!) The flavors and textures in this salad are perfect. The pan seared scallops were tender, juicy and sweet. Desserts for me were overkill, but it came with the meal. The \"Pig in the Orchard\" Bread Pudding was delicious, but not as delectable as the Irish Coffee Pot de Crème which sent me to Cloud 9.   The Cons:  Atmosphere (3*) Even on a Sunday evening, the dining room is really loud. Even though we were sitting next to each other, we were borderline shouting just to be heard. Nevertheless, the design is cool and inviting.   Service (2*) Our server had zip personality, made no suggestions whatsoever, and didn't bring any bread. She brought our entrees to the table when I was clearly still working on my salad. (One of my biggest pet peeves!)   Will I go back? Absolutely. Based on all the other reviews, this just might have been a peculiar instance so I'm willing to give it another shot."}
{"text":"Great outside on the patio.  Pretty noisy inside if you want to have a conversation.  great value for the $30 special for restaurant week.  Great, attentive service without being intrusive."}
{"text":"loved  everything about this place,  went there two times on my 6 days stay in AZ, my favorite appetizers was Burrata salad and butter squash Gnocchi, my favorite drink was the persian, and you just can't go wrong with ordering anything on the menu. Just don't forget to make reservations before going, this place could be even packed on monday nights."}
{"text":"This is a nice upscale restaurant in the heart of the Old Town.  I enjoyed this place but it didn't blow me away like I thought it would. To start I ordered a Rose Garland which is a great cocktail. Similar to an Old Fashioned but with a little kick.  For our appetizer we ordered the kilt lifter fondue which was the best thing I ate all night. It had great flavor and I enjoyed all of the items we were given to dip into the cheese, especially the fruit.  We decided to split some of the starters for our meal and the chopped salad was good but not great. Overall that is how I felt about the meal as a whole. It was good but not great."}
{"text":"Best service!  Alyshah was an amazing bartender and explained all the dishes in such great detail.  Everyone was so hospitable.  This place has the most amazing drinks and food."}
{"text":"Went there on New year eve, they only allow us to order three courses together to secure 65 dollars income per guest and most of the good dishes were not provided."}
{"text":"Chopped salad is excellent. Note that it has salmon in or chicken, if you request."}
{"text":"In town for a Sales Meeting and had reservations on Saturday night for four.    Seated right before happy hour ended at 6 so tried the half price house barrel-aged cocktail special - a horchata based drink that was so good!  Moved to the cocktails and tried the Clover Club, a pretty raspberry drink and the Mezcacillin, a gingery citrus tequila wonder.  Between the table I believe we tried every cocktail - a bit pricey at $12 each but consensus was some of the best cocktails in AZ.  Appetizer: the Burrata - buttery soft cheese over a cauliflower romesco and grilled ciabatta bread.   Salad: the Chopped - interesting flavors/textures with smoked salmon, freeze dried corn, pumpkin seeds, greens and Israeli couscous covered in ranch dressing.    Dinner: the Scallops - served over corn grits with bacon.  Nicely seared, melt in your mouth.  And, the Short Ribs - boneless, fall apart medallions with a sweet cherry sauce and greens.    All in all a great dining experience and our Server, Ann, was the icing on the cake!"}
{"text":"Came here during restaurant week ... Twice ! Scallops were great but this update review is about that CHOPPED SALAD! Hands down best salad I've ever had ! So glad I ordered it during restaurant week cause now every time I come back it's a must ! Mmmm"}
{"text":"We decided to eat here while shopping and walking around Old Town. The reviews on Yelp were great so we decided to make a go of it. The entrance is on Craftsman Court, but otherwise easy to find. We decided to eat outside where they had 5 tables on the patio.  We really enjoyed our meal which included hush puppies with jalapeño hot sauce and olives early on, then the Duck burger egg and bacon, which was delicious.  Really pleased with the experience."}
{"text":"Food was excellent- but not place reads as a normal American Eatery - no such thing.   This is an overpriced farm fresh food to plate joint.   Menu is limited and way to rich,  although service and bread are excellent."}
{"text":"Chopped salad was delicious & love that it had its own FB page! Scallops were just ok in our opinion. Restaurant / server was nice & accommodating - made good suggestions (i.e. Chopped salad!)"}
{"text":"We tried Citizen Public House for the first time last night during  restaurant week.  It was excellent!  I had the OMFG salad, the Smarter Chicken, and the Black & Tan for dessert.  All I can say is WOW!  Everything was prepared perfectly.  The chicken had a wonderfully seasoned and crisp skin and was juicy inside.  All of the food that should be was HOT which means it was delivered immediately upon completion.  I can't wait to go back and try more of their menu options!"}
{"text":"A happening place for the younger crowd, everyone was well dressed, but not suit and tie fancy. Anyways, the food was super delicious; it was modern twists on classics. We had the Mac and cheese, which was a win, and fondue with the most amazing sausage I've had, and perfectly ripe Asian pears. My friends had steak and pork rib, and the pork rib was easily the best dish. It was infused with a subtle flavor none of us could place, and was perfectly tender. Many of their desserts had bacon in them, and it was good, but I am partial to not putting bacon in everything. We had the pecan and bacon brittle and the peach and bacon pie, which was empanada style. Over all it was a really good restaurant with a great atmosphere with good service and great food."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the food and service. Great place to sit outside or inside. Good to experience the outside air . Although I only ate here once, my family eats here weekly."}
{"text":"We came here with another friend on Sunday at 7:30 with no reservation and had no problem getting a table. The food here is solid, the drink menu is pretty decent, the ambiance is nice, menu is good, service is eh.  We, like others, sat around a while waiting for a drink order to be taken. We ordered the flat bread with hummus and tzatziki. The hummus was excellent and the little pickled veg that came with it was excellent.   I had the original chopped salad after that and it was really, really good. I loved the combination of the flavors and textures. The waitress mixed it up for me and I had only a drizzle of the dressing since I didn't want everything swimming in it. A drizzle was plenty! I had mine with the smoked salmon, our friend had hers with the chicken. I would come back for this salad alone (and those pickle things).   Husband had the pork belly pastrami which was just a little bit too salty but the flavors were great, the rye spaetzle was very unique and the brussel sprout saurkraut was very good.  Overall, I would come here again even if the service isn't fantastic because the ambiance is nice enough that waiting around and enjoying good company is fine."}
{"text":"This place was just okay for my fiance and I. It was a nice place and have heard great things, so we finally gave it a try. I understand dim lighting but it was SUPER dark in the restaurant, little too much for me, but might be fine for others. He ordered the chicken, I ordered the burger. We also had the mac n cheese appetizer.  First, the mac and cheese was good, but it was ruined by putting salsa on top of it? That was a bit strange and wasn't a good mix in my opinion.  Second, his chicken was pretty bland and dry. It was just okay. For the money we were paying for that, we were definitely expecting something with a bigger portion and a lot better tasting! I ordered the burger medium well, it came out rare. I don't mind pink, but that was just too pink. I think he might have misheard me for \"medium rare\" instead of \"well\" which I can TOTALLY see and understand, especially with music playing. Unfortunately gave it back and did not order anything else or another one because it was pretty late and we wanted to go out. The drinks were good, nothing to write home about, but again these were EXPENSIVE.  Probably wont be back, nothing to memorable about this place except the high bill ;). Definitely a nice place, but just not for us."}
{"text":"5 stars for the food, 5 stars for the service, 1 star for the inability to hear yourself think due to the loudness of the music and the terrible acoustics in this place.  We met some out-of-town relatives at CPH last night and were hoping to have a really good meal and catch-up conversation...but all we got was the really good meal.  The pork belly pastrami appetizer was superb, the entrees of pan-seared scallops, meatloaf and pork chop were amazing and the bread pudding for dessert was to-die-for.  So, absolutely no issues with the food.  But the noise level was ridiculous, even for a night-life kind of place.  We literally could not hear the person across the table.  Asked our waiter to turn the music off or at least down but his manager refused...so we had to scream at each for 2 hours.  We will go back but without guests.  Go for the food/food service but don't go thinking you're going to have any relaxed conversation...at least not on a Friday night."}
{"text":"I love the scallop dish. The fondue during happy hour is pretty good. Love their wine selection too, mixed drinks are a must."}
{"text":"We were here for happy hour and the $6 barrel aged cocktails were fantastic.  The shrimp cocktail was fresh, plump, and delicious.  We also had the castelvetrano olives.  Overall great ambiance for a bar and restaurant and great happy hour!  We would definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"I love the creative menu here. Lots of traditional American plates with creative ingredients. Start it off with the Chop Salad and you'll know what I mean. Ribs with a Coffee rub were terrific. Definitely a future spot for business & casual dinners. The cocktails were good, with some interesting concoctions,  but I've had a better Manhattan in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Everything was awesome, but my favorite part was our waiter. He was so nice and knowledgeable and I can't say enough good stuff about him. Gary gets huge kudos from me."}
{"text":"This is one of those places that totally catches you by surprise...a very good, bacon surprise! My husband and I drove down from Vegas for a baseball game. We were starving afterwards and I yelped this place. I'm so glad we did because it was one of the best places we've ever eaten at ever.   A lot of credit goes to out server, Gib, who was just as excited about the menu as us. Hubby was craving a good sandwich and Gib recommended the BLT. Hands down, BEST BLT ever thanks to pork belly bacon!!! It was thick cut, tender, and crispy. It elevated the BLT to a much higher culinary level. I opted for the chopped salad which has been reviewed in top mags and culinary shows. With it's mix of greens, tomatoes, sweet corn, pumpkin seeds, currants, and this amazing buttermilk, herby dressing I almost ordered a second one! We had the gorgonzola Mac and cheese to share and it was perfect for 2 people. It was super creamy, delicious, and decadent.   For dessert, Gib recommended the pork belly bread pudding. Holy bacon!!! It was the perfect combo of salty and sweet with a scoop of vanilla on the top. I had the cream cheese donuts with 3 different dipping sauces: strawberry compote, key lime pie, and caramel. So delicious!!  We were incredibly surprised by this place. Not only is the ambiance beautiful but Gib definitely made the experience better. The food was some of the best we've ever had. In fact we haven't stopped talking about it since we left and I've never yelped a review faster!! The food reminds us of how delicious food is in the Bay area where we're home. We would easily drive down from Vegas any weekend just to eat here. 5 stars!!!!"}
{"text":"Came here last saturday night without a reservation and sat at the bar.  We met the bar manager and he basically guided us through the night with his recommendations for food and drink.  It was a great experience.  Unforgettable.  You've got to eat the scallops!  Highly recommend this place. We found it because the yelp reviews were high and they didn't let us down."}
{"text":"Excellent chopped salad and short ribs"}
{"text":"It's on the pricey side, but well worth it. It's our go to spot for any special occasion and I don't think I've had a bad dish there. The bartenders are almost all mixologists so you can tell them what you like in a drink and they'll make something for you. Our two go to servers are Gary and James so make sure you ask for them!"}
{"text":"The buttermilk chicken was excellent !! The whole experience was very fun and relaxing at the same time. Low lighting which I love ."}
{"text":"This place used to be a favorite but is terrible now.  The owner(s) of Citizen Public house should fire the current manager."}
{"text":"Off the hook!!  The Cobb salads are incredible. Ask for chicken to replace the salmon if you don't like salmon. Everything was great. Barrata, chicken, meatloaf, tequilas, wine list, dessert.   If you are fortunate to get Sam as your waiter, your night here will be complete. Great job Sam!"}
{"text":"Loved all of the barrel aged cocktails that I tried.  Bar is large and the bartender (Thomas) was very knowledgable and friendly.  I wish there were more beers on tap.  We only tried appetizers but they were very tasty."}
{"text":"I would definitely recommend Citizen Public House.  We arrived with no reservation but the team quickly found a spot for us.  Great gastropub, good prices! Nice ambiance!!  Unique offerings!! The menu was super interesting. I had the fair trade short rib . . . Amazing if you like short ribs! Seasoned well, fell off the bone . . . Yes cooked to perfection. For dessert I had the bag O' bacon brittle . . . Did you see the word bacon?  I think that says it all!!! Yep yummy!  I generally go to this restaurant when I am traveling for work and I recommend it to colleagues and friends when in the Scottsdale area. The service was good, server knew the menu and was extremely attentive, had a good sense of humor.  One more thing . . . If you like sangria order one . . . I would double down that you will order another one. Enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"Everything about this place was so good. Service was excellent and the food was delicious. Try the chopped salad and macaroni and cheese. Had the scallops that were very good. Will go again!!!"}
{"text":"My overly hip, centenarian grandfather brought us here, his \"new favorite joint\", for a holiday welcome home get together.  Everything was on point. The cocktails were inventive and well thought out, and their happy hour offerings were off the actual cocktail menu. None of that \"draft, well or house\" crap.  We ordered several small plates for the table and each was distinctively different but all perfectly executed. Make it your beeswax to order the burrata.  And the service...the service is what spurred me to write this review. Our server went out of his way to make sure we had he best experience possible and were well attended to.  They've earned their 4+ star rating."}
{"text":"Food and drinks were amazing!  We split the chopped salad and duck burger, both extremely flavorful and made to perfection.    We sat at the bar and have never received more attention and service from our bartenders until now.  I think my only regret was that we weren't in town longer to try more of their menu items."}
{"text":"First time at Citizen Public House, and it did not disappoint. May want to consider getting a reservation, we ended up eating at the bar, with a several hour wait for a table. We sampled quite a few dishes: The pork belly pastrami was easily our favorite small plate. We also enjoyed the crab cakes, shrimp medley, and fillet minion tacos. Each dish was experimental, and brought unique flavor combinations together that complimented each other well, yet were a complete surprise. We also tried the bacon popcorn, which was also a incredible experimental. The only thing I didn't care for was the desert- which was the berry medley in a pastry w/ cornmeal. Otherwise- definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"My fiancée and I were very excited to try this place after reading many glowing reviews from a number of different sources.  We made it for their happy hour which I had heard was outstanding.    Our first impression was that the restaurant was very swanky.  We felt underdressed when we first walked in, we had just come from the Scottsdale mall on a Sunday and were dressed more for comfort in the Phoenix summer heat.  We were seated immediately.    I wanted to take advantage of the barrel-aged cocktails that were on happy hour (for a very good price).  I could not decide, so our server brought a sample of two of them which helped me decide.  I ended up getting the Instant Gratification which is a semi-sweet drink made of scotch, cognac, and grand marnier I think.  We ordered the Kiltlifter fondue next which neither of us were crazy about.  I'm not sure if it was the cheese or the beer, but something made it bitter.  For our entrees I got the meatloaf and she got the cubano.  We were both very pleased with our meals, however she did not like the meatloaf saying it was too dry and not very flavorful.    All in all it was a decent place with good cocktails and average food.  We were disappointed mainly because we had such high hopes from all of the reviews.  We will return for happy hour when we feel like a craft cocktail, but will probably get dinner elsewhere."}
{"text":"I ordered the scalloped seared. It was delicious the waiter was awesome the food was impeccable."}
{"text":"Great food - great asmosphere and wonderful service.  Trendy and fun!  I keep telling my friends about it and they have all loved it too!  Will be going back a lot I'm sure!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful birthday dinner with my husband and daughter. Gary was our waiter. He did an amazing job explaining the menu and drinks. You should ask for his selection because of his incredible attention to detail and personal warmth. We tried everything he suggested and LOVED the short ribs and meatloaf. Our daughter is vegan and enjoyed the portobello mushroom dish. We will recommend this place to others as it was AN EXPERIENCE to remember!"}
{"text":"Great spot. As advertised in terms of first class comfort food and great traditional drink offerings. Very crowded and did not have reservation but staff accommodated my family which made an impact."}
{"text":"Best pork belly I have ever had!! Service was fantastic. We have been there more than 5 times. Everything we have ordered was delicious!! I totally recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"4.5 stars We wandered in post appetizers at FnB so that was going to be a hard act  to follow. Well, it was surprising, inventive and yummy and really really tasty. I am holding out on the 5th star because I have been flinging them about lately and want to reevaluate when I come back. I need a reason to come back.  The duck was delightful on creamy risotto, the grilled scallops were perfection on a thin smear of grits. Could have used more of the latter. The place was cavernous and rather empty on a Sunday night; a good feature in my book. We enjoyed the ambiance and felt hip being there. I'm thinking we might have to add Old Town to our dining rotation."}
{"text":"Did not eat one thing that wasn't amazing (okay maybe the fries were the only thing just great).  I wish I lived closer so I could enjoy this place more often. My recommendations are: member's only drink, fondue (sausage is to die for!!), scallops, and the cheesecake. Steven (or Steve?) was great and made us feel appreciated and special. Thanks again for letting us give feedback! If and when I come back to Scottsdale I will return."}
{"text":"Outstanding. Great service and amazing food!  Scallops, branzino and meatloaf entrees can't be beat.  Service was incredibly attentive.  Our server was so kind to our young son, who was the only child in the restaurant. She brought him crayons and encouraged him to draw. Dessert was absolutely delicious!  Can't wait to try again when we return to Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I was really pleased with my dining experience here. It's really refreshing to see someone who actually enjoys their job, our server was great, and passionate. He was prompt, gave great suggestions and added to an overall positive experience. Now onto the food, for an appetizer we got the crab cakes, we both enjoyed the flavor but agreed that for the price the portion was a bit small. For dinner I got the scallops and my fiancé got the meatloaf. They scallops were very flavorful and cooked to perfection. The meatloaf was very juicy, and had great layers of flavor. Dessert was so-so, we got the peanut butter pudding cup thingy, all the flavors were good I just don't think it catered to my taste. But overall everything was good and we really enjoyed our experience ."}
{"text":"Negative -5 stars if I could! The only thing that made up for the one star is the duck burger and the their infamous salad. Others than that we had a horrible server, we had specifically RSVP'd for my husbands b day and when the server came he seemed as if he was on drugs, he kept acting strange, and when he saw good looking girl he would talk to them the whole night and forget he had other tables. He shook our hands, because he was introducing himself and if I recall that's not proper etiquette especially when your hands are sticky from spilling drinks all night. He also would ignore us when we had to leave urgently. I would highly recommend to spend your money elsewhere the negative reviews don't lie. I RARELY give a negative review, this place definitely deserved it!"}
{"text":"Excellent! Definitely better than all local bars with TVs and bar food in Scottsdale. We had the chopped salad, best salad ever! I would go back for that alone. We also had the scallops which were perfectly prepared and delicious. Service was superb, didn't rush you. A little loud. Good wines by the glass at reasonable prices. CPH is now on our list of favs."}
{"text":"This is a great place- they do take out and don't shrink your portions when you do! We've only lived here 6 days and have been here twice already And definitely planning on coming back religiously. The food is outstanding and prices are very reasonable. I've had the lamb burger and mac n cheese. Chop salad is to die for!"}
{"text":"Our first dinner experience during our vacation in Scottsdale and I think we found the best dining spot of the trip!   It's been more than 10 years since we've been to the old Scottsdale area and while some things are the same, it seems the dining scene has improved significantly.  Citizen Public House is an example of that.  With classic minimalist decor, we felt a comfortable yet energetic vibe from the minute we walked in.  The service from the hostess who greeted us to the waiter and bus staff are friendly and eager to make your experience a great one.    After a quick tour of the menu and some stellar cocktail selections (the Capital Paloma was amazing) we landed on Crab Cakes and the obligatory Chopped Salad to start.  The salad is absolutely a signature dish and their spin on it makes it like no other chopped salad you've ever had.   For our main courses, we tried the scallops, short ribs (the parsnip purée on the side was delightful) and a few orders of the short rib tacos.  On the side we shared an order of the Mac 'n Cheese - it was delicious with a spicy tomato salsa on top.  Honestly, I would return for the salad and that dish alone!  We were stuffed but made room for dessert...The Dude Jar and The Heart of Caramel.  We thoroughly enjoyed them both.  Citizen Public House should make our \"Best Of Scottsdale\" list for sure."}
{"text":"A casual version of its sister restaurant, The Gladly. You can comfortably walk in here in a Giants t shirt after a Cactus League game. The cocktails are complex and very good. The small plates are very good. The bacon oil pop corn was amazing. We also enjoyed the meat loaf."}
{"text":"Food, atmosphere, and service was very good. I would go back next time in Phoenix. Chopped Salad was awesome!"}
{"text":"We had diner in a private room which is pretty cool, and well, private (duh). It has it's own bar and it's a great spot for parties or I guess for a romantic date (there're no cameras, I believe, lol).  The food was good, like in between of good and really good (not outstanding, though).   The service was great and friendly, but I guess this is irrelevant when it comes to a private room, I mean, if you get bad service there, the place just sucks!  We tried several dishes and i can't remember anyone that I didn't like.  The salad with steak was tasteful, the fondue was really good as well as the mac&cheese, maybe one of the best mac&cheese that I've eaten recently.   The pork belly was good too.  Short rib, steal head and filet were solid but not memorable. The filet was a little hard, if you ask my opinion but it was cooked right, which is hard to find in AZ.  The apple pie was also pretty good and a normal serving, not the typical \"feed 10\" disgusting kind of desert.   Great place for parties, dates or just friends dinner.   It worth the try."}
{"text":"The happy hour is fantastic!  The barrel-aged cocktails are half price.  I absolutely loved mine.    We also had some discounted appetizers.  The fondue in particular goes perfectly with the strong drinks because it kind of slows you down so you're not guzzling.  The music was perfect.  I could sit here for hours."}
{"text":"The food was great. Duck, meatloaf, filet mignon and the fish of today were excellent prepared. A relief after all these snacks and fast food chains in the US."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of gastropubs, espcially when they are as elevated as the Citizen is.  We requested to sit next to the open window that faces the street.  It was a beautiful November evening, so a slight breeze was welcomed while we enjoyed our meal.  Our server Clark was absolutely charming.  He gave excellent recommendations when we needed some advice and he was able to joke around with us as we inhaled everything brought to our table!  Our cobb salad, our pork belly, the cocktails, dessert, EVERYTHING!    Some of the items we tried: -PORK BELLY PASTRAMI: house made and freaking delish!! melt in your mouth good! -THE ORIGINAL CHOPPED SALAD: awesome presentation -FAIR TRADE SHORT RIBS -ROASTED BUTTERMILK CHICKEN -GRILLED LAMB LOIN -Moe'scow Mule: coper cup and everything! -Citi-Zen: very refreshing.  I'm not a vodka fan, but this was smooth and sweet!  We will have to visit the Citizen Pulic House next time we're in town!"}
{"text":"Great experience and food in old town Scottsdale. The cocktails are inventive and fresh!  We loved the fondue and pork belly starter.  My dining partner loved the chicken breast even though he normally prefers the juicy dark meat. The lamb burger was tasty and juicy. Great bun! The chop salad was a big hit at our table. I loved the scallops. For dessert it was tasty and fresh. When we come back to Scottsdale we will be back."}
{"text":"Good food has to be accompanied by good service, imho, and this place does that very well !  Great salad, heck it has its own facebook page its so popular, but the service is just as good.  Well done !"}
{"text":"Beautiful atmosphere and great service. Unfortunately, the food was not up to the same standards.  We walked in on a Monday night and the place was largely empty, which worked well for us. We sat outside on the patio, which was well lit and nicely appointed with a great view of the restaurant itself. Our waiter was very friendly and helpful.  I ordered the Deep Sea Red Crab Cakes to start, and really admired the flavors. The crab cakes were well cooked, and the red pepper aioli added an unexpected but delicious kick. Unfortunately, there was just far too much aioli on the plate, making it the star of the dish, not the crab itself, as it should have been.  As it was quite late, I decided to skip an entree and just order another appetizer as my main course. The butternut squash gnocchi with pecan pesto and brown sugar sauce sounded amazing, but it was probably the worst thing I have ever eaten in a restaurant. The gnocchi seemed to have been deep fried, so they lacked that soft, melt-in-your-mouth taste that I love in gnocchi. They were chewy and meaty - in fact, when I passed one to my husband, he asked, \"What kind of meat is in this?\" The \"sauce\" was a very light slop that did little to mask the texture of the gnocchi. I actually had to stop eating because I thought I was going to be sick if I put another one of those gnocchi in my mouth.  Perhaps I just didn't order the right things at Citizen, but I can honestly say I will not be returning for another go."}
{"text":"We visited on a Friday nights and enjoyed the Yelp Eats menu. It was maybe 2/3 full with room to sit at the bar.   Our server, Gary, was great, although he did try to explain to me what pepitas and rapini was (um, thanks, but those are pretty easy ones). The best part was that our courses never felt rushed, and you actually had time between them to chat and relax.  We both started with our own chopped salads. If you're not a smoked salmon fan, they can substitute chicken. It was delicious--great mix of textures.   Hubby had the Berkshire pork loin, which I thought was just ok (I thought it was a little dry and lacked flavor, but he liked it). He loved the fruit compote on top but thought the white corn spoon bread was strange (it was fluffy yet dry). I had the scallops and loved every damn thing about that dish.  We finished with the bread pudding, which wasn't overly sweet or huge in size.  They didn't have many wines by the glass, and the ambience was pretty loud. Other than that, we thought it was a great meal out and would highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"My family and I came for dinner. We enjoyed a few happy hour cocktails in a dim lit room which played a part to the comfortable and cozy atmosphere. For an appetizer we had the fondue and for dinner we had the pork chop, scallops, chicken, and short ribs. All were prepared and presented perfectly. Everything tasted wonderful and the bottle of st. Emilion we ordered was excellent. Needless to say, this restaurant is a definite success for a great experience."}
{"text":"Went in for a friends birthday last night. The food, drinks, and our server were amazing and if it were not for the unfortunate experience with the management staff, I would have highly suggested this place to anyone. Because we had a larger party, they had explained while making the reservation that they could only do one check, but would take multiple forms of payment. When the check arrived, we went through, and wrote down what items went on which card, so the server would easily be able run each card for whatever the total would have been. A few minutes later the manager comes back, sets the cards back on the table with a calculator and says that they were not going to do the math for us, and to figure it out ourselves. After we did, I approached the managers again to explain how unprofessional and rude that was, given they have computers that could have easily done the math for them had they not chosen to be lazy. They went on to tell me that they were \"very clear\" when we made the reservation that they were not going to split the check...which was not what we were asking them to do when asking them to do some basic math. They went on to tell me how \"lucky\" we were that they even got our size group in on such short notice. (*Bear in mind we had 12 people at 10pm...there was so much room in the restaurant we could have been a walk-in party and they would have easily been able to get us right in, even without a reservation.) I have worked in the restaurant industry for the last 5 years, and when I explained that in my experience I had never worked at or been to a restaurant that would ever toss a calculator on a table and tell the guests to \"figure it out themselves,\" the woman said she \"encouraged me to eat at those other restaurants then.\" Im giving it 2 stars because the food and drinks were good, but dont waste your time at this place if you dont want to deal with lazy, rude management."}
{"text":"Pretentious - I should have known by the name and location.  The waiter actually used the phrase \"You should consider getting something from the bar, we like to think of it as the engine that drives the restaurant...\" This comment was obviously uttered in the pre-shift meeting, I could not believe he actually said it.  The chopped salad was good (petite & tossed table side?), I ordered a microbrew and my date had an egg-white/lemon vodka drink - yeah apparently in 2011 protein is cool to mix into your cocktails.   Should have asked if they had egg-beater whites instead.  Both choices were interesting but not anything I would tell a friend about.  Trying way too hard on the drinks in my opinion, some of the ingredients are completely unnecessary.  Good luck pronouncing them or trying to pick out their flavors in your drink, you'll be baffled.    Entree for me was the lamb burger ($14ish) medium, it was easily med-rare and not spectacular. Came with some pretty excellent french fries and some pickled rare vegetables (rutabaga? pickled rutabaga. yes, it exists.). Date ordered scallops which were a bit chewy, not melty like the mid-$20 price tag would have indicated.  If you are trying to impress someone, you can try to go here and maybe you'll fare better...we might have just ordered the wrong things?  Tab was about $80 for two drinks, an appetizer, and two entrees. Boooo.  Booked the reservation on Yelp, bonus!"}
{"text":"We went with a group of 8 on a Friday night and had a reservation. We were sat promptly and on time. The drinks were tasty but small pours for the price. The chopped salad was delicious. The entrées were average to small portions. I had the short ribs which were dry. The greens were undercooked and extremely bitter. My wife had the meatloaf which was also very dry.    The kicker to the evening was when we asked out waiter James to split the checks. His reply was rude and condescending but did eventually split the checks. Overall it was ok but not a place I would go back to."}
{"text":"We came for happy hour and stayed for dinner. What a delightful surprise! Excellent crab cakes and burrata appetizers"}
{"text":"I have heard buzz about this place for some time now and I see why. The chopped salad is hands down the best salad I have ever had. The Spam Sandwich was very good and was an interesting twist. A few nice beer options and some great mixed drinks and wine too. Gets very busy on weekend nights."}
{"text":"Here for double birthday celebration.  Great service from Gary, wonderful food.   Thanks for making our celebration a success!"}
{"text":"Let me just say that stars or words cannot express the fabulous dining experience I had with friends last Sunday! I am originally from NYC, now living in Atlanta, and was visiting friends in Phoenix last weekend. We were going to the theatre in Tempe and my friend who lives there suggested a number of restaurants that she has been too. We checked menus online, discussed, and she decided to make reservations at Citizen. As it turned out the show we saw ran longer than we expected and we were going be late for dinner. My friend called and they said no problem at all. I guess being a Sunday night was not as booked as let's say a Friday or Saturday. We actually got to the restaurant almost an hour late and they could not be more gracious seating us right away and our waiter came over immediately. His name is Kent and if there is a school for training wait staff and servers, Kent should be an instructor! He was engaging, personable, knowledgeable about menu items, drinks, wines, and never once rushed us and really made us feel like we had all the time in the world.   My 2 friends and I shared appetizers with the original chopped salad and mac n' cheese. This salad was perhaps the best I've ever had anywhere! The flavor combinations were amazing and the mac n' cheese pretty darn good too. For entrees, one friend had the pan-seared scallops, another friend had the short ribs, and I had the meatloaf. We tasted from each other and everything was perfectly prepared. My meatloaf? Being a bit of a meatloaf type guy I can safely say was the best I've had ever! For dessert, we had coffees and shared something called The Dude Jar, or basically just a jar of delicious chocolate heaven!  I think this is fairly new spot and I really hope they succeed. I'm not sure what the dining scene is like in Phoenix now but I will be back next time in town!"}
{"text":"Love love love CPH!!! The chopped salad is so refreshing and delicious. Great choice for dinner on a warm scottsdale night. I would highly recommend. We have also done a few birthdays here and the staff is extremely friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"Their menu promised food likely to send any foodie into a blissful food coma.  I didn't quite reach food coma status, I'd say nap status would be more accurate.   The wagyu burger, made from meat that is considered one of the most fatty cuts of beef, was dry probably because the chef cooked it medium well instead of medium rare per our request.  Minus 1.   The fondue light kept going out, minus 1.   But the waiter made it his mission to keep it lit all throughout dinner, so plus 1 for service.   The fondue accompaniments were aite.  Nothing to write home to mom about but they did have asian pears.  Plus 1. The pork belly dish was freaking amazing.  Caramalized brussel sprouts, spaetzle, it was all done to perfection.  The only thing wrong about it was that there wasn't enough.  Plus 2.   Beers during happy hour were 2 bucks.  Plus 1.  -1-1+1+1+2+1=3 stars"}
{"text":"We've wanted to come here for qhile and it was worth the wait!I thought this place would be all hype but I was clearly wrong.   We were a larger party and had reservations. We got right in on time.  We basically tried the entire menu. food and drinks came  We were greeted by a team of friendly hosts, seated, and did not wait long before our server arrived. He answered our questions, made recommendations and took our drink orders. We started with a bottle of sparkling wine - Cannot remember name but they had a nice selection.    Waiter was polite and made recommendations.   He also suggested 6-7 dishes and everything was great and came out at the right time. Don't skip the desserts."}
{"text":"Awesome dinner, awesome service, would come again tomorrow if we could. Chris our server was awesome and his suggestions were spot on. The short ribs and scallops were tasty, chop salad AMAZING!!! Great place"}
{"text":"Just got into Scottsdale and was looking for a late (9:30 pm) dinner.  Citizen is open until 11 and the menu looked great so off we went.  Located downtown, tastefully decorated we were greeted and seated immediately.  At that hour still a lot of diners which was a good sign.  Menu has a lot of unique and interesting selections.  I ordered the duck burger, others the short rib tacos, the Mac and cheese and the meat loaf.  Everything was very good although some of spice combinations weren't to our liking.  Ate about half (portions are big) because we wanted to try desserts.  Had the chocolate cake, the ale cake and took home the bacon brittle.  Again, everything was great.  Service was fantastic and our server was a blast.  We'd definitely come again."}
{"text":"Service was great! Drinks are interesting craft cocktails... The salad and scallops were both fantastic!"}
{"text":"I don't know why I'm so obsessed with this place. Staff and food never disappoint me. The chopped salad is an obvious must have. I ordered the carne asada tacos and was very impressed by how tender the meat was. The burrata salad was fantastic. My fiancé and I loved their dirty martinis as well. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Service: amazing. Our waiter was awesome! He was super friendly and I noticed he was very personable with all his tables. Very pleasant. Their staff is very on top of it.  Atmosphere: this is why I am taking a star off. It was crazy loud. I don't know if it is normally like that but it was so loud that I felt that I was shouting across the table to be heard. It had a fun vibe but honestly way too loud. I felt like I was in a club type atmosphere and not a restaurant.   Food: started off with the Mac and cheese which was actually pretty good. Had a nice flavor to it. Also had the burrata which was very delicious!! I had the meatloaf with mashed potatoes and zucchini and it was amazing. Best meatloaf I have ever had and the portion size was huge. My bf ordered the filet, med/rare and he said it was cooked perfectly and delicious!  An overall great experience!"}
{"text":"I have recently discovered this place. The food is really good. I have to say that the service is good. The two times I have gone..the server takes the order and the runner's who bring out the salad haven't gotten it down right. 1st time they brought it out with my main course. This time they brought out the wrong salad and brought out my partners 1st. You guys are great but I think you need to get that simple part solved. It's not fun when you guests get there's and your still waiting for yours. I also mentioned that we were celebrating a big deal that closed for my partner and nothing was mentioned to celebrate at the end of the meal, after they asked me on the phone when I made the reservation. Why ask then?"}
{"text":"Been going here for a long long time with only positive opinions of the place and unfortunately a new insecure Bar Manager makes me write the following.  So disappointed that I feel the need to write my one and only review on yelp but the management need to know.  After sitting down at the bar tonight alone.  First drink of the night.  I order my first drink and an appetizer. Some guys sit by me.  They are having their first drink if the night.  And after 20 mins the bar man gets a stick up his ass about all of us and refuses to serve us all and returns all the food.  I have no idea what the hell got his goat.  After the other two guys left I was so disappointed I called over the manager who supported the bar guy without question!  Really?  Whoever the owner is they need to really look at the over sensitivity of their managers. Great food, great vibe,... Usually...  Unfortunately spoiled by poor management staff with self confidence issues. Good luck guys you just lost one regular and a few locals."}
{"text":"Such a trendy and fun dinner spot! The food is amazing and there are variety of menu options will leave you wanting several items. I got the seared scallops and my husband got the meatloaf and we were both impressed with how extraordinary the flavors and ingredients were. The others in our party got the chopped salad and the pork loin and were also very excited and impressed. This is a great spot to go with a large group or some friends as the atmosphere is energetic but the ambience is somewhat formal."}
{"text":"It's just one of those must go spots in Scottsdale. My friend had taken me here for my birthday and she had their salad as a main dish and since then I have gone back SEVERAL time just for this salad."}
{"text":"Really, really good all the way around.  From the first moment we were greeted to the moment we left the service was impeccable, the food and drink were top-notch, and the atmosphere is just very relaxed and puts you at ease.  We shared some of the dishes that folks repeatedly mentioned - pork belly pastrami, chopped salad, short ribs, scallops, bread pudding and the pudding jar - all washed down with a couple of kilt lifter ales and a couple of glasses of delicious wines.  Every single bite and sip was great.  Our server, Jeremy, and all the other staff did a wonderful job of pacing things, refilling glasses, etc., and we never felt rushed or neglected.  A must try if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Food was amazing!! Ambiance was great too. Very upscale with reasonable prices. Went for a business group dinner and was not disappointed. I plan to go back for a date night with the Hubby!!!"}
{"text":"Try the Jucy Lucy...it's so good!  The mingon tacos were good too.  And they are open til 11pm on a Sunday night."}
{"text":"Peanut butter paradise!  All I gotta say!  Wow!!!"}
{"text":"We went here for dinner last night. To start, the $$ rating is very misleading. The prices are on the high side. The chop salad was amazing per the previous reviews but the entrees we ordered, Lamb Burger and Chicken, were both overcooked and very dry. I can see going back here for a happy hour but never for dinner. Just not worth it."}
{"text":"After choosing this place after it's great reviews, I decided to give it a try. Not gonna lie, I was a little let down by the menu choices, but what I had (crab cakes & chopped salad) was ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC! Definitely worth the bite! :)"}
{"text":"After dining at Citizen Public House, it's no surprise it's one of the top rated restaurants in Scottsdale! We chose the restaurant as the venue for our post-busy season office dinner and it did not disappoint. The event coordinator was very prompt with email communication and gave us the option to choose between a variety of set dinner menus. She also offered cocktail and wine menus to enhance our dining experience.   We all had the famous Chopped Salad to start. I was a bit hesitant as I'm not a huge smoked salmon fan, but wow, this salad was absolutely delicious. Not only is it beautiful plated, all the ingredients perfectly marry together. I was disappointed the portion wasn't bigger for the set menu as I could have eaten this for my main course!  For our entree course, guests had the option to choose between chicken with saffron rice, coffee cherry glazed short ribs with parsnip purée, and pan seared scallops. I chose the short rib dish and the flavor was phenomenal. It was paired with crunchy sautéed Swiss chard and I was shocked how much I enjoyed this simple vegetable. My only teeny tiny complaint was that the short rib was just a tad dry. The chicken and scallops dishes looked amazing as well, everyone was very happy with their selections!   For dessert we all had the smores pie in a jar. While it was perfectly sweet and decadent, it tasted a bit more like gingerbread pie. No complaints from me, just an observation.   What stood out above all was the service. We had a party of 11 and our glasses were never empty. Our server was very attentive and explained all dishes on the menu in great detail before we ordered. I also loved that when I asked the host where the bathroom was, he walked me all the way through the restaurant to the door. It was a nice touch that showed the waitstaff really cares about their guests and making their experience enjoyable.   I would recommend Citizen Public House to Scottsdale residents and visitors alike. You're sure to have a memorable culinary experience!"}
{"text":"You should consider this an update of my review of the Yelp Event at Citizen's Public House. http://www.yelp.com/user_details_review_search?userid=v-gCiEr8vr9JnMkkR5Uq_A&q=citizen%27s+public+house  Ever since the amazing drinks we had at the Yelp event I've wanted to go back to Citizen's Public House. So we stopped in tonight, our 23rd wedding anniversary, after dinner at a French restaurant we wanted to try. Richie Moe, mixologist extraordinare and my drink hero was busy so his apprentice, Chris, made me an amazing drink. But Richie knew we wanted a taste of his magic so when he was free, he came by.  He remembered me and Yelper Shannon M and how much we enjoyed our drinks. When he learned it was my and Jim W's anniversary he offered us anniversary shots, saying he felt like lighting something on fire. OH MY GOD!!!  He started out with these two stainless steel pitchers - way too big for a couple of shots. He put in chopped chocolate, added chocolate liqueur and banana liqueur and heated the bottom of the pot. He then gently caught the contents on fire. That's when the real excitement began. He poured flaming liqueur from one pot to the other. Back and forth went the flaming lava-like stream, a brilliant blue and gold. When he was done he poured it into two shot glasses, added some sort of cream and grated chocolate on the top. It was warm, a perfect temperature to drink. And it tasted like a liqueur version of bananas foster. IT WAS FANTASTIC!!!  I'd been wanting to go back since Presidents day. Richie reminded us why. Chris is well on his way to being an amazing mixologist as well. You need to find out why too. Go now. What are you waiting for?!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came here to celebrate our 5 year wedding anniversary. They were so accommodating and greeting us with a complimentary glass of bubbly. Always a treat! The server knew the menu so well and suggested many delicious items! We of course had to try the omfg salad and look forward to trying to recreate its amazingness (although it will be impossible!) truly one of the best salads in Scottsdale. Wonderful decor, service and cuisine!"}
{"text":"The chopped salad is the best I've ever had.  Service was great.  Noise level a bit high. Worth going back!"}
{"text":"I loved their pork belly pastrami and their lamb burger! Def on our list of places to return to on our next trip out to Arizona! Yums! And not pricey either!  You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"We love this place and visit every time we are in town. The food is yummy. Love the original chop salad, the beef short ribs, meatloaf and the lamb burger.  The mixologist is top notch, the service friendly and the vibe welcoming & fun. A must while in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"The cocktails here are totally unique - and beyond tasty!  Chopped salad is outstanding, but so is just about everything on the menu."}
{"text":"The ambience was very trendy and relaxing. This being our first time there, we let our very exuberant waiter tell us his favorites. He was a fountain of information and did a wonderful job explaining the whole menu. He recommended the tossed salad as an appetizer and it was a great mixture of texture and taste that was refreshing. I chose the meatloaf entrée and yes you may think it is just a home style classic but this meatloaf was elevated in taste and the zucchini was cooked perfectly (wish I had gotten more than three slices, but succulent each of them). I was stuffed but when the desserts were explained to me, I could not resist and ordered a the trifecta dessert that included fudge, strawberry ice cream and brittle. Delicious! This was a great find in Scottsdale that was pretty close to our hotel. Bonus!"}
{"text":"Best drinks for your money in town if you like whiskey and gin."}
{"text":"Just happened to pop in Saturday night with my husband. No reservations but there was ample room at the bar. Service was amazing and we started off with the catfish grits appetizer. Wow. We had the spicy mustard sauce on the side and are glad we did as it was too mustardy. The catfish was fresh and the crust made of grits was delish. My husband had the meatloaf and I had the crab cakes. Both were phenomenal. My crab cakes were some of the best I've ever had and I eat them everywhere! I'd definitely make plans to visit this place if you've never been. Or to go back if you haven't been by in awhile. Wonderful experience!"}
{"text":"Unique food - I had the Chop Salad, Short Ribs & took home some of the Bacon Peanut Brittle to try later. Each of the dishes were unique but very tasty."}
{"text":"Elijah and the other bartender(Greg?) were great and attentive and friendly. Kilt lifter fondue was superb. I can compare to many different ones I made myself or had at different friends houses in Switzerland.  I also tried the noble bread. The bread is not special but the bone marrow butter is freaking delicious that comes with it. There also was sundried tomato with it that isn't 5 stars but still okay. Unfortunately it is the cocktails that make it lose a star. It was the size of my pinky and 12 dollars. Thanks for the service. Highly recommended for the food. My buddy enjoyed his Banh Mi quite a lot"}
{"text":"Great food Great drinks Great atmosphere Great Service. Get the chopped salad, the pork belly pastrami, and the meat loaf. Everything I have ever ate here has been awesome or amazing."}
{"text":"Burrata, scallops and ribs were excellent, as our waiter recommended! Definitely a top recommendation when in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I never would've imagined that I'd write a review based on a salad! I don't even like lettuce! Yet, here I am...writing about the world's best chopped salad!  1) Occassion:  For my first birthday weekend in AZ, Ryan made a reservation for us here. As soon as we walked in, we were seated at a very cozy and romantic table(it had a candle, that's romantic right?!).   2) Service: Our server (also named Ryan) was the sweetest guy we've ever met! He had the warmest smile and treated us like we were the only customers there! Although he was servicing several tables by us, we felt he was there the second we needed him!   3) Food: The chopped salad is to die for. When it's brought out, the ingredients are layered vertically. Our server mixed it up for us with the dressing and I think that's the best way to eat it. I saw a table near us eat one section at a time and I think that's missing the point! (Who watches others eat..this weirdo)  The salad consists of lettuce, salmon, sunflower seeds, corn, and some sort of green dressing. It is super good! I want the recipe so I can make it every day!  *Seared scallops: Also to die for!   4) Ambience:  It's a fairly small restaurant with cozy seating. There is a bar in the middle. Although we were here for a birthday, it seems pretty awesome for happy hours etc.  We'll be back regularly!"}
{"text":"First time visit was really enjoyable.  We benefitted from the Happy Hour prices and were pleasantly surprised at the quality and portion sizes of the cocktails and food."}
{"text":"Really nice dinner - great service.  Interesting beer and cocktail list.  Keep in the rotation"}
{"text":"Love this place.  Great food and good service, had this amazing salad. I could of just eaten double of that.  Yummmm.  Nice atmosphere and great service !!"}
{"text":"We came to Citizen after being recommended to it by a friend (plus the good reviews didn't hurt), but what a disappointment. Bland food and service. Velveeta on $35 chicken doesn't make it gourmet chicken. On top of that the service was less than ideal and slow.   I will say that the restaurant itself has a nice atmosphere and maybe we just came on a bad night?"}
{"text":"Pan seared scallops with corn grits and wilted snow pea greens and cola gastrique: humble-poser sounding dish, corn grits were fine but the scallops were too salty  Lamb burger: lamb patty lacked flavor except for the bitter gamieness, loved the kennebec fries that came with though, very unique chunkier texture, homemade ketchup was also too bitter and I'd rather have heinz/sirracha/korean bbq sauce/mayo/anything else generic  Could've just paid $10 tops at any southern restaurant for grits and fries instead."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my experience at C.P.H. and will go back. I want to point out the positives and negative of my experience. After a long day of catering, I started with their version of a Manhattan. To no surprise, it was great. Their cocktails are always great! I love the alterations they make to the list from time to time and it also shows how good their bartenders/mixologists are. Before my meal arrived, Eric(a mixologist) was just finishing his shift. He, like me, had a long day. He treated him self to a beer and a pour of Amaro and we struck up a great conversation. A truly genuine person. He is incredibly knowledgeable about spirits and He will be the reason I go back. I want him making my cocktails in the future.  As for the meal. I chose the game hen. The presentation was great. The flavor was good. The sauces they put on the plate could be kicked up a notch, especially the one made with the peppers from Calabria. I would say commit a tad bit more. The most  displeasing thing was the amount of vegetables they gave you. In total, 1/8 of a full size Portobello mushroom, maybe 12 English peas and one tiny marinated in a can artichoke heart. To pay in the high 20's for a plate I want to be full and also feel like I got a fair amount of food. Is that not fair?  C.P.H. would of received 3 stars, if it wasn't for Eric saving the night."}
{"text":"Great experience at Citizen PH...highly recommend the food and ambience trust me well worth the price!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic service.   Great variety in menu.  Thai margarita to die for.  Hummus good, macaroni and cheese good,  grilled cheese super yummy.  This place lives up to its great yelp reviews.  Prices medium to low in my opinion.  Would go back for sure!"}
{"text":"Food was incredible and server was very attentive to us. The potatoes were incredible as well as the macaroni and cheese. Very impressed with this choice and you may want to make a reservation."}
{"text":"The food and drinks there are amazing. However, Brandan Casey, The tall glass of water behind the bar, is the main reason we keep coming back. The whole staff kicks ass actually."}
{"text":"Had the turkey sliders appetizer which were decent but the chopped salad and pan seared scallops were phenomenal! Service and ambiance--excellent. Pricing is average considering the location"}
{"text":"We went here tonight for the Valentine's Day special dinner menu.  There were 8 in our party and between us all we probably had almost every course option there was.   Salads were great, but endive was quite meager portion size, and tortilla soup while tasty was only lukewarm.   The chicken (these chicks had augmentation lol!) with risotto was fabulous as was the meatloaf.  Those who paid extra for filet did not feel it was any better than ones at chain \"Texas\" restaurants.  Scallops were large, well presented and tasty.  Sides were good and plentiful. Dessert was excellent.  Service was ho-hum.  Those with mixed drinks were offered refills but iced tea and water were not refilled. No one asked if they could get us anything else and some would have ordered coffee to drink with dessert.  To go boxes were provided.  Atmosphere was very noisy, difficult to have a conversation.  Dessert was delicious, but it felt very prepackaged. For the price I expected something very special and this left me wanting more.  Much more."}
{"text":"We're from DC and were generally not impressed by Arizona cuisine. But CPH was the exception. Best meal we had the whole trip.  Salad special was just that. Scallops fine too. Wines good and reasonable. Honored our reservation. What's not to like?"}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me on a date here and we absolutely loved it. We loved the food, drinks, service and the ambiance. Can't wait to go back for a date-night."}
{"text":"Really great, strong drinks. very unique too. The bartenders are all expert and friendly."}
{"text":"By far the best service I've ever had in Arizona. Our waiter, Sam, knew everything about not only the menu, but the intricacies of how it was prepared. The scallops and the chopped salad are amazing btw. I can't believe I haven't been here before. The perfect place for gastronomers in the area who are picky with what they want."}
{"text":"Tonight was my one year anniversary with my girlfriend. We wanted a safe bet for good food, we are big fans of the Gladly, and were willing to pay a larger bill. Sadly we only achieved the later. I am hoping this was an off night as all the other reviews were rather strong.  First we were presented with the Summer menu, which being October should have been the Fall menu.  We had the tuna and peaches on the appetizer list. The tuna was really good 8/10 - slight fishy taste, but hey its Arizona. The sea is far away. The baked peach salad was pretty bad though. The lettuce and bacon was ok, but the peaches were hard as rocks. Its a dish we have all done and if you have peaches a little less than ripe you can usually wing it, but these were solid like a rock. They were most likely very apt for the Summer menu, but as it is Fall, peaches are no longer in season.  We ordered the scallops as our main. I'm a big scalop guy, but these were undercooked and leveled off with a huge pile of greens on top. The photograph of the scallops on yelp showed them with a deep brown sear. Ours were white with a hint of brown and pink in the middle.   I think the best part of the meal was true to scottsdale form, the cocktail. Extra strong which made my girlfriend a little more flirty.   We decided to cut our losses and go to a different restaurant. Frank and Alberts over at the Biltmore. If you want a really good dinner and ambiance you should check this spot out.  The meal came to $80, and we were charged an extra $8 for an extra scalop on the plate which we left behind as a casualty of a bad dining experience.  Moral of the story: if you are into the scottsdale drinking scene bring your date here they serve a strong cocktail, if you are into good food look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and try the pork belly pastrami appetizer. Or the scallops. Or better yet, both. You will thank me later.   Great ambiance without being \"too much\". I would recommend Citizen for a date or nice night out with the girls. If you happen to be flying solo or hanging out with the boys, the good looking gentlemen behind the bar will make you feel at home and whip you up a delicious cocktail.  I appreciate how passionately the staff talks about the food. CPH definitely gets my stamp of approval."}
{"text":"My colleagues and I had the best experience at Citizen Public House.  While in Scottsdale for a meeting last week, I was tasked to find a great place for dinner and this place was recommended.  When we first arrived, I immediately liked the vibe and trendy look of the place.  Dim lights and their cool interior created just the right casual elegant atmosphere that I love. When we arrived, our party of 11 were seated quickly in a semi private area alongside the dining room that was perfect.  All cocktails and food were excellent and exceptional which is important for any 5 star rating.  But what solidified 5 stars for me was our stellar waiter Sam.  Talk about exceptional service and someone who so naturally has mastered the concept of connecting with customers.  He was funny, sociable,  enthusiastic and addressed me by name.  He flawlessly handled our party's cocktail demands without a hitch.  We went through quite a few rounds but he was on point and attentively got our cocktails ordered and served with such efficiency.  He then suggested we leave the ordering to him, where he would help decide on the best appetizers, mains and desserts to serve our party.  He nailed it.  We all absolutely loved the fondue, burrata, chopped salad (extremely tasty!), seared tuna, rack of lamb, scallops, shortribs and chocolate and caramel desserts that were just too luscious to describe.  We literally just sat back, relaxed and enjoyed an exceptional meal and service.  Bravo Citizen Public House, for standout food, service and such a star waiter like Sam!"}
{"text":"My friends and I came here as a big group for a birthday dinner. For some reason I thought this was more of a bar, but it is actually a foodie's delight! Our group was quite a handful (the drinks were flowing, therefore we were all very chatty... with everyone around us) but the server was SO nice and accommodating. None of us could decide on anything so we decided to get everything instead. My highlights...  #1: Chopped salad. Doesn't sound like much but literally THE BEST SALAD EVER. It's probably not the healthiest salad in the world, but is so so so worth it.  #2: Pan seared scallops. Perfect seared outside, nice smooth delicate inside. Delicious entree.   Overall, great bar area for mingling/happy hour and a fantastic foodie spot as well."}
{"text":"We had a dinner with 4 last night and would fate this as an average restaurant. Obviously went because of the reviews, but did not find the food, service or ambiance remarkable. The grilled octopus was nice, but the remainder of the food disappointed. In an area with lots of competition, we would recommend trying another spot.  I also agree with the other reviews that the inside seating is loud and we noticed a number of people move to outside seating."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to the heart of Carmel, but my server said it came off the menu six months ago. I substituted the Black and Tan which was lovely but probably not the same. I enjoyed my chopped salad but it was not one that I was used to. My server Robbie was exceptional!"}
{"text":"Good food. Very knowledgeable staff. Great drinks. Cool ambiance. Atmosphere was a little muted, especially for a Saturday night. Not that many people there and the tables are spread far apart. Overall though, a great restaurant for Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times for business dinners.  Not my choice, but my boss's choice.  :)  The menu is heavy on the meat, so perhaps not the best choice for vegetarians and vegans.  However, they are willing to customize your meal to your liking.  A couple of things off the top of my head from the menu that I can remember that are vegetarian are the olives (appetizer), the green salad (appetizer, comes with goat cheese), and the Hippie Dippie sandwich (comes with cheese).  My waitress was very helpful to create a vegan entree for me.  They have a vegan entree, but it is not on the menu, so you'll have to ask for it.  It is a marinated and cooked portobello mushroom with purple rice, and cooked kale.  To be honest, I can make better tasting vegan food at home.  It was just okay.  But I was happy that they were accommodating to my desires for a vegan meal."}
{"text":"Get the Chopped Salad! Always busy in a fun part of town so get a reservation.  Really interesting menu & craft cocktails. The chopped salad is notoriously awesome! Went for my birthday & couldn't resist the Fried Bologna salad?!  I know sounds so cheap & weird but it was so amazing! Don't forget to try some of their custom on sight aged & flavored whiskey! (if you like that sort of thing)"}
{"text":"Place has a nice feel to it. The food is good but it is expensive and the portion is lacking."}
{"text":"I went to this highly recommeded restaurant for my birthday dinner. I was looking for great food, service and a cool vibe. Well, I found it! From the moment we were greeted by the pleasant hostess our experience was nothing but professional and welcomming. The place was moderately busy on a Thursday night, service staff bustling around, but not \"panic mode.\" Our server (Gary?)was very knowledgable of all the menu items and the wine list. We were told by him as well as friends that we had to get the pork belly pastami app, it was the best thing we had! The crab cakes were good, not the best I ever had, but I would get them again. The short rib entree was outstanding. Perfect balance of savory, salty, sweet, sour etc. Gary even split the dish for us even though we didn't ask for that, he over heard us saying we were going to share, very nice touch. We passed on dessert, since i had a special one waiting at home for me. Gary still brought me a tiny box of truffles to enjoy later and knowledged my birthday, with out a big fanfare (which is what i prefer) We didn't have any cocktails, since I was having a champagne kinda night, but I know Richie Moe makes some of the best cocktails in town. We will be definately be back soon and I have already told many people of our experience. Thanks to gary and the rest of the staff for a memorable b-day dinner :)"}
{"text":"Citizen Public House is my go to place for an amazing bite to eat and excellent service. I have been to CPH at least 6 or more times and every time I am never disappointed.   CPH is comfort food taken to the next level. Whether you order the Bacon Fat Heirloom Popcorn (don't fear it, it's awesome) or the chicken and waffles, taste bud satisfaction is the norm at this place.   I think the reason I keep coming back, despite the excellent food and amazing white sangria is the amazing service. Whether it's a busy Saturday night, or an early dinner on a weekday I am continually impressed with their level of knowledge and service at CPH. It's how a restaurant experience should be, and it's consistently amazing, just like the food. A plus also is they offer Gluten-Free options for my celiac sister. Believe me she is very hard to please, but CPH always puts her at ease when it comes to the GF options. Go to CPH and I promise you will not be disappointed.  What I love to order: white sangria, original chopped salad, pan seared scallops"}
{"text":"They have a great cocktail list, and offer affordable bar snacks. From rosemary roasted nuts to assorted olives, plenty to choose from. Oh, and order the Original Chopped Salad. You won't be sorry. One of my favorite restaurants in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"We visited her Mother's Day weekend, and shared quite a few of the dishes, but the most memorable was the short ribs. I make short ribs at home, and even use a coffee rub, and  I often order them when dining out, but these were the best, hands down. I hope to return here on my next visit to the Phoenix area. Any guesses as to what I will order??"}
{"text":"All of the bartenders are true mixologists and always willing to answer questions or explain drinks.  Had a lot of fun on every visit while enjoying superb cocktails."}
{"text":"Food was burnt,  what else is there to say.  Nothing worse than horrible service and burnt food.  Spent $96 dollars total.  Next time I will buy steaks at Costco and call it a day."}
{"text":"This place is going to turn me into a alcoholic.  The cocktails here get five, big, huge amazing stars.  They are as great as everyone says they and you will want to order \"one of everything\" - and that's okay.  I started with the Citi-Zen as the waiter said it was their most popular and I was not disappointed. I followed that up with a traditional Pisco Sour - I say traditional because they include a RAW EGG in their recipe - just like the pisco sours in South America!  The menu is slightly lacking in the 'vegetarian' department, but to be fair our waiter did offer up an off-the-menu risotto type dish for my honey and I.  Instead, we ordered this grilled cheese type sandwich. Okay, but get this, the cheese itself is grilled. Its this weird/awesome Middle Eastern cheese that doesn't melt easily so they put a thick cheese slice on the grill! YUM!!   Our waiter was extremely knowledgeable in both the food and cocktail menu and brought us out a complimentary dessert for our anniversary.The decor itself was kind of plain and lacked in the ambiance department - but after two or three Pisco Sours, who cares?!"}
{"text":"Good foods. Had pork cheek and meatloaf. Pork Cheek. Well cooked and tasted 5 flavors like Chinese uses when they cooked pork. Thought about the owner or the chef is oriental. Anyway, it was good.  Meatloaf. Good. Nothing I can say more.   I think this restaurant is fusion style which I don't like most of all. But...this restaurant deserves 5 stars for the taste of foods and servers. Waiters are well trained for upsales. Need to hire him in my restaurant."}
{"text":"For anyone that wants a wicked cocktail, a great meal, and an atmosphere that is part speakeasy (barrel aged cocktails by a mixologist with a heart) and part modern incarnation of Cheers (truly felt like everyone that worked there new my wife's and my name)...go to this place.  Everything from the bar is a gift (thanks to Michael who is a true artist and a helluva guy) and anything from the kitchen is worth skipping meals for the rest of the week (this ain't your mom's meatloaf).  Hands down the best meal in Scottsdale.  So bummed this place isn't just down the street from my house in Portland.  Citizen something special. Go there tomorrow."}
{"text":"I really dig this place, the white linin, the neatly lined tables, clean and orderly...I love the original chop salad, the tuna is always so fresh there isn't a hint of 'fishy' anywhere near it. A must have for me Overall, the place garners 3.5 dollar signs, It's a bit pricey and pretentious but save up order a whiskey cocktail and enjoy the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Here is a straight up review. Food was decent, prices were avg for Scottsdale, Service was ok as well. Atmosphere is where it lacked. The place echoed and WAY too loud. Almost to the point of annoyance. Unfortunately that is something that would be hard to correct. I still give it 3 stars though"}
{"text":"4.5 stars.  Service:  Friendly, attentive, and helpful - this place did a great job of hiring a 5 star staff  Atmosphere: Trendy, yet casual - you can pass with jeans, but I did see a couple tables that were pretty dressed up  Drink: The Citi-Zen cocktail was a little on the sweet side, but still absolutely amazing  Food: The pork belly pastrami and chopped salad were the highlights of the evening as they were both delicious. We also ordered the buttermilk chicken, which was good but nothing special, and the scallops, which were extremely salty - on the border of being inedible.  Overall, even though Citizen didn't stand out enough to make this a 5 star review, it's still a great place to eat in the Scottsdale area."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in Old Town! When my husband called to make a reservation he happened to mention that the dinner was for our anniversary. Not only did the hostess welcome us when we arrived by saying happy anniversary but there was a nice card on the table and we were served two flutes of champagne when we sat down! Those nice extra touches made our dinner that much more special and memorable. I love the omfg salad and every dinner we've had there has always been flavorful and delicious. Service is friendly and sincere and we can't recommend it enough to our visiting friends and family!"}
{"text":"Word fail. They elevate taste and dining to new levels I never thought possible. Sheer perfection. We could think or talk if nothing else but our blown away taste buds. You must dine here to complete your experience as a human being."}
{"text":"Happy New Year 2016!! We wanted to celebrate our first meal of the new year in style and ventured over to Citizen Public House for lunch.   It wasn't too crowded, but we wanted to keep it casual and sat at the bar. Our friendly bartender came over and went through the menu with us. He spoke with such enthusiasm and passion for the food. We decided to go along with all his recommendations.  Appetizer: The Original Chopped Salad: By the name, chopped salad sounds like rabbit food, but our server warned us that we would soon be chopped salad addicts. He was absolutely right! WOW! It was one of the best salads we had ever eaten!! The separated ingredients were beautifully presented to us on a platter and then mixed together with a delicious dressing. Smoked salmon, couscous, dried corn, diced tomato, trail mix, arugula, creamy dressing-the perfectly articulated combination. The texture and flavors were really incredible and we all fought for the last few bites. I would come back just for the salad alone! I found out later that this particular salad has its own Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/TheOriginalChoppedSalad  Crab cakes: Scrumptious and served with unique crunchy cole slaw. There was a decent amount of lump crab in the cakes for being in Arizona and not near the ocean.   Entree: Duck burger with duck fat fries, how meta! The duck burger was mouth-watering with shishito aioli, fried egg, tomato, spinach, and potato bun. Juicy and incredibly flavorful.   Short ribs: We were drawn to the dish because of the local coffee rub. The meat was super tender.   Dessert: The Dude Jar: Intrigued by the name, we tried out this dessert. Basically it tasted like pudding with some crunchy cookies.   Anyway, back to the main star of this meal- the chopped salad! You must try this dish! So thankful that our server made this recommendation. Absolutely superb service and food! What a fantastic way to start the new year!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times and just realized I never reviewed it. Shame on me.   My first visit here was about 2 years ago and that is when my addiction to the import started. Let's just say the import is a drink that is made with Jameson, Guinness foam and stuff like tobacco bitters. Take my word you want 1 or maybe even 3.   The bacon popcorn is awesome as a starter or a desert. Both wins in life.   I've had the filet, their rotating specials, the porkchop, meatloaf and burger here before and not one bad bite of food.   This place is trendy so it gets busy fast. Also get ready to pay a little more but the quality is top notch."}
{"text":"This restaurant was a huge disappointment. I ordered the short rib which was extremel dry and the parsnip purée had way too much cinnamon and tasted really strange. My husband got the meatloaf - one of his favorite meals - and it was not restaurant quality. To top it off, our waiter was stuck up and rude."}
{"text":"My oh my... I've never been happier to accidentally stumble upon a restaurant. It was one of those dining experiences where everything was perfect from the food to the service. I was debating between this restaurant and Bandera since both have excellent reviews, but I realized there was a Bandera location in Chicago so that helped me make my choice.   Starting with drinks, I've always wanted to try a Moscow Mule, and at Citizen Public House, all of their drinks have a signature mix to them. I HIGHLY recommend it... it was done way before we received any food :)  Now onto the food...   I ordered the Pan Seared Scallops with Roasted Corn Grits - it was one of the BEST meals of my life!!!! I've had scallops numerous of times, but these were the most delicious and delicate I've ever tasted. The corn grits were an incredible addition to the scallops as well... just trust me and get them!  My fiancé had the Buttermilk Roasted Chicken - smart Chicken breast, sweet corn-butter bean succotash, roasted Brussels sprouts, truffle oil, pecorino Romano. It's a very popular item and I tried a bit and it was great (not as good as my scallops though). We both practically licked our plates clean... and he's not much of a food lover ;-p  We were stuffed, so no room for dessert, but I WILL be back when I'm in the area again. Our server, who's name I forgot, was excellent and very helpful. The entire night was amazing and definitely the best dinner of our trip to AZ!"}
{"text":"This was hands down the best meal I had during my recent trip to Phoenix.  Our waiter was very friendly and helpful - walking us through the menu, making suggestions, and just being overall very pleasant.  My husband and I started with the Pork Belly Pastrami, which was tender and delicious.  We scarfed down the whole thing.  For entrees, I went with the scallops and grits.  The scallops were nicely prepared, but I could have eaten a whole bowl of just the grits with bacon. Mm - so so good. My husband had the short ribs which were definitely the right way to go.  They were delicious.  And, even though we were both too full to move, I really wanted to try the bread pudding, so we went for it.  So. worth. it.    The only unfortunate thing was that at 8:00 on the Sunday night before Columbus day, the restaurant was pretty much empty.  I would have expected more of a crowd - it felt a little ... i don't know..not happening.   But, despite the lack of a crowd, this place stands on its food and service and I will definitely be back the next time I'm in AZ"}
{"text":"OMG, you guys, I think I'm in love.  Maybe I've been stuck in the suburbs for too long, but I was so impressed with Citizen.  I finally had a chance to check it out, and during \"social hour\" no less.  I had been hearing about those barrel aged cocktails, so I had to give one a try.  I don't normally go for the bourbon and whiskey cocktails, so the waiter recommended the Pacific Coast Cocktail, and described it as \"sort of their version of sangria\".  It was really good, really strong and $5 to boot (during social hour).  I had to switch to wine after that because I didn't want to get completely wasted in front of a bunch of strangers.  I also took the liberty of ordering the bacon fat popcorn for the table because Holy Jesus.  Bacon.  Popcorn.  How could you go wrong?  You can't, and this was truly sent from heaven.  Or hell, maybe.  Either way, it was freaking amazing and I would eat it every day if I could.    I ordered the Short Rib, much to my boyfriend's chagrin.  I always seem to order what he wants, and then he has to order something else (sorrynotsorry).  Oh Lord, not to be a yelp stereotype here, but it was TO DIE for.  Short Rib?  Amazing.  Parsnip Mash?  Why didn't I think of this?  Swiss Chard?  Yes.  And it is gluten free, for those of you on that food trip.  Our waiter was totally on top of things, made great suggestions, and was super sweet.  Basically, everything I ask for in a waiter.  And the atmosphere?  Yes, it has that \"cool, hipster vibe\" described by other reviewers, but I like it, and I didn't find it pretentious or snobby at all.    Overall, I want to go to CPH like EVERYDAY, but alas, I cannot.  I will settle for going as often as I can to enjoy their delicious food and libations.  And I encourage you to do the same."}
{"text":"If I could have given a negative star I would have. Those with ALLERGIES, BEWARE!  I planned a birthday dinner here for 8 of us. Coming here nearly ruined our night. Called in advance to inform them of my allergy and request that they simply change their gloves and use clean cutters when touching my food to ensure that I don't get sick on my special night. The waiter raised his voice at me and said that he could write it on the paper but wasn't sure if those preparing the meal would actually change their gloves, that they were too busy to care. He probably didn't realize he kept spitting on me when he spoke, he was so animated about it. I explained that it was my birthday that day and that I had called in advance. I had all my guests seated and didn't know how I could eat there if I couldn't trust them to honor basic food preparation guidelines for those with allergies. He continued to insist that they get too many orders and may not follow these guidelines. When my friend began getting upset and asked him to just make sure that it happens, he yelled \"what did you say?!\" in an extremely rude manner. By then there was no way we could order there and risk getting sick or trusting the food he brings out. All 8 of us walked out and had to find a new place for my birthday dinner at the last minute on a Saturday night. Would definitely NOT  recommend this place. Such a shame that they turned away our business, spoke rudely to us, and even didn't apologize for their behavior even after I informed the receptionist that we were very offended by the way we were treated by their server. So disappointed."}
{"text":"Went this past weekend - little loud and dark. It was restaurant week so went with those selections.  The salads we perfectly constructed but the entrees were good, not great. Based on the previous reviews I had high expectations and it didn't quite meet them."}
{"text":"Love the service, the waitress is so nice and very helpful with all the quest I asked. Recommendations for dishes are excellent! Love this place"}
{"text":"Pork Belly = DELICIOUS. Scallops? I. Don't. Even. LIKE. Scallops, and these were A-M-A-Z-I-N-G. Fun and tasty cocktails.  Next time I'm in Phoenix, I WILL go back here. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I hate to go against the usual rating for this place, but after my experience Friday night I really don't see how a 4 star is warranted. I must say though, I do see the potential and would go back again to give it a second try, but here are my thoughts about my first experience at Citizen Public House.   First of all, we went to CPH during restaurant week for a business dinner, so part of my experience may be tainted by the reason I was there. I really felt the initial service was lacking. We wanted to change seats, but our waitress didn't come to our table for about 10 minutes, so we had to ask the hostess to move us. Then, it took another 10 minutes to clear another table, which was empty in order for us to move seats. Once we were seated at the new table, our waitress was prompt, helpful, and extremely delightful.   As far as the food goes, I was expecting to be blown away based on the reviews. My experiences at FnB and other restaurants in town completely surpassed CPH food. I did love the pork fat popcorn. I had never had something like that at a restaurant and I loved the bacon. It seems that CPH loves bacon overall as it was very present on their menu, including apple bacon bread pudding, which was just alright. I had the smart chicken which was really standard chicken and risotto. My Husband really enjoyed his scallops, but didn't like the coffee pot dessert.   So, long story short, I would give CPH a second try, but I wouldn't go running back any time soon. I'd say my experience was unique given the trend on yelp."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to this place after reading such good reviews but HOLY COW what a disappointment. I have no idea how anyone would rate their food five star quality.   There were four of us. All of us had different dishes -all terrible. We all had different mixed cocktails all tasted horrible. The speakeasy upstairs know how to make a cocktail. The bartenders downstairs DON'T.   The service was slow and it was so loud I could barely hear myself think.   But if you are a single guy on the prowl for cougars, there is quite an abundance to choose from here."}
{"text":"We are visiting Scottsdale from Chicago and found Citizens on yelp. We ate here for dinner on a Thursday night. I love the atmosphere. There is a bar in the middle of the restaurant - a great place to hang out for a drink after work or with friends. They have a great beer selection.   Our server was amazing and super nice and had some fabulous food recommendations. My husband and I ordered the famous chopped salad and added the smoked salmon. Hands down this was THE BEST chopped salad I have ever had. I had the scallops with the corn grits. So delicious! My husband got the short ribs with a coffee rub. They were super tender and came with a yummy cherry bbq sauce."}
{"text":"I am always excited for dinner at the CPH! I am sure every review says it, but seriously, order the chopped salad. I've been here several times and I always get the salad and then try something else from the menu. Nearly everything has been delicious, especially the chia seared tuna. My boyfriend had the crab cakes last time we were here, and I recall them being a bit of a miss.  The drink menu has something for everyone from cocktails and beer to a complete wine list.   Great place for a date night or dinner with friends. Although I will caution, when the place is full, it can be very loud and hard to hear."}
{"text":"5 stars. Service, food, atmosphere, friendly staff and very knowledgeable waiter. There was no waiting (for table or for food) even on a Friday night. Food was phenomenal. Love pastrami pork belly, their specialty salad and my main dish (spare rib)."}
{"text":"My husband and I specifically made reservations for this place to see what all the hype was about.  Upon arrival, we were greeted and told to have a seat in their waiting area (we may have been about 5 minutes early). However, the slight disappointment came when we were now waiting 20 minutes past our reservation time.   After the unacknowledged and unapolgetic wait from the front staff, we were finally seated at the most awkward booth ever. It was shaped like a really short rainbow which forced us to awkwardly stare at two girls about a foot away eating their dinner. As it was quite uncomfortable for us, I'm sure it was even more strange for them.   With regards to the food and beverages, here's what we ordered: Amaro Meatloaf, Duboc Pork Loin, their Black and Tan for dessert, and a Sour Pisco and Tipperary to help wash it all down.  I can't say there was anything extraordinary about this place or the list of things they have for you to consume but most of it was better than your average with one exception: the Black and Tan. I truly think this is their money maker. I'm not too big on sugary things but this was absolute perfection - the kind that makes a Negative Nancy want something fancy."}
{"text":"Fun and knowledgeable bar staff. Had bacon popcorn. Fantastic!! Excellent happy hour with half price drafts and great appetizers."}
{"text":"The food was good, but the drink list was really the star of this show.  They feature some classic cocktails that you don't find too often, as well as some truly unique drinks.  Definitely try the Midwest Manhattan, Moe'scow Mule, and Persian.  Our waiter was excellent, and provided wonderful recommendations.  Husband had the spare ribs, which were delicious.  I had the meatloaf, which was definitely a step up from mom's meatloaf.  Prepare for big portions."}
{"text":"Looking for a place in Scottsdale open late, my friend and I were very surprised to stroll into CPH at 9 pm and find a very classy place. As we were seated, we had this nagging feeling that we'd look at a menu that was $25 a plate or more. Thankfully, most of the menu was very reasonable, especially considering the quality of the food, which I'll get into later.  The service was downright flawless. I wish I remembered the name of my waitress, because she was probably the most attentive waitress I've had in years. The atmosphere is classy, very white and black. However, the indie rock playing on the restaurant speakers reassured me that this was a place that was also comfortable with being casual as well, a juxtaposition that I am sure only exists in the state of Arizona.  Now, to the food. I wasn't in an appetizer mood, so I went right in with the Wagyu Burger. I am not kidding when I say THIS WAS THE BEST BURGER I HAVE EVER HAD THE PLEASURE OF CONSUMING! I ordered it medium well, as is typical with me and burgers, but with the quality of the meat they used, I should have gone with medium at least in retrospect. Everything in the burger, the bun, the veggies, the cheese, the homemade mayo they had on the side, was flawless. The arugula fries on the side were some of the best fries I've ever had as well, and went amazingly well with their homemade ketchup.  The cocktails were expensive and didn't contain anything that particularly stood out at me, but I'm sure they're great if you like what's in them. I paired my burger with a Duvel, which is great because I can rarely find that beer anywhere and it went perfectly.  For dessert, I had the Cookies and Milk since I was feeling pretty full from the burger but still wanted a nice way to cap my evening. What I got was a bag of five of the best cookies I have ever tasted. They came in exotic flavors such as \"spicy chocolate fudge\" and \"apple bacon brittle oatmeal\" so if you want to take your sweet tooth on an adventure, I highly recommend it.  This is quite a place if you're looking for a classy joint to enjoy a few drinks and great food, especially kind of late or on a date. One of the best places in the area, IMO."}
{"text":"The starter foods were fantastic....the food was perhaps a little too fancy for my liking. I don't care for sweetened mashe potatoes :) you may say that's just a personal preference, but this is just a personal preference post :) The atmosphere is beautiful but not great for large parties because the sound is way too loud. I could only realistically speak to the person next to me and have meaningful conversation."}
{"text":"great service, food, and atmosphere. Loved the scallops, chicken, and chopped salad! Try their other restaurant, \"The Gladly\" in Biltmore, too!"}
{"text":"Citizen Public House  Citizen is my favorite place for happy hour when I'm in old town. Their cocktails are always strong and perfectly executed (thank you Brandon Casey), and there's a good selection for $6 on their happy hour menu. The Rose Garland with bourbon, Solerno blood orange, Sangue Morlacco (Luxardo) liqueur, and coffee-caramel bitters is my personal favorite, probably the best twist on an old fashioned I've ever had. They also make an awesome Bulleit julep.   You really can't go wrong with any of the food here, but you absolutely can't leave without getting Bernie Kantak's infamous chopped salad - smoked salmon, pepitas, freeze dried corn, Israeli couscous, bruschetta and arugula. The ingredients might sound a little strange together, but trust me, it's freaking magical. There's a reason this salad has its own Facebook page - it's basically a local celebrity. FYI: if you're ever flying out of Terminal 4 at PHX, you can pick one up to go at Cowboy Ciao by the B gates. The short ribs and scallops are my other favorites from their menu. And if somehow you saved room for dessert, the pot du creme is absolute heaven.   Don't forget to sign up for the In Good Spirits mailing list - you get a free chopped salad for your birthday!"}
{"text":"We followed the recommendations of the waitress and got the chef specialties, pork belly pastrami, chopped salad, the duck and the scallops. The results, a wonderful meal. One of the bests I've had in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"Good sized bar surrounded by tables with white table cloths, casual, sophisticated atmosphere.  Wine from US, France, New Zealand.  Good selection.  Everything from inexpensive snacks to sandwiches and salads to delicious full blown meals.  The whole nine yards done well.  I had the pork loin served creatively with sweet potato in phillo with delicious goat cheese and figs.  Absolutely delicious.  My date had halibut and was very happy with it."}
{"text":"Citizen Public House is a gastropub in the Old Town Scottsdale that has vibrant local community feel.  Food was excellent:  - Shrimp and tomato salad - Amaro meatloaf  Both dishes were simple, but execution made the difference."}
{"text":"This my first review on yelp. I'm not usually one to review anything but felt compelled after the delicious meal my family had here.  I was a little skeptical about the chopped salad but after having it, I would highly recommend.  The service was excellent too."}
{"text":"In town for spring training and wanted to have a nice dinner after eating ballpark food...lol. This place is phenomenal.  We ordered an appetizer, Pork Cheeks which were to die for.   For our main entree I had the Rack lamb and my friend ordered the short ribs.  Both were delicious and we are still raving about how good dinner was the next day.  Definitely try this restaurant you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Great atmosphere, great drinks and wonderful food.  The Original Chopped Salad is the best salad ever and I'm glad CPH has it on the menu.  The scallops are also delicious.  The best thing is the bar.  CPH has a ton of great and unique drinks and for those who can't make up their minds, the bartenders will concoct something great for you.  Only things that get it 4 versus 5 stars are the menu--I love what I've eaten but would like to see more options, and some of the staff are not knowledgeable about the menu and could be a bit friendlier (i.e. I went while pregnant but not yet showing and declined to order a drink and the waiter acted like I was absolutely nuts.  He kept asking me if I changed my mind and wanted a drink)."}
{"text":"My wife and I finally tried CPH and were greatly surprised by everything.  The food, as expected, was superior along with the professionalism of the staff.  The ambiance too was well set as the place could hold large parties very comfortably.   We began the nigth with a bottle of wine, the original chopped salad alons with the rock shrimp.  All were exceptional!  As out main courses, my wife orded the sea scallops and I ordered the short ribs.  (Peter of Cowboy Ciao's must miss this guy.)  Both dinners were cooked to perfection and the staff never left alone.  For dessert, we had coffee and the evening's special, the donut holes with three dipping sauces.  All were fantastic.  The wife and I don't usually rate places with five stars, but this place actually gets how food and service are meant to be as one.  Can't wait until we head back."}
{"text":"Five stars for the cocktails, desserts, and service, four stars for the entrees I've sampled so far and the ambiance.  Over a total of four visits to CPH, I've sampled five of their cocktails and a number of their appetizers and desserts along with two entrees, met and interacted meaningfully with all three of the owners (including the at least locally-renowned Chef Bernie Kantak, creator of Cowboy Ciao's Stetson Chop Salad [which is recreated here]), and generally thoroughly enjoyed myself on each occasion.   The space is large enough to accommodate large parties or couples with equal aplomb. I've twice now toured the private upstairs space, and look forward to finding a fitting occasion to fill it with close friends.   I've had fantastic service upon each of my visits - twice sitting at the bar, once at a Yelp event, and finally for a normal dinner, and feel completely confident in suggesting CPH to the most demanding diner.   I'll update or edit this review to talk more about the food once I've had the short ribs and the lamb burger. The entrees I've tried thus far (the salmon and the chicken) didn't quite plumb the depths of my soul, and while the appetizers I sampled on other occasions were excellent, I don't remember any of them well enough to cover them in any detail. Hey, it was a busy month! I will say that the salads I've tasted are all amazing and that the bread pudding dessert was an absolute revelation right up there with the one delivered to John on the Isle of Patmos.  I've saved what I feel to be the best feature of CPH for last: the drinks. I could attempt to describe the feeling of anticipation I felt watching Richie rinse the old fashioned glass in preparation for a sazerac, or the deep happiness the feel of the froth of the pisco sour brings me when it hits my lips, or even the wistful yet satisfied feeling I got when I drained the last drops of the bijou (pronounced bizh-OOOh) from its martini glass, but I won't bore you any further - just go and taste (and *feel*) for yourself.  The wine and beer lists will certainly offer you something you'll love, should your tastes run that way.    In sum: good food and great drinks served by lovely people in a nice setting for reasonable prices. Far and away my favorite bar in Old Town."}
{"text":"Second time here and it did not disappoint! Had a wonderful dinner and Gary was our waiter... service was great and food was amazing!"}
{"text":"\"Have you ever been over to a friend's house to eat and the food just aint' no good?\"  You know the famous line from the Sugar Hill Gang. You won't have to feel that way at this house, because this house has the sauce that is awesome.  Yeah, Citizen Public House might just be the most legit place in all of Arizona. I don't know what took me so long to get here.  This is a destination for foodies, and not just because it's been featured on the Cooking Channel or the Food Network.  Some Highlights:  --Tender Belly Bacon Fat Popcorn! (Not for the pretentious and idiotic) --Gorgonzola-Emmental mac-n-cheese (Not for the lactose) --The Chopped Salad (This ish is famous yo) --The Squealer Burger (yeah, it has bacon in it)  This place is absolutely amazing.  If you appreciate food, and can afford to splurge both in the wallet and palate, then make this a destination.   Absolutely worth it. Next time, I want to try the Lamb Burger.  Also, the cocktail and draught list is solid. Goose Island Matilda FTW! (Yes, I know its a Budweiser product)"}
{"text":"Wow I never thought I would find delicious food in Scottsdale. I was here for Spring Training. Here to see my SF Giants. Go Giants!  I tried to make reservations through Open Table and nothing was available for the night. SO I called and the gentleman accommodated us by saving a table in the patio for us. If service was this good, I was already thinking the food must be good as well. When we arrived, we got seated. Yeah.   We ordered the Original Chopped Salad. They mix the salad at your table. The salad was the best chopped salad I've ever had. It even has it's own Facebook page. https://www.facebook.com/TheOriginalChoppedSalad  We also got the Pan Seared Scallops to share. Since they knew we were sharing our food, they divided the entree to 2 dishes. Wow! That's service. Scallops were cooked to perfection. Very tasty and I wanted more!  We got the Bernie's Mac 'n Cheese and was also really good.  So CPH is known for the house cocktails. We HAD to order. Midwest Manhattan and the Sangria are amazing. If you like a good manhattan, go for this one!  As for dessert, we shared the blueberry pie with graham cracker ice cream!!! I LOVED it!  Overall, I was pleasantly surprised with CPH. They had fantastic service and memorable food. If I lived in Scottsdale, I would be a regular."}
{"text":"This place rocks. The real deal.  Late night menu is a real treat.  Superb mixologists at the bar.  Mind blowing cocktails.  High quality food that's fresh and scrumptious.  I love going here prior to partying in Old Town Scottsdale.  Very sexy establishment."}
{"text":"Perhaps it is me, I prefer decent portions and good food over the \"plate presentation\" of some places, such as this one."}
{"text":"The high stars for this place don't lie! It's a very unassuming looking place and the interior is simple but obviously upscale. We went here for our anniversary and they offered us some complimentary bubbly to celebrate! The food was delicious and we went home very happy with the food, service, and overall experience."}
{"text":"Really not sure what all the hype is about.  Ate here about 3 weeks ago and it was nothing but forgetful - no really had to look at menu to figure out what we ate...   He -  the scallops, they were good enough She (me) - the short ribs.  Not very tender and just OK.  I can make them better.   Burrata was our starter -  Good but again nothing that left any real impression.  Not the type of place that left me thinking \"Gosh I cant wait to return\".  Probably wont."}
{"text":"I'm still kicking myself for not venturing into Citizen long ago.  I found myself hungry and wanting a good meal a week back.  Citizen had always been in the back of mind and I decided to make my way to Old Town and give it a try.  Do not walk, run to Citizen.    I was greeted warmly by staff and a lovely atmosphere.  Dark wood beams surrounded by warm butter colored walls and soft candle light.  White table cloths and black and white pictures adorn the walls of this beautiful structure.  I started with the pastrami pork belly with hints of horseradish that play perfectly with mustard and brussel sprouts.  A dish that could be too rich if executed carelessly.  Absolutely perfect.  Followed by the scallops.  Perfectly cooked to medium rare.  Very sweet with the right amount of pan sear.    The staff is attentive and not overwhelming.  I felt at home.  I'm still dreaming of the pastrami pork belly.  Well done, my friends.  Well done."}
{"text":"I can't believe I've never reviewed this place! Their food and drinks are always fantastic & on point. It's a definite go to place in the neighborhood. Mac & Cheese-eat it, chopped salad-eat it, anything else that sounds good to you-eat that too.   Go there, eat some delicious food, drink some great cocktails, & thank me later."}
{"text":"Amazing service!! Food is incredible. Love it!!!!! Would definitely suggest this for a date night. Try the dessert!!"}
{"text":"This is one of the highest rated restaurants in the area. I didn't know what to expect here. I was in T-shirt and jeans which seemed a bit underdressed because people were in dress shirts and ladies in nice blouses.   Food:  I ordered Scallops and a beer.  Scallops - Cooked to perfection.   Service:  I sat by the bar and didn't really need much service. The bartenders were fairly attentive though dropping by every now and then to see if I wanted another beer.   Environment:  Great first date spot. Heck there were 3 couples in the bar area that seemed like it was their first date. Good food with loud vibes. Dress to impress type of restaurant.   Price:  $20 - $40 per head.   Food: 5 Service: 5 Environment: 5 Price: 3"}
{"text":"Sat nite @ CPH. Early dining at the bar as is our wont. Lotsa room at 5:30; crowded by 6:15. Service was outstanding. Could not have been made to feel more welcome by the entire bar staff. They serve a killer sazerac and have a monster selection of liqueurs. Is there another place in town that features a ' sausage of the day'? Chorizo soup was the s-o-d this lucky night. A richly textured meal in itself, I piled on with the mac n cheese which could've earned the 5 stars on it's own. They offered to add sausage: Momma didn't raise no fool, I accepted. CPH earned the hype! Hope you love it like we did."}
{"text":"Just came for dessert but it was tasty! Cocoa chile bread pudding and some brownie madness dish. Both awesome. Drinks were great too -  had the Citi-zen and hot pink paloma (not hot pink btw). Lots of furniture moving out of dining area during peak evening hours was kind of loud/annoying and seemingly unnecessary but otherwise great service and fare. Ambiance on patio was ok."}
{"text":"After visiting this place, I enjoyed the drinks and food; however I was sent out of due to homophobic reasons"}
{"text":"The service was great. We had a table of about 16 people, and our server was very attentive and helpful. The atmosphere is a very lively but classy. I ordered the Jerk Short Rib Tacos, which were delicious. My friend ordered the Chopped Salad, which I think is the best thing on the menu. Definitely will come again!"}
{"text":"In my first review, I indicated I would give this place another chance.  So glad I did!  After a concert Thursday night, we decided to stop in here for a late night drink.  It was pretty late, so not much of a crowd.  The lights were dim, the atmosphere was cozy, and I was happy to see an interesting tap selection.  I had some kind of pale ale by Anchor Steam, and it was yummy.  While I hadn't intended to eat anything, I saw the late night menu and had to try the hummus plate. Best part?  The sweet pickled baby cucumbers. Just like my mom makes!  Bartenders were knowledgable and attentive, crowd was mellow,  it was a romantic way to end our night out, and our last night for this trip to Scottsdale.  Couldn't have been better!"}
{"text":"I'm giving it 5 stars in many ways due to the context of being in Arizona. I have to spend a lot of time in AZ for work and amid the myriad of chain restaurants and mediocre food this place stands out far above the rest.   The Chopped Salad is nothing short of excellent, quite possibly the best salad I've had in my life. Look at my photos. Go, look at them. Do I look like a salad guy? No, I do not. Yet every time I come here I have to get one (once I even got two...yes, I'm a monster). The ingredients, the freshness, how it all works together, it's just excellent. You must get this salad if you come here must. The rest of the menu is solid, albeit not as spectacular. Probably more 3.5 star caliber food, but still very good (espec. for AZ). I've had the Filet (3.5), a panini (3.5), the mac n cheese (not that special), the pastrami appetizer (very good), and scallops (very good). The desserts are also very good, I enjoyed the Peanut butter dessert and flourless choc. cake very much, although the latter is very heavy.   The ambiance and drinks are also excellent, making it a great date spot. Though there are a ton of slutty (sluttily?) dressed women here so keep your eyes on your date. But hey, that's Scottsdale, it comes with the territory"}
{"text":"Everything was outstanding - appetizer (pork belly pastrami), main (amaro meatloaf) and dessert (black & tan). Service was very good also. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Not sure what happened to my previous review, but... EXCELLENT FOOD. Our server, Gary, was super informative about the menu, and we even let him surprise us when we were being indecisive between two entrees (short ribs or meatloaf) after ordering the scallops. The scallops and braised short ribs were TOP NOTCH. We followed dinner with this chocolately, caramelly heaven of a dessert. So glad we decided to come here and have a new restaurant to enjoy when passing through PHX/Scottsdale."}
{"text":"This was as good a meal as I've had in quite a while, and that includes places like New York and San Francisco.  The food is exciting and delicious--no tired old dishes that you've had elsewhere.  The service was up-beat and cheerful.  And the food came surprisingly fast.  The restaurant is beautiful and not particularly noisy, even at the height of the dinner hour on Saturday.  I was surprised to be able to get a reservation for such a good place at the last minute, but maybe they had a cancellation.   We picked it entirely based on Yelp reviews.  We were a party of four and had the following:  1. Rosemary roasted nuts.  A bargain at $5, you get a large quantity of roasted nuts, warm and elegantly served.  One serving was plenty for 4.  2. 'Tender Belly' bacon fat heirloom popcorn.  Another $5 bargain.  Popcorn like you've never tasted anywhere else.    3. Crispy Squid. $9.  A pile of lightly-fried squid and a light, delicious dipping sauce.  The pickled fennel on the side is amazing.  4. Mirliton Chopped Salad.   $12.  I seldom like salads, and most are nothing to write home about, but this one was a delightful mix of flavors and textures--including popcorn.  I only used half the dressing they give you because I wanted to taste the ingredients, and that was the right call.  Start out with half and add more of you really need it.  5. For my main course I had the Fair Trade Coffee Charred Short Ribs  $28   The meat was pretty much perfect--crispy on the outside, tender inside.  The parsnip puree and greens were to die for.  No kidding.  6. My wife (and one other person) had the Pan Seared Scottish Salmon.  $26.  She asked for it rare, and it came perfectly rare, though still crisp on the outside.  I had a bite and it was delicious.  There were plenty of delicious beets to go with it, so I had a few of those, and loved every bite.  7.  One person in our party had the Pan Seared Scallops.  $17.  They were large and seared to perfection.  The side dishes were delicious, like everything else.  8  We've been trying to stay off deserts, but couldn't resist, so we ordered one of each of the four:  Irish Coffee Pot de Crème  $10.  This came in two layers--the chocolate at the bottom and the cream on top, with an embedded wafer.  One of the best I've had.  The Strawberry Pound Cake. $9.  I'm not a fan of strawberries or pound cake, but this was ordered by someone else and I had a taste and thought it was pretty good anyway.  \"Pig in the Orchard\" Bread Pudding.   $9.  My wife and I had jokingly said ahead of time that if there was a desert that used bacon, we'd order it, so we had to order this when we saw the desert menu.  It was unusual and amazing.  Just goes to show there's no dish that can't be made better by addition bacon fat to it.  Finally, we had the Cookies and Milk.  $6.  There were several cookies served in a paper bag with a glass of milk.  We only tried one, being full by then, and that one was quite unusual and delicious.  We took the rest with us and we'll find out tomorrow, but I have every confidence they'll be great.  Oh, yes, I ordered a Moscow Mule as a drink and it was pretty much perfect:  Served in a metal mug (as it's supposed to be, but seldom is nowadays), it  was made with real ginger beer (not ginger ale) and came with slices of cucumber in the mug.  Surprising attention to detail for a $10 drink.  Everything was carefully prepared and beautifully presented,  The staff was responsive and upbeat without being obsequious.  Everyone seemed genuinely proud of the restaurant, and with good reason.  I've spent a lot more money on meals coast-to-coast, and can't remember when I've had as good a meal, as pleasant a dining experience or as great a value.  I'm anxious to go back and try some of the dishes on the menu that we missed this time, and will certainly go back in my next visit to the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"The food and service were outstanding but the cocktails were a surprising fail.  We enjoyed the food immensely.  I never would have ordered the chopped salad without the advice of the other Yelpers and it was amazing.  What made it special was not just he flavors but also the way everything was chopped (of course) into very small pieces so it was easy to eat with large spoonfuls and get every flavor in every bite.  THe pork belly pastrami killed and was the best of the evening.  The scallops were excellent according to the guy that had them and wouldn't share as were the short ribs from the guys who was much more generous.  The beet appetizer was very good also.  Our server (Greg?) was excellent and really engaged with us and offered knowledgeable & confident advice on food, wine, and the unfortunate cocktails despite being very busy.  All this excellence is why I was surprised by the poor cocktails.  I started with The Beast - which tasted like blanco tequila on the rocks.  Now I love tequila, but that isn't what I ordered.  I'm a huge fan of Ancho Reyes but couldn't even pick up a hint of it or the limoncello or bitters.  I would have chalked this up to a mistake at the bar expect that the next cocktail - The Mexcacillin was only slightly better.  Despite being warned by our server that the smokiness could overpower lighter food - it wasn't very smoky at all and was itself overpowered by the grapefruit and lemon.  Not balanced at all.  Citizens need to get a mixologist with a better palette involved with the cocktail recipes.  Or at least stop promoting innovative and great sounding cocktails that are so poorly done.  But everything else is awesome."}
{"text":"Fantastic experience from beginning to end. Ask for Paul if you can, as a former server I can say he was beyond excellent. Cocktails were fantastic, including barrel aged manhattan and tequila drinks. Try the short ribs and scallops, but everyone loved everything we got."}
{"text":"This place has plenty of 5 star reviews, but I figured I would add another one! The food and drinks are of course delicious, but what impressed me was the incredible service! Everyone that we encountered from the hostess, to the bartender, to our server were super friendly and professional."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! 1st time and was blown away. Great bartenders, the layout and tried the bacon popcorn! Delicious.  Definitely looking forward to coming back and trying dinner there.    I had a variety of cocktails and all were superb.  The wine list is good too, reasonably priced.  If you have friends from out of town I'd definitely recommend this spot to take them to."}
{"text":"Second time here was not as pleasant as the first visit. This was during restaurant week. I loved dining the first time and was excited to dine the second time. This time around I tried the Bacon Fat Heirloom Popcorn for $5, their Fair Trade Short Ribs which is prepared with a coffee rub, dried cherry bbq sauce, roasted parsnip puree & seasonal veggies for $30; and their Bread Pudding for $6. The Bacon Fat Heirloom Popcorn was regular popcorn with bacon bits and fat. If you're a bacon lover you might want to taste this. It's a simple snack to munch on while reviewing the rest of the menu.  Hmm how shall I put this ....... I can only equate the entree dish to nothing but \"Fair\" - exactly as it says!! And I didn't get a fair trade at all either for $30. It was coffee rubbed so dry and over cooked that my jaws  were gnawing on each piece pretending to like that darn meat! I dipped each piece in the cherry BBQ sauce but it was still parched and punishing experience to the mouth. Luckily I had asked for the bread pudding which was well hydrated served with strawberries and cream. This is a restaurant week dessert not in their main menu.   The final straw of the evening was the check for a party of 9. At the bottom of their menu it states in fine print: Split checks unavailable for parties larger than 8. First of all, the waitress allowed one person in the group to have their own separate check leaving 8 people left. If you allowed one person then you must do for the rest at the same table.  Was she afraid she wouldn't get her 20% or more gratuity? If the waitress allowed one person in the group to have their own check the group becomes 8 people or less. Which means we CAN technically split the check any which way. Instead the waitress proceeds to tell us she can't do that. And on top of that she proceeds to tell us that we need to calculate our own tax and tip!! You mean to tell us that a nice sophisticated restaurant lacks a POS system with zero capabilities of generating the math for you?!?!?!  Here's another kicker: At the bottom of the original receipt the waitress hand wrote herself a 20% gratuity. Again, the POS system lacked being able to incorporate the added gratuity on a receipt and the total cost. I find that a shocker. After the whole fiasco and doing our own calculations and making it inconvenient for us diners we were glad it was over. The experience overall was a disaster but the bacon popcorn and bread pudding made up for a bit of it.  Maybe a hit and miss type of deal. :/ Never dine here with a group more than 8."}
{"text":"CPH is the real deal. Phenomenal food, friendly service, decent-size portions, nice wine list. Hubby had already been and was a fan, so we went for the New Year's Eve fixed-price deal. Chopped salad is justifiably renowned, but the chia-seared tuna is just as good. We're not usually big fans of filet mignon, since it's usually flavorless, but Citizen's is delish and super tender! Scallops were perfectly cooked and properly seasoned -- yum. Deserts were good, but not TD4. We'll sooooo be back!!"}
{"text":"I recently had the opportunity to give this place a second try, and what a world of a difference! Had reservations with my husband for our wedding anniversary and from the beginning we had a change of heart about the place. From being handed black napkins so that we would not get lint on our clothing, to the bread service (neither of which happened on previous visits) everything was outstanding! Our server Gary was prompt, friendly, knowledgeable, and made us feel very welcome.  I again had the Filet, which of course was AMAZING. We tried the Mac N Cheese but it really wasn't all that impressive.  I really cant wait to eat there again, and bringing more of our foodie friends with us! Thank you CPH crew for making me see why this place gets 5 stars!"}
{"text":"I was very much in \"convivial\" company my first time here, but having tried at least 6 different main courses and an assortment of cocktails, snacks, and starters since then, I can comfortably say Citizen Public House is my favorite eatery in Old Town to date. Best bang for the buck, if you will. That may not seem like much based on my number of reviews, but I've been around - The Mission, Roaring Fork, FnB, La Petite Maison, 5th & Wine, Mastro's City Hall, Tommy V's...I really should have started a Yelp account a long time ago. In any case, with the exception of the lamb burger, I have been thoroughly pleased with everything I've tried. Their bar is well stocked, and service is great - somewhat casual but appropriate, attentive, and not overbearing. Two recommendations: The pastrami (starter) and the scallops (only 3 to an order, but still worth a try). The chopped salad is good too, just a tad small. Remember to take a picture of it before it gets tossed tableside."}
{"text":"Great service and just okay food. The food is fine if a bit oily, but it's just not particularly memorable. Our table had pretty much everything off the menu: scallops and meatloaf were the stars, lamb burger was dry and a bit boring, chicken was okay, desserts were tasty (wished we had gotten the PB & J Pudding as it looked amazing over at the next table). The grilled cheese was an only carbfest.  The Chopped Salad menu item is a bit bizarre. The menu directs you to the Facebook page of said chopped salad instead of offering any hints to ingredients. Odd marketing choice.  So, it's a good time with fairly good food. The cocktails are tasty and the service was all in all very friendly."}
{"text":"The menu is really out dated and boring.. for a place that advertises on yelp SO MUCH and also has a huge following, I really feel they can do better with the menu  I do like this place, but I feel there could be more option for entrees and appetizers.. The famous chopped salad is very good. I'll always order it when I go. I also felt the red wines were nothing new n sub par. The beer was ok n the vodka to gin room upstairs makes a good effort.. I've never had a bad meal here but I also haven't been blown away.. I came in for the duck my friend had ordered my first time there but it was no longer on the menu, everything else didn't suit my tastes for the night, so I ordered the hummus, chopped salad n lamb burger. It was fine. Lol sorry I'm tuff.. I would have  liked a lil more something on the burger. The hummus I almost forgot about while writing this, and the salad stood out again. Well anything w smoked salmon tastes f*ing good to me. I love to make certain restaurants staples for when guest come to town, this didn't make the cut."}
{"text":"We came here for my fiancé's holiday company party. To start, we shared Bernie's Macaroni and Cheese, the Burrata, the Golden & Red Beets and the Humus & Tzatziki. All the appetizers were tasteful, but nothing really stood out. For my main course I ordered the Swordfish. The presentation of the dish wasn't appealing. There were 4 pieces of radish on top of the fish and it sat on top of golden beets. The flavor was good and it wasn't too \"fishy.\" The server was nice and attentive. However, the music was quite loud so our group really couldn't hear each other unless we raised our voices. All in all the ambiance was okay,the food is good, but the prices are a bit pricey for what you git."}
{"text":"The chef is always cooking up nightly specials, I have eaten here 20 times and its never bad, they got my vote! Oh - and have the chicken and waffles for an appetizer, it's not weird = it's D'Lish!"}
{"text":"What a cool place! It's an upscale pub and refreshingly versatile. If you wanted to come with a few friends and have bar food, it's great. If you want to come with a big group, it's a fun, loud atmosphere. But somehow there is something very romantic about it - I'm not sure if its the dim candle-lit mood or the way that you just feel in your own world, but you can have a very intimate dinner right in the middle of it all and not even notice.  The food is delicious!! I had the BEST GRILLED CHEESE ever. High quality cheese and bread, and white truffle scented mashed potatoes! Mmmmmmmm. The crabcakes are delicious and the short ribs were excellent! The catfish was also delicious but it's pretty spicy, so be aware. It's a little on the pricier side, but you're in the middle of downtown Scottsdale with great ambiance and very good food. Definitely makes for a special night.   4.5 stars so I'll round up!"}
{"text":"We went to Citizen Public House because of the multitude of huge Yelp reviews and it didn't disappoint. Our waiter was so knowledgable from the cocktails to the food and wine. Amazing memory. Thanks Citizen...we will visit again when we are in town."}
{"text":"Stopped in here on a whim whilst roaming in downtown Scottsdale.  Was looking for a dive bar but found this instead.  Good mood lighting, friendly staff,  good atmosphere.  The place was busy but plenty of room at the bar.  I enjoyed a lovely Bombay gin martini which was well presented and well made.  Just what the doctor ordered.  The bars located in a super cute area with lots of kitschy shops nearby.  Great place to roam around!   If I lived here, I'd come again."}
{"text":"I've been in the restaurant biz for over 50 years, and believe me, it's really,really hard to find a restaurant gem like this one. My Wife & I stopped in & sat down @ the bar. We were immediately greeted by Ryan & Mike. These guys are consummate professionals! Drinks were good, food was absolutely fabulous. I'm so glad that everyone from the front of the house to the back of the house \"gets it.\" IF you live or are staying anywhere near this outstanding,locally owned place, put CPH on your 'bucket list' asap!"}
{"text":"The food, atmosphere and spirits are tops. Definitely need to put it on your list of places to eat in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"We came here late Friday after getting turned away at our beloved FnB. What a great runner up! We got seated right away and started devouring their fantastic warm bread. I got the Persian cocktail because I love all cucumber drinks. I remarked I hadn't had a cocktail that good since being in New York.  For my entree, I asked for a veggie plate mostly because I was too embarrassed to ask for what I really wanted-- a big plate of brussels sprouts. The waiter offered the risotto that comes with another dish as a veg entree so I went with that. The risotto itself was kind of bland, but the earthy mushrooms on top made up for that. My husband loved the scallops and said the grits they came with were the best he's ever had.  We went for the peanut butter dessert which was a decadent combo of chocolate ganache and pb mousse. There was way too much ganache for my taste. It was hard to dig into the dessert, but it still tasted good, especially with the tasty crumble on top.  Two things I loved about CPH: our enthusiastic server and the space. The server was great at the get go, but I wish I would have seen more of him throughout the meal. I am surprised to see people bashing the starkness of the interior. I think it looks sleek and modern but still warm and inviting.  We'll be back whenever we can't get into FnB."}
{"text":"4 stars only because this was the first time here. It was a little loud, but the food was amazing (I had the sea bass *****5 stars there!) and the wait staff was friendly and attentive. We never had to ask for anything and always had full water glasses. I would certainly come back!"}
{"text":"Very Good. One of those places where you just can't decide what to get cause it all looks good. The fondue is a must. I would go back for that alone. Also me got the beff belly BLT. Awsome!  And the lamburger. We will be back."}
{"text":"Hipster cool and backs it up.  Great bar snacks - bacon popcorn ?  Of course!  Dropped in for a late Valentines Day dinner and was thrilled with the service and quality of food - great hand made cocktails too ...had filet - perfect rare with a nicely charred salty crust...wife had the Ono with a spicy tomato-based sauce.  Very well prepared!  Ill be back next time in in the Scottsdale area.  Cheers !"}
{"text":"I went here for my birthday and the food and service was exceptional. The scallops!!!!!!!!! No words can describe how amazing they were.   Such a great place for a romantic night out."}
{"text":"What a lovely place.   It's so good that while we were traveling, we visited this diamond three times. We would have come more often, except they don't open until 4pm.   First of all, they know what they're doing. The ambiance is fabulous. In a sea of sports bars with TVs everywhere, the Citizen is breath of fresh air. No TVs. Dark Wood. Warm uplighting. Lots of conversation. Of all of the places we visited, this one had the most \"Northern California\" feel to it - some people were there in Tuxedos, some people were there in flip-flops. And everyone was obviously having fun.   Sitting at the bar, we got to know Thomas, the bar manager - who is a great guy, intelligent conversationalist, and passionate about making a perfect cocktail - and it shows. We deeply enjoyed the Salutation on multiple occasions, as well as the World's End, and I will say they make a mean Negroni.   The food was fantastic - the bacon fat heirloom popcorn was out of this world. I can't believe I've never thought of that. Perfectly air popped corn with chopped bacon pieces, dressed lightly in bacon grease danced on my tongue and gave me the mouthgasm I was looking for.  We loved the fondue, perfectly made sausage, bread, and asian pears with beer cheese. Aw yes. The burrata was absolutely fantastic and flavorful. We also decided on scallops one night, for which they are well known - GET THEM. I've never had scallops prepared like these.   Service: Excellent Ambiance: Excellent Food: Out of this world Cocktails: Delicious  My only wish is that they opened a little earlier, because I could've spent even more hours enjoying this place! Thank you Citizen for an awesome experience!"}
{"text":"I came based on race reviews. Atmosphere and place is nice, but a cod dish for $30 was shockingly tiny, the rest was just OK. This place is just overpriced hype."}
{"text":"Visited Citizen at the end of March while in town for a few days of spring break. Dined with local friends who suggested it. Had a wonderful meal. The bacon popcorn as an appetizer was a definite hit. Ditto for the Pork Belly Pastrami. DO NOT pass up the chopped salad - an unusual combination of ingredients that was delicious. All six of us were very pleased with our choices, which inckuded meatloaf, trout, crab cakes, filet or osso buco. Good wine selection. (Specials during happy hour.). One of us made an interesting observation: there was no salt and pepper on the table. But they weren't needed, since everything was seasoned perfectly. Alas, we had no room for dessert. One final comment: AJ was the most solicitous and engaging waiter we've ever met."}
{"text":"I've been looking forward to eating here for months after hearing such raving reviews from my friends and family and I have to admit, they were absolutely right.. this place is amazing!  I came here with friends to celebrate a recent engagement and when our waiter asked what brought us in tonight I had mentioned the special occasion, and without even asking he had sent over four glasses of champagne to toast the occasion. Kudos CPH.   I had a chance to enjoy the short ribs braised in a red wine sauce and my taste buds instantly became my taste BFF's, wow this dish is incredible and if you don't order this you're outa your dang mind.. enough said. I cant recall exactly what my friends had ordered because we all know what really matters is what is in front of your face. All I know is they all had the same great experience I had as well.  Thank you Citizens, you did not disappoint!"}
{"text":"2nd visit - Social Hour.  Great cocktail specials and a decent tap beer menu.  Very good small plates and bar snacks.  Great atmosphere/decor. Comfortable and welcoming.  Exceptional service!"}
{"text":"I was so pleasantly surprised with the food and service at this restaurant. We had the Applewood Smoked Duck, Pan Seared Scallops and Chopped salad and they were all amazing. The food duck and scallops were cooked to perfection. Our waiter was hilarious.  I would absolutely come back here next time I'm in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I've been to CPH 3 times now and will definitely be back again. The scallop dish Is a must as is the short ribs. My dining partner ordered the yellow tail special which was excellent. Lets face it, you can get scallops and short ribs at a lot of restaurants  but not of this quality and price, most dish's are $20 to $25. What CPH does is deliver consistently high quality food at great value, add in the good service and friendly staff and you don't have to wonder why this has become a local favorite. I'd be remiss if I didn't give a shout out to the bar manager and mixologist Tom, his craft cocktails are a great, I'm a fan of the Boulvardier."}
{"text":"I got the Truffle Grilled Cheese and it was amazing. Every time I go there, everything is delicious. This is the one place that I know will always be amazing. I've tried the crab cakes, lamb burger and mac and cheese as well and they were delicious as well!"}
{"text":"Ask for Eric at the bar!!Most passionate & knowledgeable server. Definitely order the Original Chopped Salad. Coming back for Duck Burger or Tuna. Ugh, can't decide. Maybe 2 visits."}
{"text":"This is a solid restaurant. I've been here twice and enjoyed it both times. The food is delicious and the service is rock solid. I've had the scallops both times I've eaten there. Good presentation and tasty dish all around.  The wine list is impressive not in quantity but in quality. A nice selection of different wines for different tastes. My dad had a Manhattan and he said it was the best he's ever had. And he's drunk a lot of Manhattans over his life.   When I came here the first time, the server messed up on my friend's order. When notified right away about the mistake, the server said that our table could keep the mistake dish and the actual order will be out right away. It showed up five minutes later and the server was apologetic. Nothing over the top but apologetic. He ended up not charging our table for either of the dishes. Completely unexpected and appreciated. He got a good tip.   I deducted one star because the the noise level inside is very high. The restaurant has concrete floors and drywall. The only thing soaking up the sound is people's clothes. It's hard to have intimate conversations since it's so loud inside."}
{"text":"Loved it and can't wait to go back. Great atmosphere while still paying homage to the location's historical roots.  Food was inventive (but not crazy)  and fresh and delicious. Appreciate the creativity to put the out of the norm spin on old favorites.  We'll be back.  And soon."}
{"text":"Oh what a night ! We found this gem on a fluke. We were looking up another restaurant and saw this and decided to give it a try! We arrived in time for Happy Hour(on a Saturday!? What???) and ordered unique appetizers. Fabulous! In fact we were full at that point! But we did order the special of the night and a wonderful dessert. But best of all was our friendly female waitress! She made our night! I highly recommend coming here if you are near Old Town Scottsdale(MAKE the time!)"}
{"text":"The chopped salad is everything it's cracked up to be- must order! We also had the yellowtail crudo, I personally loved it and the rest of our table thought it was ok. Meatloaf portion is a very large portion, delicious comfort food. The tacos had good flavor but far too much meat and needed more sauce or salsa. The galette was very disappointing although if you like banana/chocolate/peanut butter flavor profile the push pop dessert is over the top good! Our waiter was helpful with his recommendations. We joked that he seemed slightly condescending about the quantity of food we ordered per the number of people at our table (we ordered a lot). Overall a nice dinner, nice atmosphere (slightly warm), and good food especially the chopped salad. I'm not dying to go back immediately but I'm glad we went and would dine there again when the menu changes and if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Get the chopped salad.  Had dinner here recently.  Ordered the highly recommended chopped salad, the chia crusted tuna, and some drinks.  The chopped salad was amazing.  Get it with the smoked salmon.  It was large enough to be a meal.  Tasty, refreshing, great texture.  Just excellence.  The chia crusted tuna was rather weak.  It was almost like it came from a different kitchen.  The flavor, texture, and temp were all displeasing for me.  For 30 bucks this piece of tuna should have been WAY better.  The drinks were pretty decent but not 12 dollars worthy.  Bottom line is I would come back for the salad and only the salad.  If I was hungry after the chopped salad then I would order another chopped salad.  Oh yeah, everyone that stated it is loud is correct.  My right ear is still ringing.  I think it is the acoustics in the building.  We had to shout to each other right across the table and the place was only half full."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best restaurants I have been to in my life.  I make sure to make a reservation anytime I am in Scottsdale. The food, service and ambiance are amazing. My top recommendation is the short rib. It is impeccable every time."}
{"text":"A gun place to be in. The food is very good, mostly healthy food. Love their salad. The waitress was very nice and helpful. Friendly atmosphere and good food."}
{"text":"I've been here three times in the past week. Love it! Insane comfort foods. Pork osso bucco, fried chicken , all amazing! Pork belly appetizer is crazy great! The cocktails and service are the best. Ask the bartender to make you their version of your favorite drink and you will not be disappointed. I am telling everyone how great this place is and you will be missing out if you try it at least once. Ha... Try it once and you'll be hooked!"}
{"text":"The food was all sub par, especially for the price. I ordered the scallops and nothing ruins scallops like biting into a small shell on your second bite. My girlfriend ordered the grilled cheese and it was one of the worst I've ever tasted. The bread resembled store bought and there was some sort of mashed potato in it. The chocolate cake dessert was good, a little stale, but still good. The drinks were the lone bright spot, disregarding the price. The moscow mule and old fashioned I ordered were pretty spot on.   All in all this place is not worth the price mainly due to the uninspired and expensive food. I would, however, go grab a drink there. If you are looking for a nice restaurant with a cool ambiance keep looking because you won't find it here"}
{"text":"The menu was quite limited. Greens were fresh. Coworker ordered the fondue and she didn't care for the cheese, says it didn't take like cheese. Also ordered the Cobb salad, was told the salmon was cooked but looked and tasted fresh, not cooked. Pastrami was ok. Would have really liked to see more on the menu. Service was great though."}
{"text":"This place is ammmmmazing and definitely lives up to its reviews and comments. We went with our couple friends and sat at one of the half moon shaped booths by the back wall which arguably was the best table in the house. To start, do yourselves a favor and get the chopped salad - its unique, refreshing, just the right amount of flavor and has its own Facebook page. They presentation is impeccable and they mix and dress it table side - the dressing (buttermilk pesto) is INSANE. Then you really can't go wrong with anything on the menu, except if you skip out on the scallops. They melt in your mouth. The pork shank is like a dinosaur bone so bring your appetite. Also, try the pork cheek - I was very hesitant but the fennel and caramelized onion really balance it out. To finish, we did the Black and Tan for dessert - the layers of chocolate, salted caramel and some other whipped ingredient from heaven was the perfect finish. ;)"}
{"text":"My first time at EM Salon. My friend and I decided to go get haircuts last minute and even though it was busy Sam made time for us. He even put on the hockey game and asked if we wanted a drink. My friend and I were really happy, we got really good haircuts. I was pleasantly surprised by his skills and level of service. Really nice place. Reminds me of the good high end barbershops in NYC."}
{"text":"We began our meal with the famous chopped salad, which easily met our high expectations. My date didn't care for her cocktail -- too heavy on the bitters for her -- but my Moscow Mule was excellent. She loved her scallops, and my meatloaf was pretty good.  The service was excellent. Our waiter was friendly, attentive, and knowledgable. Couldn't ask for more. We went early in the week, and the restaurant was active but not overly busy. The ambiance was perfect for a dinner date."}
{"text":"Sitting at the bar this evening, almost every seat is filled in the restaurant.  The bartenders tonight Elijah , Will and James are text book service providers, super  solid team.  Great service from the get go, knowledgeable about everything they provide. The food is amazing, it speaks for itself. Come and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday night and it was easy to get 7 people seated. Though yelp says it's \"casual\" I would venture to say you should dress a bit nicer than jeans and a t-shirt. I had the Juicy Lucy I think it was called and at $18 it wasn't a bad burger, one of my friends also had the fillet mignon tacos and she really enjoyed them. Over all it was a good atmosphere but costs can add up quickly as what was supposed to be meet for drinks turned into a $500 dinner."}
{"text":"Citizen public house was a great experience. The service has always been great. The chopped salad and their scallops are amazing. Will be back again."}
{"text":"I was pretty excited to eat here because they had a great rating. I have had better chicken from Chick-Fil- A. General lack of flavor. I feel like I was at a different restaurant than what everyone else experienced. My boyfriend got the scallops...same mediocrity."}
{"text":"Great food and super awesome drinks! Fun place to enjoy in the evening with friends or a date."}
{"text":"I had a great meal here tonight with some colleagues. The service was great and food even better.  I had a Odell seasonal ale to start.  Great to see a awesome Colorado brewery on the list of beers.  That said, I would expect a stronger and bigger selection of beers for a restaurant categorized as a Gastropub.    For dinner I had the scallops and they were amazing.  Desert we shared every option and the bacon and apple bread pudding was phenomenal."}
{"text":"This place has the best chopped salad and is worth it every time. The other food is so-so, but the atmosphere is calm, but it is normally busy. Be ready to make a reservation."}
{"text":"Food is very creative and slightly avant guard. Had the short rib with cherry bbq sauce and parsnip puree. It was absolutely delicious.  Had two drinks, a Tom Collins and a margarita. Both were horrible. I mean just absolutely terrible and I should have sent them back. I've had better drinks from the bars on Mill Ave.  It can get a little loud in there. And they don't have any cider; hardly befitting of a so called \"Public House.\" But the food is excellent and they do seasonal menu changes."}
{"text":"So much fun and so good!  Started with happy hour and we drank a whole bunch of the seasonal mule(strawberry, balsamic vinegar mix - i think);    For dinner I had the Bavette medium rare which was unbelievably good, along with the risotto and mushrooms sides, I did not ever want to finish.  I so love this place!"}
{"text":"I made 8:45 reservations for a Saturday night and was glad I did.  The place was packed, and for good reason.  The chopped salad was amazing, the scallops were cooked to perfection and the dessert was decadent.    This is one of those rare places that can pull off casual and swanky at the same time.  You won't feel under dressed in jeans or overdressed in a cocktail dress.  The waiters are fun and efficient and the wait for our table and food were surprisingly fast.  I'll be back for certain!"}
{"text":"Five stars for the chopped salad alone. I have never tasted something so amazing. The service was also great we had a very large party and they took care of us all in a calm and timely manner. But back to the salad, I will absolutely be back for more."}
{"text":"Went to brunch had teh apple pancake was very good.  Wife had the scrambled eggs ( 6 yes 6).  They were good but not great.  There were no meat choices for sides.  Cost $96 including tip for 4, NO BOOZE"}
{"text":"While the baby in my stomach has been extremely well fed over the past 9 months, I think the meal I had at Citizen Public House was one of my best I've had in a long time. Considering the source (yours truly) has 2080+ reviews you can betcha this meal was pretty incredible.  My large party of 15 or so people was waited on by the oh so fabulous Gary, who did his best to provide serious VIP treatment. Gary started the meal by bringing out the popcorn bacon appetizer...can't go wrong with that combo! From there I had the chopped salad, which I've been dreaming about ever since. I opted for mine with chicken instead of smoked salmon (looking out for the little guy). It's the best salad I've ever had and I bet it's even better with salmon.  I ordered scallops for my main entree and they were delish, but I was too full to eat more than 1 (it comes with 30). Somehow I made room for a few bites of the variety of heavenly desserts Gary brought out to our table to end our oh so fabulous meal.  Guess where I'll be eating during my next trip to Scottsdale? Yep, Citizen House...and hopefully by then I'll be able to indulge in those cocktails everyone is yelping about!"}
{"text":"Came back from Texas for their infamous chop salad.  We were not disappointed and it was better than the last time!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and drink combos, service was excellent! We sat at the bar and had a great experience, highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"Love this place. Cocktails are fantastic, innovative and great bartenders. The food is incredible. I finally tried the chopped salad (famous and on Facebook). The salad has smoked salmon, Israeli cous cous, arugula, tomatoes, sun dried cor, pistachios, almonds in a buttermilk pesto dressing. I have been thinking about it ever since. I had the butternut squash chowder, which is not like most butternut squash chowders. Think bacon, squash, corn, chicken broth. Yummy. Food is delicious every time."}
{"text":"Upon walking into Citizen's PH, we were greeted warmly by the hostess. Once seated, we were promptly approached by our server, Gib, who was personable and helpful in his suggestions from the menu. After enjoying our mouth watering app of Pork Bell Pastrami, melt in your mouth Filet and the best damn Chopped Salad with Salomon I've ever had, Gib escorted us to the very hip and chill Mixology Lounge, upstairs. I highly suggest enjoying 'dessert' AKA: cocktails, where an amazing Mixologist will perform his magic in whipping up a delectable spirit.  We enjoyed sitting around the fireplace, enjoying our cocktails, and interacting with the Mixologist and his staff, who mingled with us. A rare find in top notch service, food and ambiance."}
{"text":"WOW!!!! One of the most creative and delicious dining experiences in years!   My wife and I were traveling, and had had a kind of meh day.....I read some of the reviews for this place -- and was intrigued by the menu. What a creative master chef.....Everything was delicious -- fabulous!  It was the kind of place that made me very sorry to have just the one night in town, because I would have loved the opportunity to come back again and again -- the menu was full of irresistible things that I just couldn't sample.  If you're in Scottsdale for the night or live there full-time but haven't yet tried this place -- go!  It's really one of the most creatively designed eating experiences I've ever had."}
{"text":"4.5 stars  While in Scottsdale for work, I came across Citizen Public House. Good food, good drinks and good times. All of these are true. Tom, our bartender, for most of the night, as we sat at the bar was incredibly friendly. After hearing it was our first time, he tossed us some free bacon popcorn (popcorn with bacon lardons on top). The drinks here are top notch. At happy hour (4-6) you can get half price beers and half price on many cocktails. They have a bunch of house aged cocktails which are killer.  The food here is not to be missed. The chicken, yes, i said the Chicken, is great. Sure, most restaurants have chicken on the menu as their throw away dish, not here. Here they braise the breast in buttermilk and serve it will Brussels Sprouts and a sweet corn and butter bean succotash. I also tasted the house made pork belly pastrami. Everything here is great, and the bartenders are all friendly.  If you are here for business or pleasure, you want to stop at citizen public house."}
{"text":"Everything was fantastic from beginning to end.  The servers, the food, the atmosphere.  Highly recommend the chop salad & the short ribs."}
{"text":"Chopped salad and pastrami were the best things I tasted on their menu so far. The crab cakes are good, typical, but good. The truffled grilled cheese was lacking in the truffle area like almost nonexistent and the  veggies that came with the grilled cheese were tasteless, and the accompanying salad was boring in comparison to the full flavors of the chopped salad.  Recommendations: - chopped salad - pastrami"}
{"text":"YUM. That really sums it up. we went here last night after having received a gift certificate for a wedding gift. We were so impressed with the food, and my husband actually uttered the words, \"I don't want this to end.\" We started with sangria and fondue which were both fantastic. My entree was the smart chicken and hubs had the pork tenderloin. Both  were unbelievably good and our server was wonderful. It's rare to have all the components of a nice meal come together so perfectly, and this is definitely worth the money!"}
{"text":"Citizen was recommended by multiple people. ......plus Yelp had it rated very high......so Citizen it was...... we sat at the bar and Brendan was our server......he was very helpful with recommendations.......we made it there for happy hour and so we tried the hummus and pita plate......this was very good......then came the very highly acclaimed chopped salad. ......not expecting this.......it was totally different then anything I ever had........it was excellent. .......so far Brendan was 2 for 2......then came the scallops........they were excellently. ......a great choice......it must say......the service was excellent....the food was excellent and our total experience was excellent. .....it f you want to recommend a nice place with quality this is the place......good job Brendan......."}
{"text":"Nothing wrong with this place. Just nothing special about it either. Another upscale casual Scottsdale bar that won't make it out of it's 3rd year. I remember it being more of a 3 star pricing, not 2 as listed on yelp."}
{"text":"My husband Matt B. and I met our friend Stef P. for dinner one night in Scottsdale, at Citizen Public House. We'd just flown into town and were looking forward to an easy gastropub dinner. The place was not at all what we expected. It was less gastropub than full-on upscale sit-down restaurant, with entrees creeping into the $30 range. Thankfully, we ended up loving the place.  Citizen Public House is in cozy Old Town Scottsdale, and it was vibrant and charming on a Friday night. We had a late reservation (9:15) and the place was still pretty busy. I liked the atmosphere--it was nice, but informal. We hadn't seen Stef in four years, and had a great time catching up over dinner. Service was excellent. Our waiter Brad was on top of his game.  We had a couple rounds of drinks, and I really enjoyed the cocktails. The Im-Port was particularly good, a smokey drink made with Jameson, Tawny Port, tobacco bitters, and Guinness foam, served on the rocks with a smoked sugar rim. The Thai Margarita was pleasant, too, a mix of Patron silver with galangal and kaffir lime simple syrup, tamarind reduction, Thai chili sea salt, basil, and lime, served on the rocks. It tasted more like a straight margarita than I thought it would, but I liked it. I also had a sample of the barrel-aged Craftsman, made with Jameson, Cocchi Americano, and Charbay green tea apertif. (Brad brought it over because I was waffling between the Im-Port and the Craftsman, and he gave me a free taste after I'd already decided on the Im-Port.) It was pretty great, smooth and boozy with a definite sweetness. Probably would've gotten it if I wanted a third drink. Matt tried one of the other barrel-aged cocktails, the Boulvardier [sic?] made with Maker's 46 bourbon, Campari, and sweet vermouth. Another solid drink.  The food was fantastic. The three of us shared the pork belly pastrami and an order of Bernie's mac 'n cheese, which worked as both appetizer and side. The pork belly pastrami seems to be Citizen Public House's signature dish, and it's a great one. Pork belly came pastrami-cured and spiced, with rye spaetzle, brussels sprout sauerkraut, and mustard jus. The pork was juicy, fatty, and intensely flavorful, and I loved all of the sides. It wouldn't be right to come here without trying this dish. The mac 'n cheese was also delicious, made with curly cavatappi pasta in a gorgonzola and emmental cheese sauce, with a chilled tomato relish on top. The pasta was cooked al dente and I loved the sharp cheeses and the spicy tomato relish. The portion was huge. We split it three ways and still had leftovers.  I had the pan-seared scallops for my entree, while Matt and Stef had the fair trade short ribs. Both were excellent. The scallops were plump and beautifully cooked, served with Hampshire belly bacon, roasted corn grits, wilted snow pea greens, and a cola gastrique. There was so much great flavor and texture on this plate. It was exactly what I wanted. The short ribs were another winner, a giant plate of tender coffee-rubbed ribs with dried cherry BBQ sauce, roasted parsnip puree, and seasonal vegetables.  We ended up spending more than we meant to at Citizen Public House, but we were on vacation and had a truly lovely meal. I'd recommend this place for a nice dinner out in Scottsdale, to locals and tourists alike."}
{"text":"I stopped in after work to check it out since I've heard sooo much about it.  The happy hour menu offers many affordable choices. So I started off with the cocktail of the day which was $6. I'm definitely not a professional at happy hour so the drink was very strong for me.  I sent it back in exchange for a glass of cab. Sometimes you have to stick with what you know.  Bartenders are very into their cocktails which seems intimating a bit to me.  If you want a great cocktail then this your place!"}
{"text":"I have gone here 3 times during my work trip to Phoenix.    The first night, started with the Original Chopped Salad, followed by the Filet Mignon, and finished with Strawberry Poundcake.  Salad was very good with a great pallet of different flavors.  The steak was perfectly cooked and paired with the potatoes and greens was phenomenal.  The poundcake was ok... nothing too special.  The second night, I started again with the Original Chopped Salad, followed by the Wagyu burger.  Once again, the salad satisfied my craving created after I had it the first night.  The wagyu burger was cooked as perfectly as the steak.  The fries were fresh with a slight crisp.  The third time I went was during lunch.  Again, decided to get the Chopped Salad.  Shared the crabcakes with a buddy.  And had the Wagyu burger again.  The salad again was great.  Crabcakes are a bit on rich side for my taste.  The wagyu burger was awesome.  The fries were a bit stale.  All in all, great restaurant and would definitely go back.    Recommend: The Original Chopped Salad, Filet Mignon, and Wagyu burger."}
{"text":"CPH for short has always delivered an exceptional dining experience from beginning to end.  This visit I strayed from the norm- the must try Scallops that are 4 huge scallops with a side of corn grits (yes it works trust me), some greens and what gives it that pop or taste is the homemade cola reduction that is drizzled on.  This is by far one of my top scallop dishes ever tasted.  But for this evening, we (the fiancee) got there early and took advantage of the happy hour.  The rosemary salted nuts where good and flavor was great.  Order the fondue which came with a nice side of break and some jerky.  Cheese was great and didn't become to hot like some places that have to much heat underneath the cheese.  Final appetizer was the pork belly pastrami.  Again, nailed it with layers of flavor, even from the slight hint of mustard at the end.  Not to mention a very tender pork belly.  Next the chopped salad which I've had at least 5 times.  Won't go into detail but the ingredients are so different they have their own Facebook page!   Entrees for me was the Fair Trade Short Ribs and my significant other just had the macaroni and cheese side.  Short Ribs where good, maybe 30 seconds less on the cooking for me- which is a personal preference.  I'm not a fan of parsnip puree, but the texture and flavor was great.  My significant other's mac and cheese was huge.  Lots of cheese flavor and lots of noodles.  For me it needed a \"pop\" of something but I can't place it.    Last, but not least, they do know how to serve a decent cocktail.  I've complained before how restaurants want to charge but not deliver, but CPH gives a real drink with real flavors.  Try their Manhattan if you like whiskey and you'll be sure to love house made bitters with the orange and cherry twist.  My fiancee had the Mia Margarita which had some nice hints of lemon and lime with a surprise salt rim that had a smokey taste."}
{"text":"I would have given it 5 Stars because of the food; however, we would never go back there due to the incredible noise level because they have so many tables packed in to the rather small space. Also, the place is so good, and the food is also, that it is busy busy busy.  We all enjoyed the food, but we couldn't enjoy our out of town company because of the noise level and zero noise abatement features."}
{"text":"GREAT food and great ambiance  had the chopped salad and buttermilk chicken.  super yummy.  will be coming back!"}
{"text":"If you passed Citizen by because of the \"meh\" exterior, then great! More for meeeeeeeeee! The drab atmosphere is easily forgotten once you've experienced an amazing meal from start to finish.   If you're waiting at the bar for a table, don't miss the opportunity to have the bacon popcorn with your cocktail. Yes! I said it. BACON POPCORN! With real bacon.   Be prepared for a wait Thursday-Saturday.   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Very loud atmosphere and can't hear each other talk. Food portions pitiful. I had the trout which they expected you to eat the skin. My friend had the chicken and said it was salty. Two people had the scallops, one person had ossu buco and one had the meatloaf. All were acceptable. We all agreed we won't be back not worth the money."}
{"text":"I must say I am pleasantly surprised at the quality of food here at Citizen Public as well as the service! The food came out quickly and was extremely fresh. The drinks are yummy, the atmosphere relaxing. So happy we gave this a try!"}
{"text":"Great meal! Fancy place but very kid friendly. They had crayons for the kids to use on the paper table cloth and offers great options.  Mac and cheese has the fondue cheese used for it. Scallops-out of this world-if you're a scallop fan-you will definitely enjoy. Best item on the menu was the chopped salad. So popular of an item that they have a recipe card they hand out when asked. Freeze dried corn, cactus veggie, oh it was divine. Even non salad eaters will enjoy. Huge portions of pasta-FYI."}
{"text":"Great selection of healthy food choices and the service was pretty good! I wish our server had more knowledge about the wines on the menu.  Cute location and atmosphere, too!"}
{"text":"I came here as part of a large party (approximately 50 people).  The restaurant was convenient to the hotel.  It was nicely decorated but he space was VERY loud.  I can't stand this in restaurants.  Especially if one is conducting business.    The servers were very accommodating.  I enjoyed their hospitality.  They brought out a perfect Guinness.  They were always ready with refills and suggestions.  We were provided with some very good bruschetta and even better chicken pesto kabobs while we waited for the entres.  But here is the rub.  We had a limited menu with 5 selections.  It took almost 90 minutes to get our food.  They had several other parties.  I do not know why they did not have additional staff.  But this is pretty inexcusable.    I will say that the scallops were exquisite!  They melted in your mouth.  The corn grits were also delicious although there could have been more grits on the plate.  Come on folks grits are $2 for a tractor trailer load.  How about an adult 3/4 cup portion?    Finally, they had some unidentified green on the scallops.  It did nothing for the meal except remind me of baling hay in high school.  This did remind me that I went to school to pay prices like these!?!"}
{"text":"We came back for dinner on Friday evening and it was everything I hoped it would be.   If you're an alcoholic...err... \"alcohol aficionado\", this is the place for you.  They offer barrel aged cocktails which is a truly unique experience.  They're a bit spendy at regular price but if you go during \"Social Hour\", they're half price and a steal (note to CPH: I appreciate not being forced to be happy.  Thanks for validating the preferences of pissy people everywhere.)  The term \"craft cocktails\" is starting to go the way of  sun-dried tomatoes (sad and overused), but currently there isn't a better description and this is definitely a destination for a twist on the sauce.  If my husband were granted full access to their bar and nifty ingredients, I might never see him again.  (But granted, it's been a good run.)    We ordered the mac n' cheese, chicken and waffle, and crab cakes for appetizers.  All were fantastic.  I thought the chicken and waffle was a strange offering but an app but it works.  For din-din, our table had the short ribs, filet, duck, and meatloaf.  Six loud tipsy people were quiet for maybe an entire minute which should tell you something.  Desserts were an exercise in competitive eating but we managed.  Our table had the pumpkin bread pudding, apple pie and dream pudding.  YUM.  We then accomplished a gastronomic feat by indulging in their house-made egg nog.  It was a thick, creamy, delicious glass of shame.        The service was fantastic.  Our waiter was friendly, funny and engaging.  They did a wonderful job of taking care of us without hovering.    I'm not the biggest fan of Old Town thanks to the douche bag/Ax factor but this is definitely a compelling reason to make my way through guys in too tight t-shirts who say \"dude\" excessively."}
{"text":"Went here with friend- dinner was excellent service was exceptional- would recommend- good looking crowd"}
{"text":"First experience was for Restaurant week 2011, been back for Yelp Eats week and then back again. Comfortable atmosphere and great wait staff. I even have the same chandelier lighting that is over their bar in my home. Will be visiting again soon.  Love the Original Chopped Salad and the Mirliton Chopped salad a close second which is a bit more on the refreshing side. The sausage of the day has been a good choice.  The seared scallops can be done to your liking, mine request is rare and they do it  to perfection. I have asked my pork \"not too done\" and it comes lightly pink, just the way I like it.    Finish it off with a very rich and dense Irish Coffee Pot de Crème. Wish they would serve it in a less \"vertical\" glass so I can get the Irish whiskey, coffee crema and chocolate easily in a single spoonful."}
{"text":"Love the food, bartenders are top notch, atmosphere is fun."}
{"text":"I went here the other night with a friend of mine and we both agreed it was okay. We both got the chicken and it was good but it was anything out of the ordinary and for 20 dollars for a piece of chicken I guess we were expecting more.The service was good but we just weren't really impressed as we thought we would be."}
{"text":"Bacon popcorn, short ribs and our waiter Sam were all phenomenal. Drink pours were light."}
{"text":"Would it be rude or pretentious of me to admit that I wouldn't find great food and cocktails in Scottsdale? Well, mea culpa. I honestly didn't expect much out of this city when it comes to comestibles. But Citizen Public House surprised me on all levels.   The cocktails here are crazy good. They even have a little 'speakeasy'-ish mixology lab upstairs that's all secret and only accessible by... wait... can I tell? Anyway, these folks are making some interesting drinks with house-made infusions, tinctures, and various chemistry equipment. Better than the best drinks in PDX? I don't know about that, but impressive all the same.   The food is a very big surprise for me. The chop chop salad is, from what I understand, legendary, and from tasting it I am not surprised. I also sampled some tasty meatloaf and delicious scallops. The fact that I can't recall the dessert doesn't mean it wasn't memorable, I think it had to do with my focus on the drinks and mains. I recall everyone at the table enjoying them.   Service? Impeccable. 'Nuff said.   Consider me a little humbled."}
{"text":"Got the cuban sandwich.... Nothing to right home about. Neat location.. And server was good. Chop salad is same as cowboy chow."}
{"text":"What we ate:  Bacon fat popcorn - yummy  Gorgonzola Mac and Cheese - yummy BLT of the day - glad we split this, it was good but super rich  At this point I wish there would have been a small palate cleanser offered, the food is so rich and something small and light would have helped me decide to order more.  Instead I ordered the chopped salad and I was happy with it, though would have ordered a main course instead if something small and light would have been offered.    The rest of our party ordered main course's and I tried all of them, the roasted parsnip puree was awesome and so were the scallops.  The BBQ dipping sauce for the short ribs was very heavy and the short ribs were better without it.    The service was great, we had a reservation and were seated right on time.  The drinks were great and inventive.   I probably won't return to have a full dinner here, but drinks and the popcorn for sure, maybe a happy hour."}
{"text":"Citizens public is a really chic place, especially on a fri or sat night before going out. I love the indoor / outdoor feel created by the large doors at the front of the building. Interior decor is classic fine dining elegance with minimalist qualities. R and D is the upstairs speakeasy joint, you should definitely check that out as well, after dinner. Be sure to check with the host on getting up to R and D as that part can be tricky. When I first went to Cit pub almost a year ago I was enticed by their Moscow Mule served traditionally in a copper cup, with a garnishing of a sugar sucker. It's a very good mule. I tried the chop salad and while all my girlfriends die over it, it's not my thing. I didn't enjoy the separation of flavors and didn't overall like the ingredient mix, but I'm sort of particular so I encourage you to try that salad for yourself. It's pretty famous. I had the chicken entree which has a delicious sauce, was not dry, and had a lovely hash type bean and brussel sprout thing on the bottom of the plate. It was amazing, definitely a step up from not loving the salad last time. I paired it with their better rose available by the glass. Wonderful meal and highly recommend eating at this restaurant soon."}
{"text":"This is a terrific place!  It has every single thing going on.  Cool environment, great atmosphere, some serious mixologists behind the bar making fantastic cocktails and truly great food.  It's a \"happening\" place, with a welcoming atmosphere.  If you haven't been, you should go."}
{"text":"As first I was skeptical... But mad I haven't been a fan longer!  Chopped salad, pastrami pork belly, kilt lifter fondue and scallops what was for dinner!  I don't even like scallops and I thought they were okay! My fiancé sure did love them, he said the best he has had since City Hall. The chopped salad is a must do-- see my tip!!   AJ was our sever and he had his hands full of tables. He must be the most friendliest server I have had. He was very engaging with us and the rest of his tables. He even sent us home with a dessert! I know I will request him next time we dine here.  I love the lighting in this restaurant too , very romantic and calm.  Great place !"}
{"text":"Everything we had there was excellent and reminded me of Austin: the pork belly pastrami, the beef short ribs, the smoked duck, my Arizona Mule cocktail. It is definitely a lively, noisy atmosphere, but it has a good crowd."}
{"text":"Yes! I love walking into a place like this and feeling my bougie self get juiced up. Service was good. Great bar snacks and plenty of drink options during social hour, although I wish they used less gin and vermouth.  They may have had the best roasted nuts I ever had.  I already had dinner plans and didn't order an entree so I can't speak much about the actual food.  I did take a bite of my friend's cobb salad and it was pretty darn good, even though it reminded me of the smoked salmon salad at LGO.  I wish I got out of work earlier to catch their happy hour more frequently."}
{"text":"I just keep coming back for their Chopped Salad. I always come back with the intent to get something different..but the chopped salad!! It's so good!"}
{"text":"I had the Crispy Steelhead, and it was delicious! The sweet pea risotto and roasted tomato-chanterelle ragout were a great addition. If you're looking for a great restaurant with an original menu, this is the place to go! Friendly staff and they were quick to seat us."}
{"text":"Service is always spot on, My go to in old town!  The chopped salad and meatloaf are insanely delicious! Service is great n a fun crowd"}
{"text":"My favorite place to dine in Phoenix. The staff is exceptional and the OMFG Salad is worthy of its distinction."}
{"text":"Although my fiancé and I only stop by this place for some desserts and drinks, it was tasty and the ambiance is chic. We decided to stop by here because of the high yelp reviews that we had to try it and be able to say \"we've been here and tried it.\"  Well, I'm glad we did!  Even though we sat at the bar, our service with our bartender was superb.  He was able to make some fancy mixology cocktail for my fiancé and I.  He also sold us on their dessert menu.  We end up getting the soufflé which our bartender recommended.  As always, soufflé takes awhile to make but it was worth the wait.  It was made just right because watching Master Chef educated me how and what makes a soufflé go wrong. It was nice and crisp on top and the inside wasn't too mushy.  When I'm back in town, I'll definitely try out their entree menu."}
{"text":"My review is only for the bar and drinks!   My girlfriend and I came here upon hearing that they serve Irish Coffee. We recently visited San Francisco and had Irish Coffee at the Buena Vista Social Club and wanted to relive that amazing night.   The Irish Coffee here of course wasn't as good as SF but it was very good! The bartender was very friendly. The drinks were pretty steep at $10 each but they are meant to enjoy at a leisurely pace."}
{"text":"Highly recommend the chopped salad! It is to die for. Also their soups are heavenly. Has a great atmosphere and the servers are all super friendly."}
{"text":"Ok. Good not great. We had reservations and we were seated quickly. My scallops were decent, but the fondu was just ok and the salads were very average. I have no problem paying for good food, but it was a bit expensive for a mediocre experience."}
{"text":"Ok so I really wanted to love this place. Service was great. Chopped salad was a little weird but ok. The food was overall prepared well, just not to our liking. Unfortunately no one in our party was a fan of the food."}
{"text":"Dined in March, 2013 for a late dinner/pre-drink snack w/ friends. Ordered 2 apps, salad, and one entree, w/ good but not extravagant wine; out the door for apx $100. I could see noise becoming a potential problem with its layout. Service was very attentive, informative and friendly. the pork belly pastrami and applewood smoked duck were both A+++; chopped salad A-/B+; crab cakes were not remarkable. I will absolutely return to this restaurant w/ very high expectations next time i'm in the phoenix area."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday night around 10pm. We were on the waiting list so we went to the bar for some drinks and noticed that there were at least 2 table in front of us that were clean and empty. Waited for a bit and asked hostess why we weren't being seated when there were tables available. They seated us right away thereafter.   We ordered family style - mac n cheese, pork belly pastrami, chicken & waffles, crab cakes, and bacon popcorn. Food was great. Loved the cheese they used for the mac n cheese; pork belly pastrami I wasn't even look at on the menu but tasted it and it literally melts in your mouth; the breading on the chicken was unique (in a good way, not your typical breading) and the waffles and syrup with some kind of nuts on top that was delish; bacon popcorn i didn't see what the big deal was but then again I don't get the whole bacon craze but all the guys devoured it at the table.  Tried 3 different cocktails all with a unique taste, all excellent. Bartender isn't too attentive, it was hard to get his attention may be because I wasn't sitting at the bar? But it wasn't like he was busy or anyone else was asking for drinks so no bueno on that.  I asked the server (2 because they switched on us in the beginning) to bring out bread because I was starving and the menu said you had to ask for it. The bread didn't come out until after the food, major disappointment.  Overall I can't say much for the service but the cocktails and food are good enough for me to want to come back which says a lot about the eats. Everyone was friendly but may cause I came at the end on a Saturday they were tired? Anyways, worth checking out and definitely order family style."}
{"text":"This was definitely the best meal of this year's holiday trip....  The Kale Caesar! is a very creative interpretation of the timeless classic.  We loved the melted Scamorza cheese.    I had the Applewood Smoked Duck for my entree, accompanied by a glass of the Siduri pinot from Willamette.  The wine was perfect with the cherry sauce, besides the fact that pinot is a classic pairing with duck.  A glass of Siduri for $12 is a great deal, too.  I loved the way the duck was prepared, too, and it did not weigh me down afterwards like duck often can, either.  My wife had the buttermilk roasted chicken along with a glass of their creative (and delicious) interpretation of sangria.  Roasted Brussels sprouts and sweet corn are part of the presentation.    Dessert was the decadent Dream Pudding Jar.  We always get excited about an original dessert dish, and this one did not disappoint.  Service was top notch all the way, also."}
{"text":"Up all night sweating and with stomach pain after visiting last night. Will never go back."}
{"text":"This is a classic Old Town staple. I frequently come here and enjoy the Stetson chopped salad. Seriously this chopped salad is worth coming to Phoenix for alone. Two other restaurants, The Gladly and Cowboy Ciao, also serve the same salad. However, The Gladly and Cowboy Ciao do not have the same menu items.  One of the best items on the Citizen Public House menu are the crab cakes. They're a bit pricy, but what crab cake isn't? It's one of the crab cakes that has a solid amount of crab in it which you rarely find anymore with restaurants trying to keep food costs down.  I have been coming here for years and the menu has recently changed. The staples have remained, but the drink menu has a few new options that are all fantastic. There is a rum drink on the menu that is extremely strong, and extremely tasty. A few of those and you won't remember the dinner conversation! Definitely one of the best Phoenix restaurants with fantastic service and knowledgeable wait staff."}
{"text":"I'd give them five stars for the Original Chopped alone, but their great service and other tasty menu items, in addition to an impressive drink list only make it better."}
{"text":"Great ambiance! All the staff was very friendly and helpful. We had the pan seared scallops and the filet, both were amazing. Everything was delicious!"}
{"text":"Excellent!!!  We went with the recommendation of our waiter-  chopped salad & scallops.  Wonderful explosion of flavor.  It's definitely a place I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere no the patio and food is a solid 4*"}
{"text":"We had an amazing experience here! The server was knowledgeable, friendly and professional, and the drinks and food were fabulous!! The chopped salad was unique and incredibly delicious!! The pork belly pastrami was unbelievable, as was the dessert! highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Cornish game hen. It was very tender but did not have a lot of flavor. My companion had the short ribs. It was tender and flavorful. The accompanying kale was also very well done. For dessert, we had heart of caramel. The cake was very rich. Good for sharing. The Arnold Palmers were tart, different from any others I've had. Service was good. I would eat here again."}
{"text":"Outstanding. Service was fantastic. The original chopped salad was amazing. #micdrop #yum #orderit"}
{"text":"Just to throw my voice in with the choir: this place is awesome.  Yelp helped me find this restaurant, and I had an absolutely decadent time.  Everything was on point for my visit.  Service was attentive, fast, and polite.  The food was fantastic.  The cocktails were some of my favorite I've had in a long time.  The place was full of people even for it being a Wednesday night.  I highly recommend the food and cocktail that I enjoyed during my visit.  The End of the World gin cocktail was refreshing and intoxicating.  The beef short ribs were incredibly tender and rich.  My friend's scallops were perfect.  Just go.  The place is great."}
{"text":"Loved it. We shared a ton of dishes. Started with the fondue, fantastic. The sausage, pear and bread all blended well together with the cheese. The chop salad, pork belly pastrami, spam cubano, roasted acorn squash with chorizo were all fantastic. I recommend the Pinot Grigio, not expensive and was fresh and crisp. Then for dessert we had the dude jar, which was good, but rich. By far the superior dessert was the heart of caramel. Bradley made sure that the service was spot on. The ambiance and the music were great. Ridonkulous!"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff and excellent service. Food was amazingly good. Starter portion was small (crab cake) but extremely good! Main course portion size was good and filling."}
{"text":"Had dinner here and our waiter Sam was by far the most fabulous guy and they are so lucky to have him as an employee. He went above and beyond and made our last dinner in Scottsdale so memorable! Congrats to Sam on his promotion! Well deserved!!!! The food was excellent and definitely order the salad it was delic!!!"}
{"text":"Had a lovely time here trying some of the best cocktails I've ever had. Didn't try the food, though I plan to next time. Keeping to the bar, I had several drinks that were all winners. The bartender was attentive and made my drinks with just the right amount of flair. As far as I could tell, the staff were all very professional, but my particular bartender, Will, has clearly practiced to the point of perfection and has a natural gift for making unforgettable drinks."}
{"text":"The chopped salad was off the charts amazing, a must order. I also had the short rib which I really enjoyed. Our waiter also made great wine selections."}
{"text":"Dark, noisy, overpriced, weak customer service. We ( two couples) had dinner here tonight for the first time. An appetizer of fondue-curdled cheese, lots of bread. Weak. An appetizer of Capprresse- decent,  Two entrees - chicken and sprouts, poor plating, bare-looking, weak. The other was a lamb burger- plain, tasteless, frozen French fries. Weak. Customer service- the worst. Long periods of time between visits from server. Empty glasses, empty table, no food, weak. Scottsdale, this is typical of your dining options, all show no substance. I will not be eating at this place again."}
{"text":"We had a delicious meal. The Original Chopped Sald was so good we shared it as a starter and then I ordered it for my entree. My husband had the Pork Belly Pastrami and it was so good. Our server was Gina and she wS so sweet and personable. We had a drink at the bar before dinner and loved Will the bartender. Two big ."}
{"text":"This review is for my second trip to CPH.  It was a special family affair that brought us back.  We were celebrating joint 50th Birthdays with our two children.  We arrived prior to 6 Pm and were able to order some of the reduced Happy hour drinks and bar appetisers.  I good value.    I did order one of the barrel drinks for $5.  It was ok, and for a few bucks more, i would have preferred my regular gin and tonic. Too much flavor and spice in the barrel drinks for me palette.  We had the bacon popcorn and fondue as bar appetiserrs, both excellent.    For entrees we had the meatloaf, the scallops, the black cherry roasted short ribs and I had the grilled cheese.  There were also all wonderful.  Well prepared and presented.  Our waiter was suberp and it made for a ncie evening.  Noise level was not so bad until the place started hopping around 8 PM.  Then the noise level was a bit much for us old fuddy duddities."}
{"text":"We came for happy hour/dinner and were glad we did. The less expensive wines drop to $5 during happy hour. We had some. Others had ice tea and Arnold Palmer.  We had olives and bacon popcorn snacks.  Three had a lamb burger which was good but not great.  I had a mortadella slider and it was good. The kennebec fries with the burgers tasted good but were very chewy. The almond and bacon brittle wasn't bad but difficult to eat after dinner. Service was very good. we will want to try it again."}
{"text":"Very impressed all around with the service, ambience and food. Our server was spot on and you can tell this crew is well trained to make your dining experience vey enjoyable."}
{"text":"Citizen Public House is awesome! I've been here twice now, and am wondering why I don't go more often. The food, drinks, & service is impeccable, and the ambiance is great.  Here's the breakdown of what I've tried so far: - bacon popcorn: you really can't go wrong with popcorn cooked in bacon fat and bacon pieces - chopped salad: this salad has it's own facebook page for a reason, I had a sample of this at an event and that is what brought me here to begin with. https://www.facebook.com/TheOriginalChoppedSalad?fref=ts - watermelon & halloumi salad: marinated sweet watermelon chunks with tangy halloumi, so good - pork belly pastrami: simple but so flavorful - burrata: creamy goodness, fresh ingredients, you can't not like this - scallops: generously sized scallops with bacon, cooked perfectly - rockfish: served with a mild curry sauce, also cooked perfectly, also a generous portion I would highly recommend Citizen as it's one of my favorite Phoenix restaurants!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food & service, loved the ambiance. We'll be back again next year for Spring Training."}
{"text":"Pork Belly Pastrami - excellent Chopped Salad - unique Smoked Duck Breast - delicious Bread Pudding - fantastic  Excellent all around."}
{"text":"This was a pick for a girls night out.  I ordered the pan seared scallops and they were phenomenal.  Their \"Persian 9\" specialty cocktail is crazy good.  I'm glad I was with a group who like to share plates.  It allowed for a nice sampling of the menu.  The friendly staff and great service along with the fabulous food make this a place I recommend with confidence."}
{"text":"I had a confirmed reservation but unfortunately made it (via Yelp) for Wednesday and had intended for Tuesday. When we walked in on Tuesday in March at 6pm there was only 1 table that was occupied by patrons (the place was empty) and the hostess was very rude...she said that she wasn't sure if she could accommodate the 4 of us. Screw her, we left and went to the Herb Box."}
{"text":"Always a favorite spot when I'm in town. Meatloaf is one of the most unique dishes and boy is it a treat! Happy hour specials are solid. Service is top-notch. If you are in the area, don't hesitate to come by and every seat in the house is good!"}
{"text":"Always have the best experience when I eat here. For some reason Gary is always my server but he's fantastic! He always makes wonderful recommendation when I can't figure out to eat. Can't go wrong with anything..."}
{"text":"CPH is amazing! We have never had a bad meal there.  We have tried a few of their salads, including the Chopped, Fernet Steak, and local field greens, all if which were good.  We also tried the Pork Belly Pastrami appetizer, which they have received numerous reviews on, and it was delicious.  My husband LOVES the short ribs in the coffee rub.  My absolute favorite is the scallops.  They are fresh and cooked properly, and are paired with some wilted greens, corn grits and a cola gastrique sauce.  The whole combination is amazing!  We are normally stuffed, so have only tried dessert once, but it was incredible as well.  We ordered the apple pie in a cheddar cheese crust, and it was by far the best apple pie I have ever tried.  We love Citizen Public House and will continue to call it one of our favorite restaurants in the Phoenix area!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! I was working out of town in Phoenix recently and visited here on a whim on a Sunday evening - wonderful wine on the happy hour list, impecable service - I sat at the bar and there were amazing bartenders, and the scallops were to die for! I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Service was great, food was awesome!  Yelp is right.  Definitely try the pork belly pastrami ($12) and the Citizen chopped salad ($12).  The pan-seared scallops were also winners ($24).  The cask cocktails are also amazing. So smooth.  The Manhattan ($11) was amazing.  The flavors definitely mellowed in the cask and gave it a unique flavor as well.  And don't miss the bread pudding!  Yum! $10 and worth every penny!  Plus one of the only places in downtown Scottsdale that's open past 10pm.  Score!"}
{"text":"I have Mixed feelings on Citizen Public House. I truly want to love it more than I do and because if that I've been here about 3 different times. I almost wish I could write two seperate reviews. If I were writing this simply on the drinks the service and the atmosphere I would give them a solid 5 stars. I just feel like for me, the food is a hit or miss.   The first time I came in was for my boyfriends birthday. We eat out almost every meal and were so excited to try Citizens public house. I had called before hand to make the reservation and they seated us in a great location.  The service was top notch. I dont remember our servers name but he was fantastic. We ordered three smaller plates to share and every thing was just ok.   The Chop Salad: Our server told us we had to try it. This is something that they are known for. We both thought it was good but not overly fantastic. I honestly expected more. Presentation wise it was really pretty  The Kilt Lifter Fondue: So-So once again not overly impressed. The idea of fondue is fun but i wanted just a little more.   The Truffle Grilled Cheese: They honestly need to take this off the menu. It is aweful. It tasted like someone just put a huge mass of potatos on bread and called it a day. DO NOT ORDER THIS.    PB&B Pudding jar: Yum im a fan. Im a sucker for anything with caramel and bannana and this hit the spot.   I dont remember the drinks we ordered but they were all great. They know what there doing behind the bar.   We left that night a little dissapointed. I still left the server a great tip because he was awesome and deserved it but I wish the food had reflected the service.   Ok So now for EXPERIENCE #2:  I came in with a girlfriend for restraunt week and had a Fantastic time. We were seated in the same great place as before. Our server this time wasnt as great as the guy Id had before but he was a gem. They have somewhat of a pr-eset menu for restraunt week so heres what we ordered:   Squash soup: Not always on the menu. It was a little bland but over all good. Its hard to make butternut squash soup pop. I was happy.   The Pan Seared Scallops: OH MY GOSH YUM. These scallops are fantastic!!! The corn grits they are served on are to die for and the cola gastrique is Awesome. This dish is killer and I would come back for them. I even ordered them at thei sister restaurant the gladly.   Amaro Meatloaf: The meatloaf was huge!! I only tasted one bite because it was my friends but she loved it and the bite I took was great as well. Tasted as good as moms meatloaf!! The only quam we had with this was My friend had asked to switch the veggies it was served with and our waiter just  flat out said no. She could have at least asked the kitchen for us.  PB&B Bread Pudding: I feel like it was different than the first time id had it. Maybe not in a jar? Still good though!!  Now for the drinks: The Sangria here is the Bomb. I dont know what they put in it but man is it good. I also love the Citi-zen cocktail. So Yummy! and they put a rock candy stir stick on top which is so cute!!!  Iv'e also been in before just to sit at the bar for drinks no food and the experiances are always good. Like I said before the guys behind the bar know their stuff.  Alright so I have mixed feelings, One Blah experience and one great experience. Im conviced that the main courses here are all awesome and we just oredered the wrong items the first time so I still reccomend this place to people. I really Want To love Citizen Public and there are parts of it that I do."}
{"text":"Everything that we ate here was delicious. I started off with the the pork belly pastrami and it was delicious. For the main meal i got was the lamb burger and it was insanely good. Never had a burger like that. It was gamey but tender. For dessert i got the bread pudding. I licked the plate clean. Everything at the restaurant is great. I would recommend this place to all."}
{"text":"Wow this place is incredible.  We had 3 courses and drinks.  Meatloaf and pork shank was cooked perfectly and tasted amazing.  The \"bar snacks\" and starters were extraordinary and bursting with flavor.  Go to this restaurant- you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"The original chopped salad is as good as people have made it out to be! It was simply fantastic especially with the presentation and all the ingredients of the salad blended very well together. I can definitely see why this is their most popular dish. The pork belly pastrami was very good as well and probably my second favorite after the chopped salad. Lastly, the chicken fried duck leg was not bad but compared to the other options I thought it was just OK.  I missed out on the happy hour unfortunately and didn't get any drinks on my first visit, however seeing as how I enjoyed the appetizers here I plan on making a return visit here to try out their drinks and of course to get the chopped salad again."}
{"text":"Had dinner there Thursday night. The food was good but the noise level was unbelievable.  Strongly suggest that you sit outside. I was literally yelling across the table to try and have a conversation.  In the end we gave up trying to talk.   Our meals were a contrast in extremes. I ordered the duck  burger and my husband ordered the game hen.   The server warned that my meal was going to be large. He should have warned that the Cornish game hen meal was super small.    The Cornish game hen was described by my husband as \"fine\".  I on the other hand thought my duck burger was seriously tasty. I wisely halved my burger before I started eating it.   I was going to order dessert, as the menu looked so good. Glad I didn't as my neighbor on the table seated to my left ordered what I was going to the red chocolate cake with mousse etc. when I saw what he received I re thought my order. It appeared a little to pretentious and decidedly not as decadent as the menu described   All in all it was a good food experience. The noise was the big downer of the night"}
{"text":"We went because of the high reviews. I really like the dark atmosphere, nice staff, and the drink menu. The Citizen is an awesome drink. Unfortunately, we weren't impressed by the food. The chopped salad was interesting, but I wouldn't order it for a dinner appetizer again. The grilled cheese I had to send back because it was melty yummy cheese, it was rubbery weird tasting cheese. The chicken entree was just okay, nothing special and the pork belly app didn't impress either. Maybe we picked the wrong items, but I don't think we'd go back for dinner."}
{"text":"I wasn't as impressed as others by Citizen Public House and I really wanted to be.  It was good, but not great.  Had the chopped salad and it was full of flavor, but didn't leave me wanting more.  In fact, we stopped ordering after it and left before we had a meal.  I can't put my finger on exactly any one thing, but didn't feel inclined to stay.  The waitress lacked culinary instincts and seemed interested to \"sell\" rather than guide us to what would interest us.  Overall, I wouldn't come back with all the other amazing options in old Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Chopped salad is so unique....and so delicious!  Zone of the best chicken dishes I have had."}
{"text":"The chopped salad and pork belly pastrami blew my damn mind. Great staff, great food and reasonable prices make this my favorite spot in old town."}
{"text":"Great ambiance and food is very good, filled with a variety of flavor. They also have a great drink menu to choose from with lots of wines. The short ribs with the cherry sauce is to die for. The meat is tender and perfectly cooked. Mac and cheese is amazing and their salads are a absolutely fantastic. Will be going here again very soon. Only thing I don't like is the tables are very close so it makes privacy impossible, I felt like we were eating with the people next to us!"}
{"text":"Bacon and popcorn was good. Pork belly pastrami was the real treat though. After that the chopped salad was a great original kind of taste that I have never had before. Thanks to the bartender Thomas for good conversation and superb craft cocktails. I hope to visit again soon."}
{"text":"Sweet service and excellent food.  I am not a foodie, so I am always impressed with food no matter the place.  I had the meatloaf (amazing!) with a side of zucchini and the chopped salad.  My friend split an order of scallops with her husband.  If you are in Scottsdale, or anywhere in the East Valley area, stop by.  We loved it and will return."}
{"text":"The restaurant was beautiful however a bit loud. We were a party of 11. I started with the aged barrel scotch drink. This was tremendous. They delivered an olive tapenade bread with butter after the drinks were delivered. This was good. I had the short rib and mashed potatoes. The short ribs, kale and sauce was amazing however the mashed potatoes was way too syrupy and thin. I think they added this sweet sauce to the mashed potatoes. Someone ordered the mashed potatoes as a side and it was very good not like the side on my plate. The rack of lamb came almost raw and wasn't sent back because she was too shy. The beans under the lamb were hard.  She did try to tell the waiter she didn't like them and he promptly brought the exact same beans to the table. She sent those back and got the mashed potatoes. The grapefruit salad was amazing. The meatloaf was truly amazing. Best ever anywhere! Mac N Cheese was very good not great. The waiter delivered a hard sugar cookie packaged in plastic wrap for the birthday guest. It was what you would expect from Subway yet not as good. The service was very good. There was a waiter in the corner watching our table at all times. All we had to do was look up. Very cool. On the whole the experience was very good not great."}
{"text":"We went to CPH for Restaurant Week and were blown away.  The service, our three course meal and cocktails were excellent.  Our server recommended the meatloaf and it was delicious.  The manager Daniel was attentive and friendly and runs a great establishment.  We are definitely returning to CPH."}
{"text":"Love this place and will be back!  There are three things I look for in a restaurant; great menu/food, great service, and ambiance.  If you are looking for these too then you have to try CPH!"}
{"text":"Wow!  Their cocktail list blew me away.  So rare to find a place with a well rounded list of old school cocktails!  Each one is like a pice of art crafted to make you smile.  After the aperitif this place keeps me happy with outstanding food.  Bacon Popcorn: Delish.  Olives: Excellent to nibble with cocktails.  Mac & Cheeze: American standard done well here.  Chicken and Waffles: Gluten free and tasty.  Short Ribs: Big portion and well prepared.  Scallops: A savory take on this normally light dish.  Pudding Dessert: Hit the spot.  Best meal I've had in a long time!"}
{"text":"Always wanted to try this place and went  for my birthday was not at all disappointed let's start with the service Sam was our waiter and this guy was the poster child for exuberance at a restaurant who knew was our first time he gave his selections  we chose one he just called the salad it's a deconstructed jem that just explode in your mouth prepared the table and it's absolutely outstanding I went with the pork belly pastrami I know it sounds odd but absolutely fantastic we did start with an appetizer we chose the fondue will say probably a little too many pieces of bread out of for a little more sausage and the Pears was just a perfect match for this beer fondue the desert that was a caramel chocolate extravaganza was definitely enough for two and pack we can't even finish it was so rich but it was certainly outstanding drinks were great amdd service was top notch really can't seem to say much more about it except had a great time definitely will be back"}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots to catch a nice meal. Their chopped salad is one of my favorites! Great drinks, awesome ambience and an eclectic menu!"}
{"text":"Food was quite good - chopped salad was awesome! However, the place is loud and the wait staff was put in a position of having to apologize for every course being way too late. If you want a quiet quality dinner this wasn't what we expected. Kudos to our waiter for making an awkward night as best as it could be."}
{"text":"Lives up to its 5 star billing.  The chopped salad was the highlight.  My party of four agreed-- you've never had a salad like this.  The lamb burger was also very very special.  The lepinja roll the burger comes on is absolutely perfect, the best piece of bread I've eaten in a long long time.  The porkbelly pastrami was rich and silky, but could have used more peppery pastrami-ness.  Still, a great piece of meat.  My wife did not love her grilled cheese.  She said the varied textures of the cheeses was not pleasant.  I had her leftovers the next day, and I tend to agree.  Very good flavor though, and again, superb bread.  They serve Goose Island Matilda on draft, which is now my favorite beer."}
{"text":"I'll go here for a cocktail called The Import. Everything is amazing here- staff, food (famous chopped salad), atmosphere. Even being in the center of Old Town Scottsdale it doesn't get obnoxious. There are nights where they are jam packed- even around the bar. Plan ahead if you are going on a date."}
{"text":"This is going to be the place to go in Old Town.  I had a fantastic time last Saturday.  Thomas was excellent at the bar.  He recommended the Citi-Zen martini, it was perfect, I had two.  We only had appetizers since we had dinner somewhere else, but everything around us looked fantastic.  The couple next to us was visiting from NY and they had the scallops and the chicken, both looked and smell great.  We will definitely be back with some friends."}
{"text":"Crazy drink selection, food was top notch. Little pricey but worth it. Atmosphere is pretty cool. Abbey our waitress was super informative and accommodating. Definitely a must visit for either an upscale dinner or a simple hangout for an eclectic drink concoction."}
{"text":"We went to Citizen Public House for our anniversary and it was everything you could ask for. Very cool atmosphere, prompt professional service and the food was fantastic! I would definitely go again either for a special occasion or even just for a drink. Their cocktail selection was amazing and they had a number of great beers to choose from."}
{"text":"I'm a poor college student, therefore, I don't eat at places this nice very often. We came in last night around 8. The room is very spacious and beautifully decorated with a nice ambiance. The service kind of confused me, because I'm used to servers wanting you in and out as soon as possible. Here, they get your drink order, then get your appetizer order. They don't get your meal order until AFTER you finish your appetizer, just in case you change your mind after eating the appetizer. The head chef, I believe, of the restaurant personally delivered our appetizer and chatted us up for a good 15 minutes. We got the pork belly as our appetizer and it was really good, basically melted in your mouth. I ordered the AZ BLT and my friend ordered the grilled halloumi cheese. Both were REALLY good. The BLT came with homemade bacon and the cheese on the grilled cheese was super tasty. I ended up switching sandwiches with my friend because I enjoyed the halloumi cheese more! We finished off the meal with the bread pudding which, like everything else, was absolutely fabulous. I'd give the restaurant five stars, but the drink orders took FOREVER. This was there only downfall. Besides that, I would definitely return, especially to check out the sexy, bald bartender with the tattoos."}
{"text":"My new favorite place in old town. Late night menu on the weekends always keeps things interesting. Thomas the bartender is always very nice and knowledgeable. I have tried just about everything on the menu, and have yet to be disappointed."}
{"text":"Attentive staff, succulent offerings, incredible mixologic concoctions...Citizen continues to inspire with it's near-perfect...okay, PERFECT menu of entrees, cocktails, and starters that plow new ground of satisfaction. I went to AZ88 after this place tonight, and I'm convinced this IS the best place in Lower Scottsdale - -and perhaps the Valley entire, to enjoy...everything!"}
{"text":"I think I've subconsciously avoided writing this review in hopes that no one else would find my favorite my Manhattan joint... well that didn't work so here goes! Hands down best cocktails in old town, everything from their sangria to their Manhattans are made fresh and it's clear the recipes have been thoroughly tested. Same goes for the food.  We mostly go for the drinks and the reverse happy hour appetizers, but their dinner menu is also superb.  There isn't a huge vegetarian selection, but what they do have is tasty and filling.  Some of my favorites are the kiltlifter fondue, hummus, burrata and kale starter, and the truffle grilled cheese.  I've honestly never made it to dessert because there is never any room. Someday... but as long as they keep up the quality I'll be a CPH superfan for life =)"}
{"text":"Came here for Restaurant Week as the reviews for this place seemed pretty stellar.  First things first, outstanding service (almost alarmingly so).  Our server Gary took great pains to ensure the four of us had a good experience and were taken care of.  Props to Gary for going the extra mile for us.    Now to the food.  Again, went with the restaurant week menu for this visit.  For the appetizer I of course went with the chopped salad.  As expected it was outstanding.  Great presentation, tons of tasty ingredients, and just the right portion.  I think the chopped salad at Cowboy Ciao might be a little better, but just barely.  For the main course I went with the scallops that were covered with greens, tiny pieces of bacon, and doused in a cream corn sauce.  Great dish.  Portion was healthy but not over top.  I had a piece of the buttermilk chicken dish from my girlfriend's plate and that was also good.  For dessert I had the caramel bread pudding.  Portion was fairly small, but tasted good and when all was said and done I didn't feel uncomfortably full.  The reason I dock one point wasn't the food or the service, but the noise.  I literally had to yell across the table for everyone to hear me.  The acoustics are such that even the smallest noise bounces everywhere.  Probably wouldn't be a big deal if I were just hanging out at the bar, but I didn't think the sounds would be so overpowering in a sit down restaurant.  Overall though, cool place and great food.  Just make sure your vocal chords are adequately prepared."}
{"text":"First time here. Actually it's my first time eating in Arizona! Being from LA and eating around there all the time, one can be kind of a food snob when eating outside of your comfort zone. This place does not disappoint. Everything we ordered was on point from the scallops, short ribs, meatloaf, and their chopped salad.  If you're in Scottsdale, hit this place up. Shout to Brad our server!"}
{"text":"*Reviewing cocktails only*  I have not eaten here yet but if the cocktail quality is met or surpassed by the food, this is a huge winner.  The bartenders know their stuff and they use amazing ingredients like the antique formula vermouth (this stuff is $30 a bottle!) and luxardo cherries ($20 a jar).  My test is always to order a mescal drink and let the bartender make up what he/she wants with it.  I've had several of them and they've all been on par with some of the best cocktail places in SF, NY and Chicago.  My only small ding is the prices are high for Scottsdale.  SF has an average of $10 a cocktail at a respectable place... maybe $12.  I've paid $13.50+ at CPH.  Not a huge deal, but you get what you pay for here."}
{"text":"I have to say that the appetizers were pretty good and so were the entrees, though i would probably only come back for an event or special occasion.   Recommendation: 70%"}
{"text":"I was so disappointed by our meal at citizen public house last night after reading such great reviews. I ordered the swordfish and it was so incredibly bland and the sauce was cold. My boyfriend had the carne asada tacos which were fatty and very average. Finished with the bread pudding which was alright but the ice cream that came with it was super watery and flavorless. Two stars for service and for the chopped salad. What a bummer this restaurant was"}
{"text":"Have the Buttermilk Chicken. It was amazing and moist. Great atmosphere and reasonable prices. Great for a romantic evening!"}
{"text":"Great experience and great food. Waitress was extremely helpful with recommendations and was always around when needed. Crab cakes, spare ribs and the drinks were all spot on"}
{"text":"Why oh why have I deprived myself of this amazing establishment for so long?! No idea, but that all changed last night. After a long day, my best friend and I got hungry and were craving mac 'n cheese so we strolled into Citizen Public House.   We were warmly greeted by the most amazing and kind-hearted bartender, Will. He was super quick with getting us our drinks, and (I swear he was lightning fast) getting our order of mac 'n cheese in. They all must've known how hungry we were 'cause our food came out in the blink of an eye -- or so it seemed. The cheese was ooey gooey, and the pasta was cooked exactly perfect. It was topped with a tomato something -- which gave it an unique and mouth-watering flavor.   The mac 'n cheese was so good it was gone in 2.2 seconds. And what's the logical thing to do when your amazing mac 'n cheese runs out? You order another bowl, of course!!! Will was so incredibly sweet, he bought us our second bowl of mac 'n cheese, which totally made our night! Thank you, Will. And management -- he deserves recognition for his superb customer service (perhaps even a raise? Christmas bonus?). Matter of fact, the whole staff deserves recognition for their excellent service -- from the bartenders, to the bussers, to the kitchen that prepared the scrum-dilly-umptious food. The whole experience was incredible! The staff was quick, attentive, friendly, personable, and anticipated guests' needs before they even had to ask for anything. Keep it up, guys and gals! You're awesome!!!   We couldn't finish our second bowl of mac 'n cheese last night so we took it to-go... Smartest idea ever!!! I'm reliving the amazingness of last night as I write this review. So.Incredibly.Yum! Thank you, Citizen Public House!"}
{"text":"This place has a wonderful atmosphere and amazing food. Perfect for date night or celebrations! Everything was awesome, but don't miss the chop salad!"}
{"text":"Yum yum yum! I ordered the chicken for dinner and it was amazing! Perfectly tender and moist, the chicken was served on a bed of some vegetables (wish I knew the name) covered with sauce. You'll probably have room for a dessert!   The service was exceptional. Our waitress was very attentive.   I would also describe this place as upscale casual. The tables have white cloths, but I noticed other patrons wearing upscale casual attire with flip flops. I'd definitely recommend a reservation if you're coming in with more than 4 people and during rush times!"}
{"text":"Great intimate place. Wonderful decor. Makes for a nice casual date night. Ordered some appetizers and a bottle of Vue. Not a high markup which was surprising. I've paid well over 130 for the same bottle at City Hall.  Overall I would recommend this restraint and dine here again."}
{"text":"Love this place! The space is loud and vibrant with an interesting mix of people.  Food and drinks were delicious with service being attentive without being overbearing. Had the Piggy & Waffle, lamb loin and scallops, and drank the Citi-zen, Sazerac, and Hot Pink Paloma. Food was especially tasty, and drinks were also good.  Looking forward to many return visits!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic.  In town for the weekend, and tired and criminally under-dressed in a hoodie and jeans, came here after not finding much else that tripped our trigger in the downtown area. Boy, what a surprise!  Classy inside, with the New York-like black and white interior, with lots of sleek lines and glossy surfaces, we were welcomed immediately and led to a table where our server showed up attentively, but long enough for us to get settled in. It's a talent I wish more servers had.  Ordered cocktails, which we enjoyed, but the real shining star was the food which was outstanding. Let me recount:  Bacon Heirloom Popcorn Chicken and Waffles Mac n' Cheese Pork Belly Pastrami Truffle Grilled Cheese  Aside from being WAY too much food for two people, everything on that menu save the grilled cheese was delicious, and the grilled cheese only didn't reach that mark by a notch or two. They have many main courses, but if you don't get the pastrami and the chicken and waffles, you're cheating yourself.  Prices are what you'd expect for this type of atmosphere and location, and I'd suggest getting lots of appetizer type food rather than getting a full-on main course, though I'm sure those are delicious as well.  Also an excellent place for sending guests who are from out of town for weddings in the area for dinner the night before."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to get to the Citizen Public House since I heard about it - been on their mailing list, etc., but just never managed to get there.  Finally, a friend was in town and wanted to grab dinner in old town - he said gastropub, so I told him to meet me at Citizen.  I didn't realize that the Cowboy Ciao chef who originated their fabulous chopped salad was the man behind Citizen Public House - when I found that out, we had to start with that!  In case you haven't had it, please allow me to explain.  The plate arrives with lines of chopped salad items, looking like a bunch of colored stripes.  The stripes include dried corn, Israeli couscous, smoked salmon, asiago, pepitas, tomatoes, arugula and currants.  That is topped with a housemade buttermilk dressing and mixed up.  It's a fabulous mix of flavors and textures - a truly wonderful thing to eat.  If you haven't eaten it before, stop reading this and head to Citizen Public House.  Now.  It's ok, I'll wait.  I decided to try the buttermilk chicken for my main course.  Wow.  I was expecting fried chicken (that's usually what comes after 'buttermilk' in a chicken recipe title), but it was grilled.  It was incredibly flavorful.  Very very good.  We ordered a couple of desserts for the table:  Pig in the Orchard (apple and bacon bread pudding with maple ice cream and blueberry sauce) and the Peanut Butter Strata Bar (white chocolate ice cream, peanut butter crunch and strawberry jam).  The Pig in the Orchard was spot on - order it.  I was a bit 'meh' on the Peanut Butter Strata Bar.  Cool vibe at the restaurant, and right in the heart of Old Town (kitty corner from Cartel Coffee - which, of course, you know already, because you always get your espresso there, right?)"}
{"text":"Another visit, this time solo after work. I arrived at 5 on a Thursday eve and it was nearly empty. Scottsdale is a late-night town, so no worries here.   I was given water and menus right away. The hostess announced that it was happy hour, so I was 'coerced' into a beer.   Sam approached me shortly later and offered to explain the menu. I wasn't very hungry so I ordered the Chopped Salad and the Chia Seed Seared Ahi Tuna.   My salad arrived in 5 minutes. The salad I've had numerous times and there are dozens of reviews about it so I'll focus on the Ahi.   It arrived shortly after my salad bowl was cleared. It was presented with micro greens, fried leeks and an asparagus gastric. The Ahi was seared nicely and was a good portion. Pretty good but not great. I was pining for the fondues that surrounded me.   Sam was genuinely happy to greet all his guests and made me feel like an important part of the clientele. Very good customer skills."}
{"text":"Good place. I definitely came in with extremely high expectations, given the rave reviews this place has. The food was definitely good. I ordered the steak with asparagus which i thought was really dry. My sister had the sea bass which was good. Chopped salad was good as well. Crab cakes were meh. I feel like there are better restaurants around. I'd definitely be back, but I wouldn't give this place 5 stars.   Service was very good, atmosphere was perfect for dates."}
{"text":"One word = D E L I C I O U S!   Such eclectic small plate options, varying ingredients and nothing basic about the menu! I thoroughly enjoyed their famous Cobb Salad!!! It was delicious! A must do when in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"If there is a place that deserves more then 5 stars this is it!  My wife and I stopped here for a cocktail and appetizer. It was a Monday right when they opened at 2:00 pm so it would have been easy to expect poor service. Absolutely not the case.   In all my years I've never met a more knowledgable bartender. He is very committed to his craft and provided great information about the drink choices and the food menu as well. Very easy to talk to, polite and just a great overall guy.   I had a craft beer and my wife a glass of wine. My wife is very knowledgeable about wine and the suggestion by the bartender was a perfect fit for her pallet.   My only regret is that we had already eaten lunch. The bacon popcorn was amazing and I have no doubt the rest of the menu is as well.   We will be back here again for lunch/dinner and if the same bartender is working I know where we will be sitting.   Just flawless in all aspects. Thanks for a great experience on our date day away from our children."}
{"text":"This place was amazing. Our host. Our waiter. Our food. Our dessert. Perfect. Scallops are hard and so is swordfish. This was perfect. :)"}
{"text":"I had dinner at the bar on a very busy night. If you plan to go here, make reservations.  The staff was friendly and accommodating, the bartender made a delicious drink full of interesting spices called \"The Persian\".  My biggest disappointment was the food. Some say that this is the next Food Mecca of America. I disagree TOTALLY. I had a chance to try three dishes:  Truffle Grilled Cheese-Tasted like slightly cheesy potato on bread Lamb Burger- No flavor. The kennebec fries tasted odd, but went well with maple syrup. Piggy & Waffle- I think this was the best dish out of the three, but it was just ok. At least the pork was moist.  Overall, I think this place just tries too hard.  2/5 Might come back to try the chopped salad."}
{"text":"we had filet, scallop and fish (3 entrees), all are delicious! good service also, we'll definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"We made reservations for Valentine's Day and because of the popularity of this place could only get at 3 pm reservation. We did not eat breakfast or lunch and arrived very hungry. To our dismay there was a pre-fixe $60 per person menu and no other options and we were not warned of this when we made our reservation on Open Table. Since we did not know the menu prices well enough we didn't realize that for the majority of the selections one was getting seriously ripped off at the $60 per person price. We should have left but we so much wanted to eat there because the regular menu sounded so great and we were so hungry that we stayed.   The appetizers were smaller versions of regular appetizers that normally cost $7 to $12, the entrées were between $20 and $34 and the desserts were about $10. Only if you got the $34 filet mignon were you anywhere near the $60/pp price which of course did not include tax or gratuity. For those of us that ordered the meatloaf we paid about $15, maybe even $20 too much for our meal.  That being said we thoroughly enjoyed our cocktails and food and our server AJ was fantastic. He engaged us when we gave him details about our activities earlier in the day and he had very sound suggestions on the menu. We did return the next day without a reservation and sampled the regular menu.   We ordered the Citi-Zen (a vodka, lemon martini basically), a Manhattan, the Thai Margarita and The Import that had whiskey, a stout float and a smoked sugar rim. The two best were the Citizen and the Manhattan (crystal clear - no shaking!) with the Import third and the Thai Margarita not balanced and too sour. The next day we had happy hour drinks - a Bouvedier (sp?) sort of like a Manhattan which was very good and the regular menu Pleasantville which although AJ did not care for our party thought was very tasty - maybe a little floral.  Here's what we ate on both nights:  Curry Caulilower soup - has a good kick of spice to it from the curry oil - delicious.  Chopped salad - excellent. The freeze dried corn gives nice crunch and flavor. It is presented in little piles in the bowl so that you can see all of them clearly before you mix it all together yourself.   Pastrami brussels sprouts - the rye spaetzle \"sticks\" were dry and strange, the rest of the dish was great.  Fondue was good, not great - it seemed a little thin in flavor.  Scallop entrée was amazing.  Pork and beef meatloaf was a very large portion and satisfying, it needs more of the porcini mushroom drizzle.The mashed potatoes under the loaf were chunky as well but not overly buttery.  Fair trade short ribs - absolutely amazing! Tender, full of flavor and not fatty. Cherry barbecue sauce was a little overwhelming for it.  Pork shank - tender and good flavor but not amazing.  Lamb burger - very strong flavors, roll too chewy, french fries are the bomb, so good and crispy!  AJ had recommended the Filet Mignon and after seeing it land on another table we regretted it not ordering it as it appeared to be a 10 ounce (or more) portion that was over 2 inches thick and perfectly cooked!  Dessert was duo of flourless chocolate cake (with a teaspoon at most of a salted caramel sauce that was great) and a heart shaped red velvet cake. They were okay but a little bit of a let down to end a Valentine's day meal."}
{"text":"There is a reason this restaurant has SO many 5 star reviews! The service and food is PHENOMENAL. I am at the point where I want to bring everyone I know to this place after trying it out. I came in with 2 of my closest friends for a birthday around 8pm. It was busy but they were still able to seat us right away. I had my 2 month old baby with me. I am breastfeeding so it is hard to leave him at home and as many moms know at that age they really don't have a set bed time. The host staff was so welcoming and instead of being weirded out that I brought an infant carrier into a gastro pub they responded with excitement and loved seeing my little one. After we were seated the service was just wonderful. The server (I wish I remembered his name- I think Alex) was extremely knowledgeable and friendly. We had a couple small dishes, the fabulous chop salad, and dessert. This review is a little late (we dined in November) but it needed to happen. If you haven't been here YOU NEED TO GO!!"}
{"text":"I am a fan of the late night menu which starts at 11pm, has great deals, amazing food and ends at 1:30a! Late night gourmet on the cheap!  The regular menu is great too! Everything sounds odd when described but tastes like heaven when it arrives!  First timers:  App: pork belly pastrami or share the original chopped salad Main: the scallops or the porcini filet"}
{"text":"After multiple visits I can't complain. Food is always delicious. Servers are always personable, well informed and attentive. Take your friends. Take your family. From drinks to dessert everyone will be happy."}
{"text":"I admit I was super skeptical of the notorious Chopped Salad...so famous it has its own FB page! Even when the waiter described the ingredients, I still didn't think it sounded good. But I was wrong! It is strange and it is delicious. The service is great here and all our meals were excellent. We ordered the scallops, filet, smart chicken, pork shank, and short ribs. All were excellent, but the short ribs was definitely the most unique dish with a nice combination of flavors. The staff was super attentive and even though it isn't a kid friendly restaurant, they were great with my 4 yr old and he enjoyed the Mac and cheese."}
{"text":"Simply fantastic all the way around. Incredible service backed up by innovative food and drink ideas. I have had shrimp and grits before (a favorite on Bravo's Top Chef). Citizen Public house simply substituted scallops for the shrimp and it turned out great. For desert I had milk and cookies. No kidding.  I've not had milk and cookies since I was a kid, and it was all that I remembered it to be. The cookies were an assortment of gourmet locally made gems so whatever type of cookie you remember from your childhood, it's probably represented here.  Some soft, some a bit on the hard side, which needed a little longer soak.   There are some great new cocktail ideas on the bar menu as well as some old classics that they manage to pull off quite well. All in all, CPH is a great restaurant."}
{"text":"Stetson salad. Literally that's all you need to know. Get it with the salmon. Amazing."}
{"text":"Buttermilk roasted chicken is on point! My uncle came to Phoenix for work and I'm new to Scottsdale so I had no idea where to take him but I went here off of a local's recommendation and it did not disappoint! My dad came to visit a few weeks later and I took him as well. I got the scallops that time and they were amazing!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant.  Went late on Sunday night. The bacon fat popcorn was our starter and it was so tasty. We shared the beets which was lovely. The salad I had for my meal was the chop salad but very unusual. Try this as a signature dish and very unique.  Loved this!"}
{"text":"Probably the best scallops I've had!! Cooked the perfection. The only thing I wish was that the veggies were something other than the bitter Asian veggies. Didn't seem to go but the scallops themselves were seasoned so well and cooked so perfectly!  Oh and they're huge!   Came here to celebrate a bachelorette. The ambiance is nice and good for groups."}
{"text":"This Scottsdale jewel will have to become a regular haunt. Creative appetizers, craft beers and a nice wine selection help start a unique dining experience. The service is terrific with everyone having a solid knowledge of what is being served and (my favorite) actually having an opinion they are willing to share with you if you ask.  We started with the imported olives followed by the Burrata. Definitely need to ask for more bread. For entrees we had Pan Seared Scallops and the Gypsy Pork Shank. The Scallops were terrific but the Pork Shank stole the show. Nice large portion, plenty to bring home. We didn't hit dessert menu this time but will dive in the next time we're in.   Great dining experience. Well done!"}
{"text":"Outstanding place!  Can't believe I never made it here before.  The chopped salad was AMAZING.  I had Scallops with grits to DIE FOR.  Our waiter was amazing, too.  I was concerned about noise with the bar being so large and centrally located in the place, but it wasn't  an issue at all.  We got a little dressy, but there were definitely people in jeans.  Recommend!"}
{"text":"This place was all it promised it would be!  We were told the wait would be 45 mins so we left our number and went to wander the city but were pleasantly surprised to receive a text about 20 mins later letting us know our table was ready! We snagged an out side table where we could actually hear each other as the inside has a vicious echo that detracts from the ambiance in our opinion... Our server was lovely and let us take our time deciding on each course before going to the next... We enjoyed the Famous Chop Salad, to see what the hype was all about and were not disappointed, although can see why other Yelp reviews comment on the smallness of portions. The crunch of the freeze dried corn was unexpected and the smoked Salmon sealed the deal! Next we split the Chia crusted Ahi and the Oso Bucco which were both perfectly executed and left us not a prayer of entering any room for dessert!  We would absolutely be regulars here if we lived locally!"}
{"text":"Citizen Public House has excellent food and drinks.  We had the Pork Belly Pastrami, Mac & Cheese, \"Smart Chicken\" and Coffee and Donuts - all were delicious.  I would give the food 5-stars.  The dining experience overall 4-stars.  We felt that the service was somewhat slow.  We had to wait quite a bit for our server to take our order.  I even noticed people who sat down after we did had bread & olive oil.  I had to ask out server for bread (even though it was complementary she didn't bring it).  If the staff was more attentive, I would have given 5-stars overall."}
{"text":"Can't I give these guys 6 stars?? In town for some Spring Training baseball games, we wanted some good food and drinks - on a Friday night, everything was of course packed. Instead of laughing at us for not having reservations, they were so super nice and tried accommodating us BUT 3 seats at the bar opened and we happily ate there. The FOOD was all outstanding (recommend that duck burger, bigtime!) and the bartender who served us (I think his name was Eric?) was the best bartender and server I have EVER had. So attentive, so fun, I wish I lived here so we could come every weekend. KUDOS to these guys!"}
{"text":"My husband to be and I had a great date night here. We made a reservation using open table and were seated promptly when we came in. Our waiter Gary was fabulous and provided great recommendations on the menu. He was fun and knew the menu well. We had great drinks and great food. We tried the crab cakes and Mac n cheese both to start with. My hubby to be got the filet and I got the meatloaf and everything was super yummy. Definitely will go back and bring friends!"}
{"text":"We were able to walk in on a Friday night without reservations (3 people) and be seated within 10 mins. This is sometimes unheard of on a weekend in Old Town, so we may have gotten lucky. They do accept reservations (to my knowledge), so if you don't want to gamble make reservations.  Service: The restaurant has a bit of a bourgeoisie feel, but the the service was attentive and polite.  Food:  We ordered the gypsy pork shank (tender and delicious), bacon fat heirloom popcorn (so tasty and even better the next day), the OMFG salad (saw many reviews for this and gave it a try -- very unique, light taste and filling), and filet mignon asada tacos.   Our server told us that they didn't have any house wine selections, but did recommend a red for me to try. I asked for a sample before getting a full pour and it was tasty. They seemed to have a nice list of cocktails, but nobody else in our party ordered drinks, so I can't speak to how those are.  Would definitely come back here for the salad and popcorn."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite valley restaurant. The drinks are great and the food is excellent too. A tad pricey, especially some of the cocktails.  Our first waitress Katie was fantastic, but she may have set the bar too high... Noone since has lived up to her standard.   The original chopped salad is a must. Also, the cheese fondue is a great appetizer for three or four diners.   For dinner, the filet mignon asada tacos are very tasty but I'm not much of a taco guy. Not sure why I ordered them. My own fault. The Gio Osso Burger is the best burger in the valley I think.  The peppercorn filet mignon is super tender and mine was cooked exactly to spec for the medium rare I ordered. The fair trade short ribs are terrific and tender but a bit on the small side if you are a big eater.   The best dessert in my opinion is the Black and Tan. The push pop is just okay, more something to laugh about than thoroughly enjoy, but ymmv. The apple crisp is tasty but could use more apple frankly.  My big complaint about Citizen Pub House would have to be the noise. Put up some acoustic panels or tile please so diners can converse without shouting across the table!"}
{"text":"AMAZING experience. It was our anniversary dinner and we started with a complementary dinner. Ambience is just awesome. In starts, I tried pork belly pastrami n my husband order chopped salad. Salad was interesting. It was sweet n crunchy. Pork belly just melts in ur mouth. In entrees, we order Mediterranean Sea Bass n Flat Iron Steak. Steak was perfectly cook but star was Sea Bass. It was so beautiful n perfectly cooked. We wl visit again. It's a must visit place."}
{"text":"Get the chopped salad and the scallops. I love this place!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm used to restaurants being noisy these days, but this place was so noisy we could barely carry on a conversation. Service was polite but adequate. The server offered to bring some bread since the dinner was taking so long to arrive, ironically the bread arrived after the meal which didn't arrive for at least another 10-15 minutes after her offer of bread.   My husband ordered the velveeta filled burger, I had the street tacos and our friend had the filet mignonette. Both my husband and I found our food to be quite average but the filet mignon was reported to be quite good.   Be careful with the burger, the first bite has cheese literally exploding out of it. Both my husband and I were covered in hot cheese. The server was apologetic and offered to pay for dry cleaning if needed. It wasn't needed but it was a nice gesture.   All in All, we wouldn't desire to come back."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere and decor.  I think this place would be pretty good for big groups.  The bar is nice and I love the drink menu.  I'd like to try each one, they sound so interesting.  I had the Persian this time around.    The chicken and waffles had good flavor.  Loved the seasoning on the chicken and it was cooked just about right.  There was one piece that had a bit of wet batter but for the most part it was well worth the 10.  4 large pieces of chicken on top of a smallish square of waffle.  It was actually way better than Lo-Los and probably about the same price!  I tried some of the filet mignon, duck and scallop entrees.  Loved the combinations, especially the filet and the scallop - wasn't sure about the risotto that came with the duck.  The glazes for the filet and scallop was very good as well.  All in all, the prices are kind've high but reasonable for the product and experience they bring.  I would love to come back to try the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"My girlfriends and I came here for my bachelorette dinner and I'm so glad we did! We flew into Scottsdale from Houston for a few days and loved the restaurant scene here! Citizen Public House was absolutely amazing!  We true the pork belly pastrami, chopped salad and I had the scallops for my entree.  Everything was absolutely DELICIOUS! We did a bit of research regarding the menu here before our dinner and originally thought, \"A chopped salad? Really? How much better can it be than the ones served everywhere else?\".  Boy, were we wrong! It was so worth it!  The pork belly pastrami was TO DIE FOR (ignore the fact that your cholesterol may shoot 50 points)! Hehe ;) The scallops were cooked perfectly and seasoned just right.    Our server was very knowledgable about the menu offerings and even suggested a few areas around town that we might like to visit after our dinner.  He was super friendly and checked on us frequently throughout the night.    If I ever make a trip to Scottsdale again, I'll definitely be stopping by here again :)"}
{"text":"5 stars. You heard me.  Man, am I late on this review...  My sweetie took me to dinner at CPH for my 35th birthday. I know what you're all thinking... \"but Kristi...you don't look a day over 34&3/4.\" Stop....no, pleassssseeee enough with the flattery folks. I can't take it anymore. No seriously. Keep going..  Turns out CPH is right up there with the likes of Nobuo at Teeter House and FnB when it comes to quality and experience. Excellent wine selection. Please, if you have the opportunity, try the 'Tender Belly' bacon fat heirloom popcorn. It was delicious. Though bacon fat could probably make dog poo tasty.   I enjoyed the Porcini-dusted Filet Mignon, medium rare and had a couple of nibbles of my fiance's scallops (which were amazing). The Filet was cooked to perfection and though I'm somewhat of a purist and usually prefer my steak 'au-natural' I was beyond satisfied with the accoutrement. Impressed even.   The service was phenomenal. The distress surrounding my age caused me to consume a gigantic Ketel martini, a shit load of wine (local by the way, I love that) and a desert drink and not once was I cut off. Truly though, our server was a doll. Engaging and genuine; something obviously lacking in the service industry in Arizona.   The only thing I would change about CPH is the location and that's only due to my location, so I'll deal with it."}
{"text":"In a word....loud. It's so loud at CPH that it's hard to concentrate. The food wasn't memorable and my husband and I couldn't even talk to each other without shouting to be heard. The hostess couldn't hear us when we checked in for our reservation and had to walk into the hallway to hear us. Our server couldn't hear us well when we ordered. And what should have been a 5 minute wait turned into a 25 minute wait. Why bother making a reservation?   I had Bernie's Mac and Cheese. It was just ok. Husband had the meatloaf..that too was just ok. Dining out is a full experience though. It's not just about the food. It's about the service and ambiance too. The service was just alright..but again, it was so frickin loud that the ambiance is totally ruined and I think that also effects the service because there is an air of disinterest in the service staff and hostesses that was palatable.   I get that it's a pub. That said, you can't charge what CPH charges for food and expect people to have to shout at each other during the experience. We won't be back. It's not worth it. I truly do not get the hype AT ALL."}
{"text":"Well, we waited for water. We waited for drinks.  I've been home for hours and all that I can talk about is the salad that I had at Citizen Public House.   If I make it back to Scottsdale, I will get this salad. The meatloaf was great too!  My coworker has the Pork Cheeks and commented it was the best pork that he ever had."}
{"text":"Great food, good selection of wine, and killer drinks.  It was unfortunate that the only way to carry on a conversation was to shout.  Even the music seemed to be piped up louder due to the noise generated by everyone talking.  It's a shame that the ambiance of the restaurant was spoiled by so much volume.  You can even here it overcome you when to walk past the front door."}
{"text":"absolutely amazing service,drinks,and food. The best chopped salad you will ever had. And i hear the manager plays a wicked bass."}
{"text":"Love the Citizen Public House!  This restaurant has put together some really amazing food and drink for the old town area.  Its a nice change to the Rave going on east of Scottsdale Rd.  Whatever the drink is with Jameson 12 and tobacco leather bitters is phenomenal!"}
{"text":"Great drinks, great bar, great fried pork and waffles! We will be back. Oh crap, the bacon popcorn was amazing!"}
{"text":"The best beer I've ever had in my life, I just had at Citizen Public House!  Sitting at the massive bar in the center of the restaurant, the bartender was very gracious in offering tasting pours for the unfamiliar selection of microbrews they had on tap.  It was in this manner that I discovered Lagunitas IPA - on draft, and so deliciously hoppy, fruity, and refreshing I am determined to find it back home in Texas!    While sitting at the bar, I had a chance to pore over their menu, which sounded A-MA-ZING.  Each dish was very thoughtfully laid out with amazing-sounding garnishes for each protein.  The prices were appropriate for the high-end cuisine, ranging from $13 for a Waygu burger to $32 for a porcini-dusted filet.  I can't really comment further, since I had dinner reservations down the street and sadly couldn't stay.  The atmosphere was very cool and contemporary, very open.  It is definitely more of a restaurant than a \"pub\".  For a Friday night, it didn't seem that busy, which is a plus if you waited too long to make a reservation anywhere.  This will be my first meal whenever I return to Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"The Original Salad is a MUST (but I hold off on the smoked fish). And their cocktails are fab."}
{"text":"Completely incredible. We had the burrata salad, the original chopped salad and the chicken over risotto. All were masterfully made with perfect, fresh ingredients. The place is not overly fussy, but the food is clearly made my someone with a great deal of skill. It was inventive but not too far out there. And it was so well crafted, but not over worked.  A difficult balance to strike, in my opinion. Our very memorable and charismatic waiter was Gary. And despite his big personality, he knew exactly when we needed him and exactly when we wanted to be left alone with our perfect food. Exceptional experience overall."}
{"text":"We stopped in this year for restaurant week and enjoyed the experience.  We tried the original chopped salad (the star of the meal), the soup of the day, the meatloaf, the chicken and both desserts.  The atmosphere is nice, the service is good and the food is consistent, but not out of this world, but maybe it was just the restaurant week menu.   Definitely a place worth checking out if visiting Old Town Scottsdale."}
{"text":"**H O L Y * C O W**  A diamond in the rough. Photos of the inside don't do the ambiance and good vibe of this place justice! The restaurant was packed and the bar was full nearly the entire time we were there.  We enjoyed the winter menu...the hubs ordered the meatloaf and it was magical...I don't even LIKE meatloaf and I asked for multiple bites. So what did I order? The field salad small plate and acorn squash with goat cheese and chorizo. Don't get me wrong the entrees all looked delicious but I couldn't get past the 'small plate' menu. Two items were perfect for me.  The flavors of all of the dishes were perfect and extremely complementary of each other. I don't believe there would be a bad choice on the menu and can't wait to go a second time.  So, not only are we foodies, we love good craft cocktails and here, again CPH delivered.   When you are looking to indulge and want something outside if the box...you won't be disappointed with Citizen Public House.  Cheers!!"}
{"text":"I came here the other evening for happy hour and ended up staying for dinner.  I am very impressed! We ordered the crabcakes, which were light, fresh and tastey. They are deep friend but it didn't feel unhealthy or overly saturated in fat which was great. I ordered the scallops because of all the wonderful reviews on here, and yet again yelp did not fail me! My friend ordered the short rib, which was also excellent, I like how they serve the sauce on the side as to not over power it. One thing to note though: my scallop dish was very small (3 scallops) and my friend got two massive pieces of short rib. The portions were way off. I was still slightly hungry after my scallops and 1 crab cake, so of course we ordered the apple bacon bread pudding, which was nice. The blueberry sauce they put on it is great, not too sweet and compliments the other flavours nicely.  The ambiance is also very nice, with lots of light and fresh air coming in, crisp white tables clothes while still giving the allusion of being somewhat casual.   The cocktails were okay as well, the ones that we tried from the menu didn't amaze me. But weren't bad either, I'm rather picky admittedly. I did have the bartender make me an extra dirty martini which for once in Arizona was done almost perfectly. I don't know what is it with the desert but they can't make a martini to save their life. But here it was pretty good, I'll be returning for that. I should also note they have Sipsmith here! Haven't seen that in other bars in the area so I was very excited as that is my gin of choice.  All is all - nice place, good food, decent price, acceptable cocktails."}
{"text":"It was my first time eating alone at such a special restaurant.   The host and waiter led me to an intimate table for four and made my self date one of the most memorable dinners!   Sam, my friendly waiter, checked up on me every time he passed me by and kept me company like a friend. He also surprised me with the menu of the Original Chopped Salad, which was just a perfect combo of all the healthy grains and vegetables you would normally not eat by themselves. I can't wait to try the recipe myself and see if I can live up to Citizen Public House's expectations!   There's an intimate bar in the middle of the restaurant where all the couples sit. But I'd also recommend this place for those of you who want to bring your close family members and for all of you who are looking for some alone time; the wonderful hosts at CPH won't leave you alone."}
{"text":"This was my first time here, it was great. From our waiter Gary to the fabulous chopped salad with smoked salmon to my scallops, and let's not forget the bacon popcorn, everything was delicious! And we got the recipe for that great salad too."}
{"text":"This is just one of the best places in Scottsdale. Hands down the drinks the food the people make you feel like you are at home. You know how Norm felt at Cheers in the 80's that's how you feel here even if it's your first time they make you feel right at home."}
{"text":"A lovely (and very lively) pub/bar restaurants with really reasonable price & GREAT GREAT food! Two of us stopped by this place on a Tuesday evening while on our business trip after consulting Yelp. Even on a (mid)weekday evening, the inside of Citizen (although not full) was very lively (as opposed to other restaurants that seemed empty!). I love the fact that they had a list of MANY cocktail drinks for you to choose from. The waitress was great at recommending some vodka-based cocktails that my friend would like as well! For food, we opted for:  Appetizers: 1) Pork Belly Pastrami and 2) Chopped Salad. Both dishes were excellent! The pork belly was tender and with a mustard-based sauce and a bed of vegetable (I forgot what the veg was) while the chopped salad was so refreshing! (probably the bacon made it taste so great!  Main dish: 1) Seared Scallops and 2) Crispy Steelhead. The seared scallops were also great and came with saucey looking food of what tasted like mashed potato. The steelhead was actually a fillet (instead of whole fish) and I love their green pea risotto that came with it. Honestly, I actually like their appetizers more and thought the main dish was quite large (well, since we had 2 appetizers already!)...but the food was very good still!  Dessert: Pina Colada Bread Pudding (heaven~~~)...tasted/smell of toasted coconut was so aromatic after we took a bite of dessert. I'm normally not a dessert person but since the food here was so good (both appetizers and main dishes), I was glad we tried their dessert out, too!  All in all, the bill came to around $90 without tip including 2 cocktails)...really reasonable!! highly recommend this place as a place to hang out! Judging from the fact that it was actually crowded even on a Tuesday evening, I do have a feeling this place gets really crowded on Friday/weekend though!"}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting the Citizen Public House, and have not yet decided if it is somewhere I'd go again.   Upon entering, we were greeted at the hostess stand and taken to our seats. We were seated next to a fairly loud group (not uncommon for Scottsdale on a Saturday night) who seemed to be having a good time discussing the merits of whatever their latest business ventures were and whose volume was not increasing much so chose to keep our appointed table.   The atmosphere of the restaurant was noisy and boisterous, and seemed to be filled with an interesting crowd of people. Half of them were a bit older and begrudgingly eating dinner out that evening and the other half were young  professionals. There was music playing overhead but it barely registered for most of the people there (one woman I overheard in the restroom was audibly surprised to hear it playing for the first time that evening.) The wait staff was incredibly attentive and pleasant-- the waiter introducing himself and shaking our hands was an interesting way to start off the meal.   At our server's recommendation we started off with the Pastrami Pork Belly (for him) and the Original Chopped Salad (for me.) Both were very flavorful and the salad presentation was a fun twist.   For an entree I selected the scallops, and he had the short ribs. My scallops were flavorful and well prepared, although the wilted baby kale which sat atop it was difficult to cut into in order to pair the two for a bite. The scallops were nested in a corn grit mix and the plate was drizzled with an interesting gastrique that was a little too sweet for my taste- I'm more of a vinegar fan.   The short ribs were rubbed a little too generously with coffee with very little extra flavor to add to it; the dipping sauce which was provided to flavor it was a little too salty to enjoy with the meat. Accompanying was a parsnip puree that neither of us were excited about. We agreed the appetizers were the best portion of the meal.   This seems like a great place to take a group of friends for apps and drinks to begin a fun night out in Downtown Scottsdale, but isn't really the type of place I'd recommend to anyone looking for a romantic and quiet dinner."}
{"text":"Food was amazing and I thought it was pretty reasonably priced for the amount you got, including drinks. We split the chopped salad to start and it was plenty for two people to share as an app. I got the chia ahi tuna and my wife had the scallops. Both were awesome and we were stuffed when we left.  The restaurant is pretty loud, so it makes it hard to hold a conversation."}
{"text":"I first heard about this restaurant when our son came home for a visit and showed me a picture of 'the best chopped salad I've ever had, Mom.\" So when we came out to visit him, we headed there. Our waiter was simply amazing - attentive but not hovering, very very helpful in choosing a wine (and letting me take a pic of the bottle so I could remember it!). He remembered our son from his previous visits.  The chopped salad lived up to the raves. The smoked salmon and dehydrated corn made all the difference in the taste and texture. It was simply amazing! My mushroom tartlet was earthy and tasty with some great light crust.  A must visit for Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Went last night for a drink and a little nosh with some coworkers. I didn't want to come here but the four girls I was with drag me in. I started of with a Manhattan and I love a good Manhattan, so I usually watch over the bartender when making them. I've seen it all from shaking one to using cherry juice and if I'm paying $10+ I want it done right. Our bartender out did me. He was on point and it was a perfect Manhattan. Thanks buddy. I order the cheese fondue and for a late night snack it was amazing. I pretty sure I got like 3 bits in before the girls attacked it. (I'm still raving to my friends about that bacon popcorn).  I'll be back for dinner soon."}
{"text":"Two things stand out:  1) Chopped salad. (I'm told it has its own Facebook page and a man doesn't just toss that salad aside.) It was celebrity-worthy.  2) Pregnant lady drink. That's not the name of it, but I happened to be dining with two expecting mothers in my group. As the only other non-drinker, I was happy to sip water. However, when these ladies got their fruited drinks and saw my simple H20 they took it upon themselves to ensure I joined the fruited party. They order the \"pregnant lady drink\" for me. Seeing the opportunity, the restaurant did it up right and packed more fruit and garnish in that drink than in most grocer's produce section. Well played.  I lied--the meatloaf also stood out, the scallops were outstanding, and I had a steak. I rarely order a stake, but when I do I order it rare. So tender. So simple, but with a nice, rich sauce to accompany the beef.  Honestly, the evening is a blur. The server handled our big, rowdy crowd with aplomb and grace and deserves a huge pat on the back for the effort. They showed us a tremendous time. The space is gorgeous, happy, and legitimately serving up some fantastic dishes."}
{"text":"Best salad I have ever had.....may sound strange but the most delicious, unusual creation.  It is a lively atmosphere, so having conversation is a bit of a shouting match.  Not a bad thing...just a thing."}
{"text":"So we went during restaurant week last Friday. And definitely had reservations, previously had tried to go to Citizen in April and it was slammed.    I loved the multiple course menu idea and to be honest I think they should do it often for certain weekends as nothing beats that. We both had the Chopped Salad, which to be honest...was amazing.  Great idea, and it sports it's own Facebook page. We also shared the drink pairing, the first one which was vodka based made sense but we really weren't that interested in it.  For the second course she had the Buttermilk chicken and I the pan seared scallops.  Both were amazing, the grits were very fine and I hate grits.  The grits were quite tasteful.  The second drink was a citrus and gin cocktail, definitely see how it went with the scallops or the chicken, it was good but no idea how it would couple with the meatloaf.  For our desert I chose the Peanut Butter Strata Bar and she the Pig In the Orchard, the peanut butter strata bar tasted as though I could ascend to heaven.  The bread pudding was ok, but the maple ice cream that came with it was decadent.  The cocktail was patron cafe based and it completely went with either deserts.    I would say the skills of the bar tender and the chef were in full display, the only thing that could have made this a five star night would have been our waiter being way more attentive.  He gets a pass as it seemed they needed more wait staff, so given how many patrons he had he did good work."}
{"text":"Stopped here for a New Years Eve meal with my wife before heading to the block party next door.  Set up a reservation on Opentable.  They had a set 3 course menu for $55 due to the holiday which was not clear when making the reservation, however we went with it figuring that it could be more expensive elsewhere. I had the Lentil and Sausage soup - which is good and tasty and my wife had the greens, both were pretty tasty.  Next up was a Filet for me and Butter Chicken for my wife.   I would say I got the better end of the deal but the food was all good.  To finish was a chocolate tart and sorbet \"duet\".  This was ok and probably the weakest part of the meal. Beer selection was good (we are not wine drinkers) they even had Framboise which is unusual. All in all a good start to our NYE celebrations!"}
{"text":"Meh....not really sure what the hype is all about?  The food is not that great and the prices are outrageous!  Had the chopped salad and it was good, we have had something similar before though. My hubby had the scallops and I had the grilled cheese. Nothing wow about either one. We can say we went, we tried, we defiantly  payed but we will not be going back.  Sorry"}
{"text":"Impromptu Friday night date.  First drove to a popular Tempe restaurant where the wait was 1.5 hours.  Then called another Tempe pizza place to inquire if they had gluten free pizza.  No.  This was the next call based on yelp reviews.  Was informed they have gf designation on the menu and they could seat us as soon as we drove over.   Restaurant was a tiny bit hard to find with entrance on the side road for a first timer.  Staff was extremely friendly.  Seating is odd as you are likely to be sat in the middle of the restaurant among many other tables as we were.  I hate having people sit behind me.  Waiter was very nice and informed us of the specials.  I ordered an iced tea with sweet and low.  Informed they don't have sweet and low - that's okay... it is important enough to me that I carry it in my purse.  Never got the iced tea.    My husband ordered the tacos.  They were okay.  Start off with a spice that quickly goes away.  Well prepared but simple.  The french fries that came on the same plate with the three small tacos were actually the best part of the meal.  I ordered the short ribs.  Small serving on a bigger plate which was fine I don't need huge portions.  The short ribs were super tender but lacked any flavor.  I didn't even finish one.  The cherry BBQ sauce was disgusting.  So sweet it overwhelmed any other flavor.  (Now to be fair my husband really liked the sauce and used it to dip his fries in.)  The parsnips were also average.  The greens on the plate were good.  I asked for different sauce to try with the short ribs and was brought out a demi glaze that was equally disgusting.  I'm confused by all the 5 stars but will agree to disagree.  Not all foodies will like the same thing.  With tip I think we paid around $53."}
{"text":"Even though Open Table had this venue booked solid we took a chance and arrived at Approx 830PM. We scored what I believe was the best table in the restaurant. A nice corner table in the back that was semi-private and great for people watching.  Even though you can show up in Jeans and/or shorts the Citizen is definitely upscale. Linen table cloths, excellent service, and wonderfully strong craft cocktails and of course a strong menu gives these guys an easy 4.5 stars.  Plus 1 ordered a Ketel One Martini with blue cheese olives. Her quote \"This is as good as the ones you make at home\". I went big with The Beast: Herradura silver tequila, Ancho Reyes chile liqueur, Averna Limoni, Aztec chocolate bitters. This is a one and done cocktail especially if you already had a robust HH and are planning to barhop post dinner. I would gravitate toward this craft cocktail on my next visit.  Appetizer was Chilean Crab Cakes: roasted corn salad, Oaxacan chile remoulade, micro cilantro 20. What, you thought they were your standard Krab cakes thing again as nothing is standard here. The two cakes are easily shared and ours were cooked perfectly just a tad crispy on the outside and buttery on the inside.  My main course was their gypsy pork shank. According to our waiter this dish is adapted from the chef's Hungarian family recipe. It was fall off the bone tender and I did not want my meal to end. Plus 1 stated that her smart chicken entrée was not that smart. Surely not a bust but she said she was expecting more flavor. Now the Brussel sprouts were another story. Perfectly cooked and seasoned.   Throughout the meal our waiter made sure we were well taken cared of and we never lacked for water or attention. I read that their HH is a great deal so that's on the short list for a return visit."}
{"text":"OMG the mashed potato grilled cheese with truffle oil will BLOW YOUR MIND. I love it. I've also had the duck which was equally life changing.   I'd suggest making a reservation, it's usually busy and the wait can be a damper to a fun date night."}
{"text":"Visited Scottsdale last week and Citizen's was highly recommended. The food was very good. But, the atmosphere was very bland and not inviting at all. I was surprised given the great reviews."}
{"text":"My friend and I recently came to Citizen Public House for dinner (Tuesday evening). The restaurant was crowded (past 6pm), but the host was kind enough to offer us a table, as long as we could leave before 8pm as they had reservations. I appreciated that they accommodated us despite their busy schedule.   The restaurant has a great ambiance and a bar in the center of the place. It was slightly loud but not an annoying level of noise. We went for two beers from the draft beer menu (a house brew and a locaL IPA). We shared a salad as a starter.   Our main courses were really outstanding. My friend had the seared scallops, and I had the amaro meatloaf. I didn't try the scallops myself, but the meatloaf was exquisite. The look if the dish is extremely appealing, to the extent that my friend HAD to try it (picture in the review). It's a delicious veal demi-glacé meatloaf that comes with roaster zucchini and smashed gold potatoes, and a tasty and rich mushroom cream. It was surprising that this was the cheapest priced item in the menu, at 20 dollars!  It was my third time in Citizen Public House, and it was consistently outstanding. I've been to this place in both, high season (winter/spring), and low season (summer), and it's always busy, so I really recommend making a reservation."}
{"text":"Great service and great food! They went above and beyond for our anniversary dinner. We enjoyed the ambiance as well as it was casual but relaxing. Definitely coming back during a future trip to AZ"}
{"text":"Food done right with service that brings the menu to life.  The duck was  WTF good and the pig belly bacon was as rich as the decour.  If u like cocktails that mean something then the mixology at this place will make you happy, we will be going back!"}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise. Thought we'd try a new place. For starters the server was knowledgeable and friendly.......Sean (Shawn). Recommended superb beverages as well as dishes that paired with them.   Great value and great place to get porked!!!!"}
{"text":"The food is delicious, the kitchen runs like a top, timing was perfect and the ambiance was wonderful.  Only thing that keeps this being 5 stars is that the damned waiter kept winking and flirting with my date.  I may go back, but only with my guy friends from here on out, lol."}
{"text":"In town from LA and chose this place based on online research and reviews. Had high expectations based on our readings, and were unfortunately disappointed. It wasn't bad, but just didn't meet the mark.   Pork belly pastrami appetizer - This was good, but the ratios were a bit off.   Rack of lamb - Lamb itself was cooked to the right temperature, a simple preparation. The flavoring of the dish was light and the sherry reduction a bit thin...Leading to a dish that was good, yet underwhelming.   Rib eye steak - Meat was over cooked and not to our liking, so this dish was sent back. (It was served with a Serrano mushroom compote, which was quite interesting and tasty.)  Mac n cheese - This was good, had some interesting sweetness to it. Would be a good dish to order for the table alongside entrees.   Pork cheeks - Good appetizer, flavors were an interesting, compliment.   While nothing was necessarily bad, the food wasn't good enough to return to this restaurant in the future. While we may be quite spoiled with the LA food options, this place was unmemorable and underwhelming."}
{"text":"Their original chopped salads is a MUST order! Best salad I've ever had!!! So much flavor and good for you!  Smoked salmon, couscous, arugula, Asiago cheese, currants, pepitas, dried super sweet corn, marinated tomatoes, buttermilk herb dressing!!!!  I also ordered the pan seared scallops that were cooked to perfection! One of the best meals I've had in Old Town!"}
{"text":"The Chopped Salad is a must for a starter.  It features a unique blend of varying textures and flavors like crunchy freeze-dried corn kernels and black currants that add a hint of sweetness.  I also had the meatloaf which was very savory.  A reservation may be a good idea on the weekend."}
{"text":"Delicious food and attentive service. They accommodated my group of ten on a Friday evening. Will definitely return the next time I'm in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"The original chopped salad is the best thing I ate my entire trip to Scottsdale/best salad I've ever had! A must order!"}
{"text":"Chopped salad, believe the hype :)  its very good.  I'm not vegetarian or a big salad eater but this salad is a great way to start your dinner, esp if shared.  Get the smoked salmon version okay.  What makes its special is the great mixture and variation in texture of the different ingredients.  And I am not a very selective palate eater and cannot usually detect any subtle differences, but this mixture of ingredients screams very soft, to soft to medium to medium hard to hard to crunchy.  Its very well balanced.  I had meatloaf and it was very good, the sauce they use to coat the meatloaf gravy is very good.  My friend had the scallops and it was cooked very well.  Just right, not over cooked and rubbery or undercooked and raw.  U may think its not a big deal but trust me, not a lot of restaurants can do it properly.  service here is top notch and everyone is very nice and polite.  the place is a little noisy and can get crowded which might make it a tad noisy to have conversation.  but its pretty good overall and I had a wonderful experience here."}
{"text":"Had one night in Scottsdale at the end of a Southwest trip, and chose Citizen Public House based on the wonderful Yelp reviews.   The earliest we could get a same day reservation was 8:45 PM, so we had drinks and appetizers elsewhere. Upon arriving 15 minutes early for our reservation, we were promptly seated. We enjoyed the cocktails. We shared the OMFG chopped salad, which was just as advertised! Such a unique mix of flavors and textures - I really enjoyed this dish. The server explained that this is a signature dish at all restaurants by the same owner, which was neat.   Because we already had appetizers beforehand, I opted for a second appetizer as my main course. The yellowfin crudo was absolutely delicious. Very fresh and crisp tasting. My husband really enjoyed the short ribs - the meat was melt-in-your-mouth.  Service was good. The server was definitely busy and apologized several times for our wait, which was fairly minimal. The bill was certainly high, but on par with what you would expect given quality of food and atmosphere. The one knock I would say was that the restaurant was somewhat dark and loud.  Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"This restaurant /bar is in a nice location in old town Scottsdale . The food is always delicious and the servers are great and up beat. Our favorite is Sam he is very knowledgable in regards to the food and cocktails and gives great recommendations. It can be difficult to have a good conversation as it gets pretty loud towards later in the evening when the bar fills up. It's dim lighting , candles, and white table cloths gives it a nice feel. Enjoy"}
{"text":"Been here on several occasions. The food is good, the drinks are tasty but expensive and the atmosphere is fun, but the acoustics are really bad. Not sure what there is to be done about that..."}
{"text":"Great place!  I could give it five stars but I definitely have to go with a solid four due to a couple of minor things.  I took my boyfriend here for an early Valentine's Day dinner on Saturday night.  I found it on yelp as I just moved to Phoenix and had no idea where to take him other than the usual Flemings that he loves.  We started with a couple of the recommended drinks. I had the Manhattan, it was definitely good, not the best I have had though.  My bf had the Citi-Zen and it was FAB!  Probably one of the best drinks I have tasted.  We started out with the Chicken and Waffles.  Really good, Almond Butter and Honey was so different but super yummy.  The only complaint was that they gave you one square of Waffle to five pieces of chicken.  We would have been satisfied with two pieces of chicken and maybe just cut the price a little.  Which I wasn't unhappy with the price per se but it just seemed a little off portion size.  I had the scallops which were AMAZING and my bf had the meatloaf.  Which I tasted and it was was really good. I like meatloaf that actually tastes like meat instead of everything else they put into it and that for sure delivered.  We were both really happy with our entrees.  We also had the Black and Tan dessert, which was yummy. But for the life of me I do not understand why we cannot find a restaurant that does caramel pudding the right way. This was by far the best we have ever had out but it still had a grittiness to it.    The only drawback to the restaurant per se is the noise level in there. I felt like at times I was straining to hear my bf talk or I was yelling at him and we both are not old enough to be having those problems lol.      I would definitely recommend this place, maybe not for a romantic dinner but it is for sure one of the best restaurants I have been to in the area!   Thanks fellow yelpers!!"}
{"text":"great food & drinks.  service was very attentive & helpful with food allergy concerns as well.  BACON popcorn!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I had the sangria & my hubby had Lost in Translation.  both tasty.  Hubby had chicken & waffles, I had chopped salad & we split a lamb burger.  No dessert this time, but we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Great Fresh Food in this white linen tablecloth restaurant.  Excellent Wine Selection.  And Wonderful Service!  Fresh food selection on the menu with many choices.  Definitely recommended.  Filet Migon superb!  We came early and were given a table that we quickly changed to a booth.  Servers very accommodating."}
{"text":"We came here for my birthday, and service was phenomenal.   I had the shrimp and grits and the chopped salad. My date had the scallops and everything was simply perfect.  Definitely make a reservation because this place was busy! But if you do get a chance, request a booth. It's fun to people watch. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I just moved here and a friend came to visit. I was looking for a fun place with good food.   Citizen Public House did not disappoint. The staff was friendly, accommodating, and gave excellent recomendations. The drinks were excellent. The chopped salad was a great start. The short rib was tender and flavorful. I have allergies, and when the desert had nuts that we didn't know about, the waiter ran off and got me a desert I could have. I can't wait to go back.  My only complaint was that I was so full I could not eat the whole next day."}
{"text":"We were completely confused when we walked in as we thought this would be an Irish pub i.e.: \"Public House\". We were immediately disappointed as we were looking forward to fish and chips. However, we drove pretty far to get there so decided to stay. It was pretty trendy and fancy with high prices and an odd menu. Our server Sean was Extremely helpful in guiding us and explained the name means 'a house the public of all types can come to'. Ok, but as we looked over the menu, it was odd foods. He explained that their chopped salad is a favorite and worth every bite.  My husband is not a salad guy but ordered it based on the server's advice. I ordered the ramen soup and we hoped. Both of these things were on the menu as appetizers. Food was odd and the salad looked small. However, take one bite and wow! Wow! Such bold flavors in the soup with a par-boiled egg, bacon, kimchee, and chopped thai chilies in a dark broth. Loved every spoonful and couldn't finish it. So spicy! The chopped salad was incredible! Smoked salmon, freeze-dried corn, currants, pumpkin seeds...all melded together so that every bite was amazing. It filled up my husband and that is not easy! LOL! We will go back but will be better dressed.  As an aside, one of the female servers near our table smelled sooo bad! She was blond, thin and looked like a hippie mess. She smelled like pachouli, BO and dirt and every time she came by our area, I had to hold my breath. YUCK!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner with a friend, def a fan."}
{"text":"Classy,  casual with excellent , friendly service!!!  I had a Scottsdale blonde beer and my friend had a Gentlemen's Jack  . I splurged  ordered The bacon topped popcorn, it goes perfect with a ice cold beer! I will definitely be back for the Citizens social they serve 3-6 pm everyday."}
{"text":"Awesome crafted cocktails! Love this spot for happy hour. Great atmosphere and staff."}
{"text":"Excellent service! Fabulous food! Warm and modern ambiance!  The wait staff was cheerful and helpful, which made our dining experience very pleasurable.   On to the food . . .  the chopped salad is something to come back for with all the different textures of the ingredients and merried mixture of flavors. The porkbelly steak was outstanding and my partner loved the scallops. The star was the bread pudding (bacon pieces in every other bite was perfect) with homemade cinnamon ice cream.  I can't go back soon enough.  I miss you already bread pudding."}
{"text":"Really yummy from start to finish. Service rocked. I'm not one for long posts, so there ya go. Go, and go early... eat and enjoy."}
{"text":"Pricey, but worth it for a nice evening out! I'm from New England and hesitated when the server suggested scallops...in Arizona? But I'm so glad I went with his suggestion; they were prepared perfectly. Drinks were excellent, too."}
{"text":"We went for my wife's birthday with another couple. We had a great time. The service was excellent. The food was really good with a varying selection of different tastes that played on comfort food.  The atmosphere was really happening. Not very quite or romantic, but a good place to party with a group."}
{"text":"From the moment we walked in we were greeted with smiling faces. Once we sat down we meet our waiter. He truly was an amazing man. Gary was his name. He called us love and treated us like royalty! He helped us order since it was our first time. We had the most amazing cosmopolitan! For apps we had the pork and waffles and it was yummy. Dinner we had the chicken and it was to die for. The food was impressive and very fresh! But most of all, Gary was perfection! All you waiters out there should take note and follow his lead. Lots of love to Gary!!! We will be back!!!"}
{"text":"I would like to apologize to the restaurant and all the customers for the profanities I yelled out after my first bite of that pork belly pastrami. I couldn't control myself. It was beyond ridiculous. That was probably one of the best pieces of meat I've eaten in a long time.  The rest of the meal was great as well. The field greens and the cheese plate were both delightful starters.  The crab cakes were a little bit on the smaller side, definitely the lowlight of the meal.  The lamb burger that my gf and I split was juicy, flavorful and well cooked. The fries were great. Thin flat slices of the potatoes, very different from the other fries I've had.  Service was great. Our waiter seemed friendly and honest.   Overall, it was a very nice meal in Scottsdale. 4 stars for the complete meal, but throwing an extra star on there for the pork belly, that was just awesome."}
{"text":"Amazing!!!! Citizens has a great atmosphere, great service & incredible food!!! Id eat there every day of the week if I could!!"}
{"text":"My dad and I joined the crew at citizen on. Sunday, but that didn't dampen the vibe.  Great cocktails, meatloaf and short ribs were sure fire Sunday dinner winners.  Would have spent all night there !"}
{"text":"Hands down, this is the best restaurant in downtown Scottsdale. During multiple visits in the past few weeks, we tried a variety of appetizers and main courses. Every dish was delicious and the service is always good. Our favorite is the scallop entree which was cooked to perfection and seasoned delicately. This is my favorite restaurant in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"I love it here. It has a really unique name and I had the best time.  Went here on the first day of Restaurant week - and I had several dishes.  Started with the chop salad which had a very unique flavor, crunch and dried corn. It was interesting.  Moved into Halibut and dessert - all was awesome.  I sat at the bar and had an awesome time. The service was great and I will visit again."}
{"text":"This place was just 'eh' to me!  I was just whelmed, not over or under!  The service at the bar leaves little to be desired!  I am not sure what it is about Scottsdale restaurants thinking they have to be snobby to people.  We ordered drinks from an un-friendly bartender and then waited another 20 minutes to even be acknowledged again!    The food was ok!  The bf had the berrimundi which he liked but wasn't wild about the side it came with.  I had the meatloaf, which was good.  The gravy and mashed potatoes had a great creamy flavor.  My sister had the lamb burger with fries that were cold and not very tasteful.  There is not much on the wine list either.  I probably would not come back here because I dont think it was worth the hour wait for the crappy service at the bar.  I would rather venture down the road to Olive and Ivy."}
{"text":"Perhaps we just went on a bad night? Ordered the wrong things off of the Late Night menu?  I was SO excited to check this place out, especially after reading the many great reviews on the food and service here. I'm sad to report that our experience lacked the luster that I was so looking forward to. :(  Off of the Late Night menu we ordered the ribs, wings, and hummus & tzatziki. The ribs had nice texture, but there was no flavor to it at all! Same with the wings. It literally tasted like the wings had been sitting on the counter the whole day, and someone just threw a bunch of extra sauce on top of the wings before serving it to us. Not pleasant to eat at all.  The hummus & tzatziki, though? Very good.   What really disappointed me about this meal is that it seemed as though our server KNEW that the food was going to turn out pretty badly. He asked us if the food we ordered was enough for us, but never asked if we were enjoying the meal. When I proceeded to let him know that I thought the food was \"okay\" his response was...and I quote...\"yeah, but is it ENOUGH?\" I didn't think it was a very polite or appropriate response.  It also didn't help that he got our order wrong...twice. He even asked us to repeat our order three times, and he still brought out the wrong dish. Maybe he was trying to discreetly tell us that we didn't choose good dishes?  Regardless, I'm not going to go out of my way to try this place again. Perhaps if I'm in the area, I'll give the real menu (and not the Late Night menu) a go, but at this point, I'm not entirely sure it would be worth it.  If you do decide to try this place, hope your experience is better than mine!"}
{"text":"We loved this restaurant!  Our waiter was extremely informative about every item on the menu.  We started with the fried oysters (he didn't recommend to us, we thought they sounded good) and it was the only thing that we did not care for.  Lots of breading and not a lot of flavor.  Next we had the pork belly appetizer which was delicious.  What a unique blend of flavors and even my husband (who is not a veggie lover) liked the brussel sprout slaw.  He had the short ribs and I couldn't stop asking him for another bite!   I had the salad, which was full of flavor and every bite was wonderful.  We bought a bag of pecan/bacon brittle and I wish we would of bought two!!!!!  Yum ... we will definitely come back to this restaurant when we visit!"}
{"text":"Bacon-wrapped scallops with grits! Wow are they delicious as is the chopped salad. The scallop was tender and perfectly seared and the grits were heavenly and creamy.  Honestly I've never had a bad meal here, only downside is that it's a bit noisy. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"First of all, let's state the important stuff. Yes this place is pricey, and be prepared to sustain a heavy hit on your wallet if you're planning a dinner with your loved ones here. But the question is, is it worth it? Totally! We ordered a bunch of stuff here last night, including the burrata and crab cakes for starters, and the roasted chicken and scallops for the main courses. All of them were spectacular. For drinks we tried their house cocktails and were not disappointed either. However, the server's attitude could be better. If your customers are spending $200 on a meal, then they should deserve the humblest behavior, and suggestions/recommendations on every level. Not quite satisfied with the cocky attitude of the person serving our food though, but otherwise definitely a good return on investment!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed this one.   The chopped salad is pushed pretty hard but well worth it. I stated it was very similar to Cowboy Ciao only to find the chef worked there for 14 years. Still, very yummy.   I ordered the osso buco.  Out of this world!  I was full, but wanted more. Going to go back to try more specials.   Server was terrific. Recommend reservations."}
{"text":"I decided to give this place a whirl yesterday on my lunch about 5pm from work  the space was nice open airy the staff from front of the house to The wait staff all were very friendly linens on the tables as well as linen napkins the only thing was the menu was a little lack luster the appetizer selection was fair. Hummus,tzatziki  , served w/flat bread ,selection of olives a couple of pork belly selections I had the lamb burger I ordered medium it was served a more rare but was still good the did offer some higher priced entrees and there were other selections of burgers and sandwiches thus the name gastro pub  they had some good beers on tap"}
{"text":"Pretty solid, fun restaurant in the 5th Avenue plaza in Scottsdale.  My boyfriend and I were here for a weekend trip and I decided to pick up some to-go for us while he took a long nap. The staff is very accommodating and super friendly. This is a great place to go on a date night and the ambiance is cute - also, I do believe they're open late. Staff gave great recommendations and I ended up ordering the famous chopped salad and truffle grilled cheese along with some bread and olive oil on the side.  Overall thoughts - chopped salad was good (it has its own Facebook URL) but not amazing. Solid 4/5 stars. As for the truffle grilled cheese it was the same - good 4/5 stars but felt that a little more cheese would've made it even more melt in your mouth.  I'd definitely come back. Make reservations as it looks like this place gets busy fast."}
{"text":"Salad, chicken and waffels, and the lamb burger.  So good."}
{"text":"Food:  Good. We got the famous chopped salad for an appetizer to share, the pork chop and the scallops.  The 'famous' chopped salad was really quite good and a nice twist on a something of a staple.  Really liked the presentation before it was mixed... not as pretty after they mix it, but tasted great.  The pork chop was a bit dry and overcooked, but the portion was healthy and the sides were quite good.  The scallops were extremely well done, and the mix of flavors in this main was really good.  Serving size was on the smaller side.  Ambiance:  Really very nice. We arrived early for dinner and had the restaurant largely to ourselves until near the end.  Very nice furniture, setting, etc.  Good music (blues) that went well with their overall theme.  People showed up on all types of attire, but I'd suggest business casual type attire to avoid feeling under-dressed.  Service:  Really very good.  They remembered that we had a show to get to and were very conscious of getting us out and to the show on time.  The waitress was attentive, pleasant, and had good suggestions.   They were finishing up preparing for the dinner rush during out meal and the bits and pieces we overheard, the attention to detail was really quite impressive and more than we expected.  Prices:  Considering the neighborhood, etc. not horrible, but not cheap.  $100 for 2 drinks, an appetizer and two mains.  I'd say the $$ rating is off...it should be $$$.  I'd be impressed if you escape for less than ~$35/person and I'd bet that is an uncommon occurrence.  Tip:  You really need to try the chopped salad... it really does deserve the hype.  Net:  Great place for a night out if you're going to hang in Scottsdale for the evening or first date (trying to make a good first impression).  For the price, the portions need to be a bit bigger and consistently excellent to hit 5 stars, but a solid 4 IMO."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite spots in old town! The atmosphere is cool and romantic. They have a great bar, amazing appetizers, and even better entrees. I love their original chopped salad or the scallops! Honestly, no matter what you order, I don't think you would be disappointed.   Definitely a great place to spend an evening with the people you love, eating food you'll love!"}
{"text":"For our first time here, it was a pretty good experience. Tip: make reservations or get there early. Saturday night we got there around 6:30 & the only seating was around the bar. Thank God there were four open seats. We ordered a few drinks. Not the best we've had that day (considering we started at the Second Story Liquor Bar...BOOM) but we had food & drinks. I ordered the pork belly pastrami. That LITTLE plate of food was AWESOME! Flavor packed & delicious. The next time we'll make reservations so we can sit on that awesome patio!"}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in the valley hands down. The service was great. Food was delicious. Go try. You won't be disappointed. I'm a food snob too. :)"}
{"text":"Really great food, location, service and people watching. The Fifth Ave. area is a wonderful package deal. You stroll around the galleries and shops then go eat terrific food. Just go."}
{"text":"probably really a 3.5 for food overall but rounding up for great service and really accommodating staff who treated me, my friend, and her baby really nicely!  the good: grilled cheese. i know, it's such a dumb thing to order, but it sounded so good and it was. melty cheese on super buttery, soft white bread, aromatic truffle oil, and an added surprise of mashed potatoes. so satisfying. it came with a little salad that was way too drenched in dressing that we didn't end up eating though.  the chopped salad was amazing! i was really skeptical but i was wrong. the pesto dressing on it was perfect and not too heavy, and all the textures together just worked incredibly well. it was also my first time having freeze-dried corn, which i give two thumbs up in this context.  the okay: pork belly pastrami. i liked this dish - it was greazy and salty like i expected, but the reason i got it was for the brussels sprouts sauerkraut. this was part was disappointing because i love kraut and i love brussels sprouts, but this didn't really taste like either. i might have expected too much.  chicken gizzzards - this was decent, as most fried food is to me. i don't think i would get it again though. it wasn't terribly interesting or flavorful. but it is a huge portion.  bacon peach pie - extra points for the delicious crust, but the inside wasn't anything special. it had bits of bacon, but it didn't really add anything to pie. sounded much better in theory.  the bad: i had a sazerac since it was on their house drinks menu. it just tasted like whiskey, which i can't complain about, but i wanted a sazerac!  the staff were super nice! we asked for a quieter spot since it was almost baby's bedtime and they were super accommodating and the hostess was very sweet. the service was attentive, and on our way out, someone offered to help us with the stroller. i assumed they probably didn't get a lot of babies through their doors, but everything about the place was a nice laid-back atmosphere with nice people and not hoity toity. overall a really great experience for my first-ever restaurant in arizona!"}
{"text":"This one was always on my list to try so I decided to check it out for a early Sunday dinner.  First of all, this place is in a perfect location in old town (and yes there is a patio). My friend and I did some splitting of dishes and that was just great.   Started off with a sangria, which I would highly recommend, it was very flavorful and not your typical approach. For an appetizer, we went for the fondu, served with a Swiss type cheese along with pear, sausage and homemade bread. For the main course, we tried the fried chicken with brussel sprouts. The entree was served perfectly and they split it for us on two plates :)   Our server was very friendly and helpful. She kept trying to keep our fondue warm and lit outside, but the wind kept blowing the flame out! I will absolutely come back to try different items on the menu :)"}
{"text":"Aaaamazing!!! I wanted to come here because of all the great yelp reviews.  Then I was worried that it was just an overhyped place and we almost canceled our reservation. I'm sooo glad we didn't! The food and service was honestly the best. Everything we ate, we loved. I was really impressed.  The bread plate with the black garlic butter and bacon jam - who knew that combo would be so yummy.  The cobb salad that everyone raves about is completely rave worthy. Good quality smoked salmon, and the combo of ingredients is perfect.  We loved the crab cakes and the scallops entree. After sharing all those dishes the two of us were beyond stuffed.  The service was excellent! Highly recommend trying this restaurant. It was the best place we ate all weekend!"}
{"text":"Ahhhhhhmazing food and service. Chopped salad, truffle grilled cheese and scallops were all delish! Prices were very reasonable. Service was excellent.  Vibe was good. 5 stars!"}
{"text":"A friend chose Citizen for her birthday dinner and I wasn't thrilled with the small menu, but I ended up finding a few things that looked pretty good. It was my first experience with the original chopped salad and it was F'in delicious.   She was turning 29, so most of us are too young to be saying this, but the general consensus was that it was too dark, too loud and too warm, so that's the lower rating. The service was average, but she did let us know ahead of time that they couldn't split that many checks and helped up split it up as best she could.  I'd definitely return for a special occasion with a smaller group or likely, just a significant other."}
{"text":"Chiropractic Rehabilitation Center. Great office ... great staff ... great treatment!  I was referred to this office after a horrible first experience with another office and wow am I impressed.  Excellent attention and treatment in a very clean and presentable office.  From the young lady at the front desk who always has a beautiful smile to the ladies that provide your treatment to the doctors themselves.  You won't be disappointment."}
{"text":"Per the waiter's recommendation, we ordered the chopped salad, short ribs and scallops.  The chopped salad is definitely something that you must try once.  It's different compared to other chopped salads.  Now that I've tried it once, not sure I'll order it again.  It's unique and good.  The short ribs were very tender and good.  Nice tangy BBQ sauce and the parsnip puree was light and delicious.  My husband loved the scallops and said they were cooked perfectly.  In addition, they came over grits.  He typically doesn't like grits but loved the grits.  We also tried the peanut butter paradise for dessert, also very good."}
{"text":"Awesome service and great food. The host was so great he remembered my name as we were leaving on a busy Saturday night."}
{"text":"Place pretty much empty with an hour but the crowded bar is available. Seems like it is more important for you to accommodate them."}
{"text":"Good was awesome. Had the original chopped salad and it was definitely something to try. Finished off with the apple bacon bread pudding and it exceeded all expectations.  The portions are a little small, but I was still definitely full by the end of the meal. Will be back to try the other things on the menu and the barrel aged cocktails!"}
{"text":"We came to Citizen during a vacation to Scottsdale. We made a reservation, which I recommend doing - it was busy in there!  We arrived early for our reservation, and had a drink at the bar to start. I was DD, so I just had a soda water (womp woooomp), but my pals had some fancy cocktails, which they loved, though they did seem a bit pricey.  Seeing the bartender made me really happy because he was clearly living his best life, loving his job, and being an all-around awesome human. Bearded bartender, if you can see this, you're great!  The host saw us to our table, and this isn't the kind of place that forces you to settle up with the bar before you go to your table, which I appreciated immensely. We were seated inside near the patio, but it was quite chilly. The host had no problem finding us a new place to sit. She was incredibly nice and accommodating, and it was clear that our comfort was important to her.  Our server was a friendly fellow who made some good recommendations. On his recommendation I had the scallops on polenta and it was delicious, but again, pricey.  The bathroom had a candle that smelled like cake.  This place lost points with me because it was super duper loud, and we found it to be a bit slow. It was also maybe a bit pricey for what it was.   I wouldn't object to coming here again, but it may not be my first recommendation."}
{"text":"Citizen is one of my favorite places to go for a nice meal with friends. We celebrated my boyfriend's birthday here with a big group (12 people) at prime-time on a Friday. They were great about taking and honoring our large reservation, and we only waited about 15 minutes for our tables to be set up, which was pretty reasonable for the group size we had. The servers that helped us did a great job of keeping our glasses full, and were very attentive, despite how many of us there were. My boyfriend and I started with the deep sea crab cakes, which were amazing!! I'm also a huge fan of the chop salad, so I knew before we walked in the door what I'd be ordering! No one in our reservation had any problems with their food, and everyone seemed to really enjoy the dinner. I'm so glad I chose CPH for the occasion; the ambiance is great, the food superb, and the service wonderful as always! Thanks for a fun, celebratory evening!"}
{"text":"Food was 4 stars.  Chopped salad is fun and delicious.  Sausage of the day was very good.  Chicken was pretty good but tasted a bit bland, corn risotto underneath was good.  Scallops were huge and savory on bed of grits, but it felt a bit stingy to only give 3 scallops.  4-5 would have been better, and not cost them a lot more really in ingrediants.  Atmosphere is upscale, trendy, clean lines, what you expect from any new upscale restaurant.  Service was extremely good.    So why 3 stars.  I could easily have put 4 stars.    But the food was NOT outstanding.  Good definately.  Very good, mostly.  Just nothing stood out as mind blowing.    Which is fined except when you are dropping around $100 for two people.  For $100, I expect outstanding.  Would I be back.  Sure.  Great place to go out with another couple, enjoy walking around, enjoy a good meal."}
{"text":"Never disappoints, we've eaten here easily two dozen times, and I'm thoroughly satisfied every time. I love their changing menu, was sad to see the Venison go, however. We always start with the Pork Belly Pastrami, Burrata, Pub Pork Cheek and Bernie's Mac 'n Cheese. Current favorites include the Duck Burger, Jerk Short Rib Tacos, Fair Trade Short Rib, Rack of Lamb, Seared Chia Tuna and Amaro Meatloaf. Everything is always prepared to perfection, and their masters of craft behind the bar will make the best concoctions you didn't even know existed! My person favorite is the Boulevardier."}
{"text":"Here every year in September and this has become a place to frequent by us. We were introduced two years ago with fantastic results. The food is excellent, service outstanding and drinks creative. Only missing the 5th star because I just feel they've gotten carried away with some cocktails. Clearly the mixologists are not having a hard time finding jobs these days as craft cocktails are all the rage. But sometimes when trying to get a leg up on the competition, maybe they started trying too hard... some classics shouldn't be messed with. I really don't want tobacco bitters in my Manhattan. Why? BecUse it makes my cocktail taste like an old used ash tray. We will still be back!"}
{"text":"I came here for a girls night out while I was in town.  Didn't realize it was affiliated with Cowboy Caio.  No wonder they have the same amazing salad :)  The atmosphere was casual with that Scottsdale feel.  Food, wine and dessert were all great!  Definitely a nice place to have a nice dinner and spend time with friends/family."}
{"text":"I love CPH. The servers are attentive, the atmosphere is lovely, food is delicious every time, and the cocktails are amazing and inventive."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! Came here on a date on a Saturday night in December, and the place was packed. With a reservation, you shouldn't have much of an issue though. Just a heads up, as with most places located in Downtown Scottsdale, you may have a tough time finding parking depending on the day/time you stop by. Anyhow, the place is adorable. It's a decently-sized restaurant with a lot of character. It's modestly decorated and the ambiance is pleasant.  My date ordered a gin cocktail, which was absolutely amazing! Taste was perfect and not too much flavoring to overcome the gin, which is always nice.   For dinner, I ordered the scallops and he ordered the prime rib. I didn't try any of his, but from what he said it was delicious. The scallops I had were the best I've ever tasted in my entire life. They didn't have an overpoweringly fishy smell or taste and literally melted in my mouth. Absolutely delicious! The only thing I would have to complain about would be that the greens the scallops are served with are rather tough, hard to cut through, and hard to chew. For dessert, we shared the bananas foster dish that they have, and it was pretty delicious as well.   Overall, I would absolutely return!"}
{"text":"Oh EM GEEEE, I absoluetly love Citizen! I have had so many dishes here and I love that they're open for late night dinning. The chopped salad is the best in the world!"}
{"text":"Great bar, great atmosphere, great service!  Citizen crafts classic old-school cocktails courtesy of Thomas and Rich.  ON top of that they have a few beers on draught, by the bottle and a pleasantly surprising wine selection.     Food-wise the menu is kinda geared towards comfort and southern style offerings including mac-n-cheese, scallops with bacon and corn grits, dungeness crab cakes with complementary slaw, pork-belly, etc  Again, overall good place to go for a casual and relaxing drink or two. Will be back for more..."}
{"text":"We ordered various items and shared: OG chopped salad, grilled octopus, seared scallops, pork belly pastrami, duck burger & the prime bavette steak.  Listed in order of tastiness: 1. scallops - i love seared scallops, especially when served with risotto. 2. chopped salad - believe the hype, it's really good 3. grilled octopus - tender, not chewy and enjoyed the watermelon gazpacho it was in 4. duck burger - fried egg makes everything better, duck fat fries was a plus 5. pork belly pastrami - it was perfect to share, can't imagine having it as a full meal, kinda salty 6. steak - was okay, nothing remarkable, wouldn't order it again - there's better dishes to be had  I would definitely come again & I would recommend to others."}
{"text":"FIrst experience there was great!  No reservation, but got us right in and the service was fantastic.  Food was as wonderful as expected from our experiences at the chef's former restaraunt and a pretty good variety for many types of diets.  Preview of the upstairs \"private club\" is interesting.  Will look forward to checking that out when it's ready!"}
{"text":"Fantastic gastro pub...very trendy layout.  Staff are very friendly and the food was delicious...would definitely go back"}
{"text":"First, I have to say that our waiter was a real talent.  I thought the menu was more limiting than I would have wished.  My main course was above average.  My desert was below average.  Leading to an overall three stars.  Who knows, on a different night it might be a different experience.  Not yet ready to rule it out or rule it in."}
{"text":"I was asked out on a date I couldn't refuse!  I had this place bookmarked, thinking it was a romantic place since it got rave reviews from married friends.  We walked in and I was a little shocked at how noisy and packed it was.  We were seated right by the bar.  It made it interesting to people watch, though.  We had such an excellent server, who was attentive.  Everyine was telling me \"Get the chopped Salad...don't forget to order the Chopped Salad!\"  So, I ordered the Chopped Salad!  That was one of the best chopped salad I've ever had, heck it even has it's own FB!  The ingredients simply lined up which consists of corn, smoked salmon, pearl couscous,  currants, asiago, pepitas, tomatoes and arugula tossed with buttermilk pesto dressing table side.  Crave!  My gorgeous date honed in on the Coffee Braised Short Ribs Ribs with a side of  cherry BBQ sauce,  perfectly executed along with a Malbec.    Mmmmn...Pan Fried Scallops topped the creamy polenta was just...just...incredible paired with a chilled glass of rosé.    We decided that this place is best for a group of friends to enjoy the cheerful ambiance.  We both decided that we did not have room for dessert at this moment.  Instead, the beautiful night called for a nice long walk...    Dessert continued at FnB."}
{"text":"This place was great! The food was good. Expected prices. They had some great original cocktails too. The portions weren't really big, but they filled you up. The atmosphere was nice too. It was in a great location too because we got to see a neat part of downtown scottsdale. Staff was friendly."}
{"text":"A decent place. Came here on a Wednesday night (in the summer) and was seated right away. Had the Kilter fondue for an appetizer and split the Mac N Cheese and Meatloaf for the meal. Fondue was typical but good. Mac n cheese was also decent but nothing special. The same cheese in the fondue is used in the Mac and cheese. The meatloaf was the best part. It was cooked well and very juicy. The zucchini on the side competed the plate nicely. Got the Black and Tan for dessert and surprisingly did not like it. A decent place but nothing extraordinary. It's sister restaurant The Gladly is much better but pricier."}
{"text":"Went on Monday  was fab!  Luke & Thomas took such great care of us. Food n service were awesome. Will frequent this place.  Great new vibes!  Good job guys!!  great vibe and look forward to many returns!"}
{"text":"Went here with a large group for a birthday party.  Service was excellent...until it wasn't.  Had to go ask for after dinner coffee, and the tab.  The age group ranged from low 20's to mid 70's and everyone was disappointed.  The music was too loud to carry on a conversation and just not \"right\" for this place.  It is suffering from an identity crisis in my opinion.    The food....meh.  The fondue beer dip was good, the mac and cheese was good.  The short ribs were fatty, the hamburger was rock hard and the hamburger bun dry, the chicken was o.k. and the salad was 'bitter'.    Definitely won't be on our rotation."}
{"text":"Dear Bernie,  I'll start by saying I wish I could give you as many stars as there are in they sky. We had dinner at your restaurant on Saturday July 9 and it was hands down one of the best experiences I've had in any restaurant. I eat all over the world and am so excited to come back and eat here again. First, Gary, our waiter, is a keeper and an exceptional waiter. A professional in every sense and he made the meal even better than if we'd just had your incredible food.   The food, well, everything was delicious and I've been dreaming of another chop salad since the moment I left. I tried to talk my party into going back the next night!! The mac and cheese named after you was creamy and perfect. I loved the hush puppies and my meatloaf. Topping the meal off with the carmel chocolate treat was a wonderful choice. Keep up the good work and we will see you as soon as I book my next trip to PHX. Thanks for setting a great standard for other restauranteurs!   Love always,  Maile"}
{"text":"Best chop salad I've had in my entire life!!! Shop around for a chop salad as good as theirs and I can promise nothing compares! The atmosphere and Ora of the restaurant was everything you could ask for in a bar restaurant. Fun classy romantic, you name it and you can always count I them to provide it! Great spot in old town."}
{"text":"Possibly the best restaurant in Phoenix.  Thr service is amazing. Everyone is friendly. The chopped dalad changes lices. As does the beef belly BLT which is my favorite on the menu."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is quite fun with energy and great for couples and groups. Moderate level of noise. Simple but nice design. Great area for walking around Old Town! I ordered the Sangria, which is house made and it was quite good but a bit sweet for my liking. The scallops were from Maine and the entire dish was enjoyable but scallops were more gritty than normal (I love scallops). The purred grits that they are served over top of was very tasty and it will give you a cream fix for those who don't, or can't eat cream based sauces. I can't usually do desert but I was able to love and tolerate the flour-less, gluten free chocolate mint cake. It was more like a fudge but way lighter! I also had a a nice glass of ice wine from Canada (the best area by far for ice wine) and it was perfect!  The waitress (Cat) was very very sweet and pleasantly knowledgable about the menu. Perfect for this type of Restaurant, while attentive and happy! This is a fine stop in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, awesome service, delicious food...  I really wish I could remember our server's name because he was so friendly and attentive. Gerry? Gary? He knew the menu like the back of his hand and gave us honest recommendations for food and drinks when we asked him.     I wouldn't say the menu was huge and extensive but enough to choose from.  From the handful of items we ordered, I believe they are quality over quantity here.   Prices may seem a bit pricey but the food was delicious so well worth it.  Pork belly pastrami-  Oh my gosh so good.   Original chopped salad- Had to try this bc it's so raved about.  My first thought was how can a salad be so amazing?  So crazy how simple, fresh ingredients with a tasty dressing can be so yum.  I recommend. Get it.  Short ribs entree- Deeelish.  Short ribs just melt in your mouth, great sauce.   Pudding dessert-  We had some sort of peanut butter and banana pudding thing recommended by our waiter.  I'm not much of a dessert girl but this was yum.  Hubby enjoyed it since he loves pb and banana combos.  FYI: There's a happy hour here but I don't remember the time since we just missed it when we arrived for dinner.   I'm still bummed I didn't try the bacon fat popcorn!"}
{"text":"If I lived in Scottsdale I'd probably be broke in a short amount of time because I'd be spending all my money buying cocktails at Citizen Public House. Drinks like The Persian (Absolut Wild Tea vodka, St. Germain elderflower liqueur, housemade sweet & sour, Persian cucumber juice, lemon peel, served on the rocks) or the Citi-Zen (Absolut Pear vodka, Domaine de Canton ginger liqueur, housemade sweet & sour, rock candy, lemon twist, served up.)   Or I might find myself slipping in through the back door to head to the upstairs speakeasy, buying a tableside gin and tonic and laughing my best mad scientist laugh while doing so.  Or I might just have to eat the Chopped Salad every.single.day of the rest of my life.  Or I might live on Bacon Fat Heirloom Popcorn alone.  All I know is that it's a good thing I don't happen to live in Scottsdale..."}
{"text":"Every time I am in Scottsdale, I come in here at least once. The food is fantastic, and the drinks are great, too. I love the space, & the dark wood beams against a light wall w/ dim lighting make it a spot for any occasion. The staff is very friendly & accommodating, & they will ensure you enjoy your visit. I HIGHLY recommend the Chopped Salad & the duck (if available), but all the food is wonderful. I highly recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Fantastic barrel drinks and it is an easy go-to default restaurant for business or fun."}
{"text":"One word...awesome!  We started off with the crab cakes; they were very good and so was the bed of slaw they were served over.  The chopped salad is like no other chopped salad I have had before, yum!  The service was spot on.  Citizen Public House does everything right!"}
{"text":"Came here for a work dinner w/ some partners visiting from out of town and was very impressed. It had a great atmosphere for a business dinner and I was impressed by both the food and drink menus. I had this delicious crusted ahi dish and look forward to coming back to taste more of the menu!"}
{"text":"A great restaurant and bar with a trendy assortment of foods and drinks ranging from the rosemary roasted nuts to the bacon fat infused pop corn.  The service at this place is first rate.  The employees know their dishes and their drinks.  The location is smack dab in the heart of Old Scottsdale.  A fine selection of beers, hard liquor, energy drinks, etc.    A great choice!"}
{"text":"After all the reviews - some from folks that I respect greatly - I'm hoping this was just an anomaly... so here goes...  Food:  Chopped salad ... fantastic - but my dining companion and I ordered it to share, and when brought to the table, the server mixed it and divided it between the four diners - each just having a spoon full or two to taste.  Not wanting to embarrass anyone - we went with it ... but they should make note of that in the order and serve accordingly.  My short ribs were under-done - meat was cooked - but - short ribs require long and slow cooking to melt away the fat and leave the yummy goodness.  My meat was so loaded with fat that I spent most of my meal trying to find lumps of meat that were edible and separate from the heavy fat layer.  Fail.  The seasonal veggie appeared to  be swiss chard or something similar - tough - long strings - not a lot of flavor - not tender.  The parsnip puree was good.  Another diner had the meat loaf that the server praised.  Large portion - but very dense and not a lot of flavor - saved by the sauce from my short ribs.  Another companion had the filet and greatly enjoyed his.  Drinks:  Moscow mule - so so - not overwhelmed with that.  The Citizen cocktail was enjoyed.  The Tilia malbec, Mendoza, Argentina wine - \"one note\".  Not good, not enjoyable.  Those who had the Sazerac really enjoyed that - though it was a very small serving in a small glass.    Service:  Our server was great - but almost too \"animated\" for my liking ... but over all (other than the salad situation) - service was good - though it took a LONG time between courses and also to have plates cleared.  Atmosphere:  Nicely decorated and in a fun area of town.  BIGGEST complaint though is the noise level.  We couldn't hear the conversation of the folks sitting on the other side of the table - this after moving once to find a more quiet table.  There's nothing in the space to help deaden the sound - hard surfaces floor to ceiling - and perhaps - the architecture of the ceiling is the culprit.  Patio would have been nice - but it was taken by a private party.  Men's room needed a splash of clorox by the urinal ... Lastly - it was a bit on the warm side.  Not sure I'll go back ... hate to risk a good evening at these prices.  Wish I could have had the meal so many others seem to have enjoyed."}
{"text":"We went to Scottsdale Waterfront area and picked Citizen Public House for dinner.  One word of warning, no water allowed from the outside.  I was coming in and was told that I could not bring in my water to the restaurant.  I have been to five star restaurants and I have never been told this, however here, no water.  Go figure.  It does not even matter if you have health issues, you cannot bring in your own water.  Very strange.  The service was very good and prompt.  Our waiter was very knowledgeable on all the different drinks and recommendation on the menu.  Very genuine as well.  We settled on the Pork Loin for dinner.  The salad was just ok as the house dressing has a blue cheese kinda look and feel and taste.  Not my taste and no Ranch.  They really do hate California in Az.    LOL   The main course was cooked to perfection!  It also tasted as if it was brined.  So juicy and tender!  Highly recommend it!    For dessert we had the peanut butter push pop ice cream dessert and that was also very tasty.  So great service, very good food, just don't bring your water!!  LOL!!!"}
{"text":"Just ok. Nothing super impressive. Food was good, not great. Nice atmosphere but wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"GREAT chopped salad!  Glad to see the chef was so generous and shared the recipe with others around town! I had a great short rib entree and some yummy wine!"}
{"text":"This was an excellent new find! Thank you, Yelp!  The restaurant is beautiful and the service is wonderful. I tried the Watermelon salad as a starter. Incredible. This was followed by Fair Trade Short Ribs with a rub from Roastery of Cave Creek  roasted parsnip puree, dried cherry bbq sauce, sautéed greens.   My dinner was amazing and...oh yeah, great wine list, too!  Very good value as well!"}
{"text":"Thomas the bartender and the great food is why we keep coming back. We went Tues. for social hour, when the wine is 1/2 price a glass. Excellent selection, my wife had a Jordan Chard. and I had a Tempranillo from Spain, very good. For food the lamb burger can't be beat and the scallops are outstanding. The pita and hummus app. is a good starter too. Jenna is right the pork belly pastrami is a definite crowd pleaser. A very welcoming atmosphere, even when a tray of sangria was dumped, everyone remained calm and jumped into action. Everyone except the customer who bumped into the waiter. We will be back, next time for the duck!"}
{"text":"Unreal Food!!! A little abbrehensive at first because of the menu but our server Katie gave us a great run down and suggestions.  Awesome food, service, and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Food was good and service was good ... not as great as I was expecting.  Environment and response was the worst I have experienced in a restaurant in a long time.  It was Father's Day and it was very busy.  We were sat at a table with the A/C blowing right on us.  Hard to believe that on a 111 degree day I would feel cold, but everyone at our table was freezing.  There were no other tables open and we should have left, but we didn't.  After dinner as we were leaving I remarked to our waiter about our experience.  He had (whom I presume was) the manager meet me on my way out, and he was very dismissive and not very apologetic ... somewhat telling of the customer experience you can expect to receive here.  I don't expect to return soon."}
{"text":"Best meal I've had in the Phoenix area since moving here last year.  Collectively, we order the chopped salad, filet mignon, and the scallops. Everything was absolutely amazing. My manhattan was equally impressive. I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, excellent prices. Only issue, service a little slow but, we were not in a hurry."}
{"text":"This place has a really great scaled back elegance. I love the energy that the large bar in the center of the space creates. My only complaint is that the lack of soft surfaces contributes to an incredibly loud atmosphere.  On to the food! I've had the mussels there twice. Each time prepared differently. Each time delicious, hearty, and perfect for soaking up the broth with their airy bread.   Their 'Original Chopped Salad' is definitely a must order! There are several textures and flavors in this salad that individually stand out, but also peacefully come together to create a memorable and satisfying moment on your palette.   My experience so far is that I'm a huge fan of everything on the left side of the menu (small plates, apps, salads,etc). It's not that the sandwiches and entrees (only tried the roasted chx) weren't nicely prepared, but they just aren't to my taste. Too much flavor, or not enough. Not a fan of their fries.   Their wine selection is fantastic. There is a great range of varietals and price points to choose from.  The service is wonderfully friendly! All the staff that I've encountered are very knowledgeable about the wines and the menu.  Lastly... the owner is cute! Had to say it."}
{"text":"Food is f-ing amazing the atmosphere the bartenders are nice the servers act like actually care about you. What more could you ask for. Great place for a first date and then hit old town."}
{"text":"Must check out their upper bar, which apparently is known by word-of-mouth. It's open on Thursdays and weekends where mixologist create unique drinks. You can dress up or show up casual as last time I went there was a guy in his nursing clothes. My favorite drink was the Barbie Girl, mostly because I couldn't get over the fact that I was drinking pearl dust. Their presentations are enthralling and if you like a strong drink I recommend the New Yorker! If you're a gin and tonic person like myself then I definitely recommend their G and T."}
{"text":"The chopped salad was spectacular! Definitely an item everyone should order. I ordered scallops. They were good. My dining partner ordered the Cubano sandwich. It wasn't a hit. I will definitely return next time I'm in the area!It was really busy and that may have led to inconsistent service. We observed some of the tables around us receiving phenomenal service, while some of us were left sitting with less attention."}
{"text":"Went there last night, sat at the bar. Great service ! The food was D-LISH as well. I am a fan ! I had the Barramundi and my friends had the smart chicken and the short ribs. WE were all very happy with our dishes. Can't wait to try them out again and go up for a cocktail at their new bar :)"}
{"text":"Went here because of restaurant week and just had to try the \"famous\" chop salad.  I am wondering if that was the regular size or a smaller portion as part of the meal.  The scallops were huge so getting 3 is no biggie, I am actually about to eat the rest of it.  My hubby got the lamb burger, he loves lamb, and it was really good but a little greasy/oily on the bottom.  He liked the fries with the cardamom ketchup but I didn't care for them, but I did really enjoy the \"pickles\".  The restaurant is open but with that come loudness, the acoustics aren't very good.  Really liked how the bathroom looked and how the stalls didn't make you feel like you were trapped in a tiny box.  The host guys were super friendly, both on the phone and in person, I called today to make a reservation but ended showing up an hour early.  Bussers quickly came by with water and Kent introduced himself as our server.  Dinner started a bit disappointing and my side plate was dirty but then became much better after the first round of food came.  Will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Ordered a filet mignon to go. Burnt. Dry. Disgusting. Posted the photo. Ordered it medium and asked specifically to make sure it's not medium well. Worst steak I've ever had. Does the chef have any dignity left?"}
{"text":"Bravo.   Valentines day success.   We called at the last minute and got the best seat in the house on valentines day at 530PM.  We called for reso at 515Pm  Talk about accomodating.   We loved the seat on the patio, It would have been the seat I would have picked.  The place was packed, but that a couple left on the patio.  Great service at the door.  It was  a prefixe menu and wow did they kill it.  Me and the wifey had filet mignon that was to die for, and my mother and father in law had Scallops and Meatloaf.  Every dish was perfectly done.   Great beers and specialty drinks, wine was cool. We have a great server that hooked us up with wines for the happy hour@!  I had a great beer, one of my favorites. Guinness on tap.....mmmmm Dessert was bread pudding and fudge cake with icecream...perfect for the sweet tooth in the crowd.  ME!     Bravo, thanks for being our heros for one night on Valentines, you saved the day!        We will be back,  best part, we live in Vegas and will visit you here too.  Since you have a location here.    Thanks again, great job!  5 Star Service and food, location , pretty stellar for a nighttime stroll on the streets of Scotttsdale for shopping and arts district shops.   5 STARS  All of em!"}
{"text":"It might be premature after only one visit to give this place five stars but if it's not it's awful darn close to five stars as I couldn't find one darn thing wrong with our dinner or service we had here. The room is a bit on the dark side but it's crisp linen and shiny silverware. The menu goes from very casual with bar food to sandwiches to maybe about a half dozen dinners.  Upton entering we were greeted warmly and whisked to a table. Our server was very professional, explained the specials and was friendly. The cocktails we tried were good and also packed punch.  We started with a special appetizer of an all house made plate of Tasso that came with  mustard and pickles. Everything was excellent even the pickled okra and pickled watermelon rind.  My plate of Pacific Rock-fish with curry millet and stewed okra and tomatoes was delicious as well. The fish was fresh, seasoned and prepared well. The curry millet was a curry for curry lovers meaning full strength flavor and was an interesting healthy alternative grain to use. Bird seed just never tasted that good before. I sort of feared stewed okra because I have had it before and didn't enjoy it's texture but in this dish it was enjoyable and anybody would like it because it had a fresh crispness to it and picked up the delicious sweet flavor of the small tomatoes.  I was too busy with my plate to try my husband's Amaro Meatloaf but he said it was very good and also enjoyed the potatoes. he said, \"they taste just like your potatoes\" I take that as a compliment.  The waiter described a very refined adult style nut butter and boozy fruit sandwich as dessert that I wanted to try but unfortunately I was too busy with my plate to have room for it.   Very very good  don't know if everything on menu is as good as what we tried but what we tried was excellent."}
{"text":"We were Restaurant Hopping and this was last on our list.  I loved the outdoor/indoor seating and location of this hot new dining spot!  But as for the items we had....the only thing good was the chopped salad and service. We tried the Crab Cakes (too much red peeper not enough crab)  &  Bread Pudding (which was too hard to cut through).  Now after saying that I would definitely go back for the atmosphere and chopped salad because the chopped kale with the pesto ranch salad dressing was absolutely delicious and I would like to try some of the other menu items."}
{"text":"Service was great but food was disappointing. Pork belly was too greasy and my short ribs were way too sweet. Mashed parsnips were sickly sweet with an odd aftertaste. The fries with the lamb burger had a strange texture. I don't think they used the right potatoes.    I really wanted to love this place from all the great reviews but am truly left disappointed."}
{"text":"Good food.  Good atmosphere.  Good service.  Scallops are especially good.  Good wine list too."}
{"text":"What happened to the original chopped salad i had a few years ago?  This one was missing the arugula, golden raisins, roma tomatoes and other ingredients that made it so robust before. The one i was served last night was a shadow of its former self. Service was good."}
{"text":"Came for restaurant week and it was my 3rd time there. I brought my dad from out of town and I was very excited to bring him here. He loves AZ and this just further made him gush over our beautiful town. The food is excellent and the service is outstanding. The staff is so knowledgable!"}
{"text":"We had a wonderful dinner at Citizen Public House tucked into old town Scottsdale while on vacation.   We made a reservation and were promptly seated when we arrived.   We started our meal with some fantastic cocktails and ordered a bottle of Chardonnay with dinner.   All our meals were delicious.   My wife ordered the scallops which were cooked perfectly.   One daughter ordered the meatloaf which was a huge portion and very tasty.   My other daughter and I ordered the monk fish in lobster broth.  I was skeptical but it was fantastic.  Many places don't do fish well but I was pleasantly surprised.   The lobster broth was so good!   The monk fish is one of my favorites and it crusted with a seasoning.   The meal was cheap but overall was one of our best meals while visiting Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I'm not exactly sure how we received an email notifying us about the opening of CPH....I'm just glad we did.  My guess is that we must have given our email when we ate at Cowboy Ciao several months ago.  In any case, my wife and I really enjoyed our dinner at CPH.  The waitress turned out to be the same one that helped us when we ate at Cowboy Ciao a few months back.  The calamari we ate was outstanding...the best tasting I've ever had.  The salad....that famous one with the facebook page....was awesome as always.  Then we had the rib roast...which was melt in your mouth good.  We'll be back for sure...soon!"}
{"text":"I really love this part of Scottsdale.  You have a vast choice of amazing restaurants.  We decided to try Citizen Public House.  The atmosphere is an energetic one.  I can't really remember the last time I went to a restaurant at 5:30 in evening and seen such a lively place.  Now for the food.  We started with the bacon popcorn.  I was only ok, but it was also only about $2 or so.  We decided to have the pork belly pastrami and the butternut squash soup.  The soup was ok, but I wouldn't order it again.  The pork belly was amazing.  I can't wait to go back and have it again. We shared the short rib.  It was a pretty healthy portion.  My husband and I were able to share one.  The bbq sauce was a tad bit on the bitter side.  I think I will try the scallops next time.  The cocktails were amazing.  I'm really into cucumber right now, so the Persian was to die for.  Service was great!  Our food came out quickly."}
{"text":"We went to citizen public house last night because we were in the old Town Scottsdale area and wanted to try somewhere new. We found this place on Yelp, of course, and saw that it had stellar reviews.  We got right in and were seated in the outdoor section and had AJ as our waiter. It was a fun atmosphere, well kept, and had a great appearance / decor. Our waiter was quick to give us recommendations when we were trying to decide between items, and was the first to tell us when he thought one thing was better than another. This is much appreciated, and as with other similar experiences, we've found the waiters who are willing to do so make excellent recommendations.   Our food was prepared perfectly. I had the lamb burger, which was seasoned well and came with a side of fries. I also tried their seasonal cider which was good. They have a full bar and wine selections as well. The patio area had a nice view overlooking the street. The price level was fairly average for a popular restaurant in Old Town Scottsdale.   My wife had the truffle grilled cheese, which she also enjoyed. For dessert we tried the brownie. It was a fudge brownie with chocolate chips and a scoop of ice cream on top, as well as, a caramel garnish. The only thing I would say that would make it better, was if the brownie was hot. Overall we had a good experience and I would be interested in coming back and trying other options on their menu."}
{"text":"Enjoyed Every Bite!  Hubby and I found this place and made a reservation on OpenTable about 45 minutes before we showed up.  We were a bit early... but they sat us right away.  Kristen our server was super nice and very efficient. We had a few different people helping us.  And the water guy was ninja-like... our water glasses were never empty.  Thank You, Ninja Water Guy!  We were parched after being in the sun and running around outside most of the day.  This place is a higher end type of place. \"White table cloth\" .... really it's white butcher paper on top of white table cloth.   The ambience is lively.... kinda noisy in fact.  So, if you are looking for a peaceful, romantic dinner for 2.... go some place else.  The service and food are top notch. We were in and out in about an hour... and we never felt rushed nor did we feel like we ever had to wait for anything.  We ordered a bottle of wine, a salad to share and 2 entrees... our bill with tax and tip was $134.... not cheap... but I felt it was worth the price considering the quality and taste of everything.  They start you off with bread bites and olive oil.  Good soft bread with really good olive oil that was medium bodied and had a nice flavor to it... not just a regular plain olive oil.  I thought it was a bit earthy with notes of grass and herbs.  We shared the Chopped Salad and it was just the right size for the 2 of us to start with.  It had Israeli CousCous and pumpkin seeds in it which are different and struck just the right notes to change up an otherwise plain salad into a tasty salad with different dimensions to it.  I enjoyed the Scallops on a bed of creamy polenta.  I pretty much licked the plate.  The Scallops were succulent and sooooooo good!   Hubby had the special which was a cashew encrusted halibut.  His too was tasty but the bed of (I think) rice had a spicy kick to it that was good but was just a bit too empowering for me.  Definitely a nice place to go to for dinner, and I'd put this on our \"Let's Go Back Again\" list."}
{"text":"Here in Scottsdale for spring training and didn't get home from the game, checked into our crib, freshened up till after 11 on a Friday night. Alas - weary and thirsty all was well after an amazingly delicious mezcal cocktail and a tasty burrata small bite.  Home Run."}
{"text":"Love this place! Everything I've tried has been delicious and the location is right amongst the Waterfront area. I'd highly recommend the beet salad and pork cheeks appetizers and just about every entree but the short ribs and ling cod standout!"}
{"text":"The original chopped salad and scallops with corn grits along with the above and beyond service is enough to have me coming back again and again!"}
{"text":"We chose to dine here solely based on the online reviews and it did not disappoint! I prefer restaurants with an energetic vibe and while this was the case, I could still have a conversation w/my date. Bar area had a good crowd and dining area was a large open space. I felt like the walls in this place needed a more color or something... Decor seemed to be pretty plain and didn't really go w/the vibe of the place. Cocktail of choice for the evening was The Persian and it was light and refreshing. I chose the whitefish special while my husband went with the short rib. While I preferred his short rib dish, both were delicious. Was not a fan of the Bacon Peanut Brittle. Overall I'd be back when in town."}
{"text":"I don't always get emotional over salad, but when I do, it's exclusively at Citizen Public House.  Had a delightful dinner consisting of two of their now world famous Chop Salad along with fondue.  Sam was our dining consultant...not a server and definitely not a waiter.  Ask for him when you go.  He truly loves what he does and it shows.  This is the only restaurant where I've geeked out about freaking salads, but they're geek-worthy.  Service here is top notch.  The next time my wife and I find ourselves in Scottsdale, we're here."}
{"text":"Tried the late night menu at the bar tonight, awesome food, awesome prices! Service was on point, thanks to Dustin! I greatly appreciate the industry discount for restaurant employees. We'll be back soon to try the full menu!"}
{"text":"I did have so many positives- great chopped salad, excellent flat bread... Service was good, not perfect because.... It sticks in my craw a bit that my entrée was inedible. I had the house ground filet/bacon burger. A great idea to add fat to the lean tenderloin,  but the bacon was too salty. I love bacon, and the ratio of fat to meat was right to hold the burger together, but man, taste it first! I did tell our waiter, and his reply was \"yeah I know, and that's without any seasoning\". Wrong answer. Spending $200 and I get that answer? Not cool."}
{"text":"I will add my vote with MANY others...... You have to try the chopped salad!  I celebrated my birthday with 2 friends out on the patio. We ordered several apps to share . That was plenty !  Our waiter was delightful, attentive without hovering. He gave excellent suggestions.  Will return if ever back in AZ !"}
{"text":"Delicious and cozy!! Everything on the menu here is amazing! The happy hour menu has incredible deals you won't find anywhere else in Scottsdale!!! Decent beer selection, yummy cocktails, service is impeccable. One can never go wrong with the Chefs Special."}
{"text":"Used to be a big fan, but something isn't the same. Smaller portions (3 scallops for an entree??), parsnips tasted poor, but at least the desserts were still good.  Sorry to say I'm not rushing back"}
{"text":"We have found our spot! Sat at the bar and the bartender  (guy with beard) was super cool. Amazing drinks and the food was on point. Make sure you try the cobb salad. I know...cobb salad sounds boring but theirs is probably some of the best food I've EVER eaten. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"My husband and I went there last night with our neighbors and it was amazing!  I am a huge fan of a place called Houston's.  It is my favorite restaurant and I could never imagine a place that I would rather go to instead.  However, I now have a new favorite restaurant.  Trust me, that is saying a lot!!!  My husband is a \"foodie\".  I am meat and potatoes and a creature of habit.  So, I go to all these fancy new restaurants he want to try and I always play it safe.   My husband is always adventurous and never orders the same thing twice.  I should have known how amazing the SHORT RIBS were by just the fact he ordered them again and says these are the only thing  he will ever order.  I am not a fan of previous short ribs I have eaten so I got the chicken.  My husband told me that this meal is better than Houston's ribs.  I said \"No, way\".  I must say when I took the first bite of his short ribs when they came out, I was in heaven.  He was right, the short ribs were better than Houston's ribs, by far.  It was like big chunks of perfectly cooked roast over amazing, sweet potatoes and an amazing BBQ like sauce.  It is all I can think about still.  Yummy, delicious, mouth watering, tender, .........  On my chicken:  It was good but compared to the short ribs it was just \"okay\".  It was seasoned well.    Now I must also mention the amazing \"Original Chop salad\".  I had had this salad at the Gladly with salmon and was not a huge fan.  So, this time I got chicken and Oh my!!!  It was seriously the best blend of flavors and textures.  Again, this is not something I would have ever ordered on my own but I am so glad my husband pushes me to try the things he knows I will like.    It is a bit pricey but the salad and the short ribs are worth every penny!  For the drinkers, my husband swears by the Manhattan and the Moscow mule.  We did not get desert so I can not comment on them.    I could go on and on......  I would HIGHLY recommend this place ( and over Houston's too!  (sorry Houston's)) I promise you if you order just the salad and short ribs you will not be disappointed!    Enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"We happened to go to this place after seeing the reviews on yelp. What a bummer! We ordered few cocktails which were okay. And then we ordered chopped salad, crab cakes for appetizers and chicken, lamb loin for the main course. The chicken was so dry and bland, expected lot more for the money we were paying. The lamb loin was equally bad without seasoning. The crab cakes and the chopped salad were good which kept us from starving I suppose. To top it, the place was noisy making it difficult to have a conversation. I definitely wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"awesome meal - we hit the first day of Restaurant week by chance and had the opportunity to have the Prix Fix menu - awesome scallops, chicken, and yeah, the Chop Salad is as unbelievable as your server says it is."}
{"text":"Such a great place to eat for date night or any night. The food is sourced as locally as possible and the process in which the animals are pastures and later killed is known. No antibiotics or hormones go into their meats and you can trust their sources. You will get full from an entree."}
{"text":"I had high hopes considering the 4.5 stars with so many reviews.  Perhaps we ordered the wrong things.  We started with the Octopus. which was incredible overcooked which made it rubbery.  I had the short ribs, which were good but not amazing.. a tad on the dry side.  The wine list was ok but nothing mind blowing.  I hear that cobb salad is great so if I do go back that would be the route I would go, a lot of people were eating it."}
{"text":"This place is classy, comfortable and the food is outstanding - a staple date night spot for myself and my boyfriend. The real 5 stars go to the staff however. They are above exceptional, we always sit at the bar and the bartenders are extremely attentive, friendly, efficient and overall lovely every single time we go! I have never been disappointed in any way. Not to mention the cocktails are exceptional, and a side note from a frequent guest, the Mac and Cheese is to die for!   Highly recommend for any event or just a quiet night with good food and great drinks."}
{"text":"Great Central location, amazing service at the bar. Happy hour drinks are very tiny, selection in small and they are all drinks that could put hair on your chest."}
{"text":"Doesn't quite have the spirit of camaraderie  of an actual pub house but hey this is Scottsdale and ideas of brotherhood are easily snuffed out by skinny jeans and tawdry gossip.   I recommend that you go on a quiet night so you can enjoy this place uninterrupted.  The menu has all the standards but with an improved twist.  I have a hard time leaving the Squealer Burger and fries but the whole menu is a welcome joy."}
{"text":"Fantastic place for late night cocktails and good conversation... that's it... I am not sure i would want to do anything other than drink here... Brandon is a great bartender"}
{"text":"Hands down the best meal and service I quite possibly have ever had! Pork belly appetizer, scallop entree, and braised beef entree were something I'll be dreaming about for a while..! If you're looking for a great place to eat and are willing to spend the money I promise it will be worth it. You MUST request Owen for your server... He is very knowlegable about the menu which helps in deciding what to get. Not to mention he could be the best all around server we ever had! We will absolutely eat here again when in the area!"}
{"text":"I came here two separate nights and ate at the bar while traveling for work and both evenings were fantastic. The first night I had crab cakes and rack of lamb, which was cooked excellent.  The second night I stopped in I had the bavette with bone marrow risotto, which was delicious as well!  Great service and fantastic food/environment. I would definitely return if I found myself in the area again."}
{"text":"Food was ok. Loved the salad and apps (especially the fondue). Chicken breast was so so - really big breast and I typically don't enjoy those.  Three stars tho is because the noise level in this restaurant is so loud you cannot hear across the table."}
{"text":"Had the popcorn with bacon for an appetizer - it was ok, but nothing great. We split the chicken and waffles - not bad, but not maybe I'm just not a fan of chicken & waffles in general (don't hate me). But - we also ordered the short rib, which was quite delicious! It came with some greens that were quite un-delicious and we didn't take more than 1 bite of them.   If you try it, get there early otherwise it gets VERY loud inside and you'll be yelling across the table to have a conversation."}
{"text":"My husband and I found this place on Yelp looking for a new restaurant that serves filet mignon. We were NOT disappointed. I had their filet mignon, and my husband had the filet tacos. We also did the Noble Bread as a starter. The flavors were out of this world. He kept talking about how much he loved their crunchy fries that came with the tacos. Atmosphere is somewhat fancy, and the service was really great! We will be back! I highly recommend eating here for a great culinary experience!"}
{"text":"Having lived in the area for some time and looking to try something new, we walked past at first after briefly looking at the menu.   We returned after talking to a few people giving rave reviews.  Very happy we did because it ended up being a wonderful experience from greeting (actually opened a few minutes before 3pm for us) to excellent service and drinks, with the finally, wonderful fresh foods.  We will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Outstanding food, creative cocktails and bar snacks, great beer selection.  Decor is nice and the service is friendly.    What's not to like?"}
{"text":"Enjoyed every menu item I've ever ordered here - whether chicken or steak or salad or various appetizers everything has hit the spot"}
{"text":"FANTASTIC HH.   $5 oak barrel aged cocktails (negronis and manhattans are usuals) 1/2 off ALL bar bites 1/2 off beer 1/2 off ALL glasses of wine  DAILY 3-6  I cannot believe I just discovered their HH. Service NEVER wavers here. I love it. I know exactly what to expect and yet everytime I leave I feel a renewed sense of appreciation for CPH and everything they do there. Service at the bar is great!   Is it HH yet? !"}
{"text":"Great service, good food, so-so preparedness. I came for the Yelp Eats promotion, but one of the more popular items on the menu (scallops) had sold out. Usually, his would not be a problem, but I had already sold myself on the side item for this entree -- corn grits! And needless to say, this southern influenced girl was sorely disappointed not to get my serving of grits :( but no fear, the waitress made sure I got my corn grits on the side.  The rest of their entree items looked fair, but nothing in particular stood out as a must have.  I settled on a halibut dish.  The appetizers list looked a bit more interesting...   The good: - The chopped salad is a must try (this appetizer has it's own Facebook page for crying out loud!) - The staff.  We were quickly greeted and sat at our table upon arrival, and our drink orders were taken and delivered to the table in record time.  Throughout our meal, my husband harassed the waitress for different selections of wine -- but she was a good sport. He is forever embarrassing me in public, so any spot that can put up with his drunken shenanigans is a win.  The not as good: - Best looking dish, scallops, was not available - My halibut was overcooked - We came in on a Sunday, and the place was half empty... But food still took long time to get cooked. I didn't mind this much, as I was not in a hurry. But if I had been on a schedule, this would surely been annoying - No cappuccino since machine was broken (boo)  Overall, i'd give this place a 3.5.  The chopped salad and friendly service was enough to make me overlook some of their lesser qualities.  I'd like to go back another time and see whether my experience is different--maybe I just caught them on an off night?"}
{"text":"We first went to Citizen for \"happy hour\" apps and cocktails, because I was intrigued by the online reviews and always want to try something new.  We had the mac and cheese and the \"other\" chopped salad.  (Not the famous one.)  I had a pisco sour (good) and a gin cocktail off their menu (I wasn't crazy about it.)  BF had Stellas.  We wanted to sit on the patio, which was a bit sterile.  Just a little color please.  The bartender who waited on us was friendly, knowledgeable, kind, and great.  Host was great too!  The salad and mac and cheese we ate were very tasty.  If you are looking for a value, go to Bungalow or somewhere else, because, as my BF says \"Happy Hour is supposed to be less that $40 :)\"  Citizen wasn't, but we decided it woudl be a better dinner place.   I prevailed and...       We bought a $100 gift certificate, which came with a complimentary $25 certificate.  We went back for dinner the next week with my sister and her husband who were visiting from Washington.  It was exceptionally quiet on a Friday night, which might have contributed to the restaurant feeling a bit sterile.  We all agreed the space needed some more division as it felt a bit \"cafeteria.\"  Maybe skip the white tablecloths.  (We were just brainstorming  They don't seem very \"gastro pub\".)  The menu was very interesting and although, our server was not as exceptional as the bartender we had the first time, she was very nice.  We had the popcorn and original chopped salad to start.  The popcorn was greasier than I thought and not as flavorful.  I still liked it and enjoyed more than enough of it.  More bacon pieces, less bacon grease please.  The salad was FABULOUS!  Now I know why it is famous.  I would come back for this salad any day.  Great presentation.  Great taste.  For entrées we had the pork, grilled cheese, ribs, and pastrami.  The pork had excellent accompaniments and was cooked almost perfectly.  Love the figs!  The ribs were rated a 9.5.  Delic!  The grilled cheese was said to be on a brioche and was served on white bread and was somewhat underwhelming.   The pastrami was a starter portion  (which was fine) and was NOT a good cut of meat.  Because it was a small portion of meat, it was apparent, 1/2 of the portion of pastrami was pure fat.  Yucky.  The spaetzle was okay.  The brussell sprout kraut was okay.  (This was my dish if you can't tell :).  Underwhelming.  I had the Manhattan which was excellent and the champagne cocktail which was quite tasty.  Sister is prego and had water and tea.  Brother had vodka and the rocks and BF had beer.  Desert was a bread pudding to share which was tasty, but not quite as interesting as the menu would lead you to believe.  Cappuccino was EXCELLENT!  We like this place.  I want it to succeed.  I don't know if they need to throw some rugs on the floor, to put a room divider next to a table or what, but they need to make it feel like a gastropub if that is what they want it to be.  Right now it feels like they are lost somewhere between fine dining and I'm not sure.  Focus on the menu.  And the good servers.  Add some more decor.  And the quality.  And we will be back.  Good.  Almost great."}
{"text":"This was delicious and the staff knew the menu and wine selections very well. Comfortable and classy."}
{"text":"Thomas was very welcoming and a great server/bartender. Came in close to close and still gave us ample time to enjoy our late night date. My lady and i's date night are few and far between so to be able to have a experience like tonight is very appreciated. Kudos Thomas and citizen!"}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in Scottsdale. I'm a foody and have high expectations when dining at nice restaurants. So often I leave underwhelmed. Not the case with CPH. We ordered the crab cakes to start, had the applewood smoked duck and the pan seared scallops. Lastly we washed it down with Tracey Denpseys apple pie creation. The food was wonderful and reminiscent of the fine food you get in NYC....and to top it off, the service and ambience was Stellar, though a tad noisy. Our server Lex was on top of it and the food came out fast. This is one of those places that even if the service was horrid, the ambience stunk, and the wait staff were ass weasels,  you'd still find your way back here because the food is that good. Well done Bernie Kentak!"}
{"text":"Food was very good. I found the menu to be very small - definitely not enough options. Good service. Very cool neighborhood. We would definitely go back again... Maybe during a different season to see if the menu changes as well."}
{"text":"Date night with the boyfriend. Service is amazing. The drinks are unique, fun and go down too fast. The menu is eclectic and includes... pork belly bacon. It doesn't get better than pork belly bacon. He had the short ribs and you could taste the coffee in the rub, it was heavenly. Parsnips accompanied his meat and they were also so good. I had the scallops and they were out of this world. I could have happily ordered another plate of scallops and childishly licked my plate clean! A must in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Can haz romance?  This is a serious date venue.  Spanish fly is an ingredient in everything on the menu so do your stretching before getting into your hottiewear so you'll be ready for later.  Lovely craft cocktails, low lighting which will make your date even more attractive (if possible), and fine dining at a fair price.  Tough to go wrong here."}
{"text":"A+ all around.  The menu is tasteful in scope - you don't feel bombarded with choices but there is enough variety to keep things interesting.  The service is outstanding.  The staff knows exactly what they are doing here.  Our group had four different entrees and every dish was high in quality, perfectly prepared and very tasty.  The scallops were cooked exactly right with the right sear and buttery texture.  The chopped salad is everything you've read about it, and more.  It's a pretty perfect balance of colors, flavors and textures.    The atmosphere is comfortable yet elegant.  The lighting, background music and seating layout were all just right.  But the dining room can get a little noisy at peak hours due to the open seating arrangement.   Have been here three times so far and each visit is better than the first."}
{"text":"Out of my long list of bookmarked restaurants, I chose Citizen Public House to cross off the list for date night Friday night.  My BF luckily made a reservation during dinner rush hour, so we were seated instantly. Otherwise we would have waited for awhile with everyone else at the bar. Not that waiting is terrible here; AMAZING cocktails to try!! I ordered the scallops based on other yelpers advise. They had a great sear on them with lots of flavor. I was still hungry though after eating the 3 scallops so I influenced my bf to order me dessert. I was being indecisive on my dessert selection and ended up ordering both the flour less chocolate cake and blueberry pie. Both were great, but the blueberry pie was my favorite!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service.  The meatloaf was phenomenal, as was the PB&B jar for dessert."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite dinner location.  I started with the bone marrow great appetizer which was amazing.  For my entre I had the meatloaf which was absolutely amazing.  It was enough for two people easily.  The waiter recommended an excellent wine.  The entire dinning experience was top notch and I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I would give 3 1/2 stars if I could, husband agreed.  The service was phenomenal and the atmosphere was great.  Their chopped salad really is something special.  But, I was quite disappointed in receiving 3 medium size scallops for dinner. And I didn't find the other dishes I tasted great.  For the money, I just can't rate the food any better than this."}
{"text":"Wow!!! Amazing food and our waiter Gary was outstanding!! Gary's recommendations were spot on and entertaining. We started with drinks, which were very original and delicious. We ordered the chopped salad to split, for an appetizer, yummy. For our main courses we had the meatloaf( a true \"meat\" loaf, very flavorful and filling), the short ribs( so tender they fell off the bone with a mouth watering BBQ sauce), the scallops( perfectly cooked with an amazing sauce), and the fish of the day on a risotto( mmmmmm, delicious). For desert we split the berry cobbler with a lemon ice cream...Wow, a perfect end to a perfect meal! As locals, we can't wait to come back and ask for Gary!"}
{"text":"Octopus was great, chopped salad is a must, and their manhattan is amazing."}
{"text":"LOVE  the food and drinks here. The only reason for four stars is it is a bit loud inside. But we came here twice while in the Phoneix area and were very happy!"}
{"text":"While I've never actually eaten a full meal at CPH, this is probably my favorite place for drinks and apps.  I don't even care that their happy hour discounts are not that great.  First off, they make a version of a sloe gin fizz.  Based on that alone, I'm at 5 stars.  The fact that it was fantastic was just an added bonus.  Second, they ingeniously thought to put bacon fat in the popcorn.  Now we're at 10 stars.    Third, 'kilt lifter\" fondue.  Need I say more?"}
{"text":"Outstanding service and hands down the best salad I've ever tasted in my entire life.  In a momentary mental lapse I ordered something that wasn't on the menu and they actually delivered it!  I will always come back here when I am in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"This was my second visit here and I loved the food again! This time I ordered the scallops entree and it was delcious. Since my hubby and his parents came with me for restaurant week, we could choose the scallops, meatloaf, or \"smart chicken is cool\" for our prix fix menu entrees. Upon my first visit here for a friend's birthday, I thought \"Really? They actually named a dish \"Smart Chicken is Cool\"?\" I tried it anyway inspite of the title, and I'm glad I did, because the chicken was tender and really tasty unexpectedly. What was even better was the risotto that came with the chicken with truffle oil. I melt for truffles/truffle oil infused food!  The pork belly pastrami as promised did not disappoint! That disappeared very quickly among four people. Perhaps we should've ordered more? The Im-port mixed drink was very unique in flavor and almost sweet - reminiscent of a dessert port. I liked it better than the Sazerac, which was a little bit potent for my taste. Although I might've enjoyed it more if I didn't have the Im-port first. Our waiter was good and checked on us often, except when we wanted bread and he forgot to bring it to us. I'll let it slide though, because he was so good otherwise and brought us tons of other \"yummy\" food and drinks quickly after we placed the order and I applaud him for that on such a busy night (the end of restaurant week this past Sunday)."}
{"text":"First and foremost they had so many nice servers. We had Gary as our server. He provided great recommendations and he interacted with our kid with such ease.  He made us feel so comfortable eating at the restaurant.    The food was pretty good as well.  We had the chopped salad and pork belly appetizer. The waffle and fried chicken was great if you don't mind a little heavy starter.  Cocktails were made to perfection.    The main course was the yummy scallop. The corn grits was between after each bite.   The Mignon filet was ok.    The chili bread pudding was a great closer,  but it was a bit on the dry side.    I can't get over the great service of this place.  I look up and there's someone to help me with everything i needed.    We are definitely returning to try other stuff."}
{"text":"The food was spectacular, we split a bunch of appetizers. Crab cakes were moist, tuna perfectly cooked, and the pork belly pastrami was magnificent - smooth like butter. The grilled cheese is worth it and the bacon peach pie made me feel like I was home in the south. P.S. The staff, outstanding. Brad made excellent recommendations."}
{"text":"\"You're beautiful, you're perfect, you look like Linda Evangelista, you're a model!\" No, Valentina did not just walk into Citizen Public House but our server did just bring out the entrees! Damn, could the food here get more delicious??! Each dish is beautifully plated, seasoned to perfection, the portions leave you full but not stuffed, and the staff is attentive and knowledgeable. I didn't think it could get any better until the dessert came out. I had the Black & Tan. A super smooth salted caramel pudding with a rich chocolate pot de crème, topped with heavenly whipped cream and a little bit of crunch from butter cookies for texture. I ate it all up and left 100% happy!"}
{"text":"Wow.  Where do I start.  The bar had so many health violations, my salad was warm and limp, the gnocchi tasted like it was fried in grease and my filet wasn't cooked correctly.  So I sent the salad back, gave my gnocchi away and the waiter had the chef fix my filet.  Now mind you, I cut my steak with my fork and knife and when they brought back my filet it was the same one so that means they re-cooked my filet after I cut it with my knife fork and germs...interesting.  Also for the amount of money you pay, the \"posh\" look, the snobs and wanna be's. ..the waiters need to learn to serve from the left and proper placement of a dinner setting lol.  The steak after the second time, mac n cheese were good but I've had better.  just being honest."}
{"text":"Food was good and service was great. Perfect for date nights or drinks and appetizers. We will for sure be back!"}
{"text":"The food is very good here-  and they gave some nice wines on the menu as well. Its a lovely atmosphere, but it's hard to get a seat at the bar whenever I'm in the area, so I don't get to enjoy it often."}
{"text":"interesting and varied menu. Fun place. Attentive staff. Definitely recommend"}
{"text":"The wait staff was very helpful. The seasonal mule was delicious. The food was okay although one of our orders never came. However the room is very noisy. A difficult place for a conversation.  Would not recommend for a meal over which you intend to have a good conversation."}
{"text":"I almost gave this place 5 stars, but I really only give those out for \"perfection.\"  I have to say that Citizen's Public House serves the best scallops in the city-- which is somewhat of a surprise.  They are never overcooked, and the grits they are served on are delicious as well.  The prices are a little steep, but I will say that the quality of the food and the cocktails is very high.  Also, the serving staff is AMAZING and always very friendly.  Also, you can make a reservation through OpenTable, which is always quite handy.  I take out-of-town guests to CPH, and they have all really loved it.  Again, if the prices were a little lower and if the menu had just a few more choices, I would have given it 5 stars."}
{"text":"Come here basically on a monthly basis & it never disappoints. Party of 5 so we had a few original chopped salads and the mac & cheese with bacon appetizers. Both were so good. My wife compliments how moist the cod dish was, my filet was cooked perfectly and our guest dishes were all flavorful: duck burger, scallops & pork. Only had room for the black & tan dessert. The wine menu is decent & our server brad (& lex) was excellent. My guests were happy and also plan on coming back for sure."}
{"text":"Gotta tell ya, I went back twice more in the 2 weeks following my first visit!  Everything I've had has been great.  The grilled cheese that has ham and this cherry concoction/mustard ... so great!  The Kiltlifter fondue and Panzanella salad totally satisfied and tingled my taste buds. Bf and I even popped in one night when they had a short list of $20 wines by the bottle... Score!  I haven't yet made it to the dessert menu, but I sure hope to soon!"}
{"text":"pork belly pastrami (4/5): This was pretty good, but I find the dish a tad too greasy. The sauerkraut's acidity sort of took down the grease down a notch but I still find it a bit too much for me. Which was weird because I usually love fatty pork belly.  Original chopped salad (5/5): This was the perfect salad. The flavor, the texture, and the freshness of the ingredients, everything was perfect. I think it had salmon in it as well, which imo was the perfect protein to go with this salad.  Seared scallops (3/5): The scallops were cooked perfectly, but it was over seasoned. In addition, they garnished the scallops with bacons, which added more saltiness. I also didn't like the glaze because it was too sweet (I believe it was coke and red-wine reduction?)  Taste alone I think this place is worthy of a 3.5-3.8. However, I find the food a bit too pricey (came out to be $43 per person) so I'm giving it a 3-star."}
{"text":"CPH is simple in design. White table clothes, dark wood beams, open layout and servers in black v-neck tees and black slacks.   We do tend to dine like early birds and came at 6pm which seems to be before the regular crowd.  The restaurant was about half full but there was not an available seat at the bar...drinks must be good.    When I come to places like this I tend to like when servers \"sell\" me on what I should have for dinner.  Sam did just that.  Not in a \"salesman\" type of way.  In the way that I believe that he knows the menu and asked enough about what we liked to offer suggestions.  I was being indecisive about cocktails and he said \"may I surprise you!?!?\"  UH YEAH!  I love surprises!  He brought back a martini glass with delicious and refreshing absinth, aloe, slightly sweet and other stuff.  Great surprise!    The Original Salad.  Amazing!  Alone, the ingredients sound a little ridiculous but together, it is amazing!  I would go back just for that salad.    Based on Sam's recommendations we went with the Pan Seared Scallops and the Fair Trade Short Ribs.  I live for this kind of stuff!  Coffee rub with a cherry bbq sauce on top of parsnip puree??? So good.  Different flavors all coming together to make a delicious meal.  My husband said that the scallops were the best he has ever had.  I kinda wished he had lied to me since I can't eat shellfish but I'm happy and surprised he said something like that.  He doesn't tend to rave about food that often.    The suggested dessert was the Peanut Butter Strata Bar. We went rouge and had the Pig in the Orchard.  Apple and bacon bread pudding with blueberry sauce and ice cream.   The bacon was not over powering but gave the dessert a smokey flavor.  It was interesting but it made me think about that Peanut Butter Strata Bar....   The service here was spectacular! You will be a very lucky patron if you sit in Sam's section.  In fact, you should ask for his section.  He knows everything about the menu, about the area, and about all things interesting!"}
{"text":"Another wonderful experience!  Whenever we are in town I always make reservation for dinner one night here.  The ambiance is lively & fun, the service top notch & the food is always excellently prepared & presented!  This time we shared the special of cod in a miso broth served over gnocchi with Japanese long beans & their always tasty Chopped Salad.  Nicely paired with a lovely wine, it was a perfect evening!"}
{"text":"Pretty good! The chopped salad is the best part. Duck burger and short ribs also delish.   Bradley is also an awesome server. Goes above and beyond."}
{"text":"Meh.  If anyone asked me what I thought of Citizen Public House in Old Town Scottsdale, that would be my reaction.  The ambiance was meh. The food was meh. And the sangria was meh.  In fact, the highlight of my meal was when one of the cute bartenders (at least they have that going for them) delivered our drinks instead of our server.  The interior is bare bones and plain. The white walls are covered with a smattering of vintage photographs you'd have to squint to see-from a table not by a wall, the atmosphere isn't artsy, it just looks like bad decorating in someone's living room. I didn't really understand why butcher paper covered the white tablecloth-covered tables, since that sort of took whatever class the spot had and negated it. The seating wasn't comfy, and even though there was a patio, it was tiny and overlooked a parking lot.  There weren't many vegetarian menu options on the small American menu, so I opted for a Grilled Cheese ($12). My gut told me to leave off the Peruvian Sweety relish, a weird red mixture, but I kept it on because I figured it had to contribute to the sandwich somehow. I was wrong. It tasted gross, and I ended up scraping it all off and wishing remnants weren't still stuck to the sandwich. I got it with a non-noteworthy salad, and I've had much, much better artisan grilled cheeses that were less expensive and more filling.  My friend said she liked her chopped salad, the same one I've had at Cowboy Ciao (it's a creation of Citizen Public House chef/owner Bernie Kantak, who used to cook at Cowboy Ciao.) I also liked it there, but it's so tiny, I can't justify paying $12 for it-especially since I'd leave the meat off.  Like I said, the sangria failed to leave a big impression on me, other than that it wasn't strong. For $9 a glass, I expected something with a little more kick to it but was left disappointed.  I can't think of any reason I'd tell someone to go to Citizen Public House. If the atmosphere had been a little prettier or livelier, maybe it'd be a fun destination, but the company I had was the only thing that kept it from boring me."}
{"text":"Absolutely great food quality, presentation, atmosphere and service. So very impressed by this sparkling gem of a dining establishment"}
{"text":"Another A+ meal from Citizen Public House! With the start of Yelp Eats week, I have a long list of restaurants I want to visit and tonight, Citizen Public House got checked off the list.   The Yelp Eats menu is a perfect combination of every food group. My friend and I with the Original Chopped Salad (a salad so popular, it even has its own Facebook page!), accompanied it with hummus, shared the pan seared scallops with corn grits and sweetened off the meal with the bread pudding and creme de pot! Yes, I did practically roll out of there, but very happily and extremely content!  The atmosphere at Citizen Public House continues to be chill and sophisticated. Tonight, it was bubbling with people but the tables are spread out enough that it allows each table to have their own conversation.   I am happily full right now, but I think I might try to sneak into Citizen Public House again in the near future again!"}
{"text":"Can't say enough good about this place. The service is spectacular and the food is wonderful. Parking is difficult at peak times but there is a garage relatively closeby"}
{"text":"It's not all that often I find a restaurant five-star worthy; four star, all the time. This restaurant fits the bill perfectly. From the location, to the fabulous wrap around bar, to the amazing food, only to be topped by impeccable service and the friendliest restaurant team I've ever had the pleasure of experiencing. Unfortunately, the restaurant patio was booked and we didn't get to sit outside as I had hoped, but the hostess was kind enough to give us a table just inside the folding doors so we can get our share of sunlight.  Gina and her team couldn't have been more delightful and accommodating.  Make it a point to try their Cobb salad.  The meatloaf was outstanding!  Who knew you could make popcorn and bacon work?   Thank you Lex for taking the time, and for the fantastic brittle.   Do not miss this gem if you're in the area or passing through. It won't disappoint."}
{"text":"Great vibe for a nice dinner or casual meet up. I'm giving 4 stars because the happy hour was a bit formal for my taste. The drinks and food were spot on and you will not be disappointed. The staff must get some great training - they all are very polite and super responsive. I had everything on the happy hour menu, their Negroni and 2 of their other drink specials that were very, very well mixed."}
{"text":"Overall the ambience is nice and is in a good location in Scottsdale. We had dinner her on a Friday night and were looking to celebrate a bday. We started with drinks and the flatbread. When I ordered the flatbread, I was expecting a flatbread pizza but thought the bread and hummus were good. We then the beet salad and the chopped salad. We ordered the chopped salad based on previous reviews but we found it to be bland. The beet salad, on the other hand, was great. The touch of honey was perfect! We next both had the scallop. The scallop was ok but the sides were amazing! The sides really make the dish. We had the cobbler dessert which was not great. The sauce was cooked into the fruit enough. The service, I thought, was not very basic and slow.   Bottom line...this place is good for happy hour but for dinner the food quality overall is mediocre besides the beet salad which was great!!   Pros Location  Ambience  Happy hour drinks and food options  Beet salad   Cons  Chopped salad was bland  Service was slow and not that friendly"}
{"text":"Have you ever heard of a salad that is so popular that it has its own Facebook page? I know I couldn't believe it either, but this isn't any ordinary salad. Think tidy rows of smoked salmon, Israeli couscous, asiago cheese, arugula, sweet dried corn, black currants and pepitas (toasted pumpkin seeds) topped with a creamy pesto dressing all tossed table-side. The Stetson Chopped Salad should not only have its own fan page but its creator, Chef Bernie Kantak, should be given a hug every time you see him at his new Citizen Public House.   Located in what used to be the valleys original Trader Vic's, there isn't a tiki torch in sight. Instead you'll find a contemporary space outfitted with wood accents, leather booths and a stainless steel-topped bar. The vibe is casual and relaxed elevated by outstanding service on every one of my visits.   If you're wondering what a public house is, well simply put it's a tavern that also serves food. While they do serve some great drinks and have an excellent wine list, I'd be hard pressed to call Citizen a mere tavern. How many taverns have you ever heard of serving pork studded Bacon Fat Heirloom Popcorn ($5)? Or how about a pot filled with creamy 'Kilt Lifter' Fondue ($9) savory hunter's sausage, sweet tangy pears and toasted country bread? If you have, please let me know right away.  For dinner I couldn't recommend The Original Chopped Salad ($12) more but if you don't like smoked salmon, they can make it with chicken instead. The Mirliton Chopped Salad ($12), a composition including chayote, snow pea greens, tomatoes, popcorn, grilled halloumi cheese; cucumber-onion salad tossed with a tangy parsley-garlic dressing was a fantastic textural explosion but lives in the shadow of its older sibling.  I'm not even sure where to start with the entrees; I guess it comes down to price point. Take the lower priced lusciously juicy Lamb Burger ($12) topped with a cucumber salad, zesty tzatziki and served with fries, you'd think with flavor and quality like this would be much more expensive.   At the other end of the price range sit the fantastically meaty Fair Trade Coffee Charred Short Ribs ($28) complete with a side of brightly sour dried cherry bbq sauce and roasted parsnip puree. Somewhere in between is the juicy \"Smart\" Chicken ($18) which refers to the brand not the chicken's admission into the Mensa Society.   Desserts by Tracy Dempsey were all that and a bag of cookies, literally. Cookies and Milk ($6) were delightfully chewy and come served in a sealed pouch for freshness, of course the milk was ice cold just perfect for dunking. Three words, Strawberry Pound Cake ($9). A thick slice of strawberry olive oil pound cake is lightly grilled then served with vanilla malted ice cream, chocolate sauce and malted strawberry streusel and like the Stetson salad it was Facebook worthy."}
{"text":"Gary Gary Gary. Amazing service . The food is truly amazing very original tastes portions are perfect the price is reasonable. The service was outstanding. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"This was a fantastic culinary experience. I enjoyed the impressively creative pastrami appetizer and the artfully crafted meatloaf. Both were unique, adventurous and memorable. I will certainly be returning to try other culinary delights."}
{"text":"Great service, and while all of the food was very good, it wasn't life-changing like our waiter claimed ;-). We went as a group of about 10 and had a back room to ourselves. They make a great Manhattan with leather and tobacco infused bitters--ask them about their bitters program."}
{"text":"Most of all, kudos to our server, Greg, for his impressive knowledge about menu items and wine. The wine he helped us select was perfect.  Water glasses were refilled religiously.  Service with a smile all around from host to bartender to server to food runner.  I did not love my food. Which is why I'm giving 4, not 5 stars. There were actually a few of us at our table who were not in love with the food. For the premium prices charged, I expected something incredible.  The ambiance of the patio was awesome."}
{"text":"The Chopped Salad is a must! I should have just had it as an entree. Also had the burger, which was pretty good. And interesting take on a burger with some southwestern influence. The fries were some of the best I've ever had. Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Perfect.  The only downside was the wine I ordered. When it came out the bottle had clearly gone bad because it tasted like vinegar. Our server basically said, yeah I'm not a big fan of that wine. And I was like cool, but the bottle is bad. If I'm ever in the Scottsdale area again, I'll definitely head back for the salad."}
{"text":"This place was AMAZING!  Went there for a work holiday party and it was great.  Gary our waiter made our choices even tougher as he expertly explained all the dishes.  You MUST get the smoked salmon chopped salad, it is worth all of the accolades it receives.  Also tried the pork belly pastrami and it was excellent.  Between us we covered all the main dishes and there was much being shared as everything was top notch.  Will be back again & again & again!!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat in Scottsdale.  Good food. Great bartenders who make near perfect cocktails, and a great high energy staff.  Try the chicken chopped salad.  Best you'll try. On a weekend, check out their speak easy upstairs.  Great little place to hang out and try some new craft cocktails"}
{"text":"Went here to grab some dinner for one while my husband was at a conference. Greeted with really good service at the bar and they were nice enough to charge my phone while i ate, so that i could find my way back to our hotel...  I had a glass of Chardonnay and the Short Ribs. The short ribs were well cooked and seasoned and once you dip it in the bbq sauce it was just perfect. The portion size is small considering the price ($30). Thats even pricey by NYC standards.  Overall really good. The bartenders look like they know what theyre doing. They were shaking the drinks properly. I love when there are some ice chips in my drink!"}
{"text":"Ended up here after trying to go to Citizen R+D.  We ended up sitting in the bar area on a high top. They offer a good selection of wine by the glass and had the Crush Cab, which was very good. Not sure if the bar menu is different than the main room menu, but the selections seemed rather limited.  We ended up going with the Lamb Burger and Original Chop salad. Both were very good. The wait staff was attentive and friendly,"}
{"text":"What a great place. Came for my birthday and my waiter as well had the same birthday and treated me with so much energy and lots of celebration.  Will definitely come back"}
{"text":"Great location and amazing food! Had my birthday here and would definitely go back! They had a sign made for the table it was so nice. Food was great quality!! The Mac and cheese appetizer is huge and delicious, definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I went to Gibson's in Chicago and never thought I'd find a steakhouse like that in Scottsdale... until I was introduced to Citizens.   One of my best friends + her boyfriend are steak snobs and only eat steak at this restaurant. It was their birthday celebrations and they, of course, wanted dinner here before the party. The staff was so accommodating. They let me bring cakes for both of their birthdays (see photos) and checked on our group consistently the entire night. The manager is great friends with the couple so he made sure everything and everyone was well taken care of.   The food was extraordinary. I ordered the short ribs the first time and the filet mignon during our second visit. The meat was very tender and full of seasoning (unlike most steakhouses). The short ribs come with this cherry BBQ sauce that is something I've never experienced before - but perfected the meal. Also, I'm kind of hooked on their house drink called The Citizen... but it is one sneaky ass drink! It takes like candy and you feel like you're just drinking juice... then after 15 minutes, you're drunk.  Be mindful of the price of this establishment prior to your arrival. It's worth the amount but it is on the pricey side. If that's not an issue for you... go here and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Cool place, very good food. Prices are a bit high for what you get. Service is so-so."}
{"text":"Delicious Hefeveisen and the bartenders are so nice. I have not eaten here, only sit at the bar and get specialty drinks and apps. Its a very nice place, I like it alot."}
{"text":"Great service. Fresh food. We had the crab cakes, cauliflower curry soup, chicken, all excellent."}
{"text":"I was there back in November 2013. Professional mixologists, awesome drinks and up there as my top 3 dining experiences in my life. I had the short ribs with cherry bbq sauce. If it was socially acceptable I would take the cherry BBQ sauce as my beverage. Bartender was awesome."}
{"text":"Me and my husband like to go here any time we are in town from California. We have never been disappointed with a dish or drink. The chopped salad is amazing, the short rib w/ cherry bbq sauce is to die for and their desserts are typically super yummy too!"}
{"text":"Outstanding meal and service. Cobb salad a unique twist with salmon and freeze dried corn. The pork shanks better than what we had in europe this year. Bravo!"}
{"text":"There is good reason why this place is one of the highest reviewed in the area. The food was great but the service is what really sets them apart. We had a special request to alter the food to exclude wheat products for my husband and they really went above and beyond to make sure he didn't accidentally have any in his order. They were so good with our kiddos and made our meal very enjoyable.  The food: you must try the chopped salad.. it's very unique and delicious. The scallops were fantastic.. we subbed the grits for mashed potatoes and it was still great. The burrata was good.. we had to remove the pesto since it had breadcrumbs but I'm sure in its original form it would have been amazing. The kids had grilled cheese and buttered noodles which were a hit. The drinks are great! Honestly it's a must try in the area."}
{"text":"Bartender Michael is awesome! Good beer on draft, great food as well!! Love the chopped salad! It's unbelievable! Like the chopped salad at cowboy Caio! Yum! Mac & cheese add sausage!"}
{"text":"Went in for drinks.  Nice place. Outdoor patio. Order the Beast Cocktail. We a nice strong pour. Did not order any food."}
{"text":"This restaurant is always fantastic. I have been here many times, and this week I went for restaurant week. The food and service were equally spectacular even during restaurant week. The monkfish was fantastic, perfectly done and served upon a lovely lobster bisque that did not overpower the delicate flavor of the fish.  Have a great wine list and a fantastic bar with great scotches. I have been to this restaurant many times, and it is a go-to for special occasions or when I want to have a nice meal. Consistent quality in food and service."}
{"text":"Gary was the best waiter I've had in years!!! So entertaining, funny, and really sold all the entrees to us. If you own a restaurant, you'd want all servers to be like him. I came one other time and my server was not entertaining or all that attentive.... Kind of dull.   The food here is great although their menu is a little small. Definitely a little too dark in some spots too.. I remember us sitting in almost total darkness. All in all it's a great date spot or good for happy hour after work."}
{"text":"For such a tough res to get during Spring Training, a bit under whelming. Just ok. I had the scallops, nothing special. Wife had the sword fish- overdone and too dry. She theorized it was due to the other couple in our group getting well done plates but I can only hope not. Nice atmosphere and service but won't likely go back."}
{"text":"The most interesting and delicious dish I've had in 2015 thus far is the Chia Seared Tuna. I can't even articulate what it tasted similar to or what it even was. All I can say is that the tuna was melt in your mouth delicious and had a crunchy exterior that I couldn't get enough of. Well done mr chef. Absolutely superb.   We also had the Pork Osso Buco and crab cakes. Both of which were great options and quite delightful.   Lastly, the ambiance is very dark and romantic. It's a great place for a date night or even dinner with family. It's not trendy, just pure classy. Great establishment."}
{"text":"Heard great things and was very excited to visit Citizen. Overall, I was glad it was not on my dime. I must have built the restaurant up in my mind. The entrance was quite nondescript and the interior the same. Dim lit, swanky vibe. Not bad but the only accents were old timey photos drilled into the wall through their frames. Hmm.  Service was good. A bit overbearing, but still very attentive.  My main beef is with the food and bev. I ordered the Protege cocktail. It tasted mostly of bitters with a hint of bourbon. We started with butternut squash gnocchi with pesto and bleu cheese. It was lukewarm and very dense. The pesto was nice, but there was not enough of it. My friends had salads for their entree (chopped and just the simple garden salad). They both loved them. I, on the other hand, went full force and ordered the short ribs. The parsnip puree and kale were nice. Not remarkable, but good. The short ribs, on the other hand, were very disappointing. They were at least 50% fat and seemingly \"glued\" to bone segments- for presentation's sake. The cherry glaze helped to cut the smoky flavor of the coffee-rubbed meat, but it couldn't disguise the fact that much of it was inedible.  I understand that kitchens do have off nights but, considering the price point, I will not return. I am more than willing to pay 30+ dollars for an entree, but you have to grab me on my first visit. Consistency is King."}
{"text":"Service was good. The server can really sell and explain the menu items if you are new.   Now, the food.   Started with the bone marrow and a serving of oysters.  Oysters are the size of your thumbnail. It's the smallest I have ever seen and its ridiculous that we were paying what was essentially just shells. It had a Tabasco sauce that may as well be straight Tabasco.   The bone marrow was nothing to write home about. Growing up, my family made pho often and the marrow from the beef bones for the broth were more flavorful and plentiful. It's not worth it.   Entrees were lamb and chopped salad.   Lamb was supposed to be med rare but came out exceedingly rare. Like straight red throughout. Admittedly the portion size was good but you do pay quite a bit for it. It comes with a small side of plain arugula and softened peanuts or something. The accompanying sides were not too enjoyable. It's very rich overall. I think it could have came with rice or potatoes or something. My date couldn't finish it. Too rare.   The chopped salad was what I got and it was very good. The pictures posted made it look bigger than it was but it is a salad so it's okay. I enjoyed it and would come back for that. It's a reasonable price too.   So all that plus a glass of wine came to over $80. Yikes! Just don't get too adventurous with the starters like we did."}
{"text":"Came here looking for some yummy food and we found it.   Tried their famous chopped salad, wow it was spectacular. Also tried their sea scallops man that was even more spectacular.   Totally recommend this place, we liked it a lot,  if we lived here we would totally come here often."}
{"text":"I walked in at 10:30 on a Friday and the bartender was so kind. Made me a mezcal drink (it was a long day - I didnt ask what it was). And it was perfect! I asked for spirit forward but refreshing and he delivered! I know there was also green chartreuse... if that helps.  I had the chopped salad. No idea it was so famous but two people commented on it... and I know why. It is like your slightly gourmet version of a cobb salad without the gross romaine, boiled egg and hard chicken. So nothing like a cobb salad, actually. All the ingredients paired well with the dressing and it was not overly robust. I was glad cous cous was on it so I could consume it as a meal.   While this is a nice restaurant, it is not at all pretentious. When traveling alone, atmosphere means everything. The bartenders were the best treat after a six hour day. It was so nice to enjoy good food and drinks past 10 pm and have it not be a stuffy environment! I feel like that is my bliss point and they met it.   Next time I make the trek out here from San Diego, I am coming back.  I wish I knew the bartenders names... one had a dark brown pony and beard (he ended the night) and was accommodating. He made the drink great, as well as the gentleman that initially served me. Both sweet, attractive and great bartenders. What more could you ask for, ya know ;)"}
{"text":"I had a first date at CPH 2 months ago and had an amazing time. Great food and drinks as well as an attentive and professional staff and fun atmosphere.   Last night was our 2 month anniversary (insert your sarcasm here) and chose to revisit CPH. I made an online reservation and stated in the notes the info about our anniversary and if they could do something special. Who knew they actually read those things.   Although we had a reservation we had to wait 15 for a table to open up. The place was packed. No biggie. We saddled up to the bar for some drinks. My girlfriend wanted to start drinking bourbon. I asked if they had an obscure brand that was a mellow starting point as far as bourbons go and they did. Every 5 minutes a different host came up to us to let us know our status and that we would be seated shortly. And we were. The manager came over and wished us a happy anniversary. Much appreciated.   When we were seated the server brought us a little gift which was amazing and a great surprise.   The food was amazing and so was our server. The entire staff was friendly, attentive, gracious, funny and welcoming. On the way out I thanked the manager and let him know we'll be back each month to celebrate our first date there. What a great and unexpected experience. More restaurants should take a queue from CPH on how to treat customers. Thanks for making our special night yet another night to remember."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the better restaurants in the Phoenix area. The food and service were excellent. I made a reservation for a large group and they gave us our own little alcove to sit in and we had a server all to ourselves. His name was Sean and he did a fantastic job.  The drinks were wonderful. I had a Tin Cup and a Liberator Punch. The Punch was better than the Tin Cup but they were both really good. I enjoy sweeter drinks but my husband had Manhattan and said it was great.  For dinner, I had the steelhead trout. The pickled beet salad with it was very good and the fish was cooked perfectly. I'd love to find out what they seasoned the fish with because it was perfect. My husband had the meatloaf and let me try a bite and it was very tasty. My friend had the scallops and she let me try a bit of the grits and she's lucky I didn't snatch the plate away from her. I'm wondering if they'd just sell me some of those grits.  I also managed to mooch bites of the infamous Original Chopped Salad (which is really pretty before they toss it all together) and the short ribs. Both were excellent.  For dessert, my husband and I split a Pig in the Orchard which is bread pudding with apple and bacon. A most excellent combination. We also took home a bag of the Pecan Bacon Brittle which is as awesome as it sounds.  I definitely plan to go back and have my own plate of grits, um, scallops."}
{"text":"A little more pretentious than I expected from reading other reviews.  Good luck finding parking.  And if you want a table, get a reservation."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I were visiting the area and decided to try this restaurant. It was absolutely incredible. We had the scallops and short rib tacos. Scallops are by far the best we have ever had! We also had the fondue and heart of caramel dessert. Both were also incredible. The heart of caramel was a perfect combination of rich chocolate with refreshing white chocolate ice cream. The salted caramel splash on the plate just pulled it all together. The wait staff was so polite and friendly. Our water glasses were never empty and they spent time with us to recommend places in the city to check out. We will always remember this night!"}
{"text":"Everytime I'm in Scottsdale, I make a trip to Citizen...sometimes; four trips!  Don't miss The Original Chopped Salad. This thing is unreal. I spent $50 on ingredients trying to re-create it at home, but there's only one Original.  The craft cocktails are quite good. I had a Manhattan with Tobacco & Leather bitters that was just phenomenal. I don't think it's on the current menu, so hopefully they'll still make it for you. Russel's Reserve Bourbon, Carpano Sweet Leaf Vermouth, Tobacco and Leather bitters, Maple syrup, toasted orange peel and Marasca  cherry. YUM.  For entrees: take a close look at the Meatloaf and the Short ribs. Both excellent!"}
{"text":"Sat at the bar for a cocktail and late night snack. Had the Citi-Zen which was a drink with a stick of rock candy! Genius! Also had the pita plate which was a nice helping for about $8 and the beef skewers. Just ok, expensive and you don't get much. Nice atmosphere and service. Food took a while to come out which I found weird considering what we ordered. Overall, good experience. Not sure I will be back though."}
{"text":"been twice.  was great on both occasions.  nearby Cartel coffee is well worth a visit also."}
{"text":"Well worth finding a parking spot.  I have been for lunch and dinner both the same menu.  The food was excellent fresh and I was told local."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our meal at Citizen Public House.  Our first move was to order drinks - my wife's sangria was particularly refreshing.   Our first bite was the optional bread service, served with a notably good olive oil. For starters we had the much acclaimed chopped salad. I typically don't address salads much in my reviews, but this salad was one of the highlights of the meal and our trip - it was awesome for a couple reasons. First, the flavors were great.  I didn't catch all the components, but the freeze-dried corn added crunch, and the protein came from smoked salmon. Second, the theater of the salad presentation and preparation was awesome. The server presented the salad with its ingredients nearly arranged in rows, and he added the awesome buttermilk dressing and tossed it at the table. The results were amazing. Our second starter was the Chia Seared Tuna, with purple sticky rice, asparagus purée, fried leaks and greens. The colors and presentation were great but the flavors were more muted. We liked it and it was fine but it was far overshadowed by the salad.   For entrees my wife had the scallops and I had the filet. The scallops were exceptional - perfectly cooked and perfectly seasoned on a puddle of creamy and buttery grits. Loved them. The filet was fine but not really exceptional. I liked it a lot and the preparation was fine but it wasn't really all that memorable. I did like it though. I really wanted the scallops but decided not to order the same entree as my wife.   For dessert we had the brownie sundae, which was good but not exceptional. The brown butter ice cream was a little icy - not offensively so, but it didn't taste like it was made same-day. The brownies were ok too.  The bartender was particularly attentive (in a good way). My brother-in-law (to be) was interested in trying a couple varieties of Scotch and the bartender came to our table and delighted in detailing his thoughts and letting him taste several options.   One more comment on Citizen Public House is that it could really be anywhere - from the menu you wouldn't know you were in the Southwest - I didn't see even a single solitary chili pepper on the menu.  Recap: chopped salad, scallops and service were all high points. Great place. Thumbs up."}
{"text":"Let me begin by stating that I'm from Los Angeles, and was not looking forward to the food during my trip to AZ. I usually don't leave reviews after a single visit but given the scenario, I thought why not.  This place is very good. Even in the cut throat restaurant business in LA, this place would make the mark.  The food is all great. I tried the lamb sandwich, meat loaf and short ribs. The short ribs were outstanding, and for 30 bucks, it was also a steal. Very strong beef flavor. Meat loaf was also among the better meat loaf dishes i had ever tried. It's pretty hard to make meatloaf taste \"not boring\" but the dish here was solid. The lamb burger came with battered fries which were very good with the homemade ketchup which was like a marinara. I'm surprised battered fries aren't more popular. The appetizer was my favorite: the pork belly pastrami. Very rich, not for everyone but portioned appropriately.  Service is great, ambience is perfect not too loud, not too quiet. Not too bright, not too dark. Price point is fairly accurate.  What makes this a 5 star rather than a 4 star however are the mixed drinks. They are spectacular. I had a 'Manhattan' which was perfect. So good that it hit me hard without me noticing. The 'career ender' was also good.   It's hard to maintain 800 reviews and still have a 4.5 star overall but I certainly see why this place succeeded in doing so. Next time I'm in old town Scottsdale I'll stop by again for sure."}
{"text":"I've eaten here for special occasions and just as a night out. I always love it. The classic salad of course is great. It's the one they're known for. The chicken and meatloaf are great. The tacos as well. Nice craft cocktails. Basically they're great."}
{"text":"I've been to this place numerous times and every time I get something different it is an incredible delicious meal. They are changing the menu so I don't even know if what I ordered is still on there but all the food is absolutely excellent and the service is incredible. The place gets pretty hopping on the weekends and at night good atmosphere good people good food. Good time! A+"}
{"text":"I came here once for lunch and was very pleased.  With all the great reviews on the chopped salad I new I had to try it.  It was the BEST chopped salad I've ever had!  It had the feel of an upscale pub, with upscale prices.  I would definitely come back for the salad."}
{"text":"The food is innovative and the drinks are interesting.  I like this place because I feel comfortable coming in dressed very casually or in a suit and getting great food.  The menu changes, but there are some items that have been there from the beginning.  The chef was big into bacon when he first opened up the place, but there are still hints of it like the bacon flavored popcorn.  I do miss the bacon in the bread pudding.   The place is really noisy.  Low ceilings with hard surfaces tend to reflect every word across the room.  Their sister restaurant The Gladly has a similar menu, but is much more quiet because of the high ceilings and carpeting.  The only problem is The Gladly is by the Biltmore Fashion Square and I live and work in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Moscow Mules and the scallops were amazing, while their chopped salad was bigger and just as good as Cowboy Chio's."}
{"text":"My first time visiting this place and it was a great experience. We didn't have reservations, but the host was getting ready to seat 4 people to a table and that they would be freeing up 4 people from the bar, so BAM, we got seated at the bar in about 2 minutes. Branden was the bartender/waiter and was an absolute crack up. The food was fresh, drinks were great, and there is no reason not to go back."}
{"text":"Expensive, eclectic and something different. Try the  World's End and the $25 meatloaf if you want something different and don't mind paying for it."}
{"text":"Wow, Citizen Public House blew me away with the level of service, and quality of food and drink. I loved the ambiance in the restaurant, with the sleek and modern décor. I came here for a birthday dinner, with a party of 8, and our server was on point! He was super friendly, funny, and had an impressive memory. The Original Chopped Salad was absolutely to die for and even has it's own Facebook page! I'm not normally a huge fan of salads, but you have to order this if you come here. The ingredients include corn, arugula, couscous, tomatoes, garlic, basil, etc. Every bite is super flavorful and has a lot of texture. Everyone at the table ordered the same salad, and loved it.   For my cocktail, I enjoyed the Second Generation, which consisted of Absolut Pear, chareau aloe liquer, aperol, lemon, simple syrup, and cucumber and mint. This was light, refreshing, and delicious. Hats off to the bartender!  I loved this restaurant, and can't wait to come back to try out the other menu items."}
{"text":"Will have to give this place another shot.  To be fair, I think it's closer to a 3.5 star rating.  Came here with a group of friends for Yelp Eats.  It was a Saturday night and it was both crowded and loud.  The menu is familiar (think of Cowboy Ciao mixed with Kasimeriz's wine nibbles).  There is the famous chopped salad (which I actually like sans the smoked salmon), fondue, burgers etc.  They have a lot of interesting items like blue cheese mac and cheese, pickled vegetables and sausages you don't genearlly see on the menu.  As part of Yelp eats, a portion of the menu was half off.  You really can't complain about the prices.  What I do take a little issue to is the use of salt.  The restaurant uses salt like it is going out of style.  It might have been that night, but everything came very liberally salted.  Also, I love bacon.  However, it seems like 2/3rds of the menu has bacon in it.  To the point it is almost gimmicky.  Although to be fair I did like the bacon grease popcorn, I just thought slices of bacon in my bread pudding was taking it a little too far.  The drinks are delicious.  If I was rating the drinks along, I would have given the place a 4.5 The service still needs some work.  It is clear that on really busy nights, the wait will be long.  Make sure you have good friends with you to pass the time away.  I did have to send one item back that was so salty it was inedible.  I was a little sad to see that there was no explanation and it was not taken off the bill.  (A little disconcerning given the fact that we were a large group, consuming and generating a good sized tab).  Overall, good place.  Fun but I'm not sure this will be my regular hangout.  I still prefer places where you don't have to shout to hear your neighbor across the way from you."}
{"text":"Loved this spot from the moment we walked in: vibrant atmosphere, excellent service, and great food. 4.5 stars  Food: 4, Atmosphere: 5, Service: 5 Cost to worth it rating: 3 (barrel aged cocktails $12, entrees $26-34) Return worthiness: yes  Highlights: - Cocktail menu: extensive list and unique barrel aged ones. I went with one of the bourbons. It was potent and tasty. Paired well with the bacon popcorn  - Bacon popcorn: hub awarded this the best thing he ate during our time in Scottsdale. Pieces of bacon plus tossed in some bacon fat. Could get a bit greasy but flavor was great and surprisingly not too in your face. 4.5 stars - Salad: never heard of a more hyped salad--has its own Facebook page and all--but it was very good. Think why it stands out is the variety of textures: dried corn, pumpkin seeds, little date pieces, Israeli cous cous, and arugula leaves. Another standout flavor was the marinaded tomato pieces. Default was salmon but we went with chicken and enjoyed it. 4.5 stars  - Scallops: solid version with good sized scallops cooked well. Velvety layer of grits were delicious with it. 4 stars - Dessert: caramel filled mousse cake and chocolate biscotti with ice cream was decadent. 4 stars - Irish coffee: excellent version with just the right amount of froth, sweetness, and cream - Atmosphere: lively room with a square bar in the center of it all. - Staff: everyone was friendly, knowledgable, and on the ball - Gluten free options: so many of the menu items were noted as gf which was nice to see  Midlights: - Short ribs: bit dry for my taste. 3 stars  Lowlights:  - Didn't have room to try the sandwiches: they looked really good   Best dinner we had this trip and I'd come back for sure."}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to try places that we probably wouldn't try. Sometimes it's the drive or the menu wasn't desirable to us. However we're glad we tried Citizen Public. The food, service and atmosphere were perfect. We enjoyed the famous chopped salad, pork belly pastrami, and Swordfish. The Swordfish is supplied by Chula Fisheries. It is line caught and delicious. We would definitely return.   Tonight I had one of the worst dinners of my life at CPH. We are basically talking about the food from start to finish.  The Apps we had was the chunky Hummus. It was supposed to be creamy.   App 2 was the Pork Belly Pastrami. It was ok with a sloppy presentation. App 3 was the original Chopped Salad. Of course it's not original. It started many years ago at a restaurant on Stetson in Scottsdale named Steven. And the salad was called the Clearwater Chopped. Clearly a copy. And Stevens was much better with better quality ingredients. Dinner was awful. Swordfish tonight was overlooked and really salty. Airline chicken( was like it's name. It belongs on an airplane. A hunk of dried out breast with no flavor.  Service was fair but accommodating. Ugh!! On the rest."}
{"text":"I stumbled onto this place thanks to Yelp!  My friend and I were enjoying ourselves at a beer festival down the street - and decided that we needed better food than the hot dogs they were serving there at the Venue.  So we strolled in, they had just opened, and we basically had the entire place to ourselves.  Since it was happy hour, we basically ordered one of everything.  No, we weren't sober.  But, yes, we were loving every bite.  The service was equally impressive, and I can't wait to go back for a full meal!"}
{"text":"There's nothing I wouldn't eat off this menu. Every bite of every course I've enjoyed here has always been perfect. Perfect in an okay  ready for heaven kind of way.   I do have to mention the deep sea crab cakes b/c they're the best crab cakes I've had in a while. Hands down.  I was there last night, and I'm still thinking about those crab cakes.   They put out high quality and wonderfully fresh food. Hats off to the chef."}
{"text":"Fun spot! We sat up at the bar (there was no seating in the dining room).  We ordered snacks and drinks.  The staff was friendly.  Seemed a bit like a touristy spot.  Drinks were good. We ordered the Charcuterie board and it was nice."}
{"text":"This was my second visit to this restaurant. And it did not disappoint.  Both my dining companion and I ordered the scallops and it would be an understatement to say that we were amply rewarded. The scallops were prepared JUST right. The tenderness was proof that the back of the house is in command.  Now that combined with attentive and courteous service, made it a very pleasurable experience.  Restaurants are a dime a dozen in the Old Town area. This I can tell you is a sure bet.  Thanks guys.  Will return."}
{"text":"Just had an amazing dinner here. The chopped salad was beautiful and delicious, had every component a salad should have. The service was impeccable, so attentive and informative. Brad was our waiter, not only good looking, but considerate of our palates. I highly recommend the crab cakes, one sniff made my mouth water and when that first bite hit my tongue...heaven!!! Thank you Citizen Public House for a fantastic dining experience. Will be back for more, most definitely."}
{"text":"I must preface this review by saying my expectations were very high for CPH. For no reason really, I hadn't heard any recommendations I just thought this place would be awesome.  Maybe it's all in the name, nevertheless I was disappointed. The food was above average probably deserving more them three stars but everything else was average at best. Well except the lighting, that seemed to be the perfect level of dim. The decor was bland, the walls seemed stark, random plastic house plants were the only decoration other then the poorly framed and hung black and whites. As you can probably already tell my disappointment lies almost totally in the ambiance. It just lacked that something cool that many other restrantuants in the Phoenix area these days have. But like I said the food was above average, i had the burger and it was good (the fries are exceptional). The service was very good and there are some good specialty drinks that were well made.  I would recommend at least 5 other places to try before this one especially given the price."}
{"text":"My new favorite spot to eat and drink! Excellent service and the food is phenomenal! I come here at least twice a week now and have tried almost everything. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Indeed, this Citizen shall enter the House open to the Public!  I ordered the Connelly's Grilled Cheese with little expectations.  Wow! I was surprised with my first bite, savory ham, melted cheddar cheese, and the pickled cherry's to bring in that extra sweet kick.  The crusted toast was a most welcomed texture to my senses.  Well done good Citizen, well done!  We sat at the bar for some drinks (Czech Republic - Pilsner cool!) Service was excellent!  Decors, were really modern, but with a name like Citizen Public House, can't help but the think of the movie Citizen Kane.  \"You still eating?\": \"I\"m still hungry!\" - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Good but not great food, drinks are 4 oz / $10 - tasty but disappointing, great atmosphere, trendy food, the chopped salad was good!!"}
{"text":"Our group of 3 wandered in after 10pm looking for something to soak up the booze. Luckily, one of our 3 just happened to be the Duke, and boy were we treated well!  I ordered the pork belly appy - and it was everything I've ever wanted in a small bite. Pork belly pastrami. Rye spaetzle. Brussel sprout sauerkraut. Mustard jus. I will never look at a Rueben the same way ever again. This took something so comforting and elevated it. My mouth still waters just thinking about it.   Service was great! Definitely looking forward to my next meal here!"}
{"text":"Been here twice and enjoyed it both times. Beware non pork lovers - there is a lot on the menu, or at least part of many dishes. The Burrata appetizer was delicious, I had the short ribs - they were the best I've ever had!"}
{"text":"I love Citizen Public House. I always sit at the bar, try at least two or three of their cocktails and usually just have some appetizers. The staff, atmosphere, drinks, wine, it's all on point.   There's not much else to say. I just really like it here."}
{"text":"All the wonderful reviews are well deserved!  My mom and I loved the food, and the service was extraordinary ...Thanks Clark!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and food.  Crabcakes and scallops were top-notch - expect small portions"}
{"text":"I really struggled with what to rate CPH and contemplated over a few days......Yep, I care about my fellow yelpers that much. So as for my dining experience, it was very disappointing. I selected CPH not just for an early dinner, but to take my wife out for her birthday. Upon arrival, CPH was very quiet and only two other tables were occupied. With that said, you would think we would have been provided with a somewhat intimate birthday dinning experience...ummmmm, not so much.  We were taken over and plopped right next to the other two tables. The whole place was empty and we were placed there?!?! Really?! My only thought was staff were trying to save our waiter steps. Anyhow, we rolled with it.  For dinner, I noticed we caught happy hour and we decided to try their olives and cheese fondue that came with bread, sausage, and pear. The cheese fondue was good and the sausage was tasty. I was also pleasantly surprised how well the pear paired :) with the cheese. For dinner we decided to try out their signature original salad, the meatloaf, and the short rib. I forgot to mention our daughter came with, so don't be thinking we killed all the food alone. The salad was good, not five stars good in my opinion but good. Was glad my wife enjoyed it. The meatloaf was okay but not amazing. I really enjoyed the mashed potatoes that came with the dish. As for the short rib, it was awesome. I loved the sauce that came with the dish. Unfortunately, the parsnip puree that came with the dish was not good, but I would definitely recommend the dish and ask for mashed potatoes as the side. Just my thoughts.   Now as our dinner experience was coming to an end and aside from where we were seated the night was decent. The food was pretty good, not Top Chef kind of good, but fine. So for dessert, I assumed there would be some sort of acknowledgment of my wife's special day. When I scheduled our reservation, I informed staff of the reason for the visit. I also confirmed upon arrival that we were early for our birthday reservation. So as you can guess, she got nothing. No happy birthday, no little treat, nothing, nada.  Our waitress just quickly laid dessert menus in front of each of us and waited for our thoughts. At this point I am thinking maybe they will do up the dessert we choose and so after review of the menu we ask for the push pop dessert. So after a minute or two, out comes the push pop as plain as can be. No happy birthday, nothing. To top it off, the dessert was clearly not designed for three people. I take part of the blame as I thought the components of the dish would be functional for more than one mouth but at the same time, staff could have spoken up and offered their thoughts since they have seen the dish before. The icing on the cake for the cake she did not get was as we were getting up to leave, I noticed the table two over was provided with a little cake and candle. Good to see it does exist.  Anyhow, overall we left disappointed.  I expect a certain level of perfection when you are going to spend the cash CPH asks for. I have no issues paying the price, but just did not get what I was hoping for for my wife. I felt very sorry her night did not go as I planned. Bummer."}
{"text":"This place consistently has the best drinks, service and food. I am a regular and will continue to patronize this place. The chopped salad is pretty unique. The burger is usually my go-to."}
{"text":"Came for a late lunch/early dinner date with the husband. I had high expectations from all of the rave reviews. Ordered the Kiltlifter Fondue which comes with Asian pear, bread, and a wee bit of spicy sausage. It was good, but I kinda wanted a really cheesy fondue, and this one is more of a cheesy liquid sauce. Overall, pretty good but not rave-worthy.   We ordered the Lamb Burger and the Truffle Grilled Cheese. The lamb burger was... ok. It wasn't anything special or delectable. I've definitely had better lamb burger/sandwiches other places. The components were all there and decent, especially the bread, but the meat was just lacking. And the Kennebec fries? They were aight. Not crack as some other Yelpers have claimed.   The Grilled cheese was uber cheesy - probably the best thing we ordered. The mashed potatoes were an interesting addition and tasty... but I hate when my sandwich fillings spill out when you take a bite. It was really a great, tasty sandwich, but could have used a side of tomato soup to add a zing to it. The side salad was a great mix of cranberries, cashews, goat cheese, tomatoes and balsamic dressing.   Our waitress was wonderful and did a great job of keeping our glasses filled, BUT it took a loooooooong time to get our food, and we were one of 4 SMALL parties dining at that time. And I didn't feel that our orders were complicated. I dunno, but it was a really really long wait. And on a somewhat random side note, the bathrooms, while clean, smelled absolutely horrid. Like hold-your-breath-hurry-up-and-get-outta-here horrid.  Now.... would I come back? Yes, to try the pastrami and scallops that are so raved about, but I'm in no rush to do so. And I will also plan on using the loo elsewhere beforehand."}
{"text":"Having read these reviews i expected more. So very compelled to review myself.   Service excellent, atmosphere classy and chill, menu, same as atmosphere.   Gastronomically this place is classy, definitely aspires for that modern blend of fresh farm ingredients and high fat natural  elements like butter, cream bacon and cheese. TOO much bacon on this menu for sure, jews and muslims must not apply.   Food:  Pita and Hummus from Bar side of Menu: Oddly the best of the 7 things we had! I ate it up! the pita is too good, i think it's fresh baked, falls apart into s gooey bready goodness, the eggplant hummus amazing especially when combined with these little sour pickles that it's served with. YUM  Gaspacho- the tomato puree with slices of cucumber and radish was only ok, flavor profile definitely weak, resembled baby food to me and i LOVE good gaspacho, could have backed a little kick, even pepper would improve it, but the 2 shrimps that came inside it were cooked to painful perfection. Definitely executed well, the recipe itself is blah, won't have again.   Chopped salad- everyone raves about this salad, and it's good, but it's really not that good at all, it's own facebook page? ah sounds like a fad to me, the dry freezed corn in it is a let down, it's crunchy sure, but the seeds are enough crunch in there, but actual corn like grilled off the cob would have given this salad a gravitas it really needs, ground it, earthy it up, because it's  very light, it's got lox and seeds and etc so it's got various textures, but somehow nothing stands out so it's like a pleasant mush in your mouth, i think most of all it could be improved by a better dressing than the generic ranch it comes with, i might have had an entirely different impression of it if the dressing was lighter, sweeter, more acidic and again perhaps more peppery or spicy-sorry to say but this salad didn't stand out for me, and i live for salad  Watermelon salad- very different, never had anything like it, worth having just to try, beautiful on the eyes, but really is more of  cheese and watermelon plate, playing on the old and wonderful combo of fruit & cheese, take a bite of your watermelon with a bite of the cheese and maybe a salad leaf, it's tasty.   Scallops- Good normal well assembled dish....TOO MUCH BACON, must the gorgeous delicacy of a well prepped scallop always be obstructed by bacon? Over wrought, I feel like this trend ought to be retired, i get the appeal of surfy turfy plates, but scallops themselves are enough, i don't need them floating in bacon fat(not literally, they are served beautifully) surrounded by chunks of piggy, it's not that clever bringing the demise of these very contrary creatures onto the same playing field, we get it, none of gods creatures are safe when humans crack open their cookbooks, the novelty has long worn off for me, decadence is better served by letting one or the other shine, and not having them struggle on a plate for attention like two adopted siblings.   Grilled cheese sandwich - Sort of awesome if you are willing to take in about a weeks worth of fat and cholesterol, it's stuffed with mashed potatoes, you can taste the cream in them, truffle oil, caramelized onions and cheese, bread is soaked in butter cooked with egg, it's rich as hell, tastes really good, i could go with a little less rich and  little less butter, but i am not sure if the function of a good grilled cheese sandwich is not precisely to be rich, so i am torn. I think though i would have enjoyed it more if it wasn't such a heartattack cubed on a plate, came with a cute salad i enjoyed, and strange throw away veggies that looked better than they tasted.  Bread Pudding: We had to send it back, may be the worst i ever had, and that's rough but not an exaggeration. Hard dry old tasting coarse bread situation with icecream on top. Huge let down and not consistent with the quality of the food they served prior to it. i expect something of sublime quality even if not to my taste, but it was just a yucky afterthought.   Pros: other than the Bread Pudding food is quality, carefully assembled, thought out fresh and pretty. Everything is Cooked right. Service GREAT   Cons: Bread basket, stale and boring with surprisingly not good olive oil. no way to start a meal.  No coffee drinks other than espresso and no milk variations other than whole. a non fat latte would have really made my night.   Happy dining."}
{"text":"I was in town on business and came here off of a recommendation. Was not disappointed! I went with the filet mignon and it was perfect. Great ambiance, awesome food, and a knowledgeable bartender. What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"I had dinner here the other night and I was very happy with it. The chopped salad is the same as Cowboy Ciao's, and just as good. Later I learned that it's the same chef from Cowboy Ciao who brought over many or similar items. I ended up choosing the chicken as I had eaten a burger the night before. My girlfriend ordered the lamb burger and I was extremely jealous. My chicken was ok, it didn't blow me away, but the burger was amazing. The third in our group ordered the ribs and they were also fantastic. The meat just fell off the bone, was very tender, and had a lot of flavor. We'll definitely be coming back, and next time I'll get the burger."}
{"text":"Service was not very attentive. Bartenders were loud, numerous staff standing around chatting instead of checking on customers. Waitress did not offer bread or refill of beverages. Food was over cooked and when we informed our sever she made no effort to fix it. As we were leaving, 4 hostesses were at the stand and not one said a word such as; thank you or goodnight. Very disappointed as the prices were not cheap. Expected better quality overall."}
{"text":"Let me start my saying that we had fantastic service at Citizen Public House.   I was not impressed with the atmosphere. The famous Chopped Salad was probably one of, if not the best salads I have ever had.  My friend had the Seabass and it was not a thick filet like we are accustomed to, instead it was two very thin dry pieces with a strange tasting sauce.  I had the short ribs which were flavorful, but inconsistently cooked and the parsnip puree and greens again had a strange taste. At the price point, I would have expected more."}
{"text":"3.5. Mixed feelings about this place. We were really excited to dine here and I reserved for 5:30 since it was still Social Hour until 6 and we could take advantage of those deals in addition to our main meal.   We were seated promptly and the restaurant was pretty empty but it was early. It quickly filled up so that was a relief.   We ordered a featured rosé off the social hour menu and my husband ordered the Julep (barrel aged cocktail). My rosé was excellent and supposed to be $5.   We decided to go with the Charcuterie Board to start and it was a good choice. Great meat and cheese selection with an amazing apple butter and ground mustard and omg, the bread was so good!  Suddenly I was full so we didn't order another dish. However, my husband wanted another cocktail and we were hoping to take advantage of the social hour price but our waiter didn't come to our table from 5:50-6:06. He didn't offer my husband the price on the social hour and instead came back to the table after we ordered the drink at 6:06 to say it wasn't on happy hour anymore and were we ok with that.   I've been to plenty places and when the happy hour is about to end the waiter either comes to ask if we want anything else or they'll honor the price if they're late to ask.   Then our check came and my rosé was $10. No way. I got the waiter to correct it but come on...I shouldn't have had to point it out.   Sigh. Perhaps this is quite the spot and they don't care about lost revenue from visitors like me. Or maybe the waiter was mad bc we didn't order anymore food. I wasn't hungry anymore though and don't want to stuff my face just to get good service."}
{"text":"This place has been in business for 5 years now and not sure why it took me so long to try it.  The staff is friendly and helpful.    The menu offers many temptations and while I enjoy an entree I did not stick to the typical dining.   While they offer appetizers, salads, entrees and more they also offer a variety of small plates.  We ordered 6 different small plates.  Each were very tasty, especially the eggplant dish!  I look forward to dining again soon at this Old Town Scottsdale gem!"}
{"text":"The service at Citizen was amazing! Our waiter, Brad was so personable and passionate, he made our experience SO wonderful! Very knowledgeable and so pleasant.  We went to Citizen last night. The highlight of the dinner was the chop salad- it is INCREDIBLE! The smoked salmon was delicious- soft, juicy, and so flavorful. The herb dressing- amaze! The most pleasant surprise was their signature roasted mix of pumpkin seeds, berries, etc. The salad is so good that we are going to go to the airport early just to get another :-)  I had the \"Caesar\" - a deconstructed Caesar salad. The meat was so moist and very flavorful. Brad explained this was because it was not brined, but soaked in a buttermilk mixture. Regardless, it was yummy. I was lost by the rest of the dish, though. The chicken sat on some Caesar dressing. With the amazing flavor of the chicken, I was confused why they chose to put it over dressing, leaving a grilled wedge of lettuce naked on the other side of the plate. There were two dollops of puréed vegetables. Very bland and cold- yuck.  My fiancé had the scallops. He said they were amazing and I kept eating the grits off of his plate- cheesey with some balsamic. Soooooo yummy!  Our friend had the short ribs- he said they were overcooked. Our other friend had the tacos and did not comment on them.  The service, the scallops, and the salad knocked this place out of the park! Unfortunately the others were just a little blah."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar last night and had the best time ever! Bartender took me through all the cocktails, helping me pick my first and second choices. Ordered the chop salad (yum) then the coffee-rubbed spare ribs. Holy moly, so good. Everyone there was so friendly and wonderful - even our busboy spent 5 minutes chatting with us about what we ordered. Seriously yum and such a good night!"}
{"text":"I like this place, service is excellent and quality is great.. this is how should be in every restaurant in town. Good job."}
{"text":"I'm addicted to their chopped salad. I love to sit at the bar and have the bartender bring me his favorite wine. Cute place with consistent service, quality food and good wine. Get the salad!"}
{"text":"I had an excellent dinner here the other night. The service was top notch- the hostess made sure we had a table with plenty of room for our baby's stroller and a few other waiters stopped by throughout the meal to say hi to the baby--everyone was super friendly! Our waiter was great- very on top of drink refills and gave us some great suggestions.  We split:  The Original Chopped Salad: A MUST when dining here. Unfortunately I'm allergic to salmon so had to have mine without that component but it was delicious. All the flavors are really unique- I've never had a salad quite like this. It was perfect to share with 3 people or have as your meal alone  Crab Cake appetizer: Great, fresh and tangy slaw  Pan Seared Scallop: Simple but tasty  Short Ribs: Rich, perfectly cooked  Heart of Caramel: very tasty- great end to a meal- pretty rich so it was perfect to share"}
{"text":"Such a GREAT place!!! Food and service were fantastic! The rum punch was the best, Mac n cheese was wonderful... chopped salad was great... the scallops were truly PHENOMENAL!!! seriously my new favorite place!"}
{"text":"The food and service here is amazing. So glad I was able to try this restaurant out during my short trip in Phoenix. This is a great place for couples and families. We did not have to wait for a seat on a Friday evening around 7pm for two people. I can imagine a long wait on Saturdays though.   We shared the pork belly pastrami, chopped salad, and meatloaf. It was way more than enough food for two people. My favorite dishes were the chopped salad and pork belly pastrami. I love the way the food was presented as well. I thought the meatloaf was just okay. I would probably pass on that next time.  The waiter was so nice and split our meatloaf into two separate plates for us because he knew we were sharing the entree! At first we thought he accidentally ordered 2 of the dishes, haha. Overall this is a great restaurant with amazing food and would recommend it to anyone!"}
{"text":"Absolutely one of the best restaurants in old town.  The staff is friendly but not overly nice, which is a plus. The food is authentic, the people are genuine."}
{"text":"I picked this restaurant for an out-of-town dinner based on the Yelp reviews, and was very disappointed. I don't know if everyone else here just came on a better night with a different staff or what, but this was not the dining experience you all described. The food was just OK, not awesome or Earth-shattering. We had a variety of appetizer plates - mac n cheese, crab cakes, chicken & waffles - that were way overpriced and just average at best. We didn't get the pork belly because they wouldn't serve it without the sauerkraut - made from brussel sprouts!?! (seriously?) The server also raved about the drinks there and the \"awesome mixologists\" but the bar selection was tepid (no Sapphire, only Beefeater?) and they couldn't even make a mojito? I know that can be a  'specialty' drink in some areas but we saw plenty of them on other menus around Scottsdale. But the worst was the service and attitude of the staff; we were IGNORED all night. The server was affable and friendly but would disappear for long stretches of time. 20 minutes to get drinks, when the bar wasn't busy?? And our appetizers took almost twice that long to appear. He also forgot the bread, and didn't ask about another round of drinks until we were ready to leave! The place was a little busy but hardly packed (it was after 9pm), so we couldn't figure out what was going on.  It seemed like everyone working there was more concerned with enforcing the cool hipster vibe than actually doing any work. Except for the hostess - whose job apparently involved stomping through the restaurant periodically and angrily glaring at us like we were keeping her from something far more important. Seriously, we barely interacted with this woman (other than to ask for a table) and yet we were ducking the daggers shooting from her eyes all night. WTF was that all about? Look, any restaurant can have an off night; maybe they were short-handed in the kitchen or something. But to not acknowledge it all and generally avoid your patrons is not the tactic I would have run with."}
{"text":"Great food and service. We had the spicy burger and roasted chicken and it was very good. A good place for a date, friday night out, or even work happy hour."}
{"text":"Fancy pants meets working class watering hole.  I've visited this spot a few times via friend recommendation on the food.    Pork belly is amazing, shrimp pasta is surprisingly creamy and flavored with garlic and deliciousness.  Mussels are to die for!    What really got me about CPH is the gathering of every day people just wanting to enjoy a drink.  If you're in the service industry this bar will be a second home for you!  In spite of it's romantic feel, candle lit tables and linen tablecloths; you will feel right at home with the friendliest bartenders in Old Town.    Not pretentious but could be if it wanted to."}
{"text":"This weekend I took my girlfriend to Citizen Public House.  Before we were even done with our meal we were already discussing what we wanted to try on our next visit.  We started with two cocktails.  She had the Bellentini and I had the 1884 Manhattan.  I love Manhattans and this was one of the best that I have had--it was incredibly smooth and flavorful.  For our appetizer, we split the gorgonzola-emmental mac-n-cheese., and for our main courses we had the Grilled Cheese of the Day and the Fair Trade Coffee Charred Short Ribs.  Everything was incredible--including the service--and we wished we had room for an Irish Coffee and one of the many tempting desserts."}
{"text":"looking back, I think my expectations were a lot higher than the price and thought I was going to find a real gem.   The service was definitely good, but it was also very rushed. I sat at the bar and ordered the grilled peach salad and the hangar steak.   The peaches were tasteless and rock hard (although perfect grill marks) and although it was not over dressed, the vinegar just took over because there just wasn't enough flavors on the plate. Even the bacaon lardon crips were 'eh' and I love pork.   The hangar steak was so-so. But maybe this is my fault. Hangar steak is a great cut of meat if done right and personally, i think the only way to do Hangar is sous-vide that thing for a long slow bath. Otherwise, you don't break down the tough pars and the center is under cooked.   They slapped some asparagus on top, heaped a bunch of chipolini onions on the side and went light on the sauce.   There is good potential here and I probably ordered way wrong. I'll give it another try next time i'm in town but I was not overly impressed based on the many stellar reviews."}
{"text":"Probably the best porkchop I've ever had,  super flavorful (got it medium rare). Fondue is wonderful as well, also got the Four Seasons beer they had on tap and a Moscow Mule, which both complimented the meal well. A bit on the expensive side but well worth the price."}
{"text":"All around outstanding dining experience. Our waiter, Sam was incredibly knowledgeable about the menu and very friendly. Nice open casual dining area. I've heard many good things about this place, and let me tell you, the ratings are true. Very attentive wait staff. Never an empty water cup. Price was good for portion size and quality. Lets talk about food now!  Had to take advantage of the great happy hour prices. Ordered the Kilt Lifter Fondue, which was served with sliced pears, sausage and bread chucks. Large portions & very tasty.    We split the chopped salad with smoked salmon. Incredible mix of flavors, every bit was a perfect mixture of awesomeness. This dish is a MUST TRY.  I ordered the crab cakes app as my main dish. They were very good, perfectly cooked with no weird fishy taste. You can tell they are made fresh, not from frozen. Very tasty.  BF got the meatloaf. It was recommended to us by our waiter. Glad we listened to him, it was fantastic. Great flavor, you can tell they use high quality meat. There was a perfect amount of sauce and nice portion of potatoes.   We sampled the bread pudding and chocolate brownie. Both very rich and decadent. We did not try any of the cocktails, but the selection was huge. Maybe next time. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Always a lovely experience here. Staff is really nice and I'm crazy about the famous chopped salad. I could eat it everyday"}
{"text":"If you like over priced food and tiny portions this is the place for you. Sure the ambience is nice. The staff is friendly. The service is fine. But I'm a gosh dang man and I need to fill my belly. I'm not a fan of a cocky Cheff in the kitchen drizzling his special sauces all over my plate just so it can look fancy and he can jip me on my portion size in the name of gourmet. Honestly the flavors don't blow my mind either. We paid $28 for a scallop \"entree\" that came with 3 scallops and some overly cooked spinach and of course Cheff drizzles. If you're a wine-o and get a bit tipsy before hand you should be fine. Call me uncultured, maybe I don't fit the Scottsdale mold, but I won't be returning. Tonight this citizen has been let down by the public house."}
{"text":"Citizen Public has some great reviews and they are justified.   My husband and I were seated in the smaller dining area inside.    It was  a nice  location out of the heat on the patio, and quieter than the big dining area.       We got there at the end of the Happy Hour and tried the Artichoke (soooo tender), and the Bone Marrow with Ricotta Pancakes (pancakes were great rolled around the marrow but there was very little marrow to share).   The Grilled Peach Salad sounded very good and it was different so we both ordered that.    We were disappointed and we provided feedback to our waiter.  The peaches were not ripe.  They were too hard and lacked flavor.   (More on this below).  For our main courses my husband had the Pan Seared Scallops (which he loved) and I had the Flat Iron Steak (very good!)   Partway through our meal our waiter showed up with  the chicken version of their famous chopped salad to make up for the disappointing peach salads.    I had told him earlier I wasn't fond of smoked salmon so he had one made with chicken instead.       OMG!  I could not stop eating it.   It was delicious and full of different tastes and textures.    We topped off the meal with the Heart of Caramel dessert.  We were already stuffed but couldn't pass up trying a dessert (good!).  We will be back."}
{"text":"My wife's company rented out the \"upper room\" area. We got to try multiple dishes.   The mac and cheese was bomb.   The chopped salad was amazing.   The chicken was flavorful, but nothing amazing.   The steak was ok, but had this disgusting mustard on it.   Our bartender was very nice and showed us a lot of cool tricks, and some secrets about this place ;)"}
{"text":"It's no secret that this place is great.  Took my valentine here for dinner and it was beautiful.  The service was great, the food was delicious, and it made me look like a thoughtful boyfriend.  What more could a man want? I had the duck, which was cooked perfectly."}
{"text":"CPH is great for groups!  I admit it, (and I'm sorry, Chef Bernie), but I've only been to Citizen Public House on two occasions to date... That being said, both times I was there for events, and both times CPH did a great job.  My first visit was an event with passed appetizers and drinks shortly after they opened, and the other was for a happy hour / sit-down dinner for a group of 45 people, just last week.    Since it's more fresh in my mind, I'll go into more detail about the latter visit... We started on the patio and had drinks and some light apps including hummus and flatbread and their delicious bacon fat heirloom popcorn.  (They had vegetarian popcorn as well).  After about an hour, we moved inside to where there were three large rectangular tables set for our group with our own special menus.  We were able to choose from two mini-salads and four entrees and then we had family-style desserts.  I went with the infamous \"original Chopped salad\" to start and then chose the Pan Seared Scallops as my entree.  I think I cleaned both plates... and those around me likely had order envy as I definitely ordered right!  In addition, service was spectacular... somehow the Citizen staff managed to serve all 45 of us within minutes of each other!  They also kept our waters and our wine glasses full, which I'm sure added to the experience.  I recently saw a preview of the new fall menu which includes some interesting items such as Chicken & Waffles, Applewood Smoked Duck Breast, and Grits + Gumbo... I will have to head back over there soon to give these things a try... that is, if I feel adventurous enough to order something other than what I know I love (the original Chopped salad and the scallops).  Whether you stick with your old stand-by favorites or try something new, enjoy!"}
{"text":"We had wine and the bacon fat heirloom popcorn. The bartender said it was like crack and he was right on the money! Great atmosphere and menu! Looking forward to my next visit and having dinner."}
{"text":"The cocktails are the absolute best in the city. Try the Aviation and the Citizen.  They keep all the best dishes on the menu while also adding other creative dishes. I hope they keep the pastrami pork belly for ever.  The service is always exceptional. Sit at the bar if you don't like to wait even a minute for another cocktail.  I have been there about thirty times, and I have never had a less than stellar experience."}
{"text":"Great service, great drinks be it wine, bourbon or tequila.  I sat at the bar during happy hour and had a few drinks then sat with a friend for dinner.  The bartender knew his drinks and made a perfect Manhattan.  When seated I ordered the pork chop which was cooked perfectly and glazed I think in bourbon sauce.  They have a great wine menu and the server knew her pairings.  I'm a die hard Cabernet drinker but she recommended an old vine Zinfandel that paired perfectly.  Every time I go I just like the hell out of this restaurant.  Damn good - get some!"}
{"text":"I was in town for the Culinary Arts Festival and got a recommendation for this place for Friday night. The place looked cool and the server was very friendly. I started with the sangria and it was a good place to start. Between the three of us, we started with the flatbread, the original chopped, and the korean pear salad. All three were tasty and delicious. I loved the flavors of my salad the best, but the chopped had a lot of taste going on and the hummus was smooth and subtle (ie-not too heavy on the garlic). Great start to the meal indeed. For dinner, I ordered the halibut and my dinner partners-in-crime ordered the pork tenderloin and the short-ribs. Bites of all three confirmed tastiness once again. To round things out, dessert menus arrived.  We ordered the strawberry poundcake, the bread pudding, and the cookies and milk. And here is where they lost that fifth star. The cookies were terrible. Three of the four were hard as rocks. The spicy chocolate was the only one with flavor that was recognizable. The other three were kitchen experiments gone awry--and not awry in that \"this is experimental and new so it must be good\" kind of way. Awry in that spit this out and we know why they serve it with milk kind of way. If you are going to have an awesome restaurant and you want to be clever by offering cookies and milk, bake some good cookies. Or buy good cookies. If they can make bread pudding, they can make cookies (or take them completely off the menu)."}
{"text":"Went for a Valentines dinner and was dazzled. Great food great service. 2 cocktails, one appetizer, 2 entrées, 2 glasses of wine, and dessert for $140. Very reasonable."}
{"text":"First time dining here - we went for restaurant week. Overall, it was ok. My expectations were really built up by these reviews, and in relation I was a bit underwhelmed. It's still a good restaurant, but I expected great, so that's influencing my rating here.  As for the deets... atmosphere was excellent and I'm glad to have a place like this in the area. We had mixed reviews on the food, however. The bacon popcorn was interesting and tasty. The chopped salad was amazing and I agree completely with other reviewers on that one. I would have liked that as an entree size and skipped my main plate. I got the pork sirloin, which was dried out and the flavors were trying too hard. Maybe it was exacerbated by the contrast between it and the salad before it, which was so lovely and subtle in how it came together. I was disappointed. I got my fiance to agree to split the entrees and had part of his Smart Chicken. It was certainly better - well cooked and juicy, with delicious crisp skin on top, but the flavors were overpoweringly earthy - the balance wasn't to my taste with too much mushroom (I love mushrooms but to be fair, these were one of the few kinds I don't like for this reason). As for dessert - I had the bacon apple bread pudding, and though I liked it, some of the bacon inside was too soft and put me off as far as texture. I also didn't like the strong smokiness left in my mouth in the end of the meal. I've had bacon in desserts before that did a better job balancing the sweetness with the meatness and this was just ok."}
{"text":"Best chopped salad ever ! It totally blew my mind away. I could eat this salad every day. Ordered lamb burger which was delish. The juiciest burger with an amazing sauce and pickled veggies which goes so well together. The ketchup for the fries was astoundingly good. Loved the service and ambience."}
{"text":"Made a reservation for MNO for 6 of us mamas.  When we arrived we had 2 people cancel and the hostess had no problems quickly rearranging the table set up for us.  We were quickly seated! Great start  We ordered some cocktails.  I had their mule, refreshing with a little zap from the alcohol!  Perfect  We started with some nibbles, the bacon popcorn and the chop salad to share at the table.  The chopped salad being their signature item did not disappoint! The bacon popcorn...who thinks of this stuff-totally delicious!   I proceeded to order the short rib which honest to God was one of the best things I've ever put in my mouth! (Food!!! Get your head outta the gutter man!!! :P) I couldn't stop eating it and the next thing you know it was gone and I was licking the plate and my belly was full and I was in my happy place!   For dessert I don't remember what it was that we shared, but it was chocolatey and crunchy and creamy all at the same time - decadent and delicious!    I told my girlfriends that I can't wait to come back with the husband for a date night!      Bravo CPH...super crazy yumm!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and lovely atmosphere: dim, candle lit, and the ambience of chatter. Substantial beverage selection and rich food options. Definitely an adults only restaurant, great for a date and nice for groups as well."}
{"text":"Came in from out of town for a weekend of Spring Training. A family member from the area recommended we try this place and the reviews on here are pretty overwhelmingly positive. We showed up at about 8:45 pm, put our name in and were told that it would be an hour wait. Normally, and hour wait for a popular place wouldn't have bothered me. Saturday night, Spring Training, etc... I get it. The only problem in this situation, was that the restaurant was half empty. I counted no less than 15 empty tables. So I pressed the host a bit and was told in a rather rude manner that the empty tables I saw all around me were reserved and that the best he could do is call us if something opens up. At this point I'm thinking to myself \"Hm, the place is only open for another 3 hours and all those tables are reserved?! There was no line of people outside, no one waiting to sit down inside and a bunch of empty tables... I'm confused.\"  I definitely felt like he, for whatever reason, just didn't want us in there. Maybe it was that we were still decked out in our baseball gear from earlier, maybe because I didn't stroll in wearing a Rolex and offer him $200 for a table... in any case, I've never felt so sized up in my life. Kinda ironic that the name of the place is Citizen Public House... clearly they're not interested in serving an average everyday citizen.  Can't offer anything one way or another on the food because I never got a chance to try it. What I can say, is that I left that place very upset. Not a welcoming place, at least it wasn't last night."}
{"text":"We just landed and we were starving. Of course my husband says \"I always wanted to try this place, well let's go.\"   We had to make a reservation so of course I made a Yelp reservations.   We arrived with an adorable hostess letting us pick our seat.    Citizens menu is similar to The Glady.  I had the scallops in a creamy grits sauce. It was delicious but the grits needed to be piping hot.  That's just me, I need steam coming out of my food.  LoL, but I really enjoyed it.   I would definitely try this place again.  Yummy!"}
{"text":"I read the reviews on here so I decided to try this place. The original chopped salad was one of the best salads that I've had. It was very tasty with good texture. I also tried the pork belly pastrami which was also very tasty and moist. For the main entrees we had the seared scallops and the steak. Both were really good. To finish it off, we had the heart of caramel for dessert. I was impressed with the caramel however there's a lot of chocolate in the dessert which was a little too much for my palette. Overall it was a good experience and I will definitely be back. I'll likely just order and share the appetizers."}
{"text":"The chopped salad alone is worth going here. Service is ok- our waiter could have been friendlier but overall- the food was delicious so we would come back!"}
{"text":"I was very impressed with this place and just about everything I got was very delicious. They have an interesting selection of cocktails and they are definitely worth trying.   The highlight of my meal was the chopped salad. My friends thought I was crazy for ordering a salad but I sure proved them wrong. One of the best salads I have had. It made me look at salads a whole different way.  Stay away from the chicken and waffles. I'm not sure if I just got a bad batch but it was way too salty."}
{"text":"My favorite thing about CPH is that it's consistent.  Consistently freaking delicious.  The service is outstanding, and when you combine that with their superior ingredients/menu options you have a triple threat.  It's modern, and pretty intimate - I'm a fan of the patio.  It's tucked away and I think a little hard to find, so keep your eyes peeled (and turn down the radio) when you're looking for it.   Must haves: fondue, bacon popcorn, pork belly pastrami."}
{"text":"Part of my Hubby's Valentine's surprise was bringing me here for dinner. It was perfect from start to finish! Our waiter was wonderful!! It was a set menu, I chose the chia tuna as my 1st and my Husband (JB) had the chop, both were amazing! I LOVED the chop!  JB loved the tuna! My second was the scallops, and it was up there as one of the best plates I have had. JB had the filet and it was good, but not amazing.  I noticed it had that same sauce as the meatloaf from when I was first here. I just don't think the taste is fitting to the dish.  Then dessert, the caramel sauce made the red velvet perfect and the flourless chocolate cake was so great! I think the texture made it the best!! Beyond rich! Soooo good! I look forward to another visit for sure! Maybe happy hour, I love a budget gourmet feast, the $170 tab for tonight was a little much, but very much worth it. It was the perfect way to end our romantic day!  Side note ... Thank you/sorry (what ever fits) to the fellow diners that had the deal with our loving affectionate way of dining... The feeding each other and kissing constantly is how we roll... :P  I love you SBM!! Thank you for an amazing Valentine's day!!!"}
{"text":"Scrumdoddle. Great service and delicious food. We had the beet salad, mac and cheese, and pork belly pastrami starter (my favorite). The lamb (special) and beef tips were amazing"}
{"text":"Saturday happy hour with deals on their barrel-aged cocktails? Sign me up! The bar team is super friendly, answering questions about unfamiliar ingredients in their drinks, and even letting us taste a few samples before deciding on what to order.   We tried three from the barrels- all were good, but the Bonded Boulevardier was my fave. The barrel aging really mellows out the Campari. B went with the Instant Gratification (cognac/scotch/amaro/grand marnier), also very good.   Grab a seat at the bar and watch the talented crew do what they do best- if you're lucky you'll even see them light something on fire. :-) Great place to start the evening."}
{"text":"All I can say this time is eh, we are here 6 months ago and was great, this time the food was just off. Sirloin tacos were over cooked and bland also really small for $17.00 also they were paired with frozen french fries which seemed off for this restaurant. Cocktails were good, staff was ok they didn't know what some of the sides were. Prices were premium as you would expect. I don't mind paying but I feel that I did not get my monies worth."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant!  Our meal was wonderful!  Great atmosphere and service!!!  We had a really terrific time here and would highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"You'll come to CPH for the cocktails.....you'll stay for the food!  Citizen's Public House is my go-to destination for craft cocktails in the Valley. These guys mix all the standards exceedingly well, but take it to a new level with their barrel-aged concoctions. I often order a Sazerac (being a home-sick New Orleanian) and these guys make the best one you can find outside of New Orleans. The Happy Hour is a scorching hot deal, half price beer, wines and bar snacks (and they always have a great selection of all 3!).   The food is pretty amazing too....the pork belly pastrami is phenomenal. The chopped salad is iconic (has it's own facebook page?!) My favorite entrees are the scallops, Amaro meatloaf and Lamb Burger, but I've never had a bad dish here. Ever (and I work 2 blocks away and come here at least 1-2 times a month)."}
{"text":"Great cocktails, service & food. The chopped salad & scallops were both amazing and the atmosphere was fun & upbeat. A must if in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Legit the best chopped salad and maybe one of the best salads I've ever had all-time. The ingredients all compliment each other so well. The salad tasted so light and refreshing.  You get smokiness from the salmon, leafiness from the arugula, chewiness from the couscous, and crunch from the dried corn and currants. The dressing did not dominate the salad and allowed you to taste every flavor. It was simply a perfect salad."}
{"text":"Really love the decor and outdoor porch here. We walked there without a reservation and got lucky a table outside was available. It was also pretty late in the night. So my coworker and I sat under the stars warmed by the heat lamp and started ordering some wine and cocktails and started with their popular salad. Oh man.. it totally reminds me of a tea salad when the waitress explains all the parts and mix them together. The salad was just absolutely delicious and was a great starter. I then got the short ribs (rubbed with coffee), so I definitely couldn't resist that. The short ribs was so tender, I didn't need to use the knife they gave me. I wasn't a huge fan of the parsnip puree, but it was very smooth. My coworker's pork osso buco was also super tender and juicy. This place has a great vibe and great for hanging out with friends."}
{"text":"Very nice restaurant, our server Matt was friendly, genuine and knowledgeable.  The food was great, the mac and cheese was amazing (we try it at every restaurant we go to), cant wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Great cocktail list. Great menu.  I had the smoked tequila cocktail - Mezcal.  The bar is nice and the ambience for dinner is beautiful.  They have an outside section that leads into the dining area thru an open air feel which makes it a great touch.   The service was outstanding and the restaurant is very well run with attention to detail.  We had the lamb and the scallops.  Both cooked perfect and beautifully plated.   It was a really nice date night and also perfect for a group"}
{"text":"Really unimpressed with the service with the new manager. Was rude and refused to serve us. Brought our brother in law from the Czech Republic and he was jet lagged and tired but instead of a celebratory evening, we were refused service as they thought he had too much to drink. When we asked to speak with management, the manager told me to \"do something\" meaning to fight him. Really unprofessional and grossly overzealous. We have spent well over $2500 at this restaurant over the last year and a half and are heartbroken over the lack of professionalism after recommending CPH many times. Could not be more disappointed and will never return."}
{"text":"Very surprised and pleased with the food, service and ambiance. Our server, Gary, was very personable and attentive to our needs.  The chopped salad is as good as it gets. No need to say more except to make sure you ordered it. Excellent size for sharing with another.  The grilled ono was very good. Good piece of grilled ono on a bed of pecorino romano risotto cake, spicy arrabbiata, sauteed spinach, balsamic glaze. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"For just the food, I'd probably give citizen 4 stars. The food is great but very heavy. What bumps it up to five are the cocktails. I've tried several of the cocktails on the menu and all of them are amazing. The waitstaff and bar staff are also phenomenal. Great experience for dinner or to stop by the bar for drinks."}
{"text":"The chopped salad was delicious and really enjoyed the steak as well.  Different take on a steakhouse and lots of interesting dishes."}
{"text":"Fantastic dinner spot in the heart of Scottsdale!  The service was impeccable and the choices were very interesting.  The \"famous\" chopped salad was a must get.  It was prepared completely differently than I anticipated.  The smoked salmon (lox) in the salad was a tremendously tasty ingredient!  I loved the salad and would order it again in a heartbeat.  For dinner my wife and I got the Smart Chicken and the Wagyu Burger.  the Smart Chicken was rich and tasty.  Definitely a good call.  The burger had some very interesting flavor combinations that were all a good call.  The sliced carrots and pickled onions made a nice crunchy taste to the burger.  The Challah bun was a nice touch, but ended up being a little more dry that I would have desired.  To provide some honest feedback, I told our server that the food was great, but that the bun was a little dry.  She went and talked with the Chef and came back to tell us that they were really sorry that the bun was dry and that they wanted to comp our burger.  Wow, that was completely not necessary, but incredibly nice!  They said that they wanted to be sure we were completely satisfied with our experience and were sorry that it was not as perfect as they had planned.  This place was top notch on their presentation, service and quality!  I would go back in a heartbeat!  Many Thanks Citizen Public House!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is a little unique and I think either you love it or hate it.   The food and drinks however are creative and delicious! They have the original chopped salad which is a must order and I've never tried anything food or beverage I haven't enjoyed!   They also have a pretty cool restaurant week special when that rolls around too! Cheers!"}
{"text":"I thought this place was unimpressive. I don't know if everyone else here just came on a better night with a different staff or what, but this was not the dining experience you all described.  But the worst was the service and attitude of the staff; we were ignored all night.   It took us a very long time to get seated despite it NOT being full and having a reservation. Not a big deal, but a party of 8 walked in ahead of me and was immediately seated. I guess CPH would make more money off of a larger party, so they were made a priority over someone who had the common sense to make a reservation.  The server was affable and friendly but would disappear for long stretches of time.  It seemed like everyone working there was more concerned with enforcing the cool hipster vibe than actually doing any work.  I was pretty excited to eat here because they had a great rating. However, my entree was a major disappointed and it took a major dent on my wallet. I will pay anything for good food. However, nothing makes me more angry than overpaying for a crappy entree. I ordered the short ribs based on a recommendation. They were extremely fatty, tough, and nearly burnt. Furthermore, the sides were also a disappointment. I don't think pureed parsnips are particularly expensive, but the portion I received was a joke. I was done with them within 2 bites. What a way to waste my time and money."}
{"text":"Busy, always busy. Great food, great cocktails, great service, always great in these regards. Perfect date place with a reservation. Bar seating is first come first serve, so try for that if you go on a whim. Ask about the specials too, always something cooking in the back there."}
{"text":"This place was phenomenal! I had the scallops and my boyfriend had the chicken- both were downright amazing. We also had cocktails that were unique and tasty. Our server, Nick, was attentive and made sure we were well taken care of. Overall, this was an amazing experience and I would highly recommend it for any date night, celebration, or anyone who is looking for an amazing meal."}
{"text":"For two people we ordered a lot of food (4 stars):   Chopped Salad is by far the most amazing and distinguished salad I have ever had. It comes with dried corn that acts like croutons of a typical salad, crunchiness, but unlike croutons, it adds a sweet flavor to the salad. Smoked salmon for the protein of the salad. There were also fresh chopped tomatoes, sun flower seeds, couscous, asiago, currants, and finally arugula as the main greens of the salad. Then it comes with an amazing sauce in which you have to mix into the salad.  Chicken and Waffles is a definite must try. The chicken is coated with a unique batter and topples over 2 pieces of waffle. There was too much butter on the waffles. This is kinda pricey for chicken and waffles, since in Los Angeles, there are places that service chicken and waffles at a cheaper rate but the flavors are unique enough for me to tell you to try it at least once from this restaurant.   Pork belly pastrami is overrated. I did not taste any unique flavors in this appetizer.   Lamb burger was too game for me. I usually eat lamb, but the lamb burger was too much for me. It was a decent burger but I would not get this entree again since it lacked flavoring.   Service (3 stars):   The waiter was very nice and we stroke up a couple of conversations with him. However, we noticed that other tables got bread and olive oil and we did not. In addition, we noticed that others that ordered the chopped salad, the waiter would help them mix the salad, we were not offer such service.   Ambiance (4 stars):   This restaurant is dimly lit, which sets a romantic atmosphere for those of love birds that want to only concentrate on each other. There is also a bar area that seems to be perfect for those are just got off work and want to have a good time with some co-workers.   Tips: Free parking is located in a lot around the corner of the restaurant. I would recommend making reservations since it can get packed during certain times i.e. dinner. We came around 630pm on a Thursday night and the restaurant was not full."}
{"text":"Won't go back.  Building was nice, clean. Wait was short. Waiter pushed his suggestions instead of listening to what we wanted.  Food seemed to be designed more on how exotic the ingredients sounded instead of how they might actually taste together. \"shredded arugula with capers and a mango habenero mojo\".   Stuff like that."}
{"text":"I tried to setup a 15 person dinner after dining at CPH several times. The customer service for group reservations is AWFUL. They could care about accomodating and do not get back to you right away. Decided to take my business elsewhere and wont be back soon."}
{"text":"Great decor. Great food and very good service. You have to try the pork belly pastrami. To die for! Their version of the Manhattan was very good. As for the main courses you can't go wrong with the scallops or the smoked duck. For dessert go with the black & tan pudding. Oh soooo good. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"This place is a legit 5 star place.  Lots of beautiful people.  I never realized the beautiful people of Arizona hang out in Scottsdale.  Chopped salad, pork belly pastrami, short ribs, scallops, dream jar, coffee, and the wife's sangria.  All well prepared, with quality ingredients, presented artfully and timely.  Frickn Scottsdale, had no idea, my boy TR3 would love this town, lotsa tall white people."}
{"text":"Another solid experience at Citizen Public House. How has it been four years since my last visit?  Of course, the signature Original Chopped Salad was a must and did not disappoint. It was even better than I remembered.  We then moved on to the fondue, which was also great. Who doesn't love cheese and bread?!?! And this was great cheese and great bread!  We had the scallops next, which, while small, were perfectly prepared and delicious.   The only disappointment was the deconstructed chicken pot pie. The chicken was amazing, but the rest of the dish was just OK. It wasn't bad, but I'd likely try something else next time.  We finished with the Heart of Caramel, which was a chocolate mousse cake, bourbon vanilla ice cream, a chocolate cookie and bourbon caramel sauce. Heaven.  Our server was great and helped us navigate the menu as we were putting together what we wanted to share. I had originally picked a cocktail, but expressed an interest in one of their barrel aged cocktails and he gave me a sip to try. Fantastic service all around and I was happy to come back and visit again!"}
{"text":"Conn creek is an Amazing Cab to start off with. The pork belly appetizer is also phenomenal in taste and presentation. It definitely tided us over for our entrees."}
{"text":"It was Restaurant Week, so we save a few bucks.  The meatloaf was great, my wife had the scallops, and seemed to love them.  Drinks a bit pricey, but when your meal is about half what it should have been.....  Chopped Salad..yeah, its as good as everyone says...but get this, you can remove the salmon, and add a different meat.  If you ask.  Ask your server about R&D."}
{"text":"Wonderful dinner experience!  We had gone to a community event and looked for some good food, but nothing too heavy.  This place was great, not too busy with a somewhat quiet ambiance and great wait staff.  The fondue appetizer was a very tasty treat which we followed with the filet tacos and pork belly pastrami which we happily devoured.   Our only complaint was our food was not exactly hot, so left us wondering if we were the after thought for the night.  But still it tasted great and our service was awesome."}
{"text":"The service that we had here was one of the best dining experiences I've had in a long time. Our server was so attentive and the food was phenomenal. The Original Chopped Salad was truly insane, bringing so many textures and flavors to the bowl. It was debatably the best salad I've ever had. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Everything's sexier with pork belly.  Expecially my belly when it's full of it.  Went here for a happy hour and was cursing myself for taking so damn long to visit the place.  The vibe is perfectly sexy and dimly lit - the kind of place where you can sip lethally addictive cocktails and order dishes that make you feel dirty for eating them, they're so good.  And then you order seconds and then dessert because you've been so bad already, you might as well go for broke.  The pork belly pastrami with brussel sprouts in whole grain mustard made me curse my ill fortune for not being able to eat it at every waking moment.  Unctuous, tender belly - get in my belly.   The heirloom tomato with burrata special was clean in presentation and a celebration of all that is glorious in the summertime, and the sausage and cheese plate was gobbled up so quickly I had to do a doubletake.  Dessert was heaven in an itty-bitty crock with the Black and Tan Pudding - a dark chocolate pot de creme with salted caramel pudding?  So I'm naming my firstborn Citizen Public House now?  Adore."}
{"text":"Liked it but meh is my overall response.  A bit loud and typical.  Food was fine...bill was, well, you knw the answer!"}
{"text":"One word: amazing.  Was here for restaurant week, started with the Gazpacho, then had the Scallops, and finished it off with the bread pudding.   Great cocktails, amazing service, and outstanding food. They are awesome."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, great vibe. Amongst our group we had the rockfish, the buttermilk chicken, and the truffle grilled cheese - all were excellent. My chicken came with some perfectly prepared Brussel sprouts. Of particular note, however, is the chopped salad. This is unlike other chopped salads that you have ever had. It apparently has its own Facebook page. All that I know is that it is really, really good  CPH is in a great location. Our server was very knowledgable and engaging. The atmosphere is an attractive mix of hip and old school. I would definitely recommend Citizen Public House to anyone who finds themselves in Scottsdale"}
{"text":"I used to go to Citizen Public House's bar and order the Sangria and go there just for the Sangria. I bet I funded the Sangria bank all on my own. When my husband and I went out last night,I was super disappointed to see they got rid of it so I ordered the Highlands Drifter and I was not disappointed. Not as awesome as the Sangria but it was tasty.  Our dinner and service was fantastic. I ordered the Chop Salad with smoked salmon which is consistently good and the Cauliflower Salad, as an appetizer. The Cauliflower Salad was a little bland in some (few) parts but overall very good. My husband said his \"meat was perfect\". One knock is their menu is a bit small, but man, they do NOT disappoint in their meat and veggies! So vegetarians and carnivores and pescatorians can all love each other and get along at Citizen! I love to end on a sweet note, you cannot go wrong with their Heart of Caramel dessert. If you're looking to trash your New Year's resolution to eat fewer sweets, do it. New Year's resolutions are an exercise in futility anyway.Wowza! My mouth is watering just yelping! One final point, our service has consistently been awesome. Our waiter was quick and when the kitchen was backed up due to a party of 30, he let us know they were running a little behind.  Four stars because they ditched my favorite drink but I will be back!"}
{"text":"Fun place, great vibe. Service was close to impeccable. So why 3 stars? Our dinners were merely good, nothing to write home about, and you can do better for the same price or less at the Gladly (run by the same group) or Beckett's Table. I had the pork loin special, and it was pretty good. But for $28, it ought to be a lot better."}
{"text":"First time in PHX.  Friend recommended.  Friendly waitstaff.  They were understaffed and extremely busy, but we never knew.  The short ribs were tender, the duck breast was epic.  Waiter recommended splitting the Peanut Butter and Chocolate Cake among the party of 3- Bite of Cake with the PB dessert was insane."}
{"text":"We had just flown in from Dallas for the weekend and decided to give this place a try after seeing all of the great reviews on yelp. We were very excited and loved the ambiance from the moment we walked in -- unfortunately that was the only thing we loved, and their seasoned fries. We were a table of 5 and seated right away, which was nice. But from the moment we got to our table we did not get a great vibe from our waitress. She wasn't very eager to answer questions or even serve us at all. I always had an empty glass of water, even though our whole table was ordering cocktails. Food: Extremely subpar from what we were expecting. We had the \"legendary chopped salad\" -- and no one ate it. It just sat on the table, untouched, and our waitress didn't even take a moment to ask if our food was okay. I mean, she just took it off the table completely uneaten. Then we ordered the burger, which was only eaten because we were starving. There was another salad ordered that was pretty bland, and the filet mignon tacos were cold and a let down.  Giving this place 2 stars only because of the decor. I'm sure this place is great to grab a few drinks, but would not recommend it for a dinner out with family -- there are so many other great places to eat in this area instead."}
{"text":"We sat at the bar for happy hour food was amazing .... Service exceptional . A must try for your taste buds."}
{"text":"Love this place! They have amazing food and cocktails. It was my birthday dinner last night and it was great! The staff is always friendly and the food is perfection."}
{"text":"Only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because the cocktails are mediocre. They look great, but they aren't that delicious- but hey, if you're into that go for it.  Food was pretty good, albeit small portions. We had room for dessert and we were not disappointed.  Service was friendly."}
{"text":"I've had the pleasure of having drinks multiple times at Citizen Public House and each time it gets better and better.  The mixologist, Brandon, is one of the best up and coming cocktail makers around.    This past Saturday we finally indulged and enjoyed a meal at CPH and it was amazing.  The chopped salad really is the best in Arizona and the service and food was exceptional.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I went to this place for our anniversary dinner. Our server looks no joke like Stanley Tucci, and he was fantastic. His service truly elevated the whole experience to another level even though the food here speaks for itself. Price range is about average of what you see in the area and they have no problem splitting the meal if you want to. Try their salmon cobb salad it is delicious."}
{"text":"The ambiance is stylish and relaxed and the menu offers a manageable selection of American fare with a nice twist making them each inventive and unique. I figured we should try their prix fixe menu due to the special event week, but decided to delve into the regular menu for an additional starter. Their Grilled Octopus caught my eye, served with spicy watermelon gazpacho, chorico, fennel, fried capers and bacon fat brushed Noble bread. It was a stellar choice - stunning and delicious!  For their Restaurant Week selections our table opted to begin with their famous \"Original Chopped Salad.\" This amazing salad even has it's own Facebook page! Trust me, I know..I looked it up! And they even give out the recipe on it. Well, it was absolutely scrumptious and you can bet, I'll be trying it out for myself. We also tried their Clam Chowder, done exceptionally well, creamy yet light, topped with herbed croutons and a drizzle of finishing oil.  For mains we selected:  Pan Seared Scallops with tender belly Hampshire bacon, roasted corn grits, wilted snow pea greens and cola gastrique. Seared Ling Cod with bok choy, red miso beurre blanc, pickled papaya and hazelnuts. Grilled Pork Loin with fava beans, baby shitake mushrooms, fennel puree, pickled mustard seeds and pork demi.  I did say inventive and unique! They were all super yummy and nicely adorned.  Dessert was included, although unnecessary as we were quite satiated with our meals. However, knowing that Tracy Dempsey was at the wheel creating their luscious sweets, we had to try one of each. The Black & Tan, a chocolate pot de créme with salted caramel pudding, whipped cream, roasted white chocolate streusel and browned butter shortbread. And the Bourbon Peach Bread Pudding served with vanilla ice cream. Are you salivating yet? They were seriously decadent, but kindly served in small portions with just enough to satisfy the four of us.  Our server, Greg was personable and friendly, knowledgeable and attentive ensuring we were well taken care of. Yes, this is going on my repeat list...I'm definitely going back for another taste. And since I was duly impressed, I plan to try Bernie Kantak's other restaurant in Phoenix, called The Gladly!"}
{"text":"The coffee rubbed short rib here KICKS ASS. Great food, great little find in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I was excited to finally try this place they have a lot of good reviews but honestly it wasn't that special. I see a lot of ppl rave about the scallops but i gotta say, not that impressed. mine were small did not have a great sear and were almost grayish in color...and 3 for $30?? the \"omfg chopped salad\" was tasty, but not exactly omfg level of tasty. I gave 2 stars for the good service and the beets starter was delicious, should have had 2 of those lol most likely would not eat here again :("}
{"text":"The tomfoolery has to stop.     Citizen Public House is just a bar in the guise of a restaurant.. And because it's Scottsdale, everything has a price tag  that hovers 30% above where it should be. Does anyone but me notice this problem?  If nothing else, the noise level at CPH is unacceptable. The reverberation of the diner's voices in the space is deafening. I was there on a Saturday night and I had to raise my voice just to have a conversation with one of my dining companions sitting right next to me.  The acoustics of the building are particularly bad and no one, especially the owner has done a thing to absorb the sounds by softening the surfaces. Does he even notice? My drink was tasty (The end of the world)  but not really worth $12 for five tablespoons of liquid. I get it though. Mixed drinks = high profit margin.  Our chopped salad was a tasty combo of ingredients. I did enjoy this salad.  I wasn't super hungry so instead of ordering another starter (our waiter said the tuna crudo was very small) I got the hippie dippie sandwich. What a disaster. The greasiest fries ever. The chunks of eggplant were only partially cooked. Too much mayonnaise - and why mayonnaise? In 'n out burger does better grilled onions and fries than CPH.  Such an unpleasant sandwich. Had it not been so busy, I might  have marched into the kitchen and demanded that the chef explain how this is acceptable, quality food in an expensive restaurant.    The young waiter was obviously overwhelmed and far too obsequious. The other diners had scallops which looked tasty but I couldn't hear their opinions due to the din in the dining space. $30 for three scallops? Some bars parading as restaurants will hopefully have enough reviews like this for them to sit up and take notice. A bigger menu is not better. I won't ever eat here again. But honestly the responsibility was mine to send back food that is poorly made. We as diners must demand more from restaurants."}
{"text":"The Dream Jar for dessert! Amazing. Rich. Not too much so I left feeling full, not sick-full.  All the food was great but we only got to sample the starters: Chopped Salad was my favorite, Chicken and Waffles a close second.  Service was ideal: friendly, attentive (and \"invisible\" for the most part).  My husband and I look forward to another Date Night here. Next time, we'll just order Entrees."}
{"text":"Omg! My daughter heard about this place and we decided to check it out on one of my trips to Phoenix. We shared the piggy and waffle, and the Cobb salad. It was enough food for the two of us would even know my stomach was portruding, I could have kept eating another round of both! Since then I've been trying to make chicken and pancakes so I could get that combination of syrup and meats! Can't wait to go back and see what they have on the menu next. And by the way, the Cobb salad was really unusual it had chopped smoked salmon pieces. It was fabulous!!"}
{"text":"Food was good, not great. The chopped salad was the only thing I thought was great. The restaurant was extremely loud. The host/hostess didn't want to seat us at the table we wanted. The cocktails were tiny & mostly ICE for $12+. Hate restaurants that do that. Not very impressed."}
{"text":"Came in about 5pm, sat down right away. Brad, my waiter came over and introduced himself and asked me my name. I'd seen yelp reviews so told him they sounded good. Brad and the staff checked on me several times to make sure I was good even though the place was busy. AMAZING food and atmosphere. Highly recommended.  I'll be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"Let's talk about a really good dining experience that was brought down by a HORRIBLE HOSTESS. We were in the area after some shopping at the mall close by and decided to check out this restaurant after doing some research on Yelp. We arrived around 8:15pm and requested a table for 3. The asian hostess, Stacey, snubbed us and told us that there was a 2 hour wait. We did not really have a problem with that since it was a Saturday night and the restaurant appeared busy. However, I decided to hop on Open Table to see if there were any reservations available. Low and behold, there was an 8:45, 9:00, 9:15... reservation for 3 available. We decided to reserve the 8:45pm reservation and hang out til our time was up....  We returned to the restaurant at 8:45pm and let the hostess know that we had a reservation. Again, SNUBBED BY STACEY and surprise, there was a table available for us! We were shocked at how she did not seem to care that she told us that there was a 2 hour wait when we were able to reserve a table for 30 minutes later...  Beyond the horrible waitress, I would rate this restaurant 4 stars.  Our waiter AJ was amazing. He should get 5+ stars He was friendly, had great recommendations and was very attentive to our needs. Everyone that served us was friendly and super attentive!  The food was 4 stars. We enjoyed the following items: - The Bacon Fat Heirloom Popcorn -- This was probably the most disappointing dish we had. There were hints of bacon fat but it needed some kind of kick like an herb to make it pop? - The Original Chopped Salad -- Apparently it has it's own Facebook page. It's definitely worth the hype! It's similar to a tea salad at a burmese restaurant in the way it is presented. - Buttermilk Chicken -- The chicken was juicy throughout. - Pork Osso Buco -- Fall off the bone good. - Pan Seared Scallops -- Recommended by our waiter and was delicious!   Overall, I would've rated this place 4 stars had it not been for our horrible hostess situation... so it's gets bumped down to 3 stars. To add insult to injury, I also want to add that I just received an email from Open Table stating that I \"No Showed\" for our reservation. I guess Stacey once again reiterated how much she didn't want us there..."}
{"text":"The chopped salad was excellent. Well decorated but the noise was overwhelming.  We had to yell at each other to be heard and even that did not always Work."}
{"text":"After all the great reviews I thought this would be a fun place to take some friends for a night out. Over priced, not even average food. pretentious atmosphere and pretty cruddy service. HUGE disappointment which just leaves me wondering if people think just because a place is in Scottsdale it's good.   I honestly wanted to love it since I built the place up and was excited to try it out with my friends.    Good points.... the area, they have great location."}
{"text":"I would have to say this meal was a little above mediocre.  My hopes were high for this place and I do feel a bit let down.  I did like everything they served me, with the exception of the mashed parsnips.  It was very nice on the inside and a relaxing classy atmosphere.  When we arrived there were only 2 other tables of people seated in this large place.  They seated us all in a row, right on top of each other and we did not understand why they wouldn't seat us all in more of a private setting.  This really took away from the experience since we're were packed on top of each other when we all could have been seated in different areas.   We started off with the melted cheese dip, which was good. We dipped bread, pear and sausage into the dip. We also ordered the side of olives which was yummy, Just fresh green olives to share.  For the entrees we split the chopped salad, meatloaf and the short ribs. All were good and we enjoyed them.  So why the lower review? Compared to other meals at this cost, we weren't blown away.  I do take this into consideration when I rate places.  I do have to say that the chopped salad was bomb!  If I ever go back it will be for some happy hour appetizers and for that delicious chopped salad!   Lastly we ordered the push pop dessert. I did not care for the brownie nor do I like frozen bananas.  We did have great service though and I loved my mixed drink of the day.    It was a toss up for me on what to rate.. but after all this was a pretty pricey meal that just wasn't very memorable."}
{"text":"Hubby and I stopped in while visiting the area for Spring Training.  The beer selection wasn't as extensive as I had hoped a public house would be, but we found something we each enjoyed.  Our server was very helpful and gave us great suggestions...grilled cheese and short ribs...yum!  I so wanted to have dessert but we were stuffed and just couldn't do it.  We will definitely go back as there are other things on the menu that sound enticing and we really enjoyed what we ordered."}
{"text":"Probably the worst service I have ever had.  The bacon popcorn was good, but that was about it.  Took forever to get drinks, the orders were screwed up and the staff just came up with excuses why they could not bring out drinks within 20 minutes of ordering.  There are lots of choices in Old Town, don't go here."}
{"text":"So we ordered the pastrami pork belly. I love. Pastrami and i love pork belly- together at least for my pallet not so sure. The duck leg pure heaven with the burnt maple sauce. The dumplings rubbery and not sure why it was on the plate. I had the taco from the sandwich menu. Corn was just awesome perfectly seasoned. Tacos I expected the meat to be a little more moist a nice salsa would have worked better than the onion thing that came with it. All in all food was ok with some real standouts but the price... Not a great value."}
{"text":"Came here while visiting family in Scottsdale and our experience was superb. Everything we ordered was fantastic and the service was outstanding (I think our server's name was Clark, he was so dedicated and enthusiastic.) Clark even brought us a salad for us to try on the house which was also delightful. All six of us ordered different entrees and not one was displeased with their choice. I ordered the scallops, which were delicious, and went perfectly with the bottles of white wine. We all felt very welcome here and I certainly wouldn't mind stopping in on my next trip to Scottsdale."}
{"text":"After a long week in town for a business meeting we had decided to go out and have a nice sit down dinner at the end of the week (Friday night). After helping I found this place and I'm glad that I did. At the time we were there the crowd did seem to be mid aged but it was a very fancy yet laid back environment. The hostesses were kind and our waiter was very attentive and was always on top of things. I had the chicken meal and it was perfect!  The taste was great and the size portions wasnt small, as I would expect from a fancier sit Down! The drinks were also perfect!"}
{"text":"This place is so lively with a large menu and delicious cocktails. The chopped salad is something that cannot be missed. Don't forget to take home so bacon peanut brittle to go.  I had the scallops my most recent trip there and they were cooked perfectly and had the best flavor.  I also had the pleasure of trying the meatloaf. I love meatloaf and have very high standards for it. They got it right!"}
{"text":"Pork belly pastrami. Need I say more?  It is one of the best meats I've ever tasted. Then served as a deconstructed rueben. The cocktails are well thought out and served with a flourish. My  Manhatten with a flamed orange peel. We had several starters. All well executed and served either hot or cold. Just as intended. The desserts are the final touch. Pudding in a jar and chocolate chocolate brownie. The perfect anniversary dinner."}
{"text":"Service, cuisine, drinks and desert... 5 stars across the board. Chef, you've created a phenomenal menu and Gary, you made that first trip worthy of so many more. Thanks for taking the time to go through the entire menu making dinner and date night perfect!"}
{"text":"Good food, but it can be a bit too pricey for the quantity of food, depending on what you order.  Waiter was too pushy on his wine recommendation.  Could be a bit less loud.  THE RABBIT NEEDS TO BE REDEVELOPED INTO A LARGER MAIN COURSE !  Over-all, a nice place, though!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, and I really do mean excellent.  The service was fantastic, and when the waiter described the meatloaf as \"not your mother's meatloaf\" I had to try it.  He also had stories and recommendations that would have made me order a plate of dirt, he was very convincing and passionate about the menu.  I also sampled the dishes that my other friends ordered (scallops, chicken) and those were excellent as well.  OK, so now that I got that out of the way, WHAT THE HELL IS WITH THE CORKAGE (OR LACK THEREOF) IN ARIZONA?!??!  We brought a bottle of wine, an expensive bottle, and as soon as we walked in they informed us that Arizona has only one or two restaurants that allow you to pay corkage and drink your own wine!  I thought Arizona was full of conservatives, and we all know conservatives love to drink so what's the deal?    We were disappointed, we wanted to drink our delicious wine, and since we were there for spring training and the night was young, we carried around an unopened bottle of wine all night and had to explain at every single bar we entered what it was all about and had to also promise not to open the bottle in the bar, as if we would waste such a great wine on just getting drunk!  Annoying. I will not deduct a star from this wonderful restaurant because of the wine situation, but I will tell you that I am giving the WHOLE STATE OF ARIZONA only one star for their stupid corkage regulations."}
{"text":"Oh man, I am SO glad I came here. I was have a rather shotty day (flew in from CA) and my friend told me I HAD to come here and get the OMFG salad. I sat alone at the bar and the bartender (guy with ponytail) was just great. I mean, great. He made a delicious drink - the margarita with infused popcorn or something and it was perfect. The salad - tossed in front of me was literally the best salad I've ever had, and the burrata cheese was heavenly. I had leftovers and the bartender sent me home with extra bread. Nailed the food. Nailed the drink. Nailed the service. Really awesome folks."}
{"text":"Most amazing restaurant in Scottsdale! Love the friendly and exceptional service, especially Gary!  Food is consistently fantastic and always on-point. Recommend to everyone. :)"}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this place when looking for a restaurant for our anniversary dinner and I'm so glad we did. We were treated extra special by the wait staff- given complimentary champagne and bacon-pecan peanut brittle as a gift. The food was great- especially the OMFG salad. We got the filet and the meatloaf. We were especially impressed by our waiter's knowledge of the various cocktails and the fact that the bartender was able to make me a 'penicillin' which most places don't know how to make. Overall a great night! We would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"CHOPPED SALAD. that is all you need to know. It is amazing, delicious, full of texture...beyond words. Service is almost always on point, and if they f*!$ up, they will apologize profusely. I've had the chopped salad, beet salad, pork belly, scallops/grits and they all tasted great! I've been here a few times, and I've never left disappointed. It's a perfect spot for a dinner date."}
{"text":"Dining here with a large group was a trip. Eating in groups larger than 8 can get interesting, but the peeps at CPH were on their \"A\" game from start to finish. Service was seamless and so was the food.  The Chopped Salad alone was a 5-star experience. WOW! It's been a long time since a salad has left me in a state of \"awe.\" This is no exaggeration my friends. Israeli Cous Cous, roasted corn, tomato, pepitas, smoked salmon, arugula and currants with a wildly delicious buttermilk pesto dressing. This salad certainly does have it's own Facebook page, and I LIKED it! The salad is dressed and tossed table-side. It was love at first bite and I can't wait for my next visit to PHX to fall in love all over again.  Next, that bacon popcorn was delectable. Not really sure what makes popcorn \"heirloom\" popcorn, but that bacon fat and bacon lardons mixed in were perfection. This wasn't the first time I've eaten bacon popcorn, but it was the first time I didn't find it overly greasy.   U-10 scallops were my choice for dinner and they were seared to perfection. I'm not a fan of lot's of sauce and reductions on my seafood, so the dish was little on the rich side for my taste, but I think this would be winner in most people's books.   By the time dessert came around I wasn't quite sure I could take another bite of food I was so full! By this point I was entering my food coma and this part of the evening is pretty much a fuzzy.   I'll definitely be back to CPH. Food and service were excellent and they really made sure our group had a wonderful time."}
{"text":"I would rank the Original Chopped Salad as one of the best salads I've had. Although I don't like ordering salad at restaurants (meat for me!), I would order this in a heart beat. I don't even like salmon, and I loved this! I also got the Pork Belly Pastrami and also enjoyed this as well. I loved the brussel sprout sauerkrout on top, and the pork belly just melted in your mouth. Pork belly can come across as overly fatty, but this was so tender, and the flavor was incredible.  Both of these dishes amazed me- so I ordered another: the Ramen with pork belly in Chinese 5-spice, shiso leaves, bean sprouts, and soft marinated egg in a pork-based stock. I didn't think the ramen was on par as the chopped salad and the pastrami, but clearly, I'm Asian. I thought the ramen more had Chinese flavor than the traditional flavor, and it felt more like a bowl of Chinese noodle soup. However, the broth was pretty tasty, and the pork belly and egg were done well. Noodles were fresh.  ...I am so sad that I live so far from here..."}
{"text":"If you haven't tried the signature salad you are missing out! It's the show of table side guacamole with lettuce.   The menu selections can come of as gamy; but they are so delicious.   Service was a little slow but worth it."}
{"text":"Not as easy to find as you might hope ... the front door is actually around the corner south of 5th Ave ... but well worth the confusion. Watermelon and cucumber salad was cool, refreshing, and an interesting presentation. Their barrel-aged cocktails will knock your socks off - almost literally - heavy on the alcohol, which I consider a plus in my drinks. Loved the coffee-rubbed short ribs. The accompanying cherry BBQ sauce was the perfect blend of sweet/tart, and wasn't thick or gummy as so many BBQ sauces can be. My only complaint about the short ribs was a personal preference issue on the side ... I HATED the pureed parsnips. Think of nasty mashed turnips, and then make them sweet .... BLECH!!! Thank heavens they didn't contaminate the ribs (lol). The waitress kindly brought me some mashed potatoes instead. Friends had the Cuban sandwich (pronounced both \"tasty\" and \"huge\"), and the chicken (\"spicy and delish\").  Friendly smiling staff, attentive but not hovering service, altogether a great experience. Word to the wise for anyone with hearing aids or other hearing issues - concrete floors mean the place is super loud."}
{"text":"The chopped salad is really as good as all the reviews say. It has a perfect balance of salty and sweet and has just enough crunch. I got the chicken with brussel sprouts as well, which was also delicious!"}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place for a bit now, and we were finally able to check it off the bookmark list.  We were greeted as soon as we walked in and sat (as requested) at a nice table outside. The decor and atmosphere was fun, eclectic, and welcoming.  Our server stopped over within a minute or two and took our drink orders. After a little deliberation and a few well answered questions from our server, I ordered the truffle grilled cheese and he has the lamb burger. The truffle grilled cheese was extremely tasty. The onions on it were cooked perfectly and the truffle flavor was distinguishable, but not overwhelming on the other flavors!  The side salad had some delicious berries and cheese topped with a light balsamic that made a winning combo.  Despite being relatively stuffed already, we just had to try the brownie dessert with caramel sauce.  The only things that could have made this delectable delight better - warm that baby up before topping it with the ice cream! It was however, devoured as it was, so obviously it wasn't a loss by any means.  Our server was friendly and wonderful from start to finish - he made (good) recommendations, checked in regularly, and made us laugh.  Overall: A When we are back in the area, this is definitely on our \"do again\" list!"}
{"text":"We came here for my birthday dinner on a Saturday and had reservations for 8:30pm. We were visiting Scottsdale for the weekend from California.  When we arrived we were told to wait another 15 minutes for our table, but it wasn't a big deal. The restaurant is very loud, rowdy, crowded. It seemed like everybody was celebrating their birthday or bachelorette or something or another in here.   I opened up the menu and was surprised to see that it was actually Asian-fusion. When I had originally seen pictures on Yelp it looked like more of a gastropub/American restaurant. I had planned on getting the chopped salad because it looked so colorful and yummy in pictures, but couldn't resist the Duck Burger when the time came. My man ordered the Buttermilk Chicken. To share we ordered the Grilled Octopus as an appetizer.  The octopus was great but was soaked in a very strange spicy tomato sauce that was lukewarm. The whole thing kind of tasted like it was sitting on a bed of ketchup, honestly. I think mostly what threw me off was the temperature. In addition to small cuts of octopus, the dish came with hard cubes of grilled bread that were tough to chew.  My man's buttermilk chicken was delicious. It was very tender, moist, and flavorful.  My duck burger was just ok. The duck was honestly rubbery and not very flavorful.  Thumbs up for some risk-taking with the menu options, thumbs down for the quality and delivery."}
{"text":"I wasn't too excited to come here, since coming to Arizona I expected to be eating Mexican food. Now I'm sad this gastropub isn't on the East Coast. I forget the name of our waiter, but he was very friendly and extremely tall.   The food was delicious. Here's a rundown.  Appetizers: The Original Chopped Salad (corn, couscous, smoked salmon, asiago, pepitas, tomatoes, arugula, currants, buttermilk pesto dressing) - Despite all the raving reviews, I was really skeptical on how good a salad would be. Damn it was good. The textures were party-in-my mouth good. The buttermilk pesto dressing gave it a perfect tang. Do yourself a favor and order this above anything else. https://www.facebook.com/TheOriginalChoppedSalad/  Pork Belly Pastrami (rye spaetzle, Brussels sprout sauerkraut, mustard jus) - The pork belly was melt in your mouth, although some off-putting parts were all fat. The brussel sprouts were shaved leaves. I was confused by the rye spaetzle. Couldn't tell if it was meat or not, but overall the flavors of this dish are good.  Chia Seared Tuna (Thai purple sticky rice, asparagus puree, fried leek & micro green salad) - This dish was a bit bland overall. Both the puree and tuna had no flavor, but the purple rice provided a good contrast of texture. I love purple rice in general though.  Crispy Chicken Gizzards (pickled lemon, garlic yogurt, shiso)- The gizzards were dry, made a little bit better with the sauce. A little lackluster compared to the other appetizers.  Entrees: Tender Belly Pork Chop (dried apricot sorghum, shaved cantaloupe and asparagus salad with pink peppercorn vinaigrette) - This is on the pricey end, but definitely get this for entree. We ordered this medium and it turned out very juicy and well marinated. Good pork flavor. The quinoa provide nice contrast of texture and dried apricots provide extra sweetness.  Fair Trade Short Rib (coffee rub, dried cherry bbq sauce, roasted parsnip puree & seasonal veg) - I also recommend this for an entree, despite being pricey. So tender and the flavor was delicious. The bed of mashed turnips was a good combo. The tangy sauce is an explosion of flavor when it hits your tongue.  Yum Neau Wrap (grilled beef tenderloin, watercress, cucumber, mint, cilantro, yuzu vinaigrette, Thai eggplant & pickled cabbage slaw) - This was so overpoweringly salty. I could not taste anything it was wrapped with. The best part of this dish was the pickled vegetables, but overall I would not recommend ordering this.  Desserts: Pig in the Orchard (Apple bread pudding, bacon, brown butter ice cream) - This was recommended by our waiter as his favorite. Good recommendation by him, because this made dessert my favorite part of the night. The bread was so soft. Not sure I could taste the bacon This is a must get dessert  Cocoa Jar (chocolate coffee pudding, crispy rice crumble, whipped cream, cocoa cookies)- Not a big fan of cream, but everyone else in my family loved it. liked the cookie crumble on top and the cocoa cookies. There is a cookie/brownie at the bottom of the jar. Make sure you dig into the layers to get every layer in a bite to bring it all together.  Dim Lighting, fantastic food. Extremely popular so make a reservation if you can. I will definitely miss that Chopped Salad very much."}
{"text":"Just amazing! Visiting from out of town and went here for dinner with my husband during restaurant week.  We ordered from their special restaurant week menu and I had the most delicious scallops! Their barrel-aged cocktails are wonderful and the service is top-notch!"}
{"text":"Citizen Public House is Fantastic! Every time I have dinner here, or just something at the bar, it is always consistent with wonderful & friendly service, great wine list, fabulous entrées & dessert! I've been a Scottsdale & PV resident for 24 years and have been to a lot of restaurants here in town! This is at the top of my Favorites!"}
{"text":"SCOTTSDALE: Had the chance to stop in at the most popular restaurant in this sun-drenched millionaire metropolis and I was blown away.  Ambience and service (5 stars): The look is a little formal with white linens, candles and low lighting, but it is offset by very casual, approachable waitstaff and loud, jazzy, mid-century piano jam music.  FOOD:   Pork Belly Pastrami (5+ Stars/$13) Ahhhhmazing!  Order it: aromatic, flavorful in the extreme with a sweet pork/bacon taste  Scallops Atop Corn Gratin Purée (5 stars/$29): This was outstanding.  The smooth purée balanced the scallops wonderfully.  Lots of flavor, complexity and balance.  PB&B Pudding (4.5 stars/$10): This is delicious, smooth vanilla pudding, banana and caramel with peanut butter cookie spears.  I am already looking forward to being hungry again for my return!"}
{"text":"Love the location first of all! and the customer service is great. The staff is very friendly and welcoming. The server I had was very consistent with service so that's a plus.  Their menu wasn't that great. Not much of a variety to choose from. Not only that, buut I think for the food they do have on the menu, it is just very pricey.  On the bright side the drinks were great really enjoyed the Thai Margarita and their macaroni and flat bread with hummus is delicious!  I ordered the meatloaf dish, I'd recommend that."}
{"text":"Everything was very good, especially the chopped salad, get the chopped salad! I had it weeks ago and I still think about it...The restaurant was beautiful and the service was nice."}
{"text":"Happy Hour...so far so good!  Love the vibe!"}
{"text":"This is an awesome restaurant right in the heart of old town. I will start by saying the service was disappointing probably around 2 stars but the quality and creativity of the food and beverage is awesome and changed the experience. Server was rushing us through the meal, and my girlfriend had to push her for a description of the menu. She had a giggle that made us both a little uncomfortable. With all this said we heard other wait staff and they seemed awesome so I believe this is a one off. I had an amazing meat loaf dish and the chicken fried duck leg is amazing as well. Great spot to check out for date night"}
{"text":"This place never ceases to amaze me.  The staff, service and food was incredible.    Let me mention the service- it was a Sunday evening and not too crowded, our group of 6, I have to admit we were a pain in the ass.......we DID have reservations, 1/3 of our party were running late (OK, it was me).....CPH not a problem.    Then when we finally all get there drinks at the bar chit chatting away...our table is ready.  We don't want to sit there, we want outside....CPH not a problem.    Ok, so it was another 20 minute wait, now we are getting kind of hungry, so we sit at our original table and order appetizers, but wait 2/3 of the party still want outside sitting!!!   CPH not a problem.  An outside table for 6 is finally available so they move us (Ahhh....2 tables over), we get our appetizers and lucky for us we still get to keep our fabulous server and FINALLY the group is content.   The food was fabulous!  I love going out with foodie friends because we all ordered something different from the menu.  We started with the original chopped salad and pork bellies and they were delicious!  Dinner, we basically order everything from the pan seared scallops, buttermilk chicken, meatloaf the fish and short ribs were all excellent!  Everything was absolutely delicious.    Back to the staff & service, I have to say were all fabulous and so accommodating.  Bravo!  I can't wait to bring new friends to experience this place ......and I promise we won't be PITA's."}
{"text":"It was our first time eating here and it was a wonderful culinary experience! My husband and I were celebrating our first year wedding anniversary and instead of the usual steak house, I wanted something unique. We originally made a reservation elsewhere but last minute changed our mind.  First of all, let me tell you about Gary, our server! He was phenomenal! Very at-tentative and engaging. He knew the family sitting next to us by name and by their food order. We ordered the ramen, hush puppies and mussels from the happy hour menu. All were delicious! We also ordered a main course each; I ordered the scallops and my husband ordered the pork loin. Everything was cooked to perfection. We would definitely return and make sure to ask to be seated in Gary's section again!"}
{"text":"Great! Busy in a good way. A lot of pretty people, but the drinks and chow prove this place is legit. First, the barkeeps aren't hick town slingers. Enjoyed a Sazarac so smooth I should have bought it breakfast. Piggy & Waffle app made me wonder why the folks in the South stick with chicken... Damn! Roasted chicken and Brussels sprouts was not messing around, though the mantra \"never eat anyone's meatloaf but your mothers's\" was reinforced with a nice attempt, but not a home run. Dessert, drinks, wine, and service were all fantastic. Big recommend."}
{"text":"Superb in every way! Chopped salad is amazing and the grilled cheese is to die for. Service was great!"}
{"text":"The chop salad from a restaurant nearby is considered best, but we were then informed that chef had moved to Citizen House and produced and equally fabulous version!  Delicious and one of the best in town!"}
{"text":"The food was fantastic. The meatloaf is amazing. Interesting speciality cocktails and a great wine list. Prompt service. A great place for Happy hour!"}
{"text":"Citizen has one of the best atmospheres in Old Town.  The servers are always friendly and engaging.  The drinks are strong, and the food is excellent.  The only downside is that reservations are needed a few days in advance.  The restaurant and bar are always packed."}
{"text":"This place was incredible! As an out of towner in Scottsdale for work, I depend on Yelp reviews to decide where to try. I was beyond pleased with the atmosphere and delish drinks. The chopped salad really deserves 5 stars on its on. Wow!"}
{"text":"Can NOT say enough wonderful things about this place!! The staff, service, atmosphere & food!!! We had my daughters wedding dinner here (9/5/14)  and my son coordinated everything with Owen, the Manager & the Chefs Craig & Ben. Our party was an intimate 7 and from the moment we arrived we were treated with the highest of regard. Eric the Bartender started us off with the tastiest Sangrias, followed by several courses of appetizers (the chop salad was to die for!) and finished it off with their Porcini Filet Mignon - which was truly decadence!  We were full beyond measure and they packed us with to-go boxes for what we couldn't finish.  Absolutely every dish was beautifully presented and tantalizingly delicious!! I can not thank Owen, Craig, Ben, Eric and the staff of Citizen Public House enough for making such a monumental occasion so very special and personal."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place, but I just don't understand the hype. We were disappointed with our entrees (chicken and swordfish- both were blah and neither was hot), received inattentive service, and found conversation difficult because the dining room is LOUD. Like, really loud. The only reason I'm giving it two stars is because the OMFG salad was amazing. Nevertheless, I won't be back for it."}
{"text":"I think I'm in agreement with some of my fellow yelpers on this joint. I really like the ambiance of this place, but I was not too impressed with the food to be honest. We made reservations through Opentable which is a pretty cool and easy website where you can make reservations online and get confirmation. Anyhoo, we get there about 10 mins early and wait for our table, but things are running late. Luckily someone a table opened up fairly quick so it wasn't such a bad start afterall.   We ordered some drinks and I really am partial to the moscow mule. I like how they add cucumbers which gives it a refreshing taste. Also, they call it the Arizona mule here. (interesting). As for food, we got the pork belly pastrami (de-constructed sandwich without the bread), mozzarella (starts with V i forgot the name), scallops, and banana bread pudding. I think the best was the scallop dish which came with kale and was seasoned just right.   I would like to try other things to, so maybe it will change my mind about food."}
{"text":"AJ made my trip to Scottsdale worth it. Service and food come together to make a great dining experience here. We loved the attention to detail and flavor combinations. Best Braised Short Rib ever! Great craft cocktails too. We left happy. We'll be back."}
{"text":"I've visited Phoenix a few times on business and visited Citizen Public House the last two times (spaced a few months apart).  I had the same waiter both times ... and he remembered me the last time I went!  The chopped salad is indeed very amazing and I am tempted to order two of them the next time I go, in lieu of ordering an entree (I don't even remember what I ordered)."}
{"text":"Good spot for dinner (definitely better than other places we'd seen in the area).   Definitely order the chopped salad! It really reminded me of tea leaf salads in Burmese restaurants. A ton of flavor and different textures - probably my favorite thing we ordered. We also got the duck burger (you can skip this - was a little burnt and not that flavorful) and the pork belly pastrami (alright, not as good as Id hoped)  Fun atmosphere though and delicious cocktails. In comparison to other places around there, this place definitely seemed to be the best option."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I was in Scottsdale for a concert and we decided to come here because of the yelp hype and I couldn't believe how good the chopped salad was. I asked them to put the smoked salmon on the side and ate it as much as I wanted with the salad instead of having so much of it in the salad at once. It was the most amazing thing ever. We ordered a chopped salad to go when we left haha. I really liked the scallops I got, too. Can't wait to go back to Arizona just for this place."}
{"text":"Good food in a very hip atmosphere in Old Town Scottsdale area. Service was friendly and directed more towards the \"dining\" experience rather than quick service. In other words, we never felt rushed. The waitress as well as the several waiters whom helped us were all great. I had a \"Julep\" drink to start which was very strong, flavorful. We started with Burrata, which was quite tasty, just the right size for two to share, and the bread was excellent. My wife had the Pan Seared Scallops, which she enjoyed but could've used 1 or 2 more scallops (there were 3 total).  I had the Gypsy Pork Shank. It was tasty, smoky, but probably a little heavy and fatty for my taste. The desserts were excellent--wife had the Black & Tan and I had French Toast Bread Pudding, which to me was absolutely excellent. I docked one star just for the entrees--for the price paid, I felt there could've been a little better balance on food quantity, and I just wasn't 100% pleased with the shank. The environment was quite noisy--not really an intimate atmosphere, but I don't think that was the goal."}
{"text":"Came to cph on a friends recommendation, and right off the bat the menu seemed really familiar. I had just gone to Cowboy Ciao the weekend prior and it felt like deja vu. So much so that I had to ask if they were affiliated with one another- sure enough the chef for cph had worked at Cowboy Ciao for 15 years or something the waiter said. Ok. Got it. The thing about both of these restaurants is that the menu is very eclectic, interesting ingredients such as duck fat in the ice cream. Friends ordered the famous chop salad and loved it. Even this has dehydrated corn in it. This restaurant has beautiful decor, not stuffy but elegant. Not something I could see myself wanting to eat all the time. Very rich food. Just ok."}
{"text":"The short rib, skip. It's way too dry and basic for my taste buds. The crab cakes are also not that special here. But since I LOVE the chopped salad here, I get that Togo almost every week. It's also good with extra tomatoes upon request."}
{"text":"Amazing!  What an incredible first time to a place wonderfully run by an old friend!  Peg and I dropped in tonight (early enough so that we could savor the friendship of Bernie and Gina) and had an amazing meal.  Pork belly pastrami appetizer, the traditional chopped salad, and creative main courses of the scallops/grits and meatloaf/yukon gold potato. Of course, the pecan nut bars were an emphatic end to one of the best meals that we have had. It is so  nice to see gracious people excel at what they do, and this is one of the best ever.  We will return and bring friends!!   Love you guys!!"}
{"text":"I love this place! It was a typical slow summer night with lots of open tables but we opted to sit at the bar. Then it happened... Found out they serve The Juicy Lucy! If you don't know what that is, it's likely because you're not from MN, and quite possibly have never visited. The bartender was just as excited as I was to have this available to order, I thought it was just a Minnesota thing. He confirmed it was, but the cook was from Minnesota. Ok now it all makes sense! Lol It tasted amazing, almost as good as the 5-8 club in my hometown! Thanks for bringing a little Minnesota happiness to the valley! Can't not say something about the amazing service and definitely felt the \"Minnesota nice\" vibe!"}
{"text":"I love Houstons and Chelseas kitchen but I live near old town and I wanted a goto in old town. I think I found a contender. My first try I had meatloaf and Mac and cheese! Both good but not awesome. Nice service and atmosphere"}
{"text":"The word \"amazing\" came up often in our description of food.  Choppped Salad, chicken & waffles, fondue. Ribs, meat loaf & duck. The atmosphere was great. The staff were friendly and courteous. It was quite obvious why this is a must go to restaurant."}
{"text":"That salad! It keeps me coming back over and over again. And they always have amazing desserts."}
{"text":"Our dinner wasn't perfect, and I can't wait to come back here again. I highly recommend CPH.  Went here with some out-of-town guests as a kick off to their visit. Some of the food was served cold, and the lamb was served undercooked from what was requested. We mentioned it to the server and requested the lamb to be cooked a little more, as he asked how our meals were. He went above and beyond to make sure we were satisfied with not only our food, but our experience at this restaurant. Everything was exquisite.   I've never felt more appreciated by a restaurant for our patronage. With all that was done I can't bring myself to give less than 4 stars, even for an imperfect meal. Hopefully on our next visit it will be a solid 5!"}
{"text":"restaurant week menu not great. very small salad and three not very large scallops for main course. service barely mediocre. server never asked if we wanted coffee or  whatever for dessert. presented check without being asked for it. runners had no idea who got any of the courses. server never asked how the food was. had much better experience at previous visit."}
{"text":"Went for lunch with coworkers. We had quick and good service. I ordered the wild mushroom burger with truffle fries. Both were VERY good. It can be a bit pricy, but the flavor holds up."}
{"text":"Stark white, steel bar, dark wood beams....modern and chic. The chopped salad is wonderful...i've never seen anything like it.  It was rows of different ingredients and tossed together in front of me.  Apparently, it has been imitated by a lot of other places, which I saw later in my trip.  This version was the best though...smoked salmon, sunflower seeds, large couscous, sweet corn, arugula, tomato, and the creamy basil dressing is better than everyone else's...i'm guessing the ingredients may vary depending on what is fresh and available.  The bar staff was friendly and made me feel comfortable dining by myself.  The drinks are phenomenal...I got the Citi-zen, which came with rock candy that I can stir until my desired sweetness is infused in my pear ginger martini.  I had a great weekend visiting wonderful places while in Arizona, and this is one of them!"}
{"text":"Nice restrooms.  I really should say up-front that I didn't eat anything here.  So why do they deserve 5 stars?  Because I want to give a HUGE shout out to my server (insert name here).  I had just come from eating apps at another restaurant up the street and when my dining companion got her scallops, well, let's just say my tummy wasn't all that happy with it's contents.  I was probably running to the restroom every 5 minutes or so.  Our server (forgive me, but I didn't catch the name during my sprints to the loo) was awesome.  She gave me several bitters and ginger in an attempt to calm my stomach and offered some other options I could pick up at the drugstore.  Unfortunately, nothing worked, but the fact that she gave a damn how I was feeling was cool in my book.  Oh, and the bitters and ginger were really tasty...too bad they didn't stay down for long.  Anyway, I can comfortably say these restrooms are nicely decorated...just wish I didn't have to spend all dinner there."}
{"text":"Reviews of chop salad were right. Very tasty and a light meal all it's own. Short ribs were excellent as well. Blueberry pie was very tasty too. I am a fan."}
{"text":"Went with friends who made reservations. They were friendly and service was good. Menu was limited. They had a tasting menu which was fine. The famous chopped salad was great! I had the smart chicken which was good. Dessert was not to my liking- a berry desert. This may have been a special for the tasting. Overall a solid restaurant but not my favorite."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner, make a reservation it gets packed, especially on the weekends. It's in the heart of old town, great location, big open windows with the bar in the middle, the ambience was great. Very noisy though, so don't think it's something intimate. You HAVE TO order the original chopped salad, the most amazing salad I've ever had. They put dried corn in the salad and it tastes like crouton but sweet, and the smoked salmon for protein, the flavors are amazing. The pork belly pastrami was good, but nothing special. It tastes just like any other pork belly dish but it was still cooked perfectly. The porcini fillet mignon was really delicious, the rub was very tasty and the steak was cooked perfectly to my liking. They have a great wine list and specialty cocktails. Great place to hang out with a small group and the people there are nice and knowledgeable. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what the hype is about. The good:  Great space (Atmosphere, crowd, ambiance, decor), great service. The okay:  Food was mediocre.  Seriously, everyone at the table was not impressed with their meal.  Bad night?   I appreciate chef's exploring, but do that on your own time.  The chef was trying to be creative, I get that.  But the flavors, textures and aromas - nothing harmonized. I literally had an upset stomach afterwards.  Anywhos, if you're looking for a kitschy place to take a date and not worrying about an impressive meal, this is your place.  Or if you just want cocktails, this is the place."}
{"text":"I have one (ok two) words: CHOPPED SALAD. Some people like to sub the smoked salmon for chicken, but I prefer the original (smoked salmon). It adds way more flavor.   The textures and flavors in this salad are unlike anything you've ever tried. The nuts and dried corn make it crunchy, the cous cous makes it soft, the the currents make it sweet and salmon make it salty, the creamy (but light) cilantro salad dressing is SO refreshing.  I order this to-go at least once a week. Order it unmixed, because it's fun (and more fresh) to mix it yourself. Even if you don't eat all of it, the salad is just as good 24 hours later (unlike a lot of salads).  If I had to eat one thing for the rest of my life... I could live off of this chopped salad. No joke. I've honestly never ordered anything but the chopped salad because it's SO good, so why would I?!"}
{"text":"My favorite restaraunt in Scottsdale. The lamb burger, pastrami and chopped salad were delicious. Great selection of drinks but the real find is the bar upstairs. I'd suggest to go here for dinner and then drinks upstairs.   This is a great place for a date or to celebrate a special occasion with friends."}
{"text":"We decided to give it a try for our last dinner in Scottsdale before heading home after dropping our kids off at GCU. We had fondue and chopped salad to start. Both were very tasty. I almost ordered the salad again for dinner it was so delicious. Chose to have the meatloaf and the short ribs once again delicious flavors, a great ending to a super busy emotional week. We will be back when we return to visit the kids."}
{"text":"Where to start? Lex is the manager and really helped me out for Valentines night. He put my preordered roses on our table and brought over our bottle of wine that I preordered. Our waiter was very cool and knowledgable. Atmosphere was great and very clean. My steak was amazing! Couldn't have been better. My wife's chicken however was not the same. Her chicken breast was very dry. We didn't say anything because we were not looking to stir things up on a great night. The dessert was amazing and you have to try it no matter how full you are. That's on point. So for the price we paid, that was the sad part. I'm going to email Lex to let him know and I'm sure they will fix the problem."}
{"text":"This place was just amazing. Came here on a whim while traveling for work and was surprised by every bit of the meal. The atmosphere was classy, let laid back. The bar area was well organized and clean and the bartenders super friendly. They refilled my drinks promptly and suggested options through my entire meal.  I ended up with the pork belly pastrami which was just insanely good for too many reasons to write up. Simply put, just order it and experience it yourself.   I've always loved chicken & waffles and decided to pull the trigger here at Citizen. The chicken was super moist and the batter was pretty light so it didn't taste or feel overly heavy. The only gripe was the size of the waffle, which was a bit too small for my taste.  Lastly, the bread pudding made from doughnuts!?!!? You've got to be kidding me right?!! That just put me back a few weeks on my workouts by itself! That dish was just another one that you just have to order and experience on your own. So effin good!"}
{"text":"I went to Citizen Public House for the first time for happy hour the other day and I must say, I was very impressed! They're staff is so very courteous and always attentive. Their happy hour specials are great too! I recommend the sangria :) We didn't have much of the food but we did try of the bar snacks was fantastic! I would recommend this place to anyone looking for an upscale, quaint place to have dinner and drinks. What a great hidden treasure in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"BACON LOVERS UNITE! Get your butts over to this place pronto! I found your heaven!!! My favorite bacon eater brought me here with a couple of friends without noting any sort of hidden agenda. When I saw the menu, I understood why we were here immediately...   Our server stepped up to the table and immediately started describing drinks and dishes to us without skipping a beat. He was educated about the food and it showed-- I appreciate that. He also made us giggle when he walked away from the table saying, \"I'll get your drinks and oh, I'll grab your nuts!\"  I must say, their nuts are candied and delicious. Just the way I like them.   So, my dearest friend was unafraid to try the artery-clogging dishes that he had lined up in his mind, and it started off with the \"Tender Belly\" bacon fat heirloom popcorn. Fact: It's pieces of bacon tossed in with some flavorless regular ol' popcorn. Does the bacon make it good? Sure. Is it something amazing? No, it's definitely a novelty and they are just having fun with it.   Next: We went for something healthy and highly recommended: The Mirliton Chopped Salad. As everyone has said, it's deeeeelicious. I wanted to marry it while I was on my salad high (I realized that marrying food just isn't sustainable...). Just so you know, it's not very big-- I recommend two people sharing it before your main dish.   Sandwiches: I got the Halloumi Sandwich. I love cheese, and I wasn't certain of what to expect with this dish, so I suppose I really had no expectations. The roll it came on was delicious, the chickpea puree was a great spread, I loved the tahini addition as well, but somehow I couldn't love the cheese. It just didn't have a texture that I am used to and it wasn't a strong enough flavor to balance it out. So...I \"hmm\" this dish. Not dislike, just...\"hmm\"...  My friend's dish: Another friend ordered the BLT and the other ordered the Pastrami. He ordered the Lamb Burger. This was described by the server as \"gamey\" in his initial description. I do not like that word. That sounds like the meat is going to have body odor, soooo I didn't order it! Fortunately for me, my friend did and it was a little overcooked for his liking, so we swapped dishes! HOORAY!! It was pure, premium lamb and the tzatziki and cucumber onion salad were complimentary and DELISH. No B.O. here, folks, just tasty goodness. The server took off the lamb burger because of the overcooked factor AND offered to bring him another one that was rarer. What great service!   Dessert: Yes, I continued my role as sidekick on the bacon-anza and got the \"Pig in the Orchard\" Bread Pudding. I was in a coma already, but I decided to just finish myself off with this one. The bacon adds really just another novelty factor to this dish. You could easily have just cooked the bread pudding with some of the bacon run-off and been done with it, the bacon taste would have been enough to satisfy the taste. The bacon chunks=overkill. The ice cream neutralizes it ever so slightly and gives it an apple pie savory appeal.  As the Bacon-anza came to a close, we were all turning into little piglets before our eyes with rosier cheeks and a light glaze added to our skin... Thank you Citizen Public House."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and always have had a good experience.  Being that there are a bunch of great restaurants in the area, Public House holds it's own, and I'd probably be back again.  This place is great for a quieter nice dinner before a night out for sure.  Sometimes I like to get away from places that are slammed and this place provides that opportunity for that.  It has more of an intimate setting, probably good for dates.  They do have some nice drink selections but being fashioned after a gastropub, I'd say their beer selection is kind of weak.  But then again, I'm going here for the food, so let's say it's more gastro than pub.  The food is all good.  Pork Belly Pastrami was amazing and so were the crab cakes, although portions are small, but I expected this.  I've had the meatloaf, which for meatloaf was damn good especially with the glaze.  I'm not really a meatloaf person, but thought it would be good and it was.  Scallops were also very well done.  A friend of mine ordered the mac n' cheese and didn't like it.  I thought she hates everything and tried it and was disappointed.  One might say, yeah but... mac & cheese?  I have had some, like at Smith & Wollensky's, which is unforgettable.    The staff has always been great.  I know I'll be back here. To really go over the top for me I'm looking for something on the menu that I will crave."}
{"text":"several years ago i made a dinner reservation for my fiancé's birthday at kai.  if you know anything about that place you'd know it's the only five diamond restaurant in arizona, so it sounded like it would be an amazing spot for a birthday celebration.    long story short, we had a TERRIBLE time.  like, super infuriating i hope this place burns to the ground five diamonds are you kidding me terrible.  we actually walked out before we even got a chance to eat because that's how bad it was.   since kai is about 45 minutes from our house, by the time we got back to our area of town it was 9:45pm and practically every nice restaurant was closing.  i figured my fiancé's birthday dinner plans were completely ruined and i felt god awful. that is until i turned to yelp and saw that citizen public house was open late and still serving!   the service we received was a complete 180 from what we experienced at kai and the food was absolutely amazing! even with a $100 celebratory bottle of champagne (seriously needed after what we had experienced), our bill was half of what it would have been at kai.  since this initial dinner, citizen has become one of my favorite restaurants in the valley.  the chefs/owners/bartenders are constantly pushing themselves to create amazing things and they always succeed!   whether you're in the mood for a romantic dinner, late-night snack, or a cocktail at the bar, this is a great place to go.  and if you're there on thursday-saturday, head upstairs after dinner to citizen r+d; their cocktails will blow your mind!"}
{"text":"I made reservations on Open Table for a Thursday night at 7 although it wasn't so crowded that we wouldn't have been seated without one.  Started off with a delicious cab (later followed by a decent zin), and this is perhaps why everything was so good. ;)  We had the chicken and waffles appetizer (gluten free!!) which was great. The chicken was very crispy without being dry or burnt. The server said they use rice flour in the batter which I didn't notice only that it was tasty. The waffles were made with oats and it was very good, as well.  Dinner was varied with spare ribs, scallops, filet, and roasted chicken. Everyone's dishes looked amazing. I thought the spare ribs were fantastic with the meat falling off the bone the second you touch a fork to it. I was not, however, sold on the parsnip purée. The flavor and consistency were odd.. I think the seasonal veggie was kale which was not a good combo for the short ribs.   For desserts we had the donuts and coffee, the black and tan pudding, and the browned butter brownie. Let's just say that with the exception of the black and tan pudding (there wasn't enough of the black and too much tan!) that the plates were cleaned.  All in all, a great meal and I would go again."}
{"text":"I wanted to try this place for the first time and really nothing special about it and it's quite depressing inside the food is nothing special the ambience is nothing special I don't know with the big raves about this place???"}
{"text":"This place is a gem that is so different from many other up and coming places around town. The hostess greeted us and seated us quickly. The waitress was nothing but a fountain of knowledge about all things on the menu, which was helpful in making our selections for dinner.   Starting off with some fun, different, and delicious drinks was a great suggestion, and the mac and cheese on the appetizer menu was to DIE for. Great mix of food and fun here. Dinner came out perfectly timed, and our waitress was attentive and helpful. The food was awesome and quite different than we would normally get. Great options, and the chopped salad is awesome, and I don't like salad, so that's saying a lot."}
{"text":"as I got sick on vacation I was very upset that it went from exploring and eating around Scottsdale to me in bed nonstop, skip to 2 days later and the first thing I wanted to do was come here for my first real meal! our waiter was seriously the nicest waiter I've ever met and I have gone out to eat basically all over the world. whatever they are paying him should be doubled!   anyway my grilled cheese was perfect for someone who hadn't eaten in 2 days and just so good. my husband loved his lamb burger, my mom wasn't a fan of hers but that's because she was expecting like fake lamb you'd get at like a mcdonalds or something lol. this is the real delicious lamb at this place :) I also loved the look of this place."}
{"text":"Located in Old Town Scottsdale, this gastropub has been one of my favorite restaurants due to their superb ingredients, consistency, originality, and service. The location is easy to miss on the street corner, and strangely I haven't had problems with parking in the amount of times I have been here.  They open in the late afternoon and dim the lights once dinner hours kick in. The interior is underscored by a full bar in the middle surrounded by rows of tables and booths dressed in white tablecloths and small candles. Even though the atmosphere gets loud later in the evenings, the venue is a nice date spot or small gatherings.  For appetizer, their Original Chopped Salad ($12) is a must get. The firm couscous, fresh arugula, corn, aged asiago, and smoked salmon was a delicious combination that gave pop and texture in every bite. I highly recommend it.  Among the entrees, I top two dishes are the Smoked Duck Breast ($28) and Roasted Buttermilk Chicken ($20). The Smoked Duck Breast comes with two thick cuts of duck breast served tender and medium rare. The pieces were very soft to cut into with refined seasonings to go nicely with the sweet potato hash and braised greens. I wished the sweet potato could be a tad sweeter for a change of pace, but the greens were fresh and delicious to couple with the succulent duck.   Kudos to the chef, I'm not sure how the Buttermilk Chicken came out so tender and full of flavor! It was served with corn-butter bean succotash, roasted Brussels sprouts, truffle oil, and pecorino Romano on top. The thick cut was grilled and impressively moist with a refined buttermilk flavor in the backdrop. It was simplicity mixed with complexity. This is a dish for those who do not like to take risks, but it's also one that will impress both foodies and non-foodies alike.   The Fair Trade Short Ribs ($30) came with coffee rub, dried cherry BBQ sauce, roasted parsnip puree and seasonal veggies. The ribs lacked a desired smoky flavor, but it was nevertheless complex and cuts at the touch of knife. The ribs were moist, and the tangy and zesty cherry BBQ sauce gave it an added dimension. The parsnip puree round out the flavors to go in-between the meats.   The Lamb Burger ($13) came with Serbian lepinja roll, pickled cucumber-onion tzatziki, and fries with house-made ketchup. The lamb was tender, super moist, with a detectable seasoning and good lamb flavor. The soft rolls held the burger together nicely, but for a dish this good, the fries could come with a few innovative dipping sauces other than ketchup.   For dessert, I was not all that impressed with the Choco-Chile Bread Pudding ($10). The chili flavor could be more pointed to add to the scoop of tortilla ice cream and dulce de leche. The quality of the bread pudding was rather stiff, flavorless, and one-dimensional. I wished the bread pudding could have more flavors embedded, so it does not create a distinct separation between dull and rich flavors. Since the bread pudding came highly recommended by the server, I got the sense that dessert is not really their specialty.  Service was very friendly, responsive, attentive, personable and knowledgeable. My meals were always nicely orchestrated, and the servers were extremely knowledgeable about the menu. One time I had a two year old at the dinner table and they were very accommodating with everything he needed.   However, I wouldn't recommend this place for large groups. I tried to organize a large dinner and the person on the phone was not friendly and required a hefty minimum for drinks. Her requirements were quite unusual since I had organized many other dinner events at other restaurants in the past. Other than that, there's plenty to like about this place. I'd be happy to return to try their Happy Hour menu and other items such as the Grilled Cheese Sandwich and Mac n Cheese.  Thanks to fellow Yelper Kurdy S for finding this place!"}
{"text":"My wife had the chopped salad, which she really enjoyed. I had the belly blt which was good but different.  The bacon was a little more chewy than I'm used to. Drinks were good. I had the Citizen and she had the Mule (a vegetable type of adult beverage).  Finally we had the bread pudding dessert which was good. Restaurant was half empty but we were lucky they could squeeze us in without a reservation so I suggest you reserve before you go. Overall an enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"Really cool place. Decor and atmosphere was mission style meet public house. Service was excellent and very knowledgeable.   We split a chopped salad that was artistically prepared. Smoked salmon. Pepitas. Fried corn for crunch. Just delish.   I had the pork cheeks. It was a starter but plenty for me. This might have been the best pork I have ever eaten. Slow roasted and fall apart tender. Perfect fat content. Just wonderful. I will have this every time I return to Scottsdale."}
{"text":"the salad was amazinggggg.... it's like a party in my mouth :)"}
{"text":"Wow. This was awesome. Food was top notch (duck burger was off the hook but a bit salty). The short rib tacos were a perfect flavor blend, and the jerky was delicious. However, the service was the best part of the experience. Ask for mike to make you a beer cocktail. I am a bit of a dabbler in trying different drinks and was very impressed with both his service and his drinks. Definitely will be back here!"}
{"text":"We used to go to Cowboy Ciao until the chef opened up Citizen Public House.  This is the place I take my East Coast  co-workers when they are in town.   Great vibe, great cocktails, and a wide array of yummy dishes.  We would have done their Valentine's Dinner if they had a decent reservation time available."}
{"text":"Good food, attentive service, tasty drinks but you have to be ok with noise - it's loud!"}
{"text":"The best chopped salad. I mean it has its own facebook page. Idk if its the texture, the dressing, or the quality and freshness of the salad ingredients, but it's the best. Just thinking about it makes me want it. If i were to revisit Scottsdale, Arizona this may be the first spot i go to or the only spot i go to. Not only for their salad but also for their scallops with grits and pork belly pastrami. Citizen Public House delivers with ambiance, service, and obviously delicious food. Looking around at what the other tables ordered and from what our server had said each dish they offer is a customer favorite (and each table either had exactly what we had on our table or other dishes we thought of getting) and I believe him. Each dish we had was rich with flavor, seasoned perfectly, and just melds perfectly at each bite."}
{"text":"One of my all time favorite restaurants. WOW the filet mignon was probably the best steak I have ever had.. and this isn't even a steakhouse. The meat was cooked absolutely perfectly and cut like butter. Our waiter waited on us hand and foot. He was delightful and upbeat. We had the gnocchi for an appetizer which was pretty good. The drinks were incredible and would make any mixologist proud. Very interesting yet high quality ingredients were used to make delicious  cocktails. For dessert, my mom absolutely loved the pb and pudding, which is saying something because she's extremely picky. Can't wait to return !"}
{"text":"Started with fondue great combo of salty and creamy cheese.  Tuna with Thai rice was delicious get this!!!"}
{"text":"One of those restaurants that you know you will definitely go back to! Amazing food and amazing service. We started with the chopped salad and it was delicious, then I had the sea bass and my boyfriend has the steak. Both were delicious. The atmosphere was like a New York restaurant and I loved it because I didn't see a single cell phone in site. It seemed like everyone was just enjoying their meals and their company. This place doesn't get nearly enough credit."}
{"text":"Yes, yes, yes!!!!!!! Someone 2 years ago told me to get the chopped salad... I have been indulging in this \"crack food\" ever since and have to get it every time I'm in town.  You won't regret it.   The bartenders and servers are fantastic. The atmosphere compliments a happy hour with friends or a romantic dinner. Don't forget to get the original chopped salad."}
{"text":"Wow I'm surprised to see such great reviews for this place! I was left very unimpressed. I ordered the duck, it was greasy and simply did not have a good taste. I have always loved eating duck but this was very disappointing. The service was mediocre as well. Maybe we just had an off day here tho.... I would not return here."}
{"text":"The best! Love the salads good happy hour.  The bar is fun to sit and drink or eat dinner. The bartenders are great"}
{"text":"We popped in for early dinner after catching the Giants v Reds spring training game at Scottsdale stadium. Had the flatbread with hummus and tzatziki dip for a starter and went with the chopped salad and the scallops for our entree's. PB&B for dessert. Everything was fantastic (especially the scallops on that bed of grits), including the service."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were wandering around Old Town Scottsdale late one afternoon and happened to walk by Citizen Public House. It was getting close to dinner time so we decided to pop in. Neither one of us realized that we were about to have an amazing dinner! Wow! I think it is probably one of those restaurants where every item on the menu is excellent, but the Truffle Grilled Cheese was so good that I don't know if I could bring myself to order anything else. My boyfriend is still talking about how amazing his lamb burger was. We can't wait to go back! Also, the noise level wasn't too bad when we were there, but it might get a little loud when it's really packed. Excellent service too!"}
{"text":"Great food and wonderful atmosphere. We got there in time for happy hour so we ordered appetizers. The nuts were my fav. For dinner I had their famous chop salad with chicken. Absolutely phenomenal. A must go...."}
{"text":"I cannot say enough great things about this place. Its upscale but not stuffy or pretentious and the food is always great! Yesterday was about my 5th time dining here, this time my boyfriend and I sat outside for some cocktails during social hour and snaked on the Bacon heirloom popcorn. Our waiter AJ was awesome! He truly embodied great customer service; knowledgeable about the drinks/menu, friendly, and entertaining. This was supposed to be our last trip here before we move out of state, but because of this last experience we want to go back one more time.  Last note: Never miss an opportunity to order a chopped salad from here."}
{"text":"I was amazed at how wonderful everything was - I really wasn't sure what to expect as this was my first trip to this part of Arizona.  The original place we planned to eat at had a 90 minute plus wait, um no thanks...I'm glad though because Citizen Public House was fantastic! Great food, great service, great beers.  Favorite menu items: bacon popcorn (seriously tasty \"bar snack\"), filet mignon asada tacos were delicious and the seared scallops were perfection. I don't recall what the name of the dessert we had but it was incredibly good - it was a chocolate custard/pot de creme style dessert.  Your bill can add up very fast but definitely worth every penny!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome. It was our first dinner in Scottsdale and I had made reservations for an early dinner and I'm so happy we came here. Sometimes, you wonder why there's so many positive reviews. Well, that's because this place is awesome. Our service was wonderful throughout our entire meal, even with two terrible toddlers, they were very accommodating. For appetizers we started with their hummus and pita and those yummy pickles and definitely get this as a starter because it was delicious. Then we got a few of their chopped salads with chicken as we heard how amazing they are and they truly do live up to the hype as they were awesome and we gobbled them right up. I also got their version of mac n cheese, mostly for my toddlers, yet I ended up eating half of it as it was very good.  For our entrees we got a bunch of different things but the stand outs were the short rib tacos that just melted in your mouth and the duck burger which is what my dad got which he seemed to like but that is a huge portion I must say. I wanted to try the happy hour mussels as well but we were getting stuffed by this point so I decided to save room for dessert and I'm glad I did. The chocolate mouse with carmel cup and bits of cookies on top, can't remember the name but it literally is one of a kind, I seriously devoured the entire thing with a few spoons that I let my mom share. Wow, it was that good and probably my favorite thing of the evening. I will definitely come back here when I come to Scottsdale again as it has amazing food in a pretty casual yet still nice atmosphere. Definitely a top five in the area!!"}
{"text":"I have not even eaten here and yet had the best customer service !! Tom was absolutely wonderful trying to fit me in on a Busy Saturday night for my husbands birthday, He found me a table and then our plans changed,  he was completely gracious when I called back to tell him we could not make it. He invited us in on another night !! I can not wait to eat here  if the food is as awesome as Tom it will be amazing!!"}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday dinner and was very happy with my choice. Citizen Public House has a deceiving facade, but upon entrance you are greeted with the cozy atmosphere. Tables are lit by single votive candles completing the mood. The drink menu is filled with craft brews, hand crafted cocktails and a diverse wine list. We shared the famous Chopped Salad and were not disappointed, very rich and refreshing! We had the chicken fried duck leg, the Cubano, and the pork belly pastrami. The Cubano was fantastic my favorite! We will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Great place, awesome atmosphere, food + drinks rock. Make sure to get their famous salad!"}
{"text":"Good place to go for cask/barrel spirits. Quit early evening.  Not to noisy.  Would highly recommend. Good place for  hipsters, middle and older patrons."}
{"text":"We headed here after dinner on a Sunday night. At roughly 9pm there weren't very many people at the bar but some of the tables were filled. We didn't get anything to eat but I'm sure it would've been good. The ambience is very classy with their white table settings, dimmed lights, and dark wood aesthetic. The bar in the center stood out but not in a bad way.   I got the Socialite and was very pleased with it. It was a fruity little drink but you knew it packed enough of a punch. The bartender was very attentive and checked in only when he needed to. It was busy enough where he has other things to do but he also chatted with patrons who seemed like regulars. I like that in a bartender because I don't need someone to chat with me when I'm already here with a friend but he was still able to come check on us right as we finished our drinks.   All in all, it was a good time and I would come back!"}
{"text":"The chopped salad is a perfect little starter. We enjoyed the special item \"Juicy Lucy\" burger. A lively ambiance and stellar service seem to be constants. Be careful of their chicken breast.  Ours was brined to the core and not enjoyable at all. They were gracious enough to adjust for that.  Stuff happens. We will return! I like how you can either have a big splurge night with expensive entrees and great wine, or just a fancy sandwich and good beer. Some dress up, some make it upscale casual."}
{"text":"This place was a huge disappointment. The moment we got there they were not very welcoming.  It was a big group of bachelorette girls and the moment we sat down he seemed annoyed. The food was just OK and for the prices, I didn't think the food or service was on par."}
{"text":"Once again we have had an amazing meal. Our server tonight was Gary. Hands down the best service you can imagine. He has been there since day one and he truly does care about your experience.  My first experience with this establishment was with Mike. He's in charge of the amazing drinks they put together, hence why we came back.  Couple things you have to order: chopped salad with smoked salmon (I swear by it!). Pesto aoli with your bread (it's grilled, don't say no). And finally an espresso martini to wrap your meal up and calm your pallet for what ever the night may bring you.  Enjoy, you'll definitely see me going back there."}
{"text":"I called to make a 3:00pm reservation for a Saturday , the young lady said they didn't have anything until 9:00pm! My husband got on a booking app & booked us an appointment at 3:00pm right away. We walked up to the door at exactly 3:01 & the door was locked. Another couple was sitting outside & said it was closed & they were waiting to get in also. At 3:05 we checked the door again & it was unlocked but no one came outside to tell us they had unlocked the door! (Weird...they saw us trying the door handle). The man who sat us at our table  argued with us about how they were booked!  To our waiters credit he was good but he was the only one running around & since they were \"booked\" until 9pm I would think they would have others waiters? After a long 2 hours the place NEVER filled up! There were probably 150 empty seats!! So I'm not sure why they made such a big deal out of them being booked up?!!   The food was good but over priced for what you got. The scallops were good but the price comes out to about $10 a piece. The chopped salad everyone made a big deal of was not that big in portion. It was good but for $14 I'll pass.  I ordered a vodka/tonic & it was as flat as a pancake!  We didn't care for the atmosphere as it smells like an old moldy building.   We had plans to come back with a group of friends but we'll pass on that too. Our meal was NOT cheap & I'd rather spend that kind of money at a restaurant that has better management with better attitudes.  I don't get it?"}
{"text":"Creative, delicious, pretty meals in a nice setting with excellent, friendly service, all at a decent price. What more could you want?"}
{"text":"I came to Scottsdale as part of a 15-gent bachelor party, and CPH was our big night/sendoff dinner for the bachelor.  As a result, we did a $50-per-person fixed price menu that featured a choice of one of two salads, one of four entrees, and a chef's selection on dessert.  As my friends will tell you, I eat out 6-8 times per week all over America and at nicer restaurants a couple of times a month...I've never seen one of these menus get you less food than I got last night.  (This had that \"Restaurant Week for dinner in DC\" feel to it; DC folks know what I'm talking about!)  Part of that was tied to dessert.  I'm allergic to nuts.  Bottom line, the chef's selection featured three desserts that all featured some form of nuts.  (I don't think a nut allergy is particularly rare these days...do you?)  I asked our server--who was otherwise an excellent host for our large, somewhat unruly group--if I could just get something plain, a chocolate cake, or a cheesecake, or sorbet...anything.  The answer was a flat no.  That affected the rest of my thoughts on the meal, really.  I'm normally a cocktail guy but I opted for a glass of the pinot grigio, which was fine...but from reading some of these Yelp reviews, it looks like I should have gotten a cocktail.  The salad (field greens) was fine, a little overdressed but the greens were tasty.  The entree was, frankly, an injustice...for a fixed price menu that also featured a 7-to-8 oz. steak and the biggest piece of chicken I've seen not on top of a waffle in Chicago, the scallops were puny.  I mean, beyond puny.  THREE SCALLOPS?  I literally took a small bite a minute, just to stretch out the amount of food on the plate.  The greens served with it were chewy, almost tough to cut with a normal knife.  So, to summarize, $50 got me three scallops, about one measuring cup worth of salad greens, and no dessert.  I can't in good conscience recommend coming back, but again, I thought the service was great and the space was well lit and featured good-looking people (I am finding this is standard in Scottsdale, but still).  I did go out to eat later that evening, because I was so freakin' starved.  At least our bachelor left happy!"}
{"text":"Not your typical Irish bar. Kind of just a bar w/ some whisky barrels on one wall. Very chic looking though. We stopped in for a nightcap so we didnt see it in full swing.  The drinks were delicious and oh my god, bacon popcorn, Really?! Yes. The answer is yes. And it was awesome.  Im anxious to try something from their actual menu."}
{"text":"We went to CPH for my 29th birthday in early December.  It was easy to find as it is located in Old Town and once inside it was dark and hip.  They have a large bar and the dining area wraps around it. We did not have reservations so sat at the bar for about 20 minutes before our table was ready. The bar experience was the BEST part.  I had the Citi-zen signature (lemon drop) it was AMAZING!  It comes with a stick of rock candy as well.  My husband also thought his drink was one of the best cocktails he has ever had... We also snacked on some bacon fat popcorn which was super tasty. Once seated we had really great service, but the food was lacking. I had a pork sandwich that was just average at best and not very hot.  My husband had the meatloaf, which was good, but slightly overcooked and pretty small considering the price.  I did end the night with the black and tan dessert and it would be one of my favs along with Gallo Blancos chocolate pudding for best desserts in the valley.  So my suggestion is hit up happy hour, grab a few drinks & apps and finish off with the black and tan dessert.  Call it a night and save yourself from a disappointing entree and in the process save some serious cash.."}
{"text":"If you haven't been you MUST try! This place never fails on anything from the service, atmosphere and of course the food!   Everything on the menu is great so hard to give an actual recommendation. If I had to choose would be a seasonal item which is Burger... yes a burger. Duck burger that is! Your welcome in advance. Another must try which is great for sharing is the signature salad. Im not a salad person so very rare that i'd recommend to try it.. Its that good!   Be sure to also indulge in there amazing hand crafted cocktails as well. Happy Eating!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent happy hour and wonderful atmosphere. I've only ever had a bite to eat and drinks at the bar but dining area looks nice as well . I'll make this simple . You have to get the chopped Salad .  This is goin to sound aggressive but I am selling it short . This glorious \"salad \" is mixed right in front of you and it's one of the greatest culinary experiences of my life . That's right . You experience this salad . It's so good if you order it as an appetizer you may quickly find yourself ordering another as your entree . This is the Michael Jordan of all salads . If someone told me last year I'd be singing the praises of a salad with a page long post today I'd question if there's a new burger called salad in the future . If you live within 100 mile radius make the trip here to order this ."}
{"text":"I don't know what all the \"talk\" is about this restaurant, as we found it to be average plus! Really small martini glasses( tiny drinks), the grilled cheese was bland, the pork chop was bland, the chopped salad was very good, the Mac and cheese wasn't as good as out of the box, the filet mignon was very good! Really loud interior, super loud actually, boring bread basket, thought the PB &B dessert might save them as it sounded great, but it was only average as well! To many good restaurants to go back! RS"}
{"text":"Love it! This was our third time and this time we brought friends. Everything we've tried has been fantastic. The pork belly pastrami, the meatloaf, the filet, short ribs and that jar of Guiness chocolate mousse!! WOW. They have real mixologists that can make any cocktail and make it well. Great vibe. Always seems to be busy, so make a res. Noise level is really high, but that's not a negative for us."}
{"text":"My daughter & son inlaw took us here food was amazing, & that bacon pecan brittle was to die for"}
{"text":"Wow!! I made a reservation here after checking out Yelp reviews.  A group of 8 of us were in town for a vacay, and good food was on the top of our list! It happened to be restaurant week, which turned out to be a pleasant surprise. The menu/deal was a no-brainer, especially for those of us who wanted the scallops, as the 2 extra courses were only an additional $3.  I had the beet salad which was really good, but I am having serious regret over not ordering the OMFG chop salad which was amazing. Hubs did get it & I wanted to inhale it! Luckily they sent us home with the recipe & I can't wait to try to make it! I had the scallops which were outstanding, and for dessert the French toast bread pudding, which I did inhale.  We really enjoyed this meal & I think it was the best one of our trip! I recommend going & getting the salad for sure! (And I never rave about a salad...!)"}
{"text":"The apps we had were tuna crudo and bruschetta, both very good.  As were the chicken and short ribs entrees.  But the Brussel sprouts were undercooked, the service a bit slow and the noise a bit too loud.  CPH could easily earn another star by getting a few more things right, but for now I reluctantly conclude that it merely has \"room to improve.\"  Ps.  Among desserts: try the Black & Tan."}
{"text":"I put my name in for a table for two and I waited for 1.5 hrs for a table.  Well, they forgot to text me.  Empty tables everywhere when I returned.  Food was good, waitress was nice but I will not come back."}
{"text":"I have had nothing but great experiences at Citizen Public House. While I'll start off by saying that I know some of the items can be a bit overpriced, or possibly a lot overpriced, I'm taking into account the expensive Scottsdale location, and expensive real estate and booze licenses, so I will largely overlook it. Everything I've put into my mouth from here has been phenomenal, but I'll only really point you to one item, the meatloaf, it is unbelievable. I will judge every other meatloaf I ever meet against the CPH meatloaf. They also have inventive drinks, they even got me to enjoy gin, and I hate gin. The interior is nice, hip/modern, with an open feel and a nice bar as the centerpiece. I can't say that I'll be a regular here anytime soon, it's a bit of a drive from my house and there are other places that are basically as good but cheaper, but you can count on seeing me here from time to time, smile on my face and meatloaf in my mouth."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time last night and my oh my was it amazing! We did the 3 course meal for restaurant week only $33. First course was the chopped salad. To die for! Best salad I've ever had... That smoked salmon in it... Omg! My fiance had the meatloaf which of course i had to try. Perfectly cooked, absolutely delicious, and that mushroom cream sauce was the perfect touch. I had the pan seared scallops. First time eating scallops and they definitely set the bar! Soft like butter melt in your mouth delicious. Perfectly cooked and great texture. The greens, bacon, and grits were amazing! You have to include everything together... It will be the most amazing combo of flavors! For dessert we did the peach bread pudding and the black and tan, that bread pudding was the best I've ever had. We also had a few cocktails on their happy hour... Only $6 and they are definitely not cheap on the liquor! Holy cow! We had the Desert Sky, instant gratification, and the white sangria... All absolutely delicious! We CANT WAIT to visit again!"}
{"text":"The place isn't up to standards it portrays. But we recommend the starter with fondue beer cheese. Excellent."}
{"text":"Delicious! My husband took our 14 year old twins for a night out and we all loved it. However, it's not a place you'd bring younger kids. The food was thoughtful and modern, but still really accessible. We ordered a few starters and a couple entrees to share. I definitely recommend the chopped salad and fried catfish. The buratta and filet asada tacos really good too. Highly recommend if you're visiting Scottsdale and want a have a casual, yet sophisticated night out."}
{"text":"This is an experience to be remembered! Paul, our waiter was 5 stars. His attention to detail, demeanor, and promptness was Outstanding. We began with drinks. I selected the Zacapa 23 in a snifter and a rock. Single barrel whiskey and Riesling rounded out the table. We shared the bacon fat popcorn and chopped salad. Both best I have ever tasted. Yup best!  My selection was meatloaf. WOW it was presented like a dessert. Just try it. The chicken and yellow rice equaled the cuisine in Miami or Tampa. Who needs dessert..."}
{"text":"An overall incredible experience here! An incredible ambiance, next level service, delicious food! If you're wanting to try something new, fresh and exciting, this is a definite must!"}
{"text":"Food is great.   The Chop is my favorite.   Drink menu and bartending skills are top notch."}
{"text":"Everything from the service to the drinks to the food was amazing!  We had a reservation on a Friday at 7:15. When I fist walked in, I was greeted immediately and Matt (with the pretty blue eyes) escorted us to a nice booth for just the two of us and wished me a happy birthday (we were there to celebrate my birthday).   We ordered the Bacon Fat Heirloom Popcorn to start. It was freshly popped popcorn with actual bacon pieces on top. Yum. Then we shared the Original Chopped Salad. I crave these things so it was all that I'd dreamed of. My hubby ordered the lam burger for dinner (he said it was really good, but wished he had ordered it well instead of medium well) and I got the Truffled Grilled Cheese Sandwich, which had mashed potato on it (holla!) you could also add chicken or bacon, but I opted for it just the way it was. It was so good!  For cocktails, my hubby had the Beast (tequila cocktail - strong, but with a kick) and I had the Manhattan (strong, but tasty) and the Julep (strong, but sweeter than the Manhattan). They definitely don't skimp on the alcohol and know how to make a good cocktail.   Our server brought out the dessert menu and suggested the bread pudding or the peanut butter bar. We decided to go with the peanut butter bar (chocolate, peanut butter, strawberry jam, white chocolate ice cream). When it came out with no candle, the hubs asked where it was. The server hadn't been told it was my birthday! Pretty blue-eyed Matt had dropped the ball! (Bad Matt, bad). She felt really bad and brought out a candle, which was really very sweet. We then received a visit from the General Manager, Steve. He also felt really bad because they feel a birthday is special and if one chooses to spend it there, then it is a big deal to them. Because of all that, they comped the dessert (birthday dessert is apparently super tiny) and our popcorn AND gave us a $50 gift card to come back and let them make it up to us!   I think they went above and beyond the realm of good customer service and am looking forward to going back. I can't believe it took me so long to go in the first place!  to you, CPH."}
{"text":"Nothing better than a restaurant that opens up to Arizona's beautiful fall weather.  Wish I'd had time to hang out on the couch out front after dinner. The hummus platter appetizer was definitely better than any I've had.  The homemade pickles on the platter and on my lamb burger were delicious--remind me of my grandma's in Iowa!   I would have given them 4 stars, but after filling up on the flatbread and hummus, I ate less than half my dinner and had them box up the leftovers. Should have been a red flag when the gal took multiple plates back to the kitchen. What a bummer to open my box this morning hoping to see lamb burger and fries and see somebody else's leftovers. Not only am I mad, but whoever got mine will be disappointed too. One mistake--two unhappy customers! I suggest they bring the boxes to the table or have the staff label them."}
{"text":"On Saturday I crushed the competition during the \"Great Urban Race\". I was in a race to Sunday because I knew my Wife and I were going to CPH on Sunday for dinner!   So we get there Sunday with Reservation. I order a Midwest Manhattan, it sucked and the B-tender noticed I did not like it. He asked me for a baseline of what I liked and made a drink for me based on that. Guess Im a fruit because he gave me something pearish with red bull! It was good. My wife got sangria which was killer. We were with other guests and wanted to try the menu, so here goes:  Appetizers:  Kiltlifter Fondue: 2.5/5 - Not a thick fondue....and thats ok because the flavour is sharp, which I like. What I did not like was I could not taste the subtle flavors of the hops and barley.  Bernies Mac n' Cheese: 2.5/5 - Pretty boring. Cavatelli, came to the party underdressed and overpaid. Same mix of ingredients in the fondue. Laughing at myself.  Pork Belly Pastrami : 4/5  - This could easily be a five. It just needed a stronger pepper crust to contrast the flavourful fattyness. This dish is excellent. I actually can't wait to go back and eat it again. The flavor of pastrami, yet not as smoky as you would find in a NYC deli, as fatty and tender as can be, Oh and the tatses linger....into bedtime!! Not so good...Pastami burps. The rye spaetzle was great and I loved the sprout krout!!! Whole mustard seeds a nice touch!!   Chicken and Waffles : 3.75/5 - Really surprised! Loved the waffle. It was a touch small. Crunchy outside, soft middle full of flavour. The blue clover honey is not as fancy as some might think, quite common actually, none the less it is good. CPH may want to sub for a single pass amber. The almond butter was a nice touch. What I liked was the light crust on the chicken, and the chicken was moist, literally juicy.  Meatloaf 2/5 - Terrible. Dry with an over salty demi. Ho hum pot's and weak zuzchini. My wifes is better but I wont tell her! Sorry. The two star rating is becuse the portion size is enormous....which, had the meatloaf been good would have busted my gut. But there are some round eaters out there that would like to know that this brick o meat is for you.   Lamb Burger 4/5 - Really good. Cooked perfectly, charred a bit on outside with a nice juicy oink center. The Carrier for the beast was crispy, Warm, chewy and soft. Delicious!! Loved the fact that it was like a gyro sans gyro meat. Replaced with a hunk of charred lamb. Good Shit. The fries were great but the ketchup....thats a bingo bitch, what fun!  Duck Smoked 3.5/5 - Cooked perfectly!! Thats always a bonus. Thank you chef! Everthying seemed right here, just did not do it FOR ME! I have had much better but this was good. Definately got the flavour profile balanced. Loved the Kale! Eh...maybe I should bump this to a 4 star dish.  Pretty good.  Scallop and Grits 5/5 - Excellent ! I thought I was the only one who could truly execute a perfect tasting scallop. It is my pickest dish and one of the easiest to ruin. They were seared perfectly, cooked just right and all the oceanic, nutty, buttery smooth richness you want from a scallop was present upon first bite. The grits.....hands down the best part of my dinner. Thet were rich, roasty, corny and had absorbed the brine from the scallops almost turning this dish into a grit ala risotto. Weird, delis=cious with a a tongue ascerbic lashing from colas gastrique. Nicely done. I will be back for this soon!!  Overall a great place. Big on flavor, good vibe and it's nice to see the workers hanging out and helping out as if you were invited to a buddys house. They want you to be happy!! Good Shit!"}
{"text":"After wine tasting at Carlson Creek, we took a short walk to Citizen for a snack and drink.  Another great find for us while visiting the Old Town Scottsdale area! We sat at the bar, which filled up quickly as the happy hour crowd rolled in.    The ambiance is nice. The bar is the focal point, surrounded by tables with white table cloths for a more formal dining experience. The servers at the bar were friendly.   There were some unique items on their happy hour and starter menus. We ordered Heirloom Popcorn with bacon (salty, greasy, I liked it),  Housemade Flatbread with hummus & tzatiki (good, though nothing too special), and Pork Belly Pastrami with brussel sprout sauerkraut (I was intrigued by the description. Pretty good).  As you can see, we went with a salty, greasy kind of theme.   Hubby had the cocktail of the day. He said it was ok, not much of a kick to it. After those very generous pours by Wendy at Carlson Creek, I stuck with ice water (it was delicious, lol!).   I would try this place again next time we are in town."}
{"text":"Really good place! Awesome music, good mixology, good food, good staff...why not come here?  I consider myself a foodie and their food was definitely worth coming. The short ribs and lamb loin were fantastic! Definitely would suggest. Bread pudding wasn't that great and I was pretty disappointed - though the waiter did suggest not getting it, I should have listened because he made great drink and entree suggestions.  I would absolutely come back and you should try it if you haven't."}
{"text":"Drinks are good, bit on the pricey side but a  nice experience. Service was hit or miss at best. Food was just ok, and very pricey for what was offered, portions and flavor. Worth checking out for a happy hour, but if you are looking for a satisfying dinner your money may be better spent elsewhere."}
{"text":"Man. The Restaurant Week menu here was bomb.   We both ordered the beet salad, which was a nice combo of sweet and earthy. Not at all what I expected, in a very good way.  Wife ordered the salmon special, which had a harissa puree and cucumber couscous. I ordered the ling cod, we both agreed this was the best of the two. The pickled papaya and hazelnuts/beurre blanc were such a unique combo that played really well together.  Dessert was also delish, though not really the reason to come here. The cocktails and entrees are where it's at.  Side note, the two cocktails we ordered we're awesone. I got a Manhattan, which is probably the first I've had with tobacco bitters and maple syrup (holy smokes, no pun intended). The lady got something with gin, citrus, cucumber, and elderflower liquer. Totally different than mine, but very tasty as well.  Overall, highly recommend either In Good Spirits restaurant, honestly. Elevated dishes with a unique twist and great service. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Great food , great atmosphere and great service. My husband and I had dinner here last night and it didn't disappoint. The table started with the bruschetta and finished with the s'more in a jar. They enjoyed every bite.  I enjoyed the chicken with spicy risotto which is gluten free. They have a variety of gluten free dishes and starters.  My husband had the filet and enjoyed the steak with tasty sides.  I hear the chopped salad is the dish to beat. Next time."}
{"text":"This was one of those places that was fascinating to experience, and you don't know if you should document the evening chronologically, or by vice to virtue (or vice versa).  I love that my girl servin' us encouraged me to try somethin' new-- the Import. Ultimately, it didn't work out, and she struck it from the check (despite my protests) and stood behind the joint's penchant for gettin' fools open on food. Integrity = respect.  It was actually a rad conversation, because at first I couldn't come down on how I felt about this Jameson, tobacco bitters, tawny port & Guinness foam concoction, but I landed on \"It tastes like a flat Old Fashioned,\" and gettin' there was a few interactions between she-beaux and I and my girl servin' it up. That meant no pretense, no chit-chat, just real-talk about food and experience.  Ironically, my love had a drink called the Pleasantville that she described as \"boring.\"  While the pork was dry on the outside, it was tasty and moist internally, and the polenta was a bit scarce, but equally tasty. She-beaux destroyed the scallops, and the tuna that set the meal off was way off the meat rack.  Finally, the atmosphere (or crowd): we could not tear our eyes away from the desert rose (the Sweet Dee kind) who was way out of this homeboy's league, him with his jeans and flip flops and checked shirt tucked in (no belt(!)) and cuffs rolled up just once--- just once, mind you! This little scene was par for the course.    But my man sealed the deal, much to our bewilderment, and I think the Citizen's contribution to this feat shouldn't be underestimated or understated.  What else could explain such a thing?  Loved this place. Absolutely loved it."}
{"text":"The duck was unbelievable! Customer Service and vibe equally as impressive!"}
{"text":"Loved the mood, atmosphere, service and the food was very tasty.  Try the Pork Belly and Butternut Squash for apps, followed by the juicy Filet Mignon."}
{"text":"I don't get it. The place is loud, but we expected that. The staff is very knowledgeable and accommodating: 2 thumbs up. But the menu... Just trying waaaay too hard to be unique ... (And it does achieve that.) We consider ourselves foodies, but this was just too strange and the prices were over the top given the informal ambience (eg a $42 filet mignon can be a good value in certain settings-- but not this one).   I ordered the \"Socialite\", and this cocktail tasted as if made of half vinegar. (I do love vinegar but not as a cocktail: this concoction was undrinkable. Another case of trying too hard.  Did I mention the place smells like a college bar? It reeked of spilled beer even though the place was quite clean.  Maybe it's just us. Clearly we are in the minority, so give it a whirl and see what you think."}
{"text":"so good, double date night 4 of us we ordered few different things and everything was amazing!"}
{"text":"Stopped over on a Saturday night - was told there was a 2hr wait. All the while there was an empty table that they gave to a couple with no reservations because the hostess knew them.  Very not cool!  Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"This place is  somewhere in between casual and fine dining.  The food is definitely Fine dining Caliber and the atmosphere very relax and definitely not stuffy.  Had. pork belly pastrami. (A1). Scallops were on point and the desert was great.  Definitely coming back without others"}
{"text":"4.99 stars. When a restaurant screws up something it either completely ruins a meal, or presents an opportunity for the restaurant to redeem itself and make the whole experience better. CPH did the latter. Tonight's example was the entree. Simply the worst piece of Ahi Tuna I have ever seen. It was prepared perfectly, but the filet itself was pretty much one piece of connective tissue. Whomever was cooking it should have rejected it and not served it up in the first place. Our waiter gasped when I showed him. He knew it. The whole inside was a white inedible chunk. I couldn't get my knife through it. Furthermore, I hate being that guy to send something back. I've eaten many a grizzly piece of whatever because I feel uncomfortable being that guy. But in this case it was totally warranted. In less than 5 minutes I had it replaced with the scallops entree (which was fantastic), and was also comped another beer, and dessert. As for the rest of the meal I had the Grilled Octopus appetizer with the spicy watermelon gazpacho. It was exceptional. 10 out of 10. A truly memorable dish. In a town with a lot of great octopus appetizers (Virtu, Sassi), this was creative and delicious. A can't miss. My wife had the famous chopped salad, which she said was great as well. She had the tuna crudo for an appetizer and it was also delicious. Service 5/5 Food 4.9/5 Despite the error with the ahi tuna Citizen Public House is becoming one of our favorite restaurants and we'll be back again and again."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! If you come, you must order the special OMFG salad (see video clip). This is undoubtedly one of the best salads I have ever had, and they mix all of the fresh ingredients right in front of your eyes! Each of us ordered something different for our main courses, and nobody was disappointed. I especially recommend the french fries. For dessert, the French toast bread pudding was to die for! The strawberry rhubarb sauce and buttermilk ice cream put it over-the-top.   The atmosphere is pretty swanky yet warm and inviting. Dress code is what you make of it; one could easily fit in with cocktail or dressier attire, however we wore jeans and T-shirts. A great place to have an intimate date or a family celebration. The background music was low, however due to the crowd of excited diners, it did get a little noisy. Who needs to talk when the food is this good though, right?!"}
{"text":"Great location!  The staff was amazingly pleasant!  The drinks were fabulous.  The most original drink menu I've ever seen. And the food was outstanding.  I'm a vegetarian & our server 'Sam' offered me an off the menu vegetarian dish that was incredible!.  I would highly recommend this restaurant for the overall service, food & way cool atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great service and flavorful food and great mixed drinks. The service was great and the pork shank was so flavorful. Great restaurant!"}
{"text":"The food is generally really good here, but the superstar is the chopped salad.   I can't believe the best chopped salad I've ever had would be in Scottsdale, although I don't generally go around hunting for chopped salads.   I always make a point to stop by whenever I'm in town."}
{"text":"Trendy, casual, and warm sets the scene for perhaps one of the most unique and flavorful dining experiences I have had in recent memory. Easily the most well deserved 5 star rating I have given out in 2015.  Save yourself the trouble of looking at the menu! Look to your skilled servers for advice and direction. Our server Sam was the sever that every restaurateur wishes they had. Polite, quick, and devoted to the menu. Sam directed us immediately to The Original Chopped Salad, a recommendation from a local friend sent us to the Bernie's Mac 'N Cheese - neither of which left me underwhelmed or with an empty stomach. To boot we finished off with the Heat of Caramel to drive home a winning experience.  The Original Chopped Salad: Everything you think you know about salad just died. This salad packs a seductive and savory experience that is nothing like any salad you have ever experienced. Select the smoked salmon and each bite will erupt in your mouth with sweet, tart, and smokey delectably unique taste. Deconstructed and prepared at your table this event is a must.  Bernie's Mac 'N Cheese: This is the type of Mac 'N Cheese your Mom would have made if she didn't suck at making Mac. Slathered in rich gorgonzola cheese topped with heaps of sweet grilled tomatoes, this is not like anything you have spooned into you gullet in the past year.   In short, you must go here be call yourself a truly enlightened foodie. Oh and by the way, dinner for two for a mere $40 including tip - I walked away stuffed, pleased, and eager for more. Bravo!  Back for a second night - I walk away pleased again! Encore!!"}
{"text":"I couldn't find the location or where to place this but a small group of foodies and booze hounds just checked out the speak easy called R and D.  Maybe its not the best place to put something this good online but if you have a chance to check out the hush hush fight club type drinking lounge with 10 rules outside of Citizen Public, I highly advise.  It is simply MIND BLOWING!!!  We had an amazing time tasting all the concoctions and if you're looking for something amazing Blood and Sand and The Monk.  The mixologists (dare to call them Bartenders haha) explained history and components of each of the drinks which was great and also gave some reccomendations based on the palate of the group.  Tony was also super attentive and made sure that not only our group but everyone present was well taken care of.  Outstanding service, amazing drinks and if I had to suggest something semi-laser pointer mind shattering AWESOME try the key lime pie desert.  Balanced and great clean up for a potent cocktail."}
{"text":"Went to Citizen for my 4th time and was very impressed. This place has an excellent ambience, good service, and very good drinks and wine. I've had the scallops, meatloaf, short ribs, and chopped salad. Each were amazing and perfectly prepared. This place does not disappoint"}
{"text":"I don't get it. Was so excited to eat here because of all of the rave reviews but I just flat out don't get it. The service was great but the food was pretty meh. The chopped salad, as I was eating it, the whole time I was comparing it to the SAME EXACT salad which is served at Cowboy Ciao practically across the street. I have to admit, Cowboy Ciao wins. The tomato in citizen's salad was not fresh, and the salad had a strange texture because I really think they just skimped on the freshness of the ingredients. Aside from that though, why are you serving the same exact thing as a neighboring restaurant and trying to call it your signature dish???!!! One of you has to figure it out and take it off the menu, that's the most ridiculous thing ever. Citizen's tasted fine, but Cowboy Ciao would win on this one.  We ordered the pork belly pastrami also at yelp's recommendation and were not fans. it tasted like old coffee, it was really strange texture again and just not that great.   The positives- Scallops were a delicious dish and the pudding jar is amaaaaazing dessert. I wanted to lick the jar of that pudding dish, it was so yummy.   Basically my experience was just so so, would I recommend it if someone were to ask me where they should eat in old town? No, would I go out of my way to go there again? No, but was it a decent experience? Sure"}
{"text":"Loved the indoor/outdoor space & appreciated them accommodating our group of 6 with no reservation.  Popcorn with sizzling bacon was incredible. We had to order 2 bowls and I think I ate 1 almost entirely by myself. Meatloaf & my beautifully arranged chop salad were also amazing."}
{"text":"We came here on the Saturday before Valentine's day and definitely treated ourselves. The menu is definitely on the higher price end, but it is so worth it. It was happy hour when we arrived, and ordering appetizers off the bar food menu was awesome. We had the rosemary roasted nuts and the hummus and pita. Both were awesome, and very cheap because of the happy hour.  My wife ordered the duck burger, which had probably the best fries I have ever had. It makes me want to eat duck fat fries every night with my dinner! I had the short ribs, which were great as well. The cherry sauce was a little too sweet for me, but the rest was perfect.  I have a dairy allergy, which can make eating out difficult, or limit what I can eat at time, but our waiter was super helpful and understanding, and worked with the kitchen to ensure I had a full, amazing meal, which was very appreciated.  The one downside was the noise level. We originally got to the restaurant early enough so it wasn't an issue, but around the time we left it was quite loud and had to talk loudly to hear each other."}
{"text":"This place was so good when we went on a Thursday night that we returned Sunday evening.  The servers were all personable and described the menu precisely.  Then again bacon popcorn doesn't require much more describing.  It was fabulous.  We ordered many plates and shared them among the 6 of us.  Everything was delicious but the short ribs and pork belly pastrami were top of the list.  The portions are big enough to share and the salads are outstanding vegetarian options.  Do not miss this gem"}
{"text":"Beercheese fondue, what more can really be said?   Came here on a Saturday night, had to make reservations late because the place apparently gets packed.   Had an amazing time with friends.  Service was helpful, competent and attentive.   Such a great range of menu items with unique ingredients.   And of course, cheeeese fondue, my favorite food!    I am not surpised the place fills up quick,  MAKE reservations, okay?"}
{"text":"The cocktails are great and so is the chopped salad. That's it. Had two entrees and an app and they were just ok. Waiter was so sweet but honestly I cannot believe how many people don't have good taste and gave this place 5 stars. Next time I go, I will sit at bar, have some drinks and a chopped salad and be done."}
{"text":"I snuck in here with my co-pilot early for Happy Hour. Sat on the patio, Had THE MOST attentive and witty waiter who made good suggestions and explained some menu items. We did the olives and barrata to start. Barrata is a cheese dish. Like Italian Caprese salad on steroids. I had the short ribs, AWESOME. My cohort had the scallops. Wine list is great, beer selection was great. Never waited with an empty glass (IMPORTANT!!!) Also fun was watching people check  out our food as they wandered down after their Old Town shopping spree. Would definitely go back, probably to show my out of town visitors that AZ has some class!  PS  Try the PB&J in a jar for dessert!"}
{"text":"Good drink menu and good neighborhood place but not a destination restaurant be any means.  We enjoyed the food, especially the halibut.  It's tucked into a side street and is easy to miss.  It would be hard for me to go here instead of FnB since they are so close togeather."}
{"text":"Loved this place!  Service was great: friendly and quick. The food was delicious and artfully arranged. Ambiance was trendy.  The food is a little expensive for a casual night out, and I would not recommend coming here if you want a quiet, intimate date. But otherwise had a great time and will return."}
{"text":"Do what you do and stop trying to be gimmicky/cute.  That's the only advice I'd have for CPH.  They certainly don't need any advice on decor, food preparation, or service because all were stellar. The wine list and beer selections were very good and the menu itself is drool-inducing.  Here is what I mean though...it's called a \"Public House\" but it's a very sleek and upscale restaurant. It's not a pub and I get that but that sort of \"we're being cool\" irony bleeds over into the menu, the food, and the experience.    Another example, happy hour isn't happy hour, it's \"Social.\". Yeah, ok.  Awesome.   Furthermore each item we sampled included some sort of out of the ordinary ingredient that seemingly didn't belong. This worked terrifically well on the chopped salad.  This dish was just a unique medley I would have never thought to mix.  However the odd ingredient technique fell flat with the pork (fruit??) that was otherwise a terrific dish.  It also didn't work with the bread pudding (bacon).  Now, I know what you're saying, \"bacon is never a bad idea.\"  While that is usually accurate it was completely unnecessay in this dessert and actually disrupted the flavors.  Strip out those mediocre additions and those dishes would have been perfect.   Overall, while gimmicky the food is executed professionally and if in Scottsdale you won't go wrong here.  Maybe one day I'll come back to \"Citizens\" for \"happy hour\"...that'd probably be a 5-star review!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for a pre dinner cocktail... great experience. The cocktails were fresh and interesting (e.g. Thai Margarita and a homemade Vodka blend).  Staff were friendly and helpful, inclduing giving us some great Scottsdale recommendations. Food looked good and will try next time"}
{"text":"Yep...everyone else is right. The Chopped Salad is something else. Do it!!! Great service at the bar...amazing house smoked Tasso Ham...and that salad?! Crazy good."}
{"text":"Delicious.  The grilled cheese with mashed potatoes and bacon was wonderful.  Also was pleasantly surprised at the bacon popcorn.  It made me realize I have been eating popcorn wrong for years; all popcorn should have bacon.  Atmosphere and service were also wonderful.  Go for happy hour as they have some great deals on their food and drinks."}
{"text":"We stumbled on Citizen Public House and happy, happy us! The men had the best meatloaf they've had in ages, and friend and I split both the Filet Mignon Tacos with fries (excellent) and the OMFG salad--raves don't even do it justice--fresh, textured from smoked salmon to freeze dried corn, couscous and YUM."}
{"text":"Trendy restaurant with high end bar in old town Scottsdale. All staff were top notch and perfectionists in ensuring glassware and silverware were perfectly clean and polished and that patrons were tended to properly. Received swift attention and service. Food was good-had the beet and frisée salad and the hummus app. Both were delish. My favorite was the beet salad which had a great mix of savory and sweet flavors. Drink list was impressive. The professional service is what sealed the deal for me."}
{"text":"Wow.  I was so impressed with this place!  Came here for a date night and it delivered.  The atmosphere was romantic and the service impeccable.  Our server let us sample some barrel cocktails, which was helpful because they were strong and I didn't end up buying a drink I wouldn't have been able to drink.  They give you free bread.  Not a big deal you say?  Maybe not, but I've been to a lot of nice restaurants that make you starve while waiting for your food, so it is nice when a place doesn't nickel and dime you into starvation.  Am I right?  So we had the fondue for an appetizer and some happy hour cocktails. If you like Swiss cheese, you'd dig the fondue, otherwise maybe choose something else.  The Cherry tart pinot noir is fab IMHO.  So I bit the bullet and ordered the chopped salad.  OMG.... nosh-a-licious!  It was really, really good.  The mixture of textures and flavors was so satisfying and, I'm not going to lie, I don't get all that jazzed up over salads usually.  My husband had the special - the fillet burger - and I'm pretty sure his eyes rolled into the back of his head in delight.  I believe the exact quote was, \"This is the best burger I've ever had\".  I have seen how many burgers this man has eaten, and trust me, that is high praise.  Service - five stars!  Food - five stars!  Drinks - Five again.  Would come back here happily."}
{"text":"As good as the others said.  Incredible short rib tacos. ..melted in my mouth.  The duck burger was mouth watering.  I don't even like duck, and this was delicious.  Outstanding service at the bar...thanks,  Mike! Will definitely be sending others this way!"}
{"text":"We were in Old Town and hungry on a summer afternoon, and went in on a whim.  Well not a whim, as the Yelp reviews were good and the posted menu looked awesome.  We had the highly rated items, which were also put forth by our server:  Chopped Salad, pork belly, and the sushi-grade scallops.  Yes the salad was good, but it's a salad.  It won't bring world peace.  However, the pork belly and scallop preps that day WILL change the world.  For the better.  These are hands-down the best scallops I have had in a long time.  And I am a snob ;).  Service was efficient and friendly.  I could see the crowd being annoying (for my taste) on a busy night, but the food is seriously good and the setting is comfortable.  I will be back for another afternoon snack."}
{"text":"This place was fantastic! Great service at the bar! Bartender was attentive and made a delicious sazerac cocktail! The popcorn with bacon hurt my feelings so bad I may go back again tonight because I can't stop thinking about it! For dinner I had the short ribs and they were really good too! Pulled apart perfectly and the bbq sauce combined with the mash potatoes and greens were on point! Definitely recommend checking this place out! I will be back again!"}
{"text":"Definitely happy I've finally made it to CPH. Cons: parking kinda sucks...take a uber if you can.  Pros: the vibe was cool.... Not a stuffy cloth napkins kinda steakhouse. I had the filet mignon it was cooked perfectly the mushrooms were so good.  The chopped salad was the best salad ever! The cocktails were also very good.  This isn't a overly pricy spot the prices were legit for the service, ambience and food. I'll definitely be back again and again."}
{"text":"Paul was our server and he was fantastic. He took great care of us & made great food recommendations. Really made us feel special. The food was fresh, creative & delicious. Cocktails were wonderful & dessert was dream worthy. So glad we came here for our date night."}
{"text":"Citizen Public House truly epitomizes modernist cuisine.  For example the pork belly is prepared as a pastrami, the entire preparation from before its even cooked, the spaetzle resembled french friends and even includes brussels sprout sauerkraut.  Some of the cocktails such as the Im-Port, featuring leather and tobacco bitters, sound really strange but when combined with the other components just work.  This a truly first class dining destination and one of the few places I've been to in Arizona I could see working in east coast cities such at Philly, NYC and Boston."}
{"text":"The staff (meaning the front of the house, the bartenders, and the waitstaff) was attentive and enthusiastic without being annoying. Here's what we shared as a group and the winners overall (*): - The Original Chopped Salad* - Grilled Octopus* - Noble Bread - Crab Cakes* - Scallops entree* - Beef short ribs entree - Pork porterhouse entree (off menu) Again, the staff was great, but we'd only go back for the *'s."}
{"text":"Love this place!  The original chopped salad is as good as it gets!  Must start with pretzels and fondue cheese too!"}
{"text":"Citizen Public House of course! Long known among locals for it's great blend of ambiance, great drinks and adventurous appetizers it's no wonder this was on our list of places to recommend.  Happy Hour has some unusual items on the menu, this is when I should warn you that your typical menu. Many of the appetizers come served in bell jars and are meant to be shared and explored. Looking for more standard fare, don't worry, all the regular appetizers are  1/2 off during Happy Hour as well and you can still find some signature items here to try also.  May we suggest the Tender Belly Bacon Fat Heirloom Popcorn? Once again remember that all regular appetizers are half off during Happy Hour. Dig yourself some comfort food? How about Chicken and Waffles? Buttermilk-marinated fried chicken on oat waffles covered in almond butter and blue clover honey. Another must try item on the menu is the Kiltlifter Fondue. It is served with bread, sausage and apple slices for dipping with those cute little forks. Yeah what's not to love about a great fondue?  Read the entire review here... http://schmoozeaz.com/blog/?p=652"}
{"text":"It can get a little noisy, but the food is exceptional - the service is excellent as is the wine on offer. The scallops were excellent as were all the meals for our little group - - well worth a visit."}
{"text":"Great night hangout spot to watch sports, have a drink with friends or just chill on a date.food was very good! The Blazin buffalo chips were amazing! Very spicy but not over the top. And I had the Chopped Cobb salad and would definitely order and visit again! 5-stars for sure! Very friendly and easy on the eyes service!! ;)"}
{"text":"Not that I need to repeat this after seeing all of the other reviews, but holy cow the chopped salad is amazing! I was skeptical that a salad would be worth talking about, but it really blew us away. The short ribs were also fantastic, and they have a great social hour with discounted drinks and appetizers. My friend had the smart chicken, and while the chicken itself was nothing special, the side dishes were great! The staff were all great. I definitely recommend checking this place out!"}
{"text":"Every weekend my friends and I hit up citizen public house after we work on restoring my friends airstream... I love their happy hour - everything has been amazing (minus their ramen, it's spicy but is missing any flavor profile) and I always have to get their original chopped salad with double salmon! Their barrel aged cocktails are delicious as well."}
{"text":"The chop salad was amazing.  We will definitely go back for that.  Service was good; server was funny and knowledgeable.  Was a bit loud to have conversations."}
{"text":"As mentioned in almost every other review, they nailed it. Took my fiancé out for a nice Monday dinner in old town and wound up here. Harrison greeted us and made easy conversation as he walked us to our table. Cool guy. AJ was out server and was pretty busy. He was back and forth at his tables spending a little time at each one and keeping his head on a swivel. Having been in the industry for years I'm a little critical.  Fondue: great Came with some bread, little sausage links and apples. Bomb! Filet is laid over mashed potatoes. Bomb! Lady had the chopped salad that everyone raves about. According to her...bomb. The only thing that outdid the food was the service. Shoutout to AJ and Harrison. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Located in downtown Scottsdale, Citizen Public House serves classy gastropub food.  The server I had was great and even offered a kitchen tour while we were waiting for our food. This place is awesome."}
{"text":"What an amazing place, crowd was amazing, the service is amazing and the food was absolutely amazing.  Citizens, has amazing food. The pork shank was amazing, and the short rib was amazing and amazingly rich too.   When we got there it was so crowded we didn't think we get in, however they were happily able to assist us in seat us right away. Our Puerto Rican server was a blast. She had a big personality. I'll bet if they took some of her abuela's recipes they'd be in seventh heaven. Actually no, as there food is wonderful.   It should be noted, there was a patron who got out of control with his drinking & the bartender asked him to leave, the staff handled this jerk professional and quickly.   Love this place!"}
{"text":"One of my absolute favorite places in Scottsdale.  I bring guests here all the time.  The first time I ate here was about 2 years ago during Restaurant Week and I wasn't all that impressed.  I'm glad I gave it another shot because every time I've come back I have loved it more and more.  My personal recommendations are the Pork Belly Pastrami, The Original Chopped Salad (yes it's just like Cowboy Ciao, but it's still really friggen good), and the Beef Belly BLT (oh my gosh is this good...everyone at my table wished they had ordered this after they tried it).  Recommendations based on friends/family's experiences: Bernie's Mac 'N' Cheese,  Fair Trade Short Ribs, and the Pan Seared Scallops.  Also, a good tip if come during busy season (spring training) and can't get a reservation until late: come at 7pm when the \"secret\" upstairs speakeasy opens, and call to get on the list up there.  The drinks are AMAZING and they serve the full CPH menu."}
{"text":"Abridged: Chopped Salad. Superb drinks. Sparse decor.  Unabridged: I was excited for the chance to finally hit Citizen Public House. I know I know. But if you want to up my chances of going anywhere in Scottsdale, make them available during lunch hours.   At first glance I was only somewhat impressed. The decor and feel was very empty and sparse. Almost as if it had no vibe, but I'd heard great things about the food and beverage selection, and the hostess gave me props on my Pliny the Elder shirt (hopefully she wasn't making fun of me), so I was anxious to see what else was in store.  It was a Saturday night around 7, and apparently the place was booked until 9, though it looked really empty, and we were promised it would liven up soon as we sat at the bar.  The bacon fat popcorn quickly started to make up for the concerns I had. The whiskey concoction I had started to as well, until I realized they did have 12 and 18 year Jameson reserve but told me they didn't when I asked if my drink could be made with that.  The recommendation to have the Chopped Salad pretty much was the most amazing thing ever. It changed my life. It is my quest now to recreate this masterpiece in my home. I cried when I finished. I didn't want it to end, and I typically don't even like arugula!!  So the day wasn't a bust and I definitely will head back again. The company I surround myself with makes up for sparse decor and now I know better than to believe they don't have Jameson reserve.  Maybe it was my fault for dressing in bright colors and my weird style. I was also the only redhead :)"}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoyed my first visit here. The food was ok, but the drinks made the night and so did our personable and skilled bartender who did an awesome job in serving, teaching, and entertaining us while our party of 3 sat at the bar waiting for our table.    DRINKS: -I ordered the Persian -My friend ordered the  Citi-zen -Her friend ordered the Moscow Mule, which by the way came served to her in a copper mug and a pickle:  the LEGIT WAY to serve any Moscow Mule (shout out to our bartender who informed us of this interesting fact).    My friend's drink was served to her in a martini glass. However, she asked our bartender to pour her drink into an old fashioned glass since she was a klutz when it came to drinking from martini glasses. He willingly obliged but also joked around with the rest of us and asked what drinks we wanted AND what glassware we preferred our drinks in lmao. Needless to say he made our drinks really well and really strong: our drinks were the perfect combination of preserving the integrity of the various flavors while packing a strong punch.  When our table was called we sadly parted ways and what's worse, I completely forgot to ask his name -_-  The rest of my experience here was ok. We were seated in the little room off of the main dining room. I would've preferred to eat at the bar then eat in this small area because it felt closed off from the rest of the restaurant.    FOOD: -I ordered the grilled halloumi cheese sandwich -my friend ordered the kale salad -her friend ordered the \"original chopped salad' which apparently has its own Facebook page (click on the FB link located in the online menu on Citizen Public's website).   My grilled halloumi cheese sandwich was definitely a frou frou version of the classic dish, it was good but it was a bit disappointing only because I didn't know  this type of cheese doesn't melt and I was totally in the mood for some cheesy cheesiness. My least favorite part of my dish was the bread, it was just too thick tough to chew. My friend's kale salad was a complete bust. The kale was completely raw which was ok expect it was hardly dressed so alot of the bitterness was still there. It was also hardly chopped so there were large pieces of raw and bitter kale to eat. The \"original chopped salad; was the best dish out of everyone's. Each ingredient used is arranged in neat rows and presented to you on a plate.  The server then pours the dressing to your liking and proceeds to mix all the colorful ingredients and then serves it to you.   I'd definitely come back just to sit at the bar and try some more of their interesting cocktails; chit chat with the super awesome bartender who assisted us during my 1st visit here; and possibly try another food dish or stick to the chopped salad."}
{"text":"Outstanding, lived up to what I've heard. Staff is extremely passionate and knowledgeable about the cuisine and beverage list. Atmosphere can look fancy, but it's not stuffy at all.   -The Original Chopped Salad is fantastic. I don't entirely agree with the dehydrated corn vs. fresh corn choice, but the dressing has basil in it and completely makes the dish. You get a ton of salad too. -Crab cake appetizer is good, but underwhelming. Next time I'll get the pork belly pastrami like our server recommended, or the butternut squash gnocchi. -My friend got the duck with cranberry compote, looked pretty damn good. -Tulip-git-to-quit drink was meh. Next time, sangria. -Pb&b pudding dessert is NECESSARY. Did I taste house-made whipped cream?"}
{"text":"Our son gave us a gift card for my birthday after researching on Yelp!, and the card was waiting for us on arrival.  Located in beautiful Old Scottsdale, this wonderful gastropub is beautiful and trendy, and the food is to die for!  Our server Chris was amazing and recommended the Chainbreaker brew on draft since the Four Peaks Hef was no longer available, and it was delish and we both had two.  We started out with the bacon-fat heirloom popcorn, which my wife didn't care for, but I loved.  Hey, I'm a guy and there was crumbles of warm bacon all through it.  Then we both split their famous chopped salad, which Chris brought to the table unchopped and chopped right before our eyes.  Honestly, I got cold chills with the first bite!  Hands down one of the best tastes ever in a salad, with salmon, tomato, arugula, couscous, etc. (recipe on Facebook,) and delicious homemade Buttermilk ranch dressing--perfection, and we could have eaten a whole one but wanted to save room for more delights to come.  Chris recommended the scallops, which I had already had my eye on, so my wife ordered the buttermilk roasted chicken, served over sweet corn-butter succotash with roasted Brussels sprouts.  Moist and delicious!  My scallops were wrapped in Tender Belly Hampshire bacon, nestled in a bed of roasted corn grits and topped with wilted snow pea greens (yum!) and drizzled with a cola gastrique.  Tenderest and most tasty scallops ever.  By the end of the night manager Owen stopped by to visit--he had been staring at our names for over a month on his bulletin board and he wanted  to put a face with our names.  Chris joined us for the sit down and we had a wonderful conversation. Wanting to try the peanut butter bread pudding, Chris recommended the Guiness pudding jar instead, which was a stout infused chocolate pot de creme over a chocolate shortbread cookie, topped with Irish whiskey crema and two chocolate shortbread cookies on the side, and served in an actual small jar with lid. I threatened to take off Chris' hand when he reached to clear the plate with the remains of the last cookie still on it!  Overall, a perfect night with perfect food and service in a warm inviting atmosphere.  It does NOT get any better than this!  Thank you my son!"}
{"text":"Best cocktails and service in Scottsdale!!  I am never disappointed when I go to Citizen Public House.  The cocktails are unique and delicious (ask Thomas to make them for you, he's amazing), and the service is impeccable.  For dinner ask to sit in Sam's section; he is by far one of the most knowledgeable, on-point servers I have ever had.  All of his recommendations have always been phenomenal and he has a cadence about him that makes you feel like he is enjoying the dining experience as much as you are.  Food standouts: Chopped Salad; Scallops; and the Tenderloin Wrap Drink standout: Manhattan; trust me on this one, it's out of this world."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend on Tuesday night, sat at the bar. Ordered his drink, ordered mine and the grilled octopus which was decent at best. Then mid conversation probably sat there for 25 minutes , bartender with a beard rudely asked if I could either pour my water in the glass or completely put it away. I said okay and he said to me :\"i just don't like water bottles at my bar top\". I get it, we're in old town alcohol can be disguised but to completely asked me rudely is just unacceptable. Disappointing"}
{"text":"Everything about this place was awesome! Love the cocktails; especially the sangria...the best we've ever had. Order the piggy and waffles and loved it. It was an interesting combination that was fun to try.  Loved the atmosphere..very fun upscale restaurant full of beautiful people."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in old town. The cocktails are great. Wine list is exceptional and the food is fabulous. My favorite is the scallops and the chop salad. Gary is my favorite waiter. He is friendly,informative and always makes our dining experience a pleasure"}
{"text":"AMAZING FOOD!!!!  Pretty much anything you order on the menu is AMAZING!  Some of the best stuff that we all tried at our table was the Bacon-Fat popcorn, short ribs, meatloaf, the Original Chop Salad and the Ruben appetizer.  For all you Gluten-Free people out there too, there are a TON of options on the menu and they are called out, so it makes ordering easy.  Everyone in your group is sure to find something they'll love!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying we were pretty excited to try this place, especially since a few of us even had this bookmarked on yelp...   But damn this place is dissappointing.    A bunch of us are in town for Spring Training and tried to hit up Citizen Public House.  The place wasn't too packed... more open tables than filled tables.   We showed up at around 10:30 on Saturday night walked up to the hostess and told her we had a party of seven.  She confidently told us \"Sure, just a few moments\", looked us all up and down then walked away into the back.   A couple minutes later, she comes back and says \"Sorry, we can't seat 7 people right now.\"  ......  Seriously???  WTF?!?!?!  We asked about all the empty tables and she said we can't sit there.  I'm assuming they didn't want to seat us because we were slightly dressed down (even though attire shows 'casual') or because we weren't a group of the standard middle aged white dudes in button shirts, jeans and dress shoes.  whatever the case is, it came off as a kind of pompous place with a hostess (or manager) who looks down on people.  You guys missed out on a few hundred dollars plus a big tip from us.... not that you care though.  ***this review is soley based on service since we never got the chance to eat here***"}
{"text":"The service, the salad, the drinks . . . this is a yumtastic place (but would be even better if someone else is paying). Definitely worth a visit when you're in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Really good food. Appetizers were really good. Lots of good drink options. Atmosphere was really nice and the service was outstanding. Great area of Scottsdale to walk around also."}
{"text":"Came here with colleague for late dinner. This place had great yelp reviews so I was really looking forward to the experience.unfortunately it was not as good as I would have expected given the rating. Food was ok. Service was ok. Overall was not a five star experience and food quality, variety and service were good but for the price I just expected better."}
{"text":"An outstanding experience overall!   The quality of the meal was wonderful and we were impressed with the friendliness and personal experience from the staff.  Our waitress, Gina, provided a level of professionalism we don't experience nearly enough when dining out; additionally, both the owner and chef took the time to visit our table.   If you're looking for a warm, inviting dining experience with delicious, innovative comfort food, this is the place."}
{"text":"What a fantastic dinner celebrating a 50th birthday for one member of the dining party. Our server, Gary, and food runner, Patrick, both had the right balance of friendliness and professionalism.  Their service was top notch. The food was excellent: chopped salad, beet salad, bread with marrow butter were tasty starters which we all shared. Two people had the short rib entree and one had the seared tuna. Delicious. For dessert we shared the peanut butter and banana push pop and the cherry pecan bread pudding. Both great ways to end the meal. Add to the above some well crafted cocktails and we were extremely happy. A great dining experience."}
{"text":"Coulda been a 4 star rating but the excellent customer service makes CPH a 5-star in my book.  Once we were seated our waiter Matt greeted us and made us feel welcome. His easy going demeanor and sense of humor make CPH look good and he could teach lessons to some waiters I've known.   CPH makes their own barrel cocktails aged and flavored right in the restaurant. We were undecided on which to try ($5 each during happy hour, usually $12) so Matt brought us a sample of each. All were interesting and unique and we ended up ordering the Negroni, the Pyrat Eye the Craftsman along with an appetizer of rosemary nuts and green olives. Great way to start a meal!  Our dishes included the Seared Scallops (heaven on a plate), the Fried Bologna Sandwich (delicious mortadella and pistachios) and the Grilled Lamb Loin (perfectly cooked and seasoned). Dinner cocktails included the Citi-Zen, a pear vodka concoction topped with rock candy; the Hot Pink Paloma, a paloma with a light, zesty pepper taste; and a Persian, made with wild tea vodka and cucumber...super refreshing!  Finished dinner with Irish Coffee and a take home bag of bacon brittle.   While dining we noticed two employees putting two tables together for a party and actually taking the time to adjust the lighting so as to make sure none of the ceiling lights would be in any of the incoming diners eyes. Impressive and caring enough to make sure all the details were right."}
{"text":"Rich the magic man masterfully mixing the most mesmerizing manhattans, mai-tais, and mystical momentos of what will be a good evening for any manner of person.  I can only say that I only viewed the barrage of creativity displayed by all the mixologists on hand to stimulate our curiousity and to address our needs.  This place is not only offering an atmosphere that is warmed by its staff, it is offering a place that you can be guaranteed will appeal to all types of people because it is fantastically delicious! The menu is thoughtful.  No item seems misplaced and all is prepared matching seasonings with meats and veggies that are not always naturally paired.  I love the lamb meatballs with tzatziki sauce.  And who does ribs in a deep fried cherry BBQ sauce?  Where can you find a succulent lamb burger?  I mean these guys are even making their own ketchup.  You have to try the bread pudding too...don't play... it comes fondue style!    When I feel comfortable about the potential of a place to accommodate my discerning appetite, I usually ask about Cinzano and Campari.  I have often been disappointed, needless to say, by the absence of one or the other.  Rich actually one upped me.  He offered alternatively Compano Antica sweet vermouth.  I have never smelled such a great scent on a vermouth.  Wow.  I love it that we could speak the same language!  If you are looking for a traditional public house where you see the gang everyday after work, I think you'll be disappointed.  It is more of a special place to slip away with a new date, or a bunch of new friends, or to show off your town to loved ones visiting. It is special enough to add just the right flavour to Fifth Ave.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Bacon popcorn. That's all I'm gonna say.  Thay have bacon popcorn. They also have bacon toffee.  What's not to love? There, that's all you need to know.  Actually there is much more offered than bacon fare.  Yes, the Chopped Salad is as fantastic as all the reviews. Yes, it is possible to get excited about a salad. NO, really.  Now is that salad good for you?  Not at all.  Hence, the over the top reviews.   Any time I\"ve been there I\"ve had a great experience. Whether at the bar or at a table, this is a nice place with great food and drinks.    Happy hour from 3-6!  Score!"}
{"text":"We went a year ago and loved it. This time it was awful. Short ribs were dry and full of gristle. The greens were tough and bitter. The scallops were gritty. The noise level was so loud we couldn't talk to each other without saying \"what?\"  A really bad experience. I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Can't rave anymore about the Chopped Salad!! Literally the best!! We generally come in late night and sit at the bar. Always friendly helpful service and great drinks!"}
{"text":"Great food and well crafted drinks. Unfortunately a little pricy for the amount but can be a fun date location."}
{"text":"I have been this restaurant many times and have never had a bad experience. Great food, drinks, atmosphere and service. One of my favorite places in the area! Keep up the great work! I would give a 10 out of 5 if I could! You can tell the people that work here really care about what they do. The service is always excellent and the food is consistently awesome in every way."}
{"text":"Two words: CHOPPED. SALAD. I think I've found my soulmate. It is so full of flavor, absolutely amazing!  I went with a handful of co-workers and we all ordered a bunch of things and passed them around. No one was overly thrilled with the Duck Burger, but it wasn't bad. We loved the meatloaf and the short ribs!! The fondue was also an excellent starter!  I also have to mention that the service was great as well. Our server was very helpful when we were indecisive, he provided great recommendations.  I got one of the cakes on special for dessert and it was AMAZING! It was called the Fruity Pebbles cake - dense layered cake with a light lemon ice cream and topped with fruity pebbles. I was in heaven! I wish they had it all the time!  Loved this place, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Be careful with this place.....took friends out for dinner and they added on an extra filet mignon meal....yes their most expensive item on their menu!!  We almost paid it but caught it last minute and when we bring it to the waiters attention he is NOT apologetic AT ALL.....just brings the bill back adjusted and doesn't even apologize!!  Food was good but that experience did not make it worth it...."}
{"text":"Went here with the family... Service was helpful and extra friendly- they went above and beyond to accommodate my little girl. The food was amazing! Recommend the meatloaf, the seared tuna and the chopped salad (often imitated by other Scottsdale restaurants but never duplicated) This place was by far the best restaurant we visited during our vacation."}
{"text":"Mostly everything was great! Great service and our main dishes were great. We had the truffle grilled cheese and trout with quinoa So good! Only giving them four stars because our fondue appetizer was super watery :( Our meat and cheese plate was much better."}
{"text":"Cobb Salad was pretty good and unique. Worth it for sure.  The filet and the scallops was also very good and recommended.  Unfortunately, the service had a lot to be desired.  We ordered drinks that never came, waters weren't refilled and although the staff was pleasant, they were not dialed in.  It was Saturday, I would return, but on a slower night."}
{"text":"Great food, creative drinks, good service.  Kale Caesar is awesome, meatloaf is awesome, plus ask about R&D while there...its the secret bar upstairs, insanely cool stuff. Will come back for more."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate there for dinner July 10.  We had 3 appetizers: (1) pork belly- magnificent, (2) crab cakes- exc, and (3) lamb belly- nice sauce but far too fatty.  Our entree was short ribs- a generous portion but nothing special in terms of flavor.  These 4 dishes and a drink each came to $99 w/ tip.  For that price, I expect consistently excellent to superior for every dish."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to Citizen Public house. Everything we had was superb. The quality of the food was amazing. The service is top notch, everyone walked with a fast pace and were very Pleasent. We have found our new favorite place in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I really want to give it five stars, but to be honest this place just didn't \"knock my socks off\".  Don't get me wrong, the food was pretty great, the service was good and the drink menu was awesome and unique.  I had the Lamburger which is basically a Gyro on a bun but kind of deconstructed.  It was very juicy and flavorful but I probably should have ordered it mid-well instead of medium as I freak myself out over undercooked ground meat.  My fault though, not the restaurants.  Definitely worth a try.  Give it a go!"}
{"text":"Loved this place. The pork belly pastrami starter was phenomenal. We had the seared scallops and the filet mignon tacos. They were both great. Staff was friendly and helpful. Decent by the glass wine list, and they make a great Manhattan! Will be back!! The only reason I gave 4 stars was because of the noise level....would give 4 1/2 if I could!!"}
{"text":"You have to try this place to appreciate it.  At a glance, the menu seems a bit ho-hum considering the price, but that notion vanished as soon as our waiter, Tomas, started explaining the items to us.  Though very down-to-earth, he had a story-teller's gift for describing the food in a manner that brought out its complexity and our lust.  The chef demonstrated the same talent in execution.    The Korean pear salad is good, but you get to watch the preparation of the original chopped salad -- no ordinary thing.  The pork belly pastrami is rich beyond imagination.  Even the mac and cheese is yummy.  The pan-seared scallops sitting on a bed of grits may be the best dish there, but the smart chicken and short ribs are also hard to ignore.    The dessert menu almost tricked me also.  At first glance, nothing for chocolate lovers, but the Pot de Creme has a serious surprise on the bottom.  I'd also go back for the bread pudding.  The location and layout are convenient though not particularly memorable.  Though the patio is small the restaurant proper opens into it with some large doors to provide an outdoor feel."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best restaurants in Scottsdale.  Atmosphere is great, owners are uber nice, and the care they have for their restaurant shows in the food.  I love this place"}
{"text":"Citizen Public House is just one course away from 5-stars. It was sad really because it is that last dessert course, the final swan song of the meal, that I most remember and it was terrible (some of the most awful dessert I have ever had). On the upside the dessert did have a really tough act to follow; the cocktails were amazing, the appetizers scrumptious, the main course delicious, and the service excellent.  The hummus appetizer had some of the best hummus, pita, and pickles I have ever had. For the main course I had the Smart Chicken and for a chicken dish it was outstanding. Now they tell you that it comes with mushroom onion hash, but really it is just a saute served over the chicken which is perched atop a lovely corn risotto. It is the flavor that counts and that was out of this world. There is just nothing like a dish that presents such dimension of flavors and delights the palette. My co-diners were all equally pleased with their mains.  Sadly things took a serious downturn at dessert. We ordered the cookies and the strawberry pound cake. There were about 4 different cookies in a bag presented to us, they were not warmed, and honestly out of the four of us we couldn't find one of them we liked. We felt a place and bake cookie from the grocery store would have been better, *sorry* but I have to tell the truth. The pound cake was supposed to be an olive oil cake, which I have had many of in the past and so when I got this dry scone-like cake instead of something moist and perfectly rich I was greatly disappointed. Not to mention there wasn't one fresh or macerated strawberry on the plate, in fact those that were cooked into the cake were not even identifiable as a strawberry any longer.  Despite the sad ending to our meal, I would highly recommend you give this place a try, just skip dessert. They have only been open about a month and are doing a phenomenal job. I will definitely be headed back when in Scottsdale again."}
{"text":"Simple menu with tasty selections. You have to try the chop salad! It's the best salad I have ever had. Good atmosphere, great place to take a date because it is romantic. Its also is in the heart of old town Scottsdale which is convenient"}
{"text":"Went on a Monday and got a kick out of how it used to be the bar/club called Next a number of years ago.  The servers seemed a little too busy because I am sure they were understaffed for that evening.  The servers were happy and the busers/food runners were on top of there game.  It was nice to get a free chopped salad because we got a bottle of wine.  The chopped salad was amazing as always (cowboy ciao original) Since the weather has still been nice out, the patio was packed.  Unfortunately the draft beer lines were not cooled (I experienced this managing a bar....not fun) so no beer on draft was available.  Not a big deal having had the bottle of win.  For dinner we split the scallops and halibut which was fantastic....we should have maybe stayed for dessert but went to Yogurtland. LOL.  The price was right, ambiance was good, food was good, too"}
{"text":"Love this restaurant! Very relaxed and relatively quiet atmosphere. Great beers on tap and great bottle selection. Food is done really well and the bartenders are very friendly. I'll definitely continue eating here."}
{"text":"Came in here while in town visiting. The place is super cool looking when you walk inside.They have a few unique cocktails that I would recomend trying. We started w/the pita and hummus which was very tasty. I had the lamb burger which was very good- but my friend had the scallops- which were amazing! I would recommend getting the scallops."}
{"text":"What an AMAZING restaurant! My wife and I recently went here on our wedding anniversary. We had no idea what a great experience this would be. From the very beginning we noticed how consistently attentive and friendly the staff was. Over the top! Once we got to our patio table, we were greeted by our waiter, Sam. Sam had a way of talking and presenting the food we ordered that made everything feel like we were in for such an amazing treat... and he was right. We ordered the chopped salad to share. It was the best we've ever had! We were in the middle of trying to figure out how it was made (so we could try to make it) when Sam came back to see how we liked it. We told him what we were doing and he helped us! Then he said, \"Ill be right back with a surprise.\" When he returned he had a printed recipe card for the chopped salad which he gave to us. Who does that?! I could go on and on about the details for the rest of the evening, but they all played out just like it started... AMAZING. Thanks for the great food and great memories. Even though this is a 5 hour drive for us, Citizen Public House is one of the main reasons we will go back to Scottsdale. Soon!"}
{"text":"Mixed review-  Wine was very good. Service was okay. Nice atmosphere... a little bit on the dark side though... we sat at a high top near the bar and my friend had to use her phone to read the menu.... so I'd consider that slightly too dark to be comfortable.   On to the food- Bacon Popcorn, yes, absolutely, yes.  If I do return it will be solely for the bacon popcorn and drinks.   Short rib- don't do it. Whenever I see short ribs, I have to get them. This just did not meet expectations. The greens were gritty and the parsnips were much too sweet. All I ate on the plate was the meat, and for 25 (or 28?) dollars, I think the accompaniments should be good also. Meatloaf (friend had it)- excellent! Great meatloaf, mashed potatoes were yummy, and roasted zucchini was very good.    The dessert was not memorable- I remember we didn't finish it, but thats all I can remember (and it's only been 5 days!)   At the end of the day, there are better places in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Great ambience but wish they had more menu options.  Good place for happy hour as they have a huge selection of unique cocktails.  Try the Moscow Mule!"}
{"text":"Love this place- best steak in the valley, can't go without getting the Chopped Salad"}
{"text":"Citizen Public House is incredible. I got the scallops (of course). My husband and I came here for Restaurant Week because of the great deals -- they offered a three course meal for only $33/person (this included an appetizer, entree, and dessert). Yes, all gluten-free friendly! From the ambiance to the service to the cuisine, everything was supreme. I'm blown away at the qualify of food we received and the generous service we were given. Do yourself a favor the next time you are in Old Town Scottsdale, and eat here!! If you make it in the next 9 days, you can utilize the Restaurant Week deal!! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I went to CPH with my siblings on a Saturday night and we had a blast. I felt like we were actually in a restaurant in NYC. Tables are fairly close together and it was packed, but nothing overwhelming. The cocktails are fantastic and we each ordered a few to try and share. Every plate we ordered was delicious, except for the dessert. We ordered some flour less mint thing (I think?) which wasn't that great, but everything else made up for it.  Nice location-- right in Old Town, easy parking, and definitely a fun place to go if you're looking to splurge on a night out."}
{"text":"I had been anticipating a wonderful experience at this restaurant and finally went last weekend with my husband and another couple. Living in the area and traveling frequently, my husband and I eat out at fine restaurants all the time. So this review is based upon years of dining experience throughout our country... WE WOULD NOT RETURN!  The service was the only redeeming feature. The quality and food preparation was subpar and the portions were smaller than usual dinner servings. The appetizers were good but the dinner selections (we had 4 different) were just OK. We were hoping the desserts would be better. Our server recommended her 2 favorites but they were not worth the calories and we left half of each. The noise level was that of a Friday night bar happy hour - we could barely talk to our friends sitting across the table. Cowboy Ciao has the original menu because the chef started there and then moved to CPH. Skip Citizen Public House and go to Cowboy Ciao, especially if you are visiting and want a wonderful meal in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"The fact that a salad can actually differentiate itself so greatly from any other salad is amazing. They shouldn't call it a salad. Also I've had a few Manhattans and those are amazing as well. Can't wait to come back and try more of the menu."}
{"text":"I have thoroughly enjoyed this place since it's opening last year. My favorite places to go are ones that have a good bar -have some drinks, appetizers and good conversations with friends. This is a fav spot for my boyfriend and I, he loves his martini's with blue cheese olives (trust me, they are hard to find in restaurants). Our favorite appetizer is the Kilt Lifter fondue and you can't pass up their infamous chicken chopped salad. I've had everything on the menu at least twice and it is always consistent, never had a bad dish or bad time. You can even hop on their WiFi for some work with a cocktail."}
{"text":"I have never had a bad meal here....The chopped salad needs no hype from me. The Scallops are perfection...I love this place...."}
{"text":"THE BEST FOOD YOU WILL EVER HAVE IN YOUR LIFE SO GOOD!!!!!!! Melts in your mouth!!! You want to have a nice dinner date, this is forsure the place. Very romantic and the food is top notch. Everything is freaken amazing. And YES if you haven't heard by now, the OMFG SALAD is the most amazing salad you will ever have YOU HAVE TO TRY IT IM NOT KIDDING! It's famous. Waiters and waitresses always pleasant and nice. If I was rich I would always come here haha. Really high maintenance and expensive about a $100 meal , but it's really amazing."}
{"text":"Wow......totally disappointed! I have Ben a patron since I moved here a year ago...and raved about the chopped salad to my GF who flew in for Valentines weekend. I wanted to prepare a great meal and include a chopped salad and avoid the crowd. What I got was not very fresh ingredients and so little salmon that I didn't even serve it. I have never ordered to go....but this is not what I expected AT ALL!!!"}
{"text":"First off go to tenderbelly.com and order your \"Bacon, It's Good For Ya\" t-shirt. Then head over to CPH and order a properly made moscow mule and some bacon fat popcorn to get started.   I really have nothing but good things to say about this place. I have had the pork belly, the filet, the burger, gourmet grilled cheese, hummus, and a few more things. The temperature, portion size, flavors, and prices on everything have been spot on.   For those of you who are in to the current trend of supporting local and smaller business ventures, I found out that this place was started by a couple of local service industry guys along with Chef Bernie. Bernie uses tenderbelly pork and *Smart Chicken chicken. I googled both to find out why he chose these companies. The deserts are made by a local women and sold at the restaurant. They do change occasionaly.  Chef Bernie is also the creator of the famed \"Stetson Salad\" going by the name \"Original Chopped\" at CPH. Anyone who is from Scottsdale is probably aware of the popularity of this single item. So if you have friends visiting from out of town, or you are visiting yourself, this is a local fave.  I recently had a bartender friend tell me \"I'm so tired of hearing the term mixologist\". It may be overused, but this bar can probably get away with it. I am mainly a wine drinker, but they have a long list of really unique cocktails on the menu and I notice a few new ones added every few visits. Richie is one of those guys where you can say \"i had something that was like blah, blah, blah, but have no idea what was in it\" and he will probably figure out what you are talking about even when you aren't quite sure.   The last good thing I will say is liking CPH on FB is worth it. I notice many places that never seem to update anything. CPH is very good about keeping you in the loop about the daily special, deal, and new dishes."}
{"text":"Delicious creative dishes and high quality foods. Wonderful menu with great gluten free options. Staff was over the top knowledgeable, passionate about food, all exceedingly friendly and very helpful. A fantastic restaurant experience!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing.  The house sausage was awesome, the chopped salad was one of the best thing I ever ate.  We had scallops and pork and both dishes were yummy.  The chef brought out the bread pudding with bacon which was to die for. If we ever come back to Scottsdale, we'd defininitely come back.  Everyone was so nice and attentive."}
{"text":"Went back with a big group when in town. The food and service are still tops.  Barrel aged manhattan is a favorite.  Still recommended."}
{"text":"My husband and I get in a rut and tend to stay with the 4-5restaurants we like so I decided to finally try CPH after hearing so much about it. First, I love the vibe there. The open, bistro feel with a lively bar crowd-the noise level is high but not annoyingly so. We had cocktails, which they are famous for-not too sweet and complex. We decided to try 4 appetizers-the stand outs were definitely the pastrami pork belly and the chopped salad. Service is efficient and casual, just the way I like it. I can't wait to come back and try the lamb burger and some of the entrees."}
{"text":"Great experience!   I had a glass of wine, the hummus and flatbread appetizer, and olives for $13. I shared the apps with a group of 6 and there was plenty to go around.   I had the scallops for my entree. You get three scallops,  about half a cup of creamy grits, and sautéed greens on top for $28.   All of the food was delicious and great service as well!"}
{"text":"Came in with friends for cocktails.  Marian and I tried the Pyrat Eye for $5 each on the happy hour menu. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/citizen-public-house-scottsdale?select=qP8gnrbtP8N9BMaFlGh6vA#qP8gnrbtP8N9BMaFlGh6vA  Others had a Negroni HH special, a glass of pinot noir (half-off during HH), and Boulevardier (also $5 on HH).  I did not really like the dark rum cocktail.  The scent reminded me of rum and coke, which I never cared for when I tried it many, many years ago, and when I took a sip, did not get the satisfying cola taste at all, and instead came away tasting very bitter dark rum.  It certainly wasn't as unpalatable as I make it sound, since I did finish half of it.  I just wasn't a fan.  If you're all about getting drunk fast though, then this might be a drink for you!  Next time, I'll just stick to wine.  When I felt the buzz coming on after only a few sips, I decided to go with the table bread that everyone had passed on earlier.  This prompted orders of Kiltlifter fondue and bacon popcorn from everyone else-- so happy!!  The cheese fondue paired the best with the toasted cubes of bread, although I skipped on the pear that Chrissy P. was loving!  (Pear doesn't like me very much.)  We all raved about the farmer's sausage from Shannon's (sorry, forgot the whole name).  The spice level was perfect!  Wished there were more slices on the plate!  I skipped on the popcorn (corn allergy), but I did try a sliver of bacon-- it was floppy, not crispy, so I left it on my plate.  The warmed, but not toasted, table bread was good, and paired only with a tiny cup of extra-virgin olive oil.  I was hoping for butter, but the EVOO did have a great, mild flavor with slight buttery notes when consumed with the bread."}
{"text":"We sat at the bar both times we went and had great service. The food was consistent both times as well. If you find yourself here you have to try their chicken sand waffle appetizer its large enough to make a meal out of or share. Dessert was also very yummy. Happy hour is a good deal. Half off drafts and wine. Can't beat a cold  $2.5 beer on a hot AZ day, the snack option isn't large for HH but still worth trying."}
{"text":"Everything tasted really good. Prices were lower than the spectacular quality. Artichoke was great, and definitely the Black and Tan. Yum"}
{"text":"We came here for my mothers 78th birthday with my 2 kids and husband. It wasn't exactly our favorite food. The steak my kids ordered was stiff and hard, and I personally didn't enjoy what I ordered. This probably won't be a place our family will be coming back to enjoy ourselves at."}
{"text":"I really can't add much more than all of the previous reviews. The service was great! The food didn't disappoint and I'm absolutely stuffed.   Our table of 5 consumed:  Catfish Appetizer Rosemary Nuts Chopped Salad x 2 Buttermilk Chicken x 2 Pork Osso Buco x 2  Some cocktails (I had lemonade)  I substituted mashed potatoes for the succotash on the chicken entree and it was delicious. The chopped salad was yummy as well but smaller than how the waiter described it.   That's all. Going into a food coma now."}
{"text":"Really great food and pretty interesting combinations of food put together. This place can get busy so go early or make reservations. I am a vegetarian and had many choices but leave room for dessert. It is wonderful. Yum."}
{"text":"My friend we meet for dinner found this on Yelp - great choice.  Food was excellent.  Service was good.  Only complaint was the waiter thought I was pointing to one thing on the menu while I was saying another.  He made good on his mistake and we all enjoyed our dinner. Steak salad was fantastic so was the grilled  cheese and truffle sandwich.  Hubby had the duck - loved it.  Dad had the chicken waffle - he loved that too."}
{"text":"Went there for a mid week dinner to celebrate a friend's birthday, but the dinner server seemed irritated that he had to be waiting on a table of 8 pretty ladies. It took him quite a long time to even come over to our table after we had been seated, and when he did he seemed to be annoyed that he had to wait on us. Maybe because we didn't all order entrees or some of us were sharing things...we were never offered a dessert menu. When it was time to settle the checks the server was rude to one member in the party about being ready to pay. I guess the best part of the night was eating the chopped salad that everyone raves about."}
{"text":"We had reservations for 4 on a Wednesday night for Citizen Public House- it wasn't super crowded but I can see why a reservation is needed; the food is amazing!  The inside of the restaurant is classic and comfortable with an upscale feel. We split the chopped salad, burratta and mac and cheese as appetizers. The chopped salad was mixed right at our table and one of the best salads I've ever had. The mac and cheese is super light and a big sized portion topped with a refreshing tomato relish. The burratta is served with bread over an amazing cauliflower and tomato mix.  For entrees we had the Pan Seared Scallops, Chula Swordfish and Fair-trade short ribs. Everything was amazing. The scallops are served over a unique and delicious corn grits. I personally ordered the swordfish and it was light, perfectly grilled and served over zucchini noodles with a light burre blanc sauce.   I would highly recommend having a meal here if you're in town."}
{"text":"So nice to have a new type of environment to hang out in Scottsdale.  Decor - Its so clean and sophisticated sharp decor right when you walk in tn the door , you immediately want a drink when you see the beautiful bar in the center of the floor. OK OK I'm a little obsessed I know:) with good reason!!  Food- I have tried several things on the menu and was impressed with every hing ! LAMB BURGER!!! a must!!!  Service was friendly and professional. This place is here to stay !"}
{"text":"I had high expectations for CPH. Great reviews, good menu and a hip vibe.  I see the potential but unfortunately it didn't live up to expectations.  Food: For starters we split The Original Chopped Salad. We weren't aware that it has Salmon mixed in it...and I cannot stand salmon...so I barely had it. My wife liked it though. Entrees - TRUFFLE GRILLED CHEESE (white truffle scented mashed potato, Emmental, melted onion, French bread, simple field greens) which was very oily and buttery. The bread was a little soggy and not toasted enough. FAIR TRADE SHORT RIBS (coffee rub, dried cherry bbq sauce,roasted parsnip puree & seasonal veg) did the job for my wife but I thought it was ok.  Dessert -  PEANUT BUTTER STRATA BAR (white chocolate ice cream, strawberry jam, peanut butter crunch) was eh. PB was flaky not creamy.  Atmosphere - Loud and modern.  Service - Good, no complaints. The hostess did hook us up with a seat without having a reservation. We tugged on her heartstrings.  Prices - Expensive. I am all for paying for a great meal but if you add a couple of drinks your dropping bucks here.  I do admit if you want to go for a drink and be noticed, this a good place to go. Parking is bit tricky but we scored a spot a few steps away."}
{"text":"Fantastic!! The chopped salad is a...DO NOT MISS.  The best chopped salad I've ever had! Let them mix it table side.  The dessert is outrageous...banana split!"}
{"text":"First, the chopped salad is probably one of the best salads ever. A must have if you are here. I love that it was mixed table side and my favorite component was strangely the freeze dried corn, very creative! All ingredients went together perfectly. I am not normally a smoked salmon fan either but it all just worked. Our server was friendly and knowledgeable not only about the menu but also wine. Entrees left a bit to be desired...I got the seabass, it was 2 thin filets with skin on. I have always had my seabass as a thick filet and this preparation just didn't do it for me. We did get a bag of their pecan bacon brittle to go and it is delicious, not overly sweet and a bit smokey from the bacon which was nice. The brittle is a great gift and a nice local item. If I lived in Scottsdale I would swing by for a lunch of chopped salad but didn't have strong feelings about return for dinner entrees."}
{"text":"The delicious cuisine and wonderful service of Citizens Public House draws a diverse crowd - older couples in classic clothing, young adults in jeans and caps, match.com dates (yeah, I can spot them from a mile away) looking snazzy and friends gathering for a casual meal.  In other words, citizens has wide appeal for all ages and all occasions.   AJ was our waiter and was attentive and knowledgable about the menu. He recommended the chop salad (of course) and the scallops. My friend went surf and followed the scallop recommendation whereas I went turf and got the filet mignon. Both of our dishes were delicious.  The chopped salad was slightly unique and tasty but probably a little overrated at this point.   The downside to this popular restaurant is the noise level. I was here at 8pm on a Sunday night when the restaurant wasn't packed and it was s A little hard to hear my table met even though I have perfect hearing."}
{"text":"The food is quite good. Even though it can get crowded you never feel cramped. Though I just realized that every time we've gone we've been seated at the wall half booth tables, which I guess is kinda annoying. The waiters are friendly though can be a tad too chatty, practicing for their reality show auditions. Also, if you order meat or a burger, the kitchen has a firing problem. Your food will be over cooked. Order a medium lamb burger and it will be well done. That's not that big a deal, though their lamb burger is not good at all. It and the fries taste like cardboard, so over cooking doesn't help. But an over cooked steak is a tragedy. So if you want it one way, order it rarer. Must be a timing issue in the kitchen. We've been 4 times, and this has happened twice to multiple plates in the party."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of this place! We went here last night! They have great service, great food, and great drinks! I got the short ribs with mashed potatoes! So good! We sat at the bar, then moved to a table. Great date spot!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants for atmosphere & certainly food.  The chopped salad will become your next craving!"}
{"text":"Ambiance was very nice.  Our server was very good.  This was a very trendy place - the drink menu was not your standard and the food dishes were on the expensive size for the portions, but it was very good food.   Desserts were fine, but nothing memorable. All that being said, I plead the fifth on the hostesses."}
{"text":"The best thing about this place was our funny waiter. The fries texture felt like they were rolled in fur. Drinks were decent. Lamb was nothing special. One visit was enough."}
{"text":"Pluses: Swift service at every step of the meal Chopped salad is everything people said....especially liked the concentrated flavor and texture of the freeze dried corn Bacon and caramel bread pudding was a superb combination of favors  Sangria unusually flavorful   Minuses: Short ribs a little dry and ordinary  Parking difficult...they should offer valet A bit pricey  Not many vegetarian options  Bacon pecan brittle was unremarkable and costly at $10/bag Dim lighting"}
{"text":"I come here every year during spring training. The food drinks and service are excellent. Chop salad is great."}
{"text":"I'll be honest and admit I really don't expect that much from dining in Phoenix outside the basics but Citizen Public House exceeded expectations. In short, Cowboy Ciao on steroids, which probably isn't an accident since it is owned by the former executive chef of the latter.   As both a date venue and a group outing for both cocktails and a full meal it delivers:  - Moe'scow Mule (~$10): A heavily poured Moscow Mule in a stylized metal urn with cucumber set the appropriate tone - Pork belly pastrami ($13): Paternal favorite and juicy, smooth merger of dishes - The Original Chopped Salad ($12): Not as good as proper Burmese Tea Leaf salad but worthy as the closest thing I've ever had out of Western salad canon - Lamb burger ($13): Well-executed with delicious thick fries with homemade ketchup  I need to return if for no other reason than to try the Bacon Brittle. I failed in that mission.  Even my parents liked the place despite the New American-ness and it's unusual for us to agree on anything that isn't a steakhouse. If there is any negative, it is that it is a bit pricey but more worthy of the occasional splurge than most other choices I've tried in or above the range in the area. If I lived in PHX I'd be here as often as wallet and heart/stomach permitted."}
{"text":"The chopped salad is a symphony of textures and flavors.  So good it has its own Facebook page!Excellent service and delicious food makes this a good choice.  It might be a little expensive, but you are worth it."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in Scottsdale. Been dozens of times and never disappointed. The happy hour is a great deal, the cocktails are delicious and creative and the food is excellent. The prices for food aren't bad either. If you haven't been before then you are missing out!"}
{"text":"5 Stars for the Experience!  It's everything a Gastropub should be and more. The Servers are wonderful, they give you excellent recommendations keeping in mind what you like(they definitely know what they are talking about)  The cocktails were interesting Navy strength Grog (2 types of Rum,liqueur,lemon,lime,orange peel) Members Only (gin,grapefruit,syrup,bitters,lemon soda,rosemary).My preference was the Grog but that's just me.I also tried a mix of Glenlivet and cognac that was amazing.  Don't miss the Chopped Salad it's a treat.We also had the Crab cakes and fondue."}
{"text":"Great ambiance, vibe, and nicely decorated.  The bartenders are masterful mixologists and we really liked our cocktails and mac and cheese.  Belly up to the bar and ask for a recommendation."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time and loved it! Super cute ambiance, amazing food and good service. I got the hummus and flat bread and their Mac and cheese. Their Mac and cheese was probably one of the best I've had! Had some vegetarian options as well so I will def be returning !!"}
{"text":"Ate here for Yelp Eats week 2011. The hubby and I were meeting up with my sister and her husband for dinner at 7pm but we arrived at about 5:30 (it is just down the street from where I work so it seemed a waste to go home first). So, we got to enjoy the full bar experience while we were waiting. The bartenders were super friendly and offered up a lot of great information about the drinks and the food menu. My hubby was very happy that they had Kiltlifter and the Four Peaks Hefe on tap and so was content to enjoy a couple of those but I decided to try the specialty cocktails since I had heard such good things about them. The first one I tried was like a vodka tonic but instead of the tonic they used a sparkling wine in it. I think it also had some orange flavor to it b/c it was served with a curl of orange peel on the rim of the glass. It was so fresh tasting and the bubbles tickled your taste buds so it made the perfect aperitif. Unfortunately I can't remember the name of it and it is not on the list on the website. We also ordered some rosemary nuts which were served warm and were absolutely delicious. Basically just fragrant nuts that were ever-so-slightly candied but they made the perfect light snack. I decided to try a more earthy drink next to go with the nuts so I ordered a Moscow Mule. I know others have raved about this drink but I really wasn't a fan. I liked the cool cup it came in and I loved the fresh cucumber and mint but the ginger beer that they use is just too bitter for me. I love the taste of ginger but this was just too peppery. The next drink I tried (yes, I like to drink, don't judge) was the Aviation and I have to say that this was one of the best cocktails that I have ever had. I am a big gimlet fan (with gin, not vodka) and so this had that nice sour flavor but extra complexity because of the cherry liqueur. It was nice and fruity without being too sweet. Just a really great cocktail and I think I enjoyed it even more because by then we had also ordered some of the bacon fat popcorn which was fantastic. Kind of felt a little guilty seeing all the bacon drippings at the bottom of the bowl but the popcorn itself somehow did not seem too greasy or soggy at all. This really is the perfect bar snack since it went equally well with my fab cocktails and my husband's beer.   Once our dinner companions finally arrived me moved to a table in the dining area. We all ordered off the Yelp Eats menu. My brother-in-law tried the chopped salad and it did not disappoint. My sister and I got the regular salad with different dressings that were both fabulous. I love the fact that they have some unique salad dressing options that are fresh made daily in house. My hubby got the sausage of the day which we had already been informed at the bar is sort of a salad, too. It was basically sliced Spanish chorizo (the hard kind) on top of mixed greens. I have never seen him enjoy a salad so much. For entrees, two of us got the scallops which were absolutely perfect. Really amazing. My sister got the chicken and my hubby got the pork. They were not as impressed as we were with the scallops but they still enjoyed their meals. We were all too stuffed for dessert but I got a cappuccino to sip on while my sister finished her wine and it was tasty though more of a latte since the milk was mixed in rather than floating on top.  I love the smooth, swanky feel of this place.  I was expecting more of a \"pub\" atmosphere because of the name but it is not like that at all.  I really like places like this that are upscale but not stuffy.  You would feel equally comfortable here in a dress and heels as you would in jeans.  I will say that if the meals weren't half off I may have felt it was a little overpriced.  I think I would have just given three stars based on the dinner but the drinks and service we received at the bar bumped it up a notch and I will definitely be back just for that reason."}
{"text":"Awesome crab cakes and the one of the best scallop dishes I've ever eaten. The scallops were delicious and the grits were smooth & creamy. Cool atmosphere. Was able to sit at a table in the bar area without waiting."}
{"text":"Great spot. The salad with its own website really deserves its own website. They do pork really well."}
{"text":"Chopped salad was tasty...great variety of textures and flavors. Drinks on happy hour were a great deal as well. 1/2 off tap beer and $6 cocktails. Restaurant is also very clean and wine glasses on all of the tables were properly polished which makes for great presentation."}
{"text":"I wouldn't go to say that this is my number 1 restaurant in Scottsdale however each for its own and reviews speak for themselves.  It's everything you expect, great food, good service, nice drinks selection and great location.  I've been here a couple of times and never felt disappointed on any front."}
{"text":"Been dying to come here ever since I saw this place on Unique Eats. Very laid back gastropub with a friendly, funny/entertaining staff!  We grabbed drinks at the bar first - Moe'scow Mule (ginger beer, cucumber, lime, rocks) & the Persian (Absolut Wild Tea vodka, St. Germain elderflower liqueur, sweet & sour, Persian cucumber juice, lemon peel, rocks) which were both good, not too strong, but a good refreshing drink.  Appetizers: 1) Pork Belly Pastrami (rye spaetzle, Brussels sprout sauerkraut) 2) The Original Chopped Salad Please order both. They were both delicious! I was in love with the salad especially.  Entrees: 1) Lamb Burger (Serbian lepinja roll, pickled cucumber-onion, tzatziki, Kennebec French fries & house made ketchup) I tend to be very picky about my lamb... Actually I'm not reallly a fan of it/the particular taste and smell lamb has. Why I ordered this, I don't know, but I can tell you that I liked it. The taste/odor of lamb wasn't overwhelming and it was juicy. 2) Pan Seared Scallops (Hampshire bacon, roasted corn grits, wilted snow pea greens & Red Rock cola gastrique) 3) Amaro Meatloaf (Montenegro Amaro Italian liqueur, pork, beef, parsnip meatloaf, smashed Yukon gold potatoes, roasted zucchini, veal demi-glace): the server described it as very meaty and meaty it was! Usually meatloaf is fluffed up with a lot of bread crumbs, but this one was mainly just meat. The mashed potatoes were very good as well."}
{"text":"This place was in a top 20 places to eat and they were right! Made reservations through open table and got 100 points too. Hehe. Parking was easy to find in the streets.  We ordered several drinks but the most memorable was the Tom Collins for me. Anything with watermelon has me sold!  We ordered the flat bread to share and the hummus was really good! I ordered the chopped salad and it was delicious!! I thought about it all night. It was super flavorful. The hubs ordered the short ribs and those were good but you def had to use the sauce that it came with. Otherwise, there really wasn't any taste. The scallops were also amazing ! Paul our server was great and friendly! We also had a toddler and they brought out a cup of water for her without us having to ask. Great experience and great time here."}
{"text":"Came for drinks but also had the popcorn and the hummus platter.   Excellent crafted cocktails.  Excellent bartender.  Found popcorn greasy prob wouldn't reorder. Hummus was excellent. Would probably ask for more hummus and no taziki.   Didn't have food but I'm sure good.  Was a little loud when crowded."}
{"text":"Had dinner here tonight with my husband and son and we enjoyed every bite. From the surprising and irresistible bacon fat popcorn, to the seared scallops served over a bed of the best-tasting grits I've ever had, and the brownie sundae, it was all excellent. And better yet, our server was attentive to our 11-year-old son without being condescending and suggested menu alternatives that pleased his palate and let us enjoy our meal as well.  We left feeling it was money well-spent and look forward to returning the next time we're in Arizona."}
{"text":"This place is just so great for any occasion. Love the food and the service is always on point."}
{"text":"Good music, great food, courteous staff! LOVED the chop salad!!!!!! Hubby enjoyed the Jucy Lucy (stuffed velveeta burger). We also tried the pork belly tossed popcorn.   When in town, I'll stop by to visit!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, knowledgeable wait staff and incredible delicious food.  We sat at the bar to wait for the rest of our party. I inquired about a cosmo and he asked what flavors I liked.  He then made me a deliciously sweet drink that was perfect.  At the bar, we ordered the bacon popcorn and it was amazing.  Lots of delicious, salty bacon flavoring the popcorn.  The bartender, Elijah, then recommended some favorites.   We were in a large party,so we tried what he recommended, and we were most pleased.   The chopped salad is amazing; so many flavored and textures.  We loved the crab cakes!  The meatloaf was the best I've had and everyone who ordered scallops was delighted.  I wish we lived closer.  This would be my go to for a nice dinner out!"}
{"text":"I have been holding back recently on giving out 5 stars reviews but for the dinner I had last week at Citizen Public House, I gladly give them all 5. My dinner was outstanding. My husband has been there before and was raving about this place. He has been to Scottsdale 3x and has said that all 3x have been great. This says alot since the menu is ever-changing with the exception of a few favorites that are always on the menu (chopped salad and noble bread with some type of jam).   We made a quick reservation on Open Table and although we got there on time, we still had to wait a bit for our table. Not sure why as there were empty tables around, maybe they just had to catch up on things from earlier. Not sure.  We elected to have 5 starters versus any entrees because we couldn't choose between all the starters we wanted. Wow - so glad we made that choice because all 5 were great!   What we got: - Pork Belly Pastrami (my husband's favorite) - the meat was crispy and tender and the brussels sprout sauerkraut was really good - Burrata - least fave of all the appetizers but still really good. i think this dish would be great if we didn't have to compare it to the other 4 dishes. The cheese is pasteurized per the waiter which is great because I am pregnant, but was able to eat it. Very fresh and creamy. - Noble Bread Plate with bacon jam and black garlic butter - this was MY fave!!! geeez, i could have licked the plate. I am on a mission to learn to make this dish because I am so sad i cannot eat this every day of my life. I love bread but that jam and butter were just whoa... - Chopped salad - really good although it is exactly the same as the original stetson salad at Cowboy Ciao. Nevertheless, still yummy and a real real good salad. - Fried grit catfish - Yummy! The outside crust was really crispy and held onto the fish. Good portions. The cucumber relish that came with it was amazing too.  Not much else I can say. Service was good but the quality of the food was the star. Even though we only got starters, the portions were very fair and we were really full at the end of the night. We are planning to go back to Scottsdale next year (we are from SF) and this place will be on the top of our list of restaurants to eat!"}
{"text":"If I lived here, I would eat here at least three times a week. The experience itself is so wonderful and uplifting. The staff is having an incredibly fun time and I am not sure I've ever had a more impeccable service experience.   Now let's get to the food. I had the Reuben as well as the chopped salad and each of them got a 10. This place is a \"must go\" while in the Scottsdale/Phoenix area. Hands down. Go!!!!"}
{"text":"Came here tonight for dinner and it was so good. I have come here before, but it has been years. We started with the popcorn (which I wouldn't get again) the fondue and macaroni. The fondue was probably the best. I ordered the chopped salad and short rib both were incredible. The chopped salad was seriously amazing something I would get every time I come back. My friends got the steak which was so good and the meatloaf.. really amazing quality of meat. For dessert we ordered the bread pudding and this weird tapioca thing which we definitely wouldn't get again, but the bread pudding was great. Love citizen the atmosphere location everything"}
{"text":"I tried really hard to like this place. I really tried.   A small selection of food. Super pricey martinis for the small pour. I'm not one to complain about the price, but they have the smallest martini glasses, which is fine if you adjust your price accordingly. Good crab cakes, but didn't inspire me to order something else.   I had high hopes. I NEED to find really amazing foodie places in AZ. This place isn't that."}
{"text":"Absolutely AMAZING!! Went in for my moms birthday (she was in town visiting from Oregon).... the host answering the phone for the reservation was super polite....asked about the occassion, said it was my moms bday, he asked her name, didnt know why at the time, but when we arrived at our table, there was a note, specifically stating her name and a \"happy birthday\"... our server  DANNY was amazing!!  We had the chop salad (the reason i go in all the time), fondue, steak, scallops (the best), and so much more... the food was to die for!! I work at a restaurant down the street and this is the experience I hope my guests have when they dine with me!!!  Thank you to the management, back of house, and Danny for the incredible time!!!!"}
{"text":"Great food and the service was pretty quick as well.  We had a party of 10 and everyone enjoyed their meals and drinks.  Can't wait to go there again!!"}
{"text":"A memorable meal!  A server at a local bar recommended we try the ahi, chopped salad and scallops.  All were perfect!   The scallops were done to perfection, and the flavors were incredible!  Service was also top notch, and we felt with the service and good food, we had one of the best meals ever!  I look forward to a return visit.    If only more restaurants could learn from Citizen Public House!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant. I held a baby shower in the private party room turned out amazing. The food was great and bartenders were awesome as well."}
{"text":"Able to sneak in for happy hour, the barrel aged drinks are stellar and the food was great. Modern portions and concept was excellent!"}
{"text":"came for a late dinner after flying into sky harbor. our server was the friendliest and most enthusiastic person I've ever met, but not in an overbearing or fake way. he seemed familiar with the entire menu and also the beers as well. each of our entrees was perfectly seasoned and balanced (lamb burger, scallops, and grouper). the coconut dessert was also fantastic. one complaint would be that the restaurant is all concrete and hard surfaces, making a fairly loud group of youngish patrons sound even louder. if I could give this place a 4.5 I would."}
{"text":"This place was great! Yelpers did not disappoint. We came with a party of six with reservation. They were waiting for us and greeted like they knew us. Our waiter was TOTALLY attentive. The famous Chop salad was wonderful! The spare ribs were wonderful too. They had my favorite Firestone beer on tap so that just added to the greatness. I tasted a couple other cocktails of folks at our table and they were good. Great experience!!! Will be back! Thanks for the fun night  You made a wonderful evening for us"}
{"text":"Wow, we were blown away with our dining experience! It was completely unexpected. We truly enjoyed the delicious food and service was OUTSTANDING. I rarely identify people in my reviews, however Gary deserves the praise. From the moment we sat down, he was friendly, charming, and attentive. His positive attitude and demeanor was infectious and it absolutely made our dinner more special. Even as he tended more tables, he hustled to get to everyone. We were so pleased. To top off an amazing evening, he waited for us at the entrance and held the door open as we left!  The Good Citizens Social (H/H) is 3-6pm daily. All bar snacks, draft beer, and glasses of wine are half off, their barrel-aged cocktails are $5, and three appetizers are discounted. We were dining unusually early since we wanted dinner before the Jason Mraz concert, however, we were able to take advantage of the Social.  Ruben opted for a pint of Anchor Brewing California Lager ($5; H/H $2.50). I settled on The Craftsman ($12; H/H $5) made with Barrel-aged Jameson Irish whiskey, Cocchi Americano, and Charbay Green Tea Aperitif.  Rosemary Roasted Nuts ($5; H/H $2.50): A mixture of nuts roasted with rosemary. Great flavor and a wonderful snack to munch on while having a couple drinks.  Bacon Fat Heirloom Popcorn ($5; H/H $2.50): The popcorn was very lovely and the addition of bacon and its fat was scrumptious. Another fantastic snack!  The Original Chopped Salad ($12): Smoked salmon, Israeli couscous, arugula, trail mix of toasted pepitas, black currants, and aged asiago, freeze-dried corn, marinated roma tomato, and pesto buttermilk dressing. Wowza! I knew the salad was popular (I mean, it has its own Facebook page), but I didn't expect to be hit by the combination of flavors and textures. It is so, so good and surprisingly light. Great dish to split as an appetizer. The recipe is available on their page, but it's much more complex than I thought and it's one I'll leave to the professionals. I would absolutely return just to eat this salad again..and again.  Buttermilk Chicken ($20): Roasted Smart Chicken breast, Brussels sprouts, truffle oil, sweet corn-butter bean succotash, and Pecorino. We chose to also share our entree and our server was kind enough to split it for us. The chicken was moist and flavorful, the succotash was creamy, and the brussels sprouts were perfect. All the flavors worked and it's probably one of the best chicken dishes I've had.  (All their desserts are made by Tracy Dempsey Originals, a local company creating sweet and savory confections)  Bacon and Peach Hand Pie ($11): Candied bacon, salted Bourbon caramel ice cream, and peach jam. The pastry was perfection combined with the sweet and salty bacon, ice cream, and not-too-sweet peach jam. Fantastic dessert option!  Bag O' Bacon Brittle ($10): The Original Bacon Pecan Brittle packaged to go. My family and I love brittle (and c'mon, bacon?), so I picked up two bags to take back to Vegas. I haven't had a chance to indulge yet, but I will update when I do!  I highly recommend dining at Citizen Public House. Although I like to try new restaurants on future visits, this is somewhere we won't want to pass up!"}
{"text":"Food was amazing and the service was even better. Honestly can't think of anything to improve on!"}
{"text":"We walked here from our hotel the Valley Ho on recommendation from the hotel staff. We were seated shortly and the atmosphere is real nice. The oval shaped bar in the middle sets it off.  The waiter gave us a 5 minute run down pumping up the menu and it changed what I was going to order. I decided on the meat loaf because it was 3 different types of ground meat. It was a mid-range price at $20 considering the filet was $34.  I ordered a hummingbird and and later a heff. Both tasty selections. My friends got fancy cocktails, including a pomegranate infused mojito that inspired laughs.  The food was delicious. I asked him what the amazing sauce was and I believe he said it was a \"veal demiglaze (demigloss??). It was delicious. The sides of zucchini and mashed potato were filling. I felt very satisfied after. I would definitely return here and recommend it to friends.  I was disappointed that none of us tried their house salad that apparently has it's own facebook page but that will be for the next time."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. The place had many positive reviews on Yelp and they were for the most part accurate.   My friends and I enjoyed our dinners and drinks. We will definitely be back on our next trip to Scottsdale."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants hands down! The salad was to die for, the scallops and chula swordfish were incredible! I have never had their desserts :(. Service was on point and they.are.always.super nice and friendly."}
{"text":"Wow. Wow wow!!! The hostess' were able to get 5 of us in on a busy Saturday night without a reservation.. WOW! I was so excited to go here and when I found out they were fully committed that night, I could have cried. BUT the hostess came to our rescue and were able to squeeze us in and I almost started crying again! Obviously, a happy cry moral of that story, make a reservation. Like at least two days in advance.  The food was phenomenal and so was the service. Our server, Sam, really took care of us. He was knowledgable, kind, funny and definitely ordered for us only because we asked him to.  We had so many different items, but the one that stuck out the most was that chopped salad with salmon. I can seriously have one every single day and never get tired of it (ok maybe I'm reaching a little, but still, SO GOOD!) I want to come back to Scottsdale just for this place. So, I just might!"}
{"text":"I went with another Yelper who had gone to the Yelp event at Citizen's, however, we didn't have the same experience as she had at the Yelp event.    We had cups of iced tea (Starbucks)  that the hostess didn't say we couldn't bring in, a server just came by and was about to take them until we asked why..  I asked how a particular drink was..was it sweet, the waitress said it was more savory which I thought well it sounded good..umm skip the Aviation, even had my friends try it and they too thought I should send it back however I got the feeling that I would be charged for the drink and charged again for whatever else I ordered, so I let it sit on the table and see how long it would take the waitress to notice..never did..another server/busboy came by to take my plate, and I just told him to take the drink, he never questioned nor asked what was wrong..all in all poor service.  We had the mussel chowder..skip it!  The 8 mussels makes the bowl look full, underneath, hardly any leeks and potatoes but a lot of celery! And the chowder was really runny. And for $9, seriously for mussels which are one of the cheapest seafood to purchase.  When I was going to the restroom, I noticed to ladies totally bored and annoyed, just sitting side by side with just water in front of them.  I thought to myself, have they been served or asked??  I walked back out and they were out the door pretty quickly.  Would I go back? Umm..no..the pricing of the food is similar to Fez and other foodie spots and reasonable, however the quality and the quantity not so much....oh..and the service..I've had better."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this restaurant since we've had a sampling tasting at the Devoured Culinary Festival. We came here for our Anniversary (wanted a place different and trendy). We booked our reservation on Open Table. We were seated right away, water poured , Katie our server introduced herself and wished us a Happy Anniversary right off.  We started off with Cocktails: Manhattan and a Thai Margarita, both were very good. We opted to make a meal and share appetizers so we can taste a variety of dishes. We started with the \"special\" Uni Shooter, not a typical shooter style, the piece of uni was a good size but was overwhelmed by the Asian pear mushroom compo. We then moved onto The Original Chopped Salad (corn, couscous, smoked salmon, asiago, pepitas, tomatoes, arugula, currants, buttermilk pesto dressing) and the Pork Belly Pastrami (rye spaetzle, Brussels sprout sauerkraut, mustard jus). Both dishes were excellent. We then had the Chia Seared Tuna (Thai purple sticky rice, asparagus puree, fried leek & micro green salad) and the Deep Sea Red Crab Cakes (smoked re pepper aioli & celery root slaw), we both felt the tuna was good but the asparagus puree was odd and weak. The crab cakes were excellent. We ended the night with Katie delivering a wonderful complimentary Anniversary desert of a Chocolate Cake with Ice Cream topped with the best Carmel sauce I've ever had and a sprinkle of the bacon popcorn.  Atmosphere was very nice and trendy, service was excellent \"thank you Katie!\", food and drink were very good. A restaurant that is a must try."}
{"text":"Seriously, what is there to review? Amazing cocktails with food that equals it. Service is always on point. Always. If you have a bad experience here it's probably on you."}
{"text":"Found this place a few years ago and I bring everyone here. The food is always good, the service is always to notch, and the cocktails are always delicious. All that without mentioning the chopped salad. Don't even try to not order the chopped salad.  This could be a public outhouse, but if they had the chopped salad I would still give it 5 starts."}
{"text":"Monday night.  teenager is out of town on trip.  what to do?  head to Citizen Public House to try some of the dishes we've heard about.  first thing -- though the address may \"be\" on 5th Ave., it faces Craftsman Court.  Understand if the PO won't let you change your address, but might be wise to make a mention of it on your website.  we drove up and down 5th twice looking for 7111.    we were one of three tables occupied at 6 p.m.  We chose indoors next to the open doors to the patio.  Wanted the ambiance of the indoors, not the so-so view of the street from the patio.  unfortunately the air conditioning was cranked full blast.  when made mention to server, all we got was \"wow, really, we're really warm.\"  we ordered cocktails, and had to catch our waitresses eye after she  and other staffers spent some time talking to a regular that had come in.  where's our drink?  oh, the bar didn't see the ticket -- and was busy talking to the regular.  shouldn't take 10 minutes to get a drink when you're two of 10 people in the restaurant.   ordered the fondue -- used Kilt Lifter.  Cheese sauce was quite good -- not overpowering.  asian pear for dipping a nice touch, as well as the homemade hunter sausage.  the bread was fine.  one problem?  the sterno blew out as soon as the waitress left (told you there was a draft from the a/c) and she was not seen anywhere.  so...we ate fast.  crispy squid were just okay.  the highlight of the night?  the pork belly pastrami with rye spaetzel (typically little blobs of dough dropped into boiling water...these were bigger, cylindrical shaped), and an outstanding brussels sprouts sauerkraut.  could eat three more plates of this in one sitting it was so good.  (actually, was dreaming about the spaetzel on the way over, but due to its shape and denseness, it took a backseat to the brussels....).  we split the grilled halloumi cheese sandwich.  good....would order it for a lunch, but nothing outstanding.  what stole the show?  the apple/bacon bread pudding with bourbon brown sugar sauce.  we ditched the cinnamon ice cream on top and just focused on the sweet, smoky, crispy on the outside, gooey on the inside pudding with its not too cloying sauce.  overall...good place for a good drink and some eats.  destination restaurant for best food in town?  no.  service is casual.  not bad, just casual.  if you've got nowhere to go, you'll be okay with it.  meanwhile, i'm trying to figure out how to get more of that pork belly pastrami and brussels....."}
{"text":"Happy Hour Food is all $6, and only 3 selections: Turkey sliders, Tasso Ham, Granola.  The \"bar snacks\" are half price but very small portions and limited as well -- all $5 regular priced unless noted (nuts, popcorn, fondue - $9, flatbread - $10 and olives).   The beer (6 drafts) is half price but NOT in mugs as some other reviewers have said.  Standard pints.  For $2.50 a pint, it's still not a bad deal.  Today they had Jever pilsner, Chainbreaker white IPA, Firestone DBA, Hop Knot, and Guinness for $2.50  and Goose Island Matilda (12oz) for $4.  Dead on HH on Friday.  They are clearly more interested in the dinner crowd.  I'd also rate this place three $$$ as it's VERY pricey."}
{"text":"AHHH-MAZING!!! I don't want to make this a lengthy review so here's just a few things.  The atmosphere was wonderful. It was trendy with it's wooden accents, lit candles, and stark white linens.  The service was outstanding. Couldn't have asked for a more knowledgeable and sincere guy. Even when someone in our party ordered something that is normally sent back he let her know, and then gave her another option that would go with the tastes she was looking for. He was wonderful at pairing the perfect wines with our food.  The food was out of this world. We shared the Chopped Salad (which has it's own Facebook page, lol). It was hands down the best salad I've ever eaten, and I'm not a salad person. We both ordered the filet mignon which came with some greens and smashed potatoes. I've have never had a more tender and juicy filet in my life. It was absolutely fantastic! Hats off to the chef!  Please know this place is quite pricey so be prepared for that. Our salad, two filets, and his two beers came to about $93 but it was so amazingly worth the splurge."}
{"text":"Great food, good happy hour prices. The best place I have taken my toddler too, which is surprising given the more upscale atmosphere (Mother's Day request from my mother), but the service was impeccable and they were really great with the baby. Get the fries!!"}
{"text":"We stopped by for Restaurant Week (and as a final hurrah before getting on the keto diet bandwagon - wish me luck) but even though Citizen Public House currently sits at 1600+ reviews and four and a half stars, it was a little lackluster.  Tip: You'd probably want to call in more than a day ahead of time to get a seat inside the restaurant and not at the bar. We didn't think of this beforehand and wound up with patio seating, which though limited, was actually pretty nice. It's a lot quieter than it is inside, which though wasn't a bar, had the noise level of one. One downside was that it seemed like our waiter handled all the tables outside. So I'm not sure if he was stretched thin or he was having a bad day, but I've had cashiers who were more involved than he was as a waiter.  That aside, the food was mediocre. I was blown away by the salads - both the chopped salad and golden and red beet salads were amazing. One was savory, the other sweet (in that order) but they were by far the favorites for me of the entire dinner. Not saying they weren't phenomenal, but the other dishes were kind of...meh, in my opinion. For the main course, my husband ordered the scallops while I got the monkfish. I preferred the scallops even though I thought I'd prefer the monkfish as it sat in lobster bisque but I guess I had expected more, but it wound up being a dish with the same flavor throughout - no nuanced flavors and textures as I would have hoped. The scallops weren't spectacular either but I just like scallops so that was pretty much it there. Unlike the many other restaurant week offerings from the other restaurants, I was a little disappointed to see that Citizen Public House only had one option for dessert. It was a cobbler which though looked good, the saving grace was the shortbread which had a bit of lemon in it to cut the onslaught of berries and compote. I love berries, don't get me wrong but well, I expected better.  It was a nice dinner and I'm glad that I stopped by to curb my curiosity, but next time this place comes up, be it during restaurant week or otherwise, I don't think I'd be as eager to stop by."}
{"text":"One of my favorites...a girlfriend and I often split the chopped salad and scallops (the scallops come with 3, but they'll add an extra for a shared plate). Another friend had dietary restrictions, the waiter went back and talked to the chef and then came back, sat down, and walked through the menu with her. Great experience all around!"}
{"text":"Wow delicious food!! It's a pricey place that is actually worth the price unlike some fancy restaurants. Nice interior and excellent service, we went for my husbands birthday booked through open table and they actually noticed I said it was for his bday and put a printed happy Birthday sign on the table! A nice personal touch."}
{"text":"Went to Citizen's tonight for the first time to celebrate our wedding anniversary. It was amazing! Service and food were awesome! We started either the beets, my husband had the short ribs, I had the scallops and we had the coconut tapioca for dessert. Everything for delicious! Our server, Ryan, was very attentive and helpful! We'll definitely be going back! Thank you for a great night out!"}
{"text":"Citizen Public House was not on our radar until I looked on Yelp!!  Home run!!!  Great customer service with Gina as our server. Gina had great suggestions and even mentioned splitting the Original Chopped Salad was the way to go to start. My wife has a lot of food Migraine Triggers and Gina was able to help her navigate the menu and leaving certain ingredients off her plates. My wife had the beet salad for starters and my son and I split the original chopped salad.  Both were very tasty and satisfying.  Our main courses were 2 of the Pan Seared Scallops and one Meatloaf.  Wow is all I can say!!  This Scallop Dish is incredible!!!  The Meatloaf is extremely tender and very flavorful!!!  I would highly recommend all of these dishes!!!  Thanks to Gina and the Chef for making this a wonderful dinner!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I had a reservation for a Saturday night dinner. When we arrived we were seated immediately on the patio as we requested in our reservation. The service was very professional and attentive. Our server made excellent recommendations what to eat for dinner. We thoroughly enjoyed the food. It was high quality and different from what you find at other restaurants. They also have beer on tap which is great. Overall we had an excellent experience and will return during our next visit to Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Always love this please definitely get the chop salad it's to die for!! We always try something different and last night we had the tacos with shredded beef that were super yummy!! The drinks are always good to!!"}
{"text":"Perfect!  I moved to AZ in May of 2011 (HOW has it been five years...HOW?!) and immediately got to work stalking Yelp and putting together a list of must-go-tos in my new town. Citizen Public House has always been on that list, but I'm an idiot and just never got around to heading there until this past weekend. It was so phenomenal that I'm kicking myself for waiting so long to get here!  My friend and I decided Restaurant Week was the perfect opportunity for our inaugural visit. Our server was Kent, and he was fantastic. Hilarious, knowledgeable about the menu, and just all around gave amazing service. Good service is very surprisingly hard to find in a metro area with a bzillion restaurants, and he was great. We ordered a bottle of Prosecco to split, because obviously, and got to eating!  I started with the roasted beet salad, which I was told they were testing out to see if they want to put on the regular menu. Dear CPH: YES PLEASE. The combo of the sweet roasted beets, goat cheese, tomatoes, frisee, and arugula pesto was such a refreshing way to start a summer meal. For my entree I chose the Chicken \"Caesar.\" Guys, I know chicken can be \"boring,\" but I didn't eat meat for almost 11 years and now really only eat chicken or turkey. This was OUTSTANDING. The chicken breast was so juicy and tender and perfectly grilled. It came served with grilled radicchio, a cauliflower puree, some ciabatta croutons and a soft boiled egg half. It was an amazing combination of summery flavors and textures. Try as I might, I couldn't finish it all...but I COULD order dessert! The Black and Tan chocolate pot de creme was layered with salted carmel pudding (I know.) and came served with a browned butter shortbread cookie. Repeat: browned butter shortbread cookie. That's all you need to know.  All in all, our evening was glorious. I will say, the next time I visit (AND THERE WILL BE MANY MORE NEXT TIMES) I might request to sit on the small patio, as it got pretty loud inside the dining room. Other than that...CPH, you are ACES!"}
{"text":"Delicious, well-crafted food and drinks, excellent service, airy, attractive decor. The chopped salad ruined all other salads for life."}
{"text":"Be sure to order the house famous chopped salad.  My son had the meatloaf and he loved it.  My husband and I had the sandwich, it was alright."}
{"text":"One of the best of Old Town Scottsdale. Great service. Amazing drinks. Hubby loves the famous chopped salad. The burrata and bacon fat popcorn literally changed my life. The chicken is so juicy yet crispy on the outside. I have never been disappointed! Can be a long wait so take that into consideration."}
{"text":"FINALLY. Got the chance to try this chop salad so many people rave about...  We got the Spam Cuban, Chopped salad for a late lunch, the Instant Gratification and the Beast for our midday cocktails.  I like how they age their own alcohol in barrels next to the bar. Pretty neat and aesthetically pleasing. Hubs got the Instant Gratification which was a blend of bourbon and whiskey? or something like that... Anyways... it was an extremely smooth drink. I liked it a lot.   The Beast was a Tequila based drink which the server said, \"is sorta like a margarita\". Which in my humble opinion, was not the case. It was better than a margarita :) the citrus wasn't overwhelming and the balance between the mixes and the alcohol was perfect.  Onto the food... Spam Cuban was very good, great balance of the sweetness of the pineapple and Hawaiian bread with the mix of spam and pork. The home made dipping sauce for the fries (cuz Heinz wasn't good enough) was this chipotle sauce that had a slight kick to it, which provided a nice subtle touch to the fries.   My salad... oh my salad. I see why people rave about it. From the surface, it doesn't appear to be too complex but I'm sure even if I tried, I'd never be able recreate this salad at home. There is a certain level of umami going on in this dish. I'll have to go back several more times :)"}
{"text":"Had a great evening here!! We ended up getting a couple starters to share - eggplant burrata, chopped salad and baked brown sugar gnocchi. They were all amazing but especially loved the burrata.   Drinks were great! Very fresh, didn't skimp on the alcohol and tasted fantastic.  Service was the best part! Our waiter was very attentive and many staff members checked on us to make sure our meal was perfect.   Thanks!"}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant on a busy Monday night, it was packed and lively. We didn't have a reservation, and were told that it would be a 40 min wait, but we took a chance and hung out at the bar; we ended up seated at a table within 15 minutes. Our server Matt was very knowledgeable and friendly. We tried the delicious hand-chopped salad and the rosemary roasted nuts for starters, then enjoyed the short ribs and buttermilk chicken as our entrees. Matt was very patient with us, as we had a little trouble deciding on appetizers. We initially requested the pork belly pastrami, but changed our minds. Matt brought us the pastrami anyway and we tried it on the house - it was wonderful! The restaurant is a classy upscale place with soft lighting and hipster patrons; great environment but probably a little too loud for quiet conversation. We will definitely make time to come back here on our next trip Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"The service was extremely attentive and helpful with suggestions. Our server was around just enough to ask how we were but not annoyingly around so often.   The restaurant itself is really nice. We came around 9:30-10 for a late dinner so I guess it explains why they were blasting the music for Saturday night but it was pretty hard to hold a conversation.   I got the Persian cocktail which was tasty but I prefer fruitier drinks so I'll probably order something different next time.  For my entree, I got the lamb burger which was pretty disappointing. It had a grainy consistency and wasn't seasoned well. I usually love lamb especially with tzaziki sauce but I could hardly taste any of that on my burger. The fries were excellent though. They give you a pretty large portion. The house ketchup is delicious but it's a little too sweet for my taste. I usually need a more tart or sour ketchup with my fries but this ketchup is pretty sweet and almost tastes like apple pie? My boyfriend got the meatloaf which was delicious. The mashed potatoes were were good with the gravy."}
{"text":"One of my favorite go to spots for cocktails and especially the chopped salad. Psst add the bacon ! It's always been a staple for me and my friends. Especially, if people are in town I always take them here for the experience. Service is always on point. I love that there quality and price meets the value."}
{"text":"Our knowledgable server made great suggestions and did a superb job describing elements of the menu. I ordered the Amaro(?) meatloaf and it was a giant portion! The loaf was simple but wonderfully seasoned and it was very juicy! The demi glacé tasted perfect and the mushroom cream was a delicious addition! The roasted zucchini was tasty and the Yukon mash was a great portion size and complemented the meatloaf nicely. I would've liked to have a roasted carrot for some crunch but this was undoubtedly the best meatloaf I have ever had. Scottsdale's food scene WINS so hard!"}
{"text":"Keep on walking......  My friend and I each tried different dishes and shared.  He got nice roast and I got a hamburger.  The place is really nice....open, bright....  ..but the food is just a BIG disappointment.  A hamburger + 2 good beers was $37.   Expect to pay a lot for your food here.  Both dishes were poor.....  sorry, really wanted to like this one...."}
{"text":"Great food.  Exceptional service.  Brought my 90 year old Dad there and they were very accommodating in every way and he really enjoyed the food although it was quite exotic compared to what he was used to."}
{"text":"Delightful. We went on a Thursday at happy hour. It was a special occasion, I was retiring from a 23 year career.  I opened Yelp to find a place near the ceremony.  CPH looked good to me.  I am vegetarian, they did not have any vegetarian entrees on the menu I found online, but I don't let that put me off.  As soon as walk in, you feel relaxed, and special.  The environment is elegant and not stuffy.  Our server, Paul, was genuine, professional, kind, sincere, and conscientious.  Happy hour drink prices are insanely reasonable.  It is evident immediately that we should relax and enjoy each others company and take in the experience.  I never felt forgotten, I felt nudged to savor my friends, my food, my drink.  We started with the hummus, the little cucumber salad was AMAZING! I told Paul I was a vegetarian and asked if there was anything we could do besides the salads.  He told me of a vegetarian entrée that was available yesterday and he asked the chef if it was still available. It was, it sounded delicious, so I tried it.  It was AMAZING, risotto, carrots, cauliflower, asparagus, parsnips.  The risotto was a teeny tiny bit overcooked but the flavor was awesome and the veggies were PERFECT!  And the portion was GENEROUS; Seriously, I took half of it home. It was $20.  My gf had the tacos, she loved them and the FRIES, she loved the fries.  My husband had the braised short ribs, he reports that they were very very good.  We all three shared the beet salad, it was so good I wanted to lick the plate.  The beets were cooked perfectly, the fancy lettuce was perfectly crunchy, the dressing was light and addicting.  Because it was a special occasion we ordered the black and tan dessert.  It was the best dessert I've ever had, I don't know what's in it other than chocolate and heaven, just try it!  But, share it, it's rich enough to satisfy four people.  We will definitely return."}
{"text":"Great service and drinks.  The Midwest Manhattan is outstanding. The food was delicious albeit a little salty. My husbands filet was generous and perfectly cooked. It was absolutely delicious. I had the scallops. Only three atop an extremely rich buttery creamed corn base.  The chopped salad is good but there's not much lettuce to it. Just goodies  - like a lot of currents.  I sampled our friends spare rib- very good and tender."}
{"text":"This place has a super cool vibe.  Definitely worth taking your significant other or family out to a nice dinner.  We went during new years eve 2017 and the place was super packed but my fiancé and I were able to find a seat at the bar.  The bartender was awesome and a true mixologist.  It was nice to sit at a bar where they don't serve you the traditional \"club\" style drink but offer you some nice options of gin, barrel aged whiskey, and bourbon to sip and talk through the night.  Using ingredients such as bitters and vermouth in their arsenal along with house made sweeteners like popcorn syrup makes their drinks that much more special.  My only gripe with the whole experience was that they ran out of filet mignon.  Not sure if they ran out or if they were saving it for the everyone else in the dining room who had the \"new years eve set menu\".  I was told I could get anything a la carte at the bar but that was one item they didn't have.    I settled for the meat loaf and my fiancé had the shellfish soup.  Both were delightful (sorry for the awful pics as this place is very dimly lit).  Overall a great experience.  Would definitely come back for the cocktails and maybe try their dinner service next time we're in town"}
{"text":"All I can say is wow. I wish I was hungry.  We came here for its rating.  My hubby was hungry plus we wanted to grab a drink.   The decor is hip and has a nice open feel.   So, where to start. We looked at the menu and honestly everything looked good but because I wasn't that hungry we just ordered enough for my husband.   We ended up ordering the Original chopped salad (this is a must order!). You will not be disappointed.  The ingredients is like a chopped salad  like no other.   For the entree we ordered the Amaro Meatloaf.  Omg!  This Demi glaze sauce could have been a tad more generous but the entire Dish was unbelievable.   We finished off with the Black and Tan dessert.  Eat it In small bites cause it's a little on the heavier side but delicious.   I really wanted to come back here to try the scallops, the pork belly, Mac n cheese, the pork cheeks, the crab cakes, the gold and red beets I mean really?  Need I say more?  Strong Yay get yourselves down here to try."}
{"text":"Heard about this place from a friend and really wanted to try it out. To start out, the service was impeccable. I have a dairy allergy and Gina, our server, went above and beyond to accommodate me.  She even made my wife a special mocktail since she is pregnant.  The atmosphere is great- very comfortable.  The food was also excellent. We started with the chopped salad, which is the classic Cowboy Ciao chopped salad you could never go wrong with. I followed this with the chicken which was cooked to perfection with a risotto side.  My wife had the grilled cheese which she enjoyed (though not her favorite).  All in all, the five stars goes for the atmosphere, drink menu and service and good food...."}
{"text":"Another trendy and tastefully decorated hang-out place in old town Scottsdale. CPH is among a handful of new resto-bars in Scottsdale that are transforming the image of the old town neighborhood. The menu is a mix of amazing comfort foods and lighter salads a dishes. Best is to go with a group and try everything! Also have a taste of The Persian cocktail! :-) I would rate this place one of the top 5 restaurants in the city."}
{"text":"We moved to Scottsdale from St Paul a week and a half ago and we have been to CPH twice. The first time was about a month ago when we took a trip down to apartment hunt and the second was Halloween evening right after getting into town. We sat at the bar both times and chatted with the bartender, Brandon (?). Very, very nice guy. They have Kim Crawford on the wine list, which is one of our favorites so we ordered a couple glasses of that. We wanted a snack but nothing too heavy. The bartender suggested we get the chopped salad and being new to town and not knowing anything about anything, we trusted his suggestion. OMG. So delicious. I thought I would be disappointed seeing as you can get a chopped salad anywhere, but this salad is out of this world. I don't remember what all is in it, but it is fantastic. The salmon is like butter it's so perfect and melts in your mouth. We got to talking with the bartender and we work in the service industry up in Minnesota and Brandon gave us a service industry discount. So nice. The second time we went we each got our own salad and scraped the bowls. The bartender even remembered us! I got the Citizen cocktail which comes with a rock candy garnish which I thought was really cool. We wanted to get an entree, but with small wallets, we decided we would wait until next time. Thanks CPH! You have a couple new fans."}
{"text":"Another visit to this perennial favorite of ours and another fantastic meal.     I had the short ribs - and as usual they were great.  Fork tender, situated on parsnips with just done greens.    Friends had the filet (always great) and the scallops    And don't forget their \"the worlds end\" martini.  Seriously.     Highly recommend for any occasion where the food matters and the service has to be great.  Just remember to book reservations"}
{"text":"A wonderful, delicious respite in Scottsdale.  Visiting for Spring Training and disappointed by our first night's meal at Papago Brewery, we were excited at the anticipated visit to Citizen Public House. We were not let down. One of those wonderful places that make you struggle to select from a delectable menu, both food and drink.  The cocktail list is inventive and inviting. The New Amsterdam was intoxicating in a good way. Complex and delicious, deftly made with obviously excellent ingredients. The only hiccup was a bespoke order for a Basil Mojito, very simply replacing mint with basil that was made (twice) without any obvious effort to muddle the basil. A disappointment that was removed from the invoice. The food is spot on, creative and very well thought out. Started with the sublime Bacon Fat Heirloom Popcorn and intriguing Pork Belly Pastrami. A flavor packed, beguiling, complex offering served over rye spaetzle and brussel sprout sauerkraut. Big and bold but well designed. Entrees across the table included the Amaro Meatloaf and two Lamb Burgers. The Meatloaf was big, earthy and warming. A generous serving, worth the sporty $20 tariff. the veal demi-glace and mushroom cream delivering a rich arc, while the potatoes and roasted zucchini supplied the ideal sweep for the meatloaf. Lamb burgers were excellent with an exotic compilation of Serbian lepinja roll, pickled cucumber-onion, tzatziki. Enough so that a request was made to attempt replication at home. Dessert for the table was the PB&J Pudding Jar. Joyous companions all! The service was very friendly and attentive while not overpowering, knowing just when to service the table. Excellent. The space is warm, yet hip and airy, with a very manageable noise level. It was nice, for a change to visit a very popular restaurant that didn't have tables stacked on each other. Very refreshing.  A highly recommended spot for an Old Scottsdale visit..in fact for a destination as well."}
{"text":"Great service, the waiter was a menu expert and gave very good recommendations. The atmosphere is pretty bougie and a little darker than preferred. We ordered the bone marrow with pancakes as appetizer, followed by the roasted acorn squash and the ribs.   The bone marrow was meh. This was my second time having it and it was worse than my first; maybe I just don't know how to appreciate marrow. Or bones, really.  Squash was delicious and the ribs just melted in my mouth - went really well with the mash potatoes and mints. Def recommend if you are in the area!"}
{"text":"Awesome place!! Very busy!! Order the chopped salad and you will understand why it has its own Facebook page. Amazing!!   Chicken pot pie was good too. It is deconstructed but very good. Too bad there wasn't more.   A must go to place in Scottsdale!!"}
{"text":"This place is unbelievable!  I was visiting AZ from DC and saw that it has 4.5stars with 900+ reviews, so I knew there had to be something special!  The atmosphere is very chill, has indoor and outdoor seating.  Service was great, the waiter explained everything on the menu with such detail and passion that I couldn't  wait to try everything.  The chop salad is a must, perfect texture and flavor, the corn and salmon harmonize together wonderfully.  Also, for starters, we got the Tuna...one word....AMAZING.  Large chunks of tuna, seared and seasoned perfectly.  The three of us had the short rib, filet mignon and the osso bucco.  I couldn't tell which one I liked more.  The meats were prepped and cooked like nothing I have seen before.  The flavor, texture and juiciness were to die for.  I honestly could not find one single thing wrong with anything they had there, and I am an anal type of guy.    I even enjoyed two Thai Margaritas, that were the perfect balance of flavor and alcohol.  If you are in Arizona, you have to go to this place at least once.  I wish they had one in DC, I would honestly eat there twice a week!"}
{"text":"Went in the late afternoon. We got the Pork Belly Pastrami and Rib Tacos. Nice portions, food tasted great. Had an appetizer called Meat. Cheese and Pickled Things which was also nice. Good all around. Attentive service."}
{"text":"This was a fantastic meal in old town Scottsdale. Not being that hungry we decided to share two appetizers and a sandwich - the beer salad, burrata, and veggie sandwich. All were delicious!   The restaurant is on the expensive side, especially for the entrees, so just know that going in. But, I would say worth the price.   Down side: a bit noise. If you want a quiet and intimate setting, this probably isn't the best choice."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time here, they try so hard to be sophisticated they end up ruining the food. I will say their take on a salad is amazing and I would recommend it to anyone, but their bread is over cooked and smells like smoke trying to make it fancy and the butter they serve with it isn't any good either trying to be fancy. (Can't recreate the wheel, Its butter!!) my wife got the filet mignon which could have been ok but instead of just serving a nice steak they stack it with their purple potatoes, green beans that have a sauce, and pile onions on the top. You add all that stuff to a cheaper steak to improve its taste. When you are getting a filet you don't want it hidden in a pile. I got the scallops and i will say they stand up to their recommendation and i would get those again. For the price we had to wait quite a while on our waiter regularly also and although this is a restaurant and we were there at 6 pm we had to scream across the table to each other do to a 10 person group of guys acting like they were in a bar at 1 am."}
{"text":"We had a nice dinner here. The service was very professional. Menu was interesting. I wish we had been more hungry so we could have tried more! I had the mac n cheese which was phenomenal. SO tasty! I also had the beet salad which was fresh and garnished perfectly. My husband had the Bahn Mi sandwich. He is Vietnamese so he is hard to please. He said he would not order it again as there was too much bread for his liking, but it was still tasty and one of the better sandwiches he has had outside of San Jose. I think this would be good for groups. The atmosphere is warm and inviting but not too casual."}
{"text":"The first thing our waiter suggested was the Original Chop Salad, and quite frankly it was the most surprising and delicious part of the experience! Service was phenomenal, we had a very professional yet personable waiter who knew the menu backwards and front.  Our main course included the the chop salad, coffee rubbed shortribs (cherry bbq sauce), and amaro meatloaf w/potatoes. The rib portions were small but made up for it in taste and quality of cut. Our heart of caramel and mint chocolate budino were perfectly refreshing as finishers- both the mint ice cream and roasted white chocolate ice cream were incredible!  Presentation was all very photo worthy, but we restrained ourselves ;)  Atmosphere is open and lively, moderate lighting and white table cloths, small candles atop- the bar is right in the center of the room. Our party of two went on a Monday night- I'm sure it would be much more crowded on a weekend. It's right in Old Town Scottsdale, after all. I definitely recommend anyone to try this place- I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"I had the scallops which were delicious. The creamy polenta was really good and the bacon popcorn was dangerously good! My bf had the tenderloin which he thought was great and I also had the Thai Margarita which had a spicy salted rim and was surprisingly delish. Service was very attentive and not at all pushy. For a mid-range dinner spot, it's as good as it gets! Entrees about $20-35.   The hostess was friendly and accommodating. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Went on a date!! Tried the popcorn bacon  OMG to die for!! I love popcorn and bacon... And together heaven!! The service was impeccable and they were very knowledgeable."}
{"text":"Love the chopped salad. Great happy hour. The rest of the menu is also good. Drinks are good and reasonably priced"}
{"text":"The chopped salad was as good as they say it is. The salmon was perfect in the salad. I wish I could recreate it because I could eat that salad every day! The scallops and short ribs were divine. Really great food and our waitress was amazing!"}
{"text":"The food is fantastic, and the staff is very friendly.  We sat outside on the patio during the perfect evening.  We wouldn't change anything about the place.  Definitely recommend the popcorn, fondue and house salad.  All photo and news worthy!  Go try this place out now!"}
{"text":"I'm always skeptical about going to a nice restaurant with the kids - will there be something for them to eat?  will the servers be accommodating and nice to my kids? will it be noisy enough to cancel out the occasional yelling of the toddler? Citizen Public House met all our needs and exceeded every expectation.  For starters, they have a TON of gluten free items.  I don't mean salad and broiled chicken.  I mean battered pork fingers and corn waffles.  We were thrilled, major bonus!  Then, the meatloaf was amazing - not traditional mushy meat loaf but not so \"out there\" that the toddler wouldn't eat it, so another huge bonus there. Finally, the noise level was just right - we could talk without yelling, didn't hear anyone else's conversations, but there was still plenty of sound and buzz so that it felt totally crowded and fun...and the little guy could make some noise without disturbing anyone else. The server was excellent, the busser brought our straws out neatly on a napkin.  Food came out quickly but not so fast that it felt like we were being rushed.  Service was attentive and polite and everyone treated my kids like guests, not pests which I really appreciate since they order as much as adults do and I expect that they should be treated as customers. Thanks Citizen Public House for a great evening out for the whole family!"}
{"text":"I can't believe it took me so long to try this place! The fondue was delish and came with sausage, bread and fresh pears. The pate was so incredible I almost forgot I was eating rabbit. The meatloaf is big enough for two and looks like a decadent dessert. Speaking of dessert, if you don't have room, be sure to take home a bag of bacon pecan brittle. YUM. Everything was perfect from the service to the presentation. Great food. Friendly atmosphere. Amazing value!!"}
{"text":"A great option for something different.    Found this place when attending a Yelp event, liked it so much I came back.  Great service.  Nice atmoshpere.  Great Alcohol options.  I thought the lamb meatballs were so good that I ordered the lamb burger but was sadly disappointed.  Tzatziki is very good.  Dessert options are wonderfu so be sure to save room."}
{"text":"Great ambiance but a little loud. I couldn't hear what the people were saying just a person over to my left.. Conversation was hard.  The wait staff was friendly and the place was clean.  Very busy place in old town Scottsdale right in the middle of everything and not far from all the bars.  The original chopped salad was amazing!! I've never had anything like it! I would go back again just for the salad!  The short ribs were good and you can fork it off without a knife but I felt like it was a bit dry.  Flavored were good though.  The mash potato was sweet underneath.. Which I wasn't a fan of but I suppose it goes well with the short rib flavor and the coffee compote sauce.  The mint chocolate budino was a little too sweet for me and the mint taste wasn't apparently strong.  The cookie on top was frozen and really hard to break into to share.  The desserts here were not my favorite but a big win with that chopped salad.  The smoked salmon and pesto dressing made the flavors but the kale, sunflower seeds and some black fruit gave it a crunch!  I want it again already!  I liked the salad so much I went back the next day before my flight to get the chopped salad to go so I can eat it for dinner on my way home!!! Loved it and couldn't stop thinking about it!!"}
{"text":"Now, really, how much better can it get than expertly made cocktails and sausages dipped in cheese fondue at happy hour prices?  It can't."}
{"text":"First time in Scottsdale AZ. Originally from San Francisco, CA. Loved the food. Just as good as what you may expect from a SF restaurant. I had crab cakes and the cos which were both great. The Cod was delicious and the veggies cooked perfectly. My dining partner had the scallops which were also great with the peanut butte jar for dessert. Great meal highly recommend!"}
{"text":"i dine at citizen any night of the week and enjoy taking friends who've not had the cph pleasure.  it's hard to explain/justify the greatness of signature chopped salad (i end up selling it my dinner mate du jour saying the salad is so good it has its own facebook fan page). the location is great, in the heart of old town and easy to get to as cph is on the corner of 5th and craftsman ct.  the vibe on any going night is easy going no matter how busy it is.  the familiar faces that do the meet and greet is an added touch being as how i notice with every visit cph is busy.   the atmosphere lighting is great and so is decor.  the seats in dining room could be a bit more \"cushiony\" to promote more relaxation.   menu terminology/ingredients could be dumbed down a bit diners who aren't the gourmand.  thankfully my girlfriend erica explained to me what an heirloom potoato is.  oh i get it, when asking what \"this\" is on the menu, the server can seize the moment to \"sell\" the dish to my awaiting tastebuds.  still, it's always a turn on to read and KNOW/imagine what the ingredients are than having to wander.  chopped salad and pork rind apps are top notch. i enjoyed the chicken with risotto, the smoke flavor was a bit much. chicken and waffles?  eh, the waffle was had a bit too much \"buckwheat\" taste to it.   mac and cheese would be much tastier if not served with sweet salsa on top.    i always receive impeccable service when sitting at the bar to eat.  drinks are great and i appreciate the bartender being constant in his attention to service /detail when i appear.  I've been a patron 8+ times now. he is singlularly responsible for the 2nd visit which has turned into unplanned but definite neverending visits to cph.  i order out here and there from cph.  when i came in one night to pick up the food he rang me up and i told him to keep the change, as i always tip when picking up take out.  (i'm in the service business). he thanked me and then asked if he could get me a drink while my order was being bagged.  i pick up all the time and am never asked this by waitstaff. this made the difference. i enjoyed a shirley temple in a to go cup and naturally he served it without charging.  i don't own a large operation like cph but how nice was it be served a non alcoholic beverage grazie.  again, the little added touches are what keeps a customer coming back.  if only other establishments offered free soft drinks while waiting for food.  the women's bathroom appears to be cleaned every time i've had to use lady's room. i've not yet (can't believe it) consumed any dessert.  i'm also wanting to try the grits app.    every person i've taken to cph has enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Disappointed. Based on rave reviews a group of friends booked a dinner. Upon arrival, the restaurant was busy, not crazy, but there was a lack of ambience of energy. I found the decor, layout and lighting uninspiring for a place with such raves in a trendy part of town. Onto the food..The portions are small. I felt like I was in an upper east side restaurant in Manhattan where skinny women eat. The beet salad was a frisee salad that had a few chunks of beets. If they were fresh, I couldn't have told you. The appetizers aka bar snacks  arrived at same time as our first course salads. That defeats the point of ordering something to snack on. It was olives, it didn't need to be cooked. And again, if they were fresh and unique, I couldn't tell you. Entrees are pitifully small for the price. Portions of them were yummy, but the scallops arrived with a cooked greens, stems attached and all of us were pulling them from our mouth. If it's on the plate it should be edible. Cut the stems off in the kitchen please. The meatloaf appeared to be the best entee of the 5 we tried. Dessert was the mini size, the 3 tablespoons of mousse side.  This is a pub..  I know it's an upscale pub but if I was expecting to healthier size portions. Service was attentive initially, multiple servers. We were talking asked if we wanted coffee with desserts, we were not askecif we wanted a second cocktail. Our waters were filled.  But hey, based on these reviews, it was like I walked into the wrong restaurant."}
{"text":"A MUST!!!!! Ask for SAM!!! I'm serious, he is what made our whole experience! Amazing recommendations, AH-MAZING food and fantastic drinks! My husband got the Manhattan and I had a France white wine ($5 on HH 3-6 M-F) and an espresso martini! TO DIE FOR!!! We also got the hummus & flatbread, cheese & meat (HH $6), Chop Salad (like a boss!!!) and scallops!!!! Ohhhhh and we had this phenomenal peanut butter and chocolate dessert. Most importantly - ask for SAM! He will make sure you LOVE what you get! Never met a waiter more passionate about what he does. Go here!!!!"}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite places in Scottsdale. The food is delicious, atmosphere is great (although a bit loud on busy nights) and the waiters/staff are all friendly! It can be quite loud on busy nights, but I think that's  a good sign, it's busy! The chopped salad...no words. Just order it.  A great way to try this place is during restaurant week. Twice a year."}
{"text":"We had dinner in this newly opened restaurant from the former chef of Cowboy Ciao, Bernie Kantak. The location is very central and the room is spacious and not as noisy as other nearby restaurants such as FNB. The menu is excellent, with many good entree choices priced at $18 and below. Bernie's legendary chef's salad at $10 made a superb shared starter, followed by an organic chicken breast served over a rice pilaf. The wine list is excellent and extremely well-priced by today's Scottsdale standards(Lyeth Meritage for $9 per generous serving). Our waitperson, Ashley, was extremely attentive and enthusiastic. Worth a visit."}
{"text":"I had heard a lot of good things about this restaurant but after I decided to give it a try, I won't be back. Everything my party had to eat was heavily over salted and couldn't even taste the food. The drinks were okay and the service was okay but nothing special."}
{"text":"Wonderful food and service!  I was in Scottsdale for work and found this gem on Yelp.  Highly recommend walking through Old Town to get a feel for the area, though of course the weather might dissuade you.   Sat at the bar.  Had two Manhattans, olives, and the Scallops.  The bartenders were professional, courteous, and very friendly.  Even gave me a slight discount because I changed seats so another party could all sit together.  Little things like that really make me advocate for a restaurant.  Beyond that, the food was wonderful.  You can tell a lot of thought and passion went into their menu selections, and I was happy to partake in the offerings listed above.  I'll definitely visit again the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try Citizen Public House. I ended up going there to celebrate my birthday with a couple of friends, though I felt like we left somewhat disappointed.   When we initially walked into the restaurant and the vibe is upbeat, trendy, but cozy. There were two very bubbly kids that were standing around chatting with each other and didn't notice us for a couple minutes. We didn't have reservations, so they said it would be 15-20 minutes, which was fine, but this was a Tuesday night and there were at least 7 open tables, some of which were never filled while we were there. They also seemed to seat one of their friends who didn't have reservations as we overheard. That was a little frustrating but I was still excited.   We sat down and our waitress was very friendly. She apologized for the wait and immediately took our drink order.   I tried the beef short ribs which I thought was good, though, very fatty and somewhat small portion for 31 dollars. My friend had the lamb burger which he said was good, but somewhat dry. Overall, it was a pretty good experience, the food made up for the rest of the experience and I will go back again to try more."}
{"text":"If 6 stars was an option for 1 out of 100 ratings, this would be the restaurant that got it. Hands down best staff, service and food I've had in a while.   We had the bacon popcorn, chopped cobb, and buttermilk chicken. All were amazing. Try the specialty drinks, the journeyman was refreshing.  Sam was our waiter and he really made the experience special."}
{"text":"Cool ambience and friendly staff, coupled with awesome drinks and food!  The moment I walked in till my departure, I was served with care and great delicious dishes."}
{"text":"Great food, great wine and great service!  Thank you Kerrie for being so accommodating for our party!  We had a blast and I would def recommend this place to everyone who will listen to me!!"}
{"text":"This was hands-down our favorite restaurant while visiting Scottsdale.  It has a lively, trendy vibe, fabulous service, and impeccable innovative food that's not too stuffy.   First, the hosts and waitstaff were exceptional and very helpful. Sam our waiter was wonderful throughout -- super knowledgeable and honest.  Cocktails are the bomb -- definitely try the spicy Thai margarita.  Don't miss the original chopped salad (which has its own Facebook page). It really is special.  We also tried the burrata and a special of the evening -- an amazing ramen with Argentine spot prawns.  The cocoa jar for dessert was also fabulous.  I wish we had more nights in Scottsdale as we would have definitely returned!"}
{"text":"Had dinner our second night visiting Scottsdale from Los Angeles and I have to say, I was extremely impressed. We sat at the bar where both of the bartenders were extremely friendly, and truly knew the menu and what to recommend. We tried the Chopped Salad which was to die for, the scallops were amazing, the spare ribs were fabulous, and what can go wrong with popcorn with bacon added? Come on now. Definitely a place to try and a place to come back to!"}
{"text":"Citizen Public House is a very popular fine dining establishment with a brew pub atmosphere.  The food is uniformly well-prepared, tasty, and attractively-presented.  The portions tend towards large, especially the rack of lamb which has about a pound of meat in it. The service is exemplary; the staff really tries to provide whatever you need (or think you need) and with genuine warmth instead of a frozen smile.  Should be five stars.  But what's the story, Richie?    Well, the story is that Citizen Public House doesn't measure up completely as a five-star fine food establishment.  The food is not innovative and the flavor profiles are simple.  Worse, it is just too darn LOUD!!  Noisy restaurants are a \"style\" today, but not my style.  On the other hand, Citizen Public House doesn't qualify as a five star casual eatery, because the prices are too high.  I really would like to sample the cuisine again, but I am not willing to subject myself to the audio assault (if you use a hearing aid and can turn it off, it might be okay).  I would like to go when it is not crowded, but apparently that is never -- be sure you make reservations."}
{"text":"While traveling to Scottsdale for a conference at the JW Marriott, we decided to venture off the resort to have dinner in Old Town Scottsdale.  Citizen Public House came highly recommended, and delivered a tremendously fun dining experience last night.  On a Wednesday night, Citizen was still pretty busy when we walked in around 8:30.  We were taken care of my Greg, who was one of most enthusiastic servers I've ever encountered, but he was a true service professional who really knew the menu from top to bottom, and talked about the cocktails, food, and dessert options with no difficulty, giving his appraisals as he went.  We started with the Char Siu pork tacos and Citizen's well-known chopped salad, which was mixed tableside by Greg.  I can see why people love the chopped salad, particularly with respect to its presentation, but the Char Siu tacos, while good, were less memorable.  For entrees we tried the evening special, a Bavette steak, the short ribs, and the venison loin.  The highlight for me was the venison loin, which was presented rare, exactly as ordered.  Nice cold center but well seared on the outside.  The bavette steaks were not quite as successful.  Based on preferences at the table, one was ordered super rare (blue) the other was ordered medium rare.  However, both came out pretty similarly cooked (I'd call it rare), and in fact the one ordered medium rare seemed to be the one less cooked despite the fact that it came out a few minutes later.   We enjoyed the steaks nonetheless.  Finally, the braised short rib was well executed with a coffee rub, again not particularly memorable but still a dish we enjoyed.  I really enjoyed the cocktails and in particular their barrel aged options.  The Instant Gratification was a scotch-based cocktail with Cognac and Amaro, and it's pure alcohol.  Definitely a slow sipping cocktail.  I also enjoyed tasting the Manhattan, which was well-made.  Their wine list is reasonably extensive and has options in all price ranges. We enjoyed the 2013 Chappelet Mountain Cuvee for $45.  Overall, this was a tremendously fun restaurant that was enhanced by our excellent server, Greg.  While the execution on the food was a bit uneven, I'd give high marks for presentation, quality of cocktails, and ambiance."}
{"text":"Great location, nice decor, varied selection, friendly and swift service, questionable value.  While in Phoenix for business, I stopped in to Citizen Public House on behalf of the overwhelming number of great reviews. I enjoyed my food and drink, I really liked the location and the decor, the service was great, but I walked away with a sour taste on behalf of the value component. Few things put me off more than the feeling of being ripped off, no matter how good I think the end product was. The end doesn't always justify the means. And I know...it's Scottsdale, but I'm from Brooklyn. I'm no stranger to expensive food. I still know what my money should look like on the plate.  I ordered the filet asada tacos, and I just wasn't down with the $16 they ran me. The 3 tacos were small, not particularly full, and came with a half a roasted corn cob. Everything tasted good, but at the end of the day that's basically $5 for a taco. Maybe a little more. And they weren't even very substantial. I feel pretty strongly that either a couple dollars should come off that price tag or another taco needs to be thrown on the plate.   I was still hungry so I ordered the flatbread/hummus app to tide me over. All in all, it's a nice spot but I wouldn't be back."}
{"text":"Know everyone has posted about Chop Salad and Pork Belly Pastrami.  You really need to try the Duck Burger it was heaven!!"}
{"text":"Came here this evening with family while I was visiting from out of town. The area where the restaurant is seems really lively and hip but it seemed quiet, even for a Sunday night. One down side was that the restaurant seemed to lack atmosphere. It seemed really dark in there too.   We were seated immediately and our waiter was really great. He was really knowledgeable about the food and drinks, asked me where I was from (and even remembered at the end of the meal), and truly made us feel at home.   We decided on the bone marrow to start. The pancakes it came with were delish, but I didn't really taste the marrow. The meals were: short ribs, cod, scallops, and the deconstructed chicken Cesar. Everything was really delicious. I had a particular craving for meat, so the short ribs totally hit the spot we finished our meal with the peanut butter push pop and some of their bacon brittle. The push pop was good, but the brittle was hard to eat... my teeth were not diggin' it. I had really wanted the cake, but they were out!   Overall, it was a lovely evening! I'd definitely recommend."}
{"text":"This has to be one of my most favorite restaurants in Old Town. I bought a Groupon or Livingsocial or some deal to try it for the first time. Went with the bf on a Friday for a date night. We got there around 7 or so and the place was relatively empty - I was slightly nervous but I'd heard so many good things about this place, I knew it must've just been early.   We started with two dirty martinis, more like filthy martinis - just how i like it. Then we ordered the Chicken and Waffles appetizer, so good. It was mouthwatering delicious, I probably could've eaten 5 more plates. Then we had the Chopped Salad. It's effing amazing. I dream of this salad - I mean it does have its own FB page. Writing this makes me want it in my belly this second. For dinner, the beau got the scallops and I got the short ribs. Everything was cooked to perfection. Oh don't forget to have a moscow mule while you're there too.   By the time we left, the place was packed and I was so full I thought I needed a wheelchair.   I'm sure I'll be back for that salad and to try just about everything else on the menu."}
{"text":"I came here with my friend for the first time. The restaurant itself was nicely decorated and the service was great.   We ordered two appetizers, Bernie's Mac and cheese and chicken gizzard. Bernie's Mac and cheese was very good. You can taste the bread crumbs and tomatoes that were mixed in it and it had the right amount of cheese! The only thing I didn't like about it were the lemon zest that was in it. Chicken gizzards were lightly battered and deep fried and it kind of tasted like popcorn chicken.   For our entrees, we ordered the lamb burger and meatloaf. The meatloaf was simply amazing! It was very juicy, tender and it perfectly tasted well with the mash potato served on the plate. I wasn't a big fan of the lamb burger because the meat was dry and also the sauce that you dip your fries into had an unusual taste to it. It wasn't ketchup, but was some sweet red sauce that left a nasty after taste.   Desserts: We also ordered the coconut lemon dessert. I forgot what it was called but it sure was amazing!! The tapioca coconut pudding with small pieces of mangos in it was phenomenal!!"}
{"text":"Wow! I had a incredible dinner here just last night. Everything was spot on from the moment we walked in the door- the hostess was delightful and welcoming, our server explained the cocktail list, and off we were. The cocktails were great I had the coastal sour along with another guest in our party and the others had something off the barrel aged list which was delicious as well. For starters we had the watermelon/beets, the bacon fat popcorn, and the tuna- all which were very innovative, interesting, and fun. For main courses we had the short ribs, scallops, and the hanger steak and nothing but rave reviews all around. Honestly- we couldn't have had a better time and our server (I can't remember his name unfortunately) was so helpful and friendly and described the dishes better than any menu could!"}
{"text":"Chopped salad is hands down my favorite salad. I usually dislike salads in general, but the chopped is something else entirely. I prefer to get it without meat and it's still pretty filling. That's usually my go to order here, they also have a good happy hour and the salad is on there too!"}
{"text":"Best meal we had on our trip to AZ! I loved the vibe and the food was delicious. The chopped salad was amazing and a must-try, and I also loved the Mac and cheese, ceviche, beet salad, and bbq sampler special. Our waiter was very patient and attentive to our large group. I wish we had one of these in LA!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, for example the chopped salad, crab cakes, beet salad, chai tuna! I would give the restaurant a five star but the noise level is deafening!"}
{"text":"Really neat vibe at the Scott. Would recommend for any meal or even just a drink if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Aside from terrible, dried out, flavorless, & non-creative desserts that do not even come close to reflecting how remarkable the rest of their dishes are, this restaurant is fantastic. Their signature salad is incredible. Their \"Persian\" drink is wonderful & very refreshing. Great fish dishes & very tender chicken. Not the best acoustics. Very loud restaurant."}
{"text":"Drove 30 min to check this place out. It made the perfect date night out with the husband. White table cloth, candle, menu that provided lots to talk about.  We got here 6pm on a Sunday night and were one of about 3 tables in a surprisingly big restaurant. By the time we left at 7:30 it was filling up nicely, but no wait.  Traded seats with my husband to have a better view of the bar which was romantic and manly at the same time (the bar, AND the gesture).  I ordered a Moe'scow Mule to drink (first one ever). Tasty and stayed ice cold my entire meal in that cool copper mug.  Hubby got the Original Chopped Salad and I got the other chopped salad - started with an M...Mir...I can't remember.  We SHARED which I highly recommend - these salads were a tastebud sensation - lots going on and they were different but both delicious.  Hubby ordered the Scallops (3-4 HUGE savory scallops, with gritts) and I ordered the Filet Mignon (cooked to perfection, awesome piece of meat, plenty to share with husband, on mashed potatoes and mushrooms).  We skipped dessert since we had Ben and Jerry's waiting for us at home. So lame I know.  Some deserts looked interesting - some involved BACON.  Bill came to $96.  This is a place that will keep you talking and bring out the foodie in anyone.  Enjoyed the ambiance, old 1920/1930's photos on the walls, and our knowledgeable/attentive server.  I'm feeling stingy with holding back that last star because I thought about a restaurant like DURANTS that might have a leg up on CPH."}
{"text":"This spot is hands down the best place I went to in Scottsdale! The barrel aged cocktails were so good! Definitely go here if you are within 50 miles of this place it is so worth it!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere was a bit sterile, yet the service was excellent and the food was fabulous!  My husband and I shared the flat bread hummus, chopped salad and the grouper.  I will recommend to my friends and we will return!"}
{"text":"Visiting Scottsdale as I'm used to I wanted to try something new. New at least to me. I was staring at a hotel near this place and the reviews couldn't be better, but what really made me decide was the pictures showing a very unique kitchen. As I arrived the place was packed but traveling by myself has its advantages I was able to find a place at the bar. This guys are friendly and even though the bar was full, the service was excellent. Started with a glass of wine and the crab cakes. They arrive within 5 minutes oil ordered them. Taste was fresh and not fishy at all, loved how well they go with the salad and sauce they came on top of. They tastes very good but I am sure there has to be another appetizer in the menu that would actually blow my mind. Not a bad start at all  To follow the trout: presentation was a 10, cooked to perfection with skin as it should. The flavor as good and perfect it was, also it was also missing something, I was set up to be impressed but I was stopped just just short of it.   As good as the appetizer and the entree were I would not repeat these dishes as it is my believe there has to be a mind blowing dish... Maybe the scallops ?   To finish the bread pudding... It actually has bacon on it!! STOP THE PRESS!!! I've found it!! One out of three. This is just fantastic and mind blowing. apple and bacon bread pudding with brown butter ice cream is TO DIE FOR!  This gives solid grounds to my theory that there has to be other mind blowing items in the menu I have not tried.  This is a very solid 4 star restaurant, I just need my mind blown 3 out 3 but being so close to do so I will definitely give this restaurant a try"}
{"text":"The husband took me out for a night on the town, and I chose Citizen for dinner.   I have been wanting to try citizen for some time now, thanks to my yelp buddies, and was very excited that the time had come!  We made reservations for an early dinner before our show.  We arrived earlier than expected, no problem, they got us in right away.  Our server was quick, friendly, and knowledgeable.  He guided up through their specialty drinks and gave great menu suggestions.  We sampled a few of their specialty cocktails on happy hour, great drinks at a good price, and had the 'tender belly' bacon fat heirloom popcorn. I like that they list bar snacks and starters separately because this certainly isn't an appetizer, but its is a great bar snack.    I'd love to tell you what my husband had for dinner, whatever it was he liked it, but  you see my memory of the night is clouded by the memory of the decadent dream that is the Pan Seared Scallops.  Wouldn't you know, I had never had scallops before, well I have, but they have been raw, or just an ingredient in a pasta, I had been meaning to try them as the main course for awhile and boy am I glad I did. Scallops my friend, have been an underrated chorus girl in my life, but this dish gave them the chance to shine, and shine they did.  When given full billing they make you ashamed you had ever shoved them in the background in the first place. I will never again take scallops for granted.  I am actually in quite a pickle, because all of citizen's menu looks amazing, but I don't know that I can ever enter this establishment and order anything but those wonderful scallops again."}
{"text":"AMAZING!  I've never had a bad experience here. This is my absolute favorite place in Old Town. Chopped salad is amazing! My favs are the scallops and the chopped salad. The bartenders are nothing short of superb so order a crazy drink, it's bound to be good!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots in old town, food is always excellent and the drinks and service are great. Love the crab cakes, the omfg salad (Stetson chopped). Highly recommend for a date night or going out with friends."}
{"text":"2nd time at Citizen and it continues to impress me. We recently went in for my a big birthday celebration. Not only did they accommodate our larger group of 8, but also put us in the best seats in the house located half indoor/half outdoor.  We had an earlier reservation which was great because regular dining was allowed to partake in happy hour dining and appetizers. We enjoyed $5 glasses of champagne, rose and house wine. A friend ordered a Mint Julep which he loved.   Service was friendly, quick and very knowledgeable. Everyone enjoyed their meal. I had the scallops over corn grits and it was fantastic!!!  Perfect portion of food. Don't let the three scallops fool you. They are large and tasted delicious paired with the corn grits.   I highly recommend for cocktails and appetizers or a meal. Great for a special occasion as staff goes out of the way accommodate and make your experience wonderful."}
{"text":"The salad...Do I talk about the amazing decor? The friendly staff? The amazing scotch selection? The unique main courses? No. This review will focus on one thing only, the salad.  The original chopped salad is sold as an appetizer  but don't be fooled. It's a wonderful mixture of various ingredients topped with fresh salmon and an amazing dressing. It's wonderful to share... But who wants to do that?! Don't forget to wash it down with son Oban 14 year!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and warm decor at CPH. The food is solid but I was a bit let down. The famous chop salad was overly sweet and the menu is so overly red meat/bacon oriented. While that is tasty to be sure it's not that creative. The scallops were delish and the wine and cocktails were perfect. A bit more diversity to the menu would make it 5 stars for me."}
{"text":"I went here for dinner with a large group. The cocktails were just ok. Apps: The Original Chopped Salad was phenomenal, Bernie's Mac 'N Cheese was good and I didn't like the Kilt Lifter Fondue. Mains: the swordfish was pretty good but kind of tough and the Scallops were very tender.  Super cute place, great for a date or group."}
{"text":"We loved it.  Our server was friendly and interesting  We ordered the Members Only and a regular margarita. Both were enjoyable.  We came in for drinks and to try the chopped salad.  I, of course, loved it.  Since the other person with me doesn't like smoked salmon he would have preferred a different meat or fish.  They give you a recipe, so I will try it at home and use chicken.  In any case, he still liked it a lot which says something, when you don't  even like a main ingredient.  He was blown away by the pork belly pastrami.  So flavorful!    We came here from Cabo and had a layover until our flight tomorrow to San Francisco and thought it would be a good to roam around old town Scottsdale and try some of the ten things you must eat in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Amazing! I was with a group of six and we tried many dishes.  From the bacon popcorn to the drink service, we were delighted every step of the way. The place is a bit loud but that was perfect for us on a Friday night."}
{"text":"We had some people for out of town visiting and we were looking for a reservation for a large party and found Citizen Public. Me and my wife were the first to get there and right away the hostess tells us we have a hard out time at 8pm. We had a 6pm reservation. Sort of strange to me to pressure us right away but oh well  So they seat us in this semi private area with a large table away from the open dining area. You can see the dining area from our table. It just seemed like our server and hostess was very nervous to make sure we were out of there by 8. Anyways, our friends were a half an hour late which didn't help but oh well  I started off with the OMFG Chopped salad. It had raw salmon, dried corn, tomatoes, greens, etc with the dressing on the side. Mixed it myself. It was okay. Good salad. Would i order again. Not sure  I had the fair trade Short Ribs. Only reason I ordered this was because it was described as local coffee rubbed short ribs. Love coffee. You get four fairly large pieces of ribs with a dried cherry sauce on the side with some type of mashed potatoes and leafy greens. Ribs were moist and fell apart on a touch. Poured the cherry sauce on top and it was pretty good. Not great but good. The mashed potatoes were pretty good but just didn't think the greens went with this meal very good. So overall I thought the dish was ok.   My wife and son got the Amaro Meatloaf which was veal with mashed potatoes and roasted zucchini. It was pretty good. Moist and good. Thought the zucchini was overly seasoned but just my thoughts. It was a pretty good meal.   My mom and others got the tacos and it turns out this is three small street tacos. They said it was okay. Not sure. Didn't try but wasn't a lot.   Service was pretty good. Had people fill our water glasses. Check on us and took away our plates in a timely manner. Only thing that irked me was them constantly pressuring us to get out by 8pm. We left at 7:45 but felt pressured. So this didn't really help our meal. Didn't seem as pleasant as it could be.   The ambiance was very Downtown Scottsdale. Very loud. Upbeat. Dim lighting. Bar in the middle of dinning area.   So overall, the food was okay. Not great but good. Service really good but the pressure to get out was too much. Great upbeat ambiance for a younger crowd. Not really for older people who like peace and calm. Just really didn't feel the love at this place. So I give this place a 3 and a half star.   Will I ever come back is the true test. Not sure. The menu didn't really intrigue me but possibly I would give it another try."}
{"text":"I have to say, I think this restaurant may creep towards four stars, but the grand expectations from the Yelp reviews really let us down. Don't get me wrong, the food was not bad, but it didn't feel like anything stellar. We had some very nice dishes such as the chopped salad and swordfish.   However, the majority of the food just felt \"meh.\" The cheese fondue, although cute in appearance, wasn't very tasty. The crab cakes had a bit too much breading and the short ribs were a bit too dry and over cooked and scallops were a bit chewy.   In terms of ambiance, it's definitely a bit less adorned and decorated than I expected, and overall the restaurant was very loud making it difficult to have a conversation."}
{"text":"Hands down, forks up!! Easily one of the best restos in Scottsdale/PHX!! Meant as a compliment, closest to a NYC/BOS/CHI resto-by far-in AZ! Great food, fantastic informed servers, and seasonally-inspired menu. Can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Old town Scottsdale for sure. Old Town prices on food, small portions but tasty. Prices on beers were fair for Old Town but nothing local and nothing too exciting beer wise, as is typical with Old Town the featured beverages are overpriced mixed drinks with fancy names-best to avoid them.  Food as I said had small portions but had an eclectic menu with a lot of variety and was prepared well."}
{"text":"I went here for my graduation dinner and I don't think I could have picked a better place. We had reservations, but got there an hour early and they were able to seat us immediately. Absolutely loved the vibe and ambience of the place. I would highly recommend the original chopped salad and the filet mignon tacos. You can't go wrong with their Manhattan either."}
{"text":"This place is legit. My wife and I started with the Heirloom Popcorn w Tender Belly Bacon Fat and then split the Burger and the Original Chopped Salad w Smoked Salmon. We only got the Chopped Salad because of the reviews. The hype is real!! It's the best salad I've ever had."}
{"text":"This restaurant is another one of Scottsdale's treasures.  Very nice atmosphere, friendly staff, and great food!  I underestimated the chopped salad.  It doesn't look like much, but it tastes wonderful!  Great drink menu, too."}
{"text":"If there was an option for 6 stars, I'd give it. This place is beyond great; from atmosphere and service, to drinks and food.   I have been meaning to write about Citizen's for a month now. I find that it's a breath of fresh air in a field of farts. Old Town had become so....well, old and it leaves a lot to be desired in the way of \"classy joints\". This is a perfect marriage of class and fun; I'd say laid back elegance, if you will.  The interior decor is such a drastic difference from the old Club \"Next\". It's sleek, modern yet comfortable, great bar space and patio and even rooms for private parties. I love the fresh flowers and candles.   I went with a girlfriend of mine and we sat at the bar. We started off with two specialty cocktails. I don't recall the names but one had cucumber and the other had freshly brewed tea in it. They were complex, fresh and most importantly, STRONG. Richie the bar manager took great care of us. He created their drink menu which is accessible but exotic. He is super knowledgeable and friendly. 2 things you need in a bartender. He's easy on the eyes too, so that helps.  For dinner, we shared the pork belly pastrami appetizer, chopped salad and scallops entree. Everything from start to finish was fantastic-you could taste and see Chef Bernie's influence in every dish. Complex flavors yet still had a comfort food feel, which I loved. At the end of the meal, Chef Bernie came out and talked to us. We saw him talking to every table and spending some time with all the guests which is pretty impressive, considering we went within the first two weeks they opened. He is a goddamn genius. Also, easy on the eyes...  At the end of the meal, I went to the bathroom and may have had too much to drink because I dropped my phone in the toilet. Richie offered me his extra cell phone for a few days until I got a new one. Now THAT'S service!   This place is awesome and you can't help but love and support two of the coolest dudes doing some innovative things with food and booze. Go support your local rock stars!"}
{"text":"Great service, great mixology, great food and great atmosphere.   Loved the Beef Belly BLT, Boulvardier, Negroni, Pacific Coast Cocktail"}
{"text":"The appetizers were amazing. Service was excellent. The original chopped salad is truly amazing. Nothing like it! We also had the Burrata and it was excellent. Ditto for the curry bisque...  slight kick and totally delicious. The drinks were good... but a little over hyped. For an entrée our server recommended the scallops but we decided to split the meatloaf... we probably should have listened to our server... stay away from the meatloaf. Honestly it was amazingly ordinary given how excellent the appetizers, salad and soup were.  All in all, a great choice. Definitely would recommend. Thanks's Yelp!"}
{"text":"Favorite restaurant! The roasted buttermilk chicken and the chopped salad are amazing!"}
{"text":"Great space.  Not too loud.  Sitting next to the false wall that opened to the outside and feeling the nice October breeze made for a soothing evening.    Nicely paced service.  - The beet salad was great!  Except for the tomatoes.  The tomatoes didn't go well with it at all.  However, the rest of the salad was splendid.    - My main, the pork shank was ridiculously huge.  By itself, it had a nice bark and a mild flavor, but combined with the preparation, it was excellent.  Savory, sweet, and smooth.  I really enjoyed my experience and will be back."}
{"text":"Everything about this place led to a great experience.  The food and drink menu are small but everything we picked was awesome.  Prepare yourself to try everything on the menu because you have to know how each item tastes.  I will be going back again soon and would recommend to anyone else looking for a good place on a regular week night."}
{"text":"Went here twice in 2 days during a trip to Scottsdale.  This was back in late May.  It's just that good.  Everything was delicious but what I loved most was there smashed potatoes. Just unreal.    Highly recommend to anyone looking for an outstanding meal and experience."}
{"text":"The chopped salad gets 5 stars, but the entrees get 3 stars, which puts me at an overall rating of 4. I had the scallops and grits...they were very flavorful, but a little too heavy on the oil.  Husband had meatloaf and said it was average.  We both loved the chopped salad though.  I wish it was a littlebit larger because I would be perfectly happy eating it as my entree."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant for my birthday, it was delicious! The server was quite attentive and helpful. The food was excellent! I'd had a meal Mastro's the night before, this meal was much more tasty and about a third of the price. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is that it was a little on the loud side-not too loud to carry on a conversation though."}
{"text":"I loved Citizen Public House and more importantly, their chopped salad.  We had a large group of girls celebrating a bday and walked in kind of late with no reservations.  Because we had to wait a bit, the staff opened up a bottle of champagne on the house and let us start the night with some bubbly.  Everyone loved what they ordered and special shout outs go out to the chopped salad (again), buttermilk roasted chicken and pan seared scallops.  The service was excellent and I would come back in a heartbeat whenever visiting Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service! I especially recommend the chop salad :). They allowed me to call in my order 10 minutes before the kitchen closed so I was able to eat before they closed."}
{"text":"Very special menu, including fried rabbit.  We had short ribs...fabulous. Plus the service was great.    Beautiful atmosphere too."}
{"text":"Best food in town!!  The hummus is wonderful and the chopped salad incredible. I highly recommend Citizens to anyone."}
{"text":"What a fantastic break from the monotony! Although I have been here before this place truly never disappoints. We arrived around 7pm to a packed house. There were a couple of seats at the bar and we walked on up. The bartender Will greeted us right away and crafted cocktails for us. We were looking for a great Cosmopolitan and in lieu of that he presented us with \"The Socialite\".  Very tasty, light, sweet with a non abrasive tartness and a hint of effervescent. Now for the edibles. The Jucy Lucy, stuffed with two cheeses, one being Velveeta and cooked to order fries that arrived hot and crispy and perfectly seasoned. The Original Chopped Salad which give you the best part of a salad without all that annoying lettuce in the way. Cous-Cous, smoked Salmon, corn and so much more, tossed table side and perfectly dressed. And of course there's the Mac N Cheese. Although, the noodles were a bit aldente, the sauce paired well with it. A happy marriage of Gruyere, Swiss, emetic and spices and the best part a tomato onion relish tested on top. Each bite of this decadent pasta paired so well with the relish as it cut through the heaviness of the cream sauce.   So in Short awesome service, fantastic food. No wonder they were busy.... We will be back!"}
{"text":"This is the perfect place to take a group of people for an amazing dinning experience! Thomas is our favorite bartender! He always has  unique cocktail suggestions to start the evening off right! Moscow Mule is a good one! Fun and excellent priced happy hour! The scallops and chop salad are my favorite, but it is all so yummy! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This place does it well in every way.  I had my birthday dinner here for a party of 16 on a Saturday night in December.  I had previously tried Citizen during restaurant week but my BF who arranged the evening had never been.  They seated us at a wonderful table near the front of the restaurant in the semi private alcove.  It was perfect, very intimate and I was able to hear everyone and mingle and socialize with my party.  The service was absolutely fantastic - never was anyone in my party left thirsty as our alcohol tab demonstrated at the end of night.  We actually had 2 servers who circulated and made sure that everyone knew what wine was open, etc.  We were there for over an hour before we began ordering appetizers.  When I apologized to the server, saying I hoped we were not taking too long in case there was another seating for the table, he told me not to worry at all, that this was ours for the night.  I like a leisurely paced dinner, especially when I'm the guest of honor.  My BF had bought me a Lisa's Rum cake, and even though they charge a $25 fee to handle and serve the cake, they did a wonderful job.  I declared it the best bday I had ever had :)    They are owned by the same group as Cowboy Ciao, which I have been a longtime fan of.  The original chopped salad which has it's own facebook page, yes, yes - they have it, and therefore I have not been able to order anything else to start.  It's just perfect.  I have also ordered the scallops each time I've been.  Corn grits and bacon along with cola gastrique combine with the scallops into the most awesome flavor and texture.  Not at all sweet, but rich and complex.  I also enjoyed their Moe'scow mule and they have a nice wine list.  The BF got the short ribs, and the first time he really really liked them.  I apparently tasted them but I was 2 hours into my bday dinner, and I can hardly remember due to the 2 martinis and countless glasses of wine. When we recently went back a week ago, he again ordered the short ribs, but he seemed less enthusiastic.  I tasted them, and I found the short rib itself to be quite good, tender, flavorful.  I did not care for the dried cherry bbq sauce.  I found it to be acidic and sweet, but not balanced at all.  The smell also turned me off.  I would go so far as to call it pungent.  It didn't compliment the short ribs, and neither did the roasted parsnip puree it was served with.  It was just too sweet.  I applaud their creativity, but in this case it just didn't work for me and I would have preferred something more garlicky and mellow.    Dessert and Espresso were fantastic, have tried the donutbread pudding and also the one with the chocolate pot de creme which I thought was more interesting.  Overall a totally solid 4 stars.  We will definitely be back again and again."}
{"text":"Great food, great staff and perfect execution. Beyond that, it's hard to add anything substantive to the already long list of great reviews. I can't wait to go back. You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"After an event at the Montelucia my girlfriend and I headed to old town with another couple looking for a good dinner spot. We ended up at the Citizen House on their one month anniversary.  The first thing was the service was great. As soon as we walked in we were greeted and sat. Within minutes we had a server taking our drink orders and asking for apps. The only negative is the kitchen still may be learning because our food took a while.  We ordered the fondue and popcorn for apps and they were both great. The only thing is they don't give you enough dipping food for the fondue but bring you extra for more money. The popcorn was unreal I mean bacon flavored popcorn who could ask for more?  For entrees our table ordered the scallops, chicken and chopped salad. All received great reviews. For dessert we order the bread pudding which was good not great. The bread pudding was a little bland but the makers mark ice cream was great.   I will be making the Citizen House a regular stop in my old town dinner rotation."}
{"text":"Great food. Unique mixed drinks. Their chopped salad may be the best salad ever eaten."}
{"text":"Great experience!! We were feeling like trying multiple flavors/styles, so once we heard about the lamb chop special app that was it! Ordered that, olives, bread with dipping sides, shrimp ceviche, and the Mac n Chs - all to share! It was so fun. Flavors were awesome and presentation so attractive. The staff was very professional. Can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"I've been waiting to try this place for a few weeks and finally got the chance on Easter. We started with the Mac and cheese and chopped salad... The chopped salad is everything they hype it up to be. AMAZING. Best salad I've ever had and I anticipate ordering it for lunch a few days a week. The Mac and cheese was ok - but the waitress never really recommended it anyway. Between our table we got the rack of lamb, short rib entree, and meatloaf... The short ribs were BY FAR the best thing by a mile. The meatloaf was good - very well prepared and the rack of lambs were simply standard... I wouldn't get them again but I would try the scallops next time. The desert is the best thing in Scottsdale - heart of caramel! Trust me on that one!!!  Service was wonderful but you can tell they are busy. I'm giving it a four star because the rack of lamb for 38.00 was very average and I was walking away pretty disappointed with that meal."}
{"text":"A trip through Scottsdale brought my Hubbie and into this restaurant.  We got in a bit early for dinner and got to enjoy 1/2 off drinks before starting off with the catfish appetizer.  One bite and angels were singing in my ears-the best I've ever had times a thousand!  Definitely recommended.  For entree I went with the short ribs and they too were sensational.  I travel regularly for work from Seattle to SF to LA and this place is the top of my list."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place, and everything I have ordered there so far...  I went for the first time this week and later in the week sent my mom and brother because I liked it so much.    The original chopped salad was as delicious as always.  I had a hard time deciding between the scallops, the halibut and the meatloaf.  They were out of the halibut, so scallops and meatloaf it was.  The servers I spoke to were all very knowledgeable about the menu.  I am not sure I could pick one meal over the other next time.  I liked them both so much.  I guess I am always going to have to drag someone with me and do the ordering for the both of us.  I can't wait to try the bacon brittle.  :-)"}
{"text":"Delicious! Great service from Jordan, and nice comfortable upscale atmosphere. Prime Bavette steak was perfectly cooked and well seasoned, but the bone marrow risotto was the star of the dish for me."}
{"text":"Headed here after picking my husband up from the airport on a Wednesday night - a little nicer than I was going for, as we were pretty casual, but very nice atmosphere.  The scallops were to die for, and I had a really tasty seasonal mule.  Would definitely dine here again."}
{"text":"The chopped salad was TO DIE FOR, but I wasn't the hugest fan of the short rib entree I got. Overall would recommend this place in Old Town Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Two words - Chopped Salad!!  Oh my gosh. It's so good that every time we know we are heading to Scottsdale for a work trip, our team immediately makes reservations here and can't stop thinking about the chopped salad.  In fact, when we tell partners who have never been here and are going to join us about the salad beforehand they always say \"salad? what's so special about a salad?\" but then they are the first one asking for a second order!  I can't eat salmon so they make a chicken one for me.  The cocktails here are always delicious and they make a great sazerac which is my favorite.  For entrees I have had the short ribs and the pork shank and both are amazing but I might say short ribs are my favorite but just slightly.  The service here is always outstanding.  This restaurant is definitely our favorite in Scottsdale which is why we always return when in the area."}
{"text":"Molten drinks please.  Grand Master Mixologist Richie Moe @CitizenPubHouse whipped up a couple shots for my wonderful wife and I that brought much of the bar to a silence on a crowded Saturday night. When he heard we were celebrating our anniversary he said he'd like to make us a special drink...and he felt like burning something.  The end result was kind of like bananas foster in a shot glass.  It involved melting Mexican chocolate in a metal mixing cup, flaming 160 proof black strap rum, Richie repeatedly pouring a flaming mixture of orange liquid with blue flames from cup to cup in an arc that captured everyone's attention.  Outstanding drink with an outstanding show leading up to it.  We've been to CPH twice and had great food and outstanding drinks each time.  If I am in the mood for a cocktail, this is where I want to go. If you're in the mood to go out for drinks and a bite, this is your place. Enjoy."}
{"text":"Happy Birthday Elizabeth. I'm still smiling that your birthday is on the same day as my oldest daughter. Happy Birthday TJ.   This is a wonderful dinner house in Old Town. The use of white and black in the interior design creates a stunning and dramatic decor. White table cloths and napkins. Intimate nooks where a family or group can dine at a large table. Family photos framed and grouped on walls in a very precise manor. Excellent touch.  I begin with a Junipero martini 12. with a twist of lemon from Elixabeth. Did I say that right? A superb intoxicologist, super friendly and very sharp. She introduces me to Andrew Fritz, one of the partners and very friendly front man.  We speak of the upstairs, mixologist, partner, Richie Moe and I am sure that their new venture Citizen R+D will be cool as hell. Not to spill too much about the new venue but I can confirm the existence of a program known as Citizen Research + Development, upstairs over the Public House, that will showcase experimental procedures from the land of craft cocktails and spirits. Richie may become the worlds greatest living mixologist.  Last but not least Chef and partner Bernie Kantak. Bernie will be preparing a pork belly pastrami rye spaetzle with brussels sprout sauerkraut. 12. This appetizer is presented beautifully. These flavors mingle and marry and are a very nice treat. A little shout out to Thomas, I think we were having a little fun but after two drinks, I can't remember.  And I left forgetting to have desert, coffee and donuts 10. Next time my friends, next time."}
{"text":"OMG. Went here yesterday the second time. This time with lomita for my pre birthday dinner. While it is a bit loud, it's a fun atmosphere and the food and the service surpasses all your expectations. Our waiter Gary made this a special evening for us. We started with the pork belly pastrami (a party in your mouth), and then following with their famous chopped salad (it has it's own facebook page!!!), and shared the best filet mignon (\"pass penny please\") we had in a looooong time.  The desert, flourless chocolate cake with homemade strawberry ice cream, was on the house (nice touch) and served us well through the birthday night into the morning. Btw: make Gary sing, hehe"}
{"text":"Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink): 1 star:  Never again. 2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back. 3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad. 4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return. 5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.  One of our favorite restaurants in the Valley.  Even if they took the pork belly pastrami off the menu, I'd love this place a little less, but I'd still love.  Atmosphere, awesome.  Drinks, very good (despite loss of amazing bar program upstairs.)    More than anything, we have loved a meat-centric approach to this place, and though heavy, it is delicious.  Apart from the aforementioned pork belly pastrami, which is melt in your mouth good with the sauerkraut and mustard to cut the richness, we've also enjoyed the pork cheeks and crab cakes.  The crab cakes are juuuuuust above my cut-off for having enough lump crab in there to make it worth calling a crab cake, but it has made it, and it's tasty.  Get the meatloaf, embrace the amaro.  My wife (as always) get the branzino and she loves it.  Also had the short ribs which are a little heavy-handed on the rub, enough to leave a bit of bitterness on the meat (not in a good way), but on the whole, is not a bad dish.  Tracy Dempsey does their desserts.  Enough said.    So from atmosphere to drinks to food, this is definitely one of the best casual fine dining joints the Valley has to offer."}
{"text":"This review is just for the bar and drinks (no dinner).   This was just one of those places where I felt comfortable sitting around, sipping on a drink, and having a conversation. The ambiance was really nice and I loved being in that environment. Maybe this is only at night when I was there and maybe during the day because it's brighter you might not get the same feeling, but going at night is a treat.  There are dinner tables all around the outer part of the restaurant with the bar in the middle. The bartender who served us was very knowledgeable and was not in our face about ordering more drinks. He only came over when our drinks were low and didn't really bother us otherwise. He recommended the Manhattan and I loved it."}
{"text":"Great location. They had a good selection of seafood, which I prefer, and lots of meat choices (my wife's preference).  The waiter was extremely helpful.  We both thoroughly enjoyed the dinner, the ambience, and the whole experience."}
{"text":"Hubby & I celebrated our 8yr anniversary here!  We loved it all!  The chopped salad, short ribs, scallops and ended with the delicious sticky bun bread pudding! The cocktails were also delightful!  The service was exceptional, as well!"}
{"text":"Great drinks and some standouts on the menu. I like the Pubic house salad. This place also wins at ambiance. Not a lot of places lay it out well enough to be social with your group. This one does."}
{"text":"For a restaurant that is so frequently reviewed and so strongly reviewed, I had high expectations.  This place simply did not live up to the ratings.  The place was empty on a Friday night which should have been our first clue and the place was cold and unwelcoming which didn't alleviate those concerns. The food was plain and very underwhelming.  They had a good selection of beers which was definitely a plus but what place doesn't have a good selection of beers.  I do not understand what everyone else saw that I didn't for this place to earn such high ratings."}
{"text":"The food good.  The service horrible.  We came in at 4:30 pm on a Thursday. There was only one other table seated and lots of servers. They were far more concerned with chatting than anything. We ordered glasses of house wine that sat on the counter for ten minutes while our server Bradley tried to get it in with a hostess half its age."}
{"text":"Laidback atmosphere, excellent service, fun, fabulous food!  A friend and I sat at the bar and had a great time interacting with the bartender and another foodie patron at the bar. The wait staff seemd really knowledgeable with just the right attention to service.  I've enjoyed the Original Chopped Salad under a different moniker for years at Cowboy Ciao, so we decided to go with the Mirilton Chopped Salad: greens, tomato, popcorn, halloumi cheese, cucumbers and onions. The haloumi cheese was a unique treat, though overall it didn't really compare to the OCS.  We ordered the Pork Belly Pastrami starter, which was kind of a deconstructed reuben over spaetzle- it was almost perfect and the pork belly just melted in my mouth. The sea scallops were also heavenly, seared just so and served with buttery corn grits and a vinegary gastrique. We capped it all of with a pot de creme: super rich and just right for sharing.  We also enjoyed some red wine from Merkin (yes, THAT Merkin), the Maynard James Keenen winemaking venture- kind of neato, I haven't seen it in a restaurant before (watch \"Blood into Wine\" if you're lost).  I think this place has a little something for everyone, and for someone like me, it has it all. Its food is artful without being fussy, and the ambiance is cool without trying too hard."}
{"text":"Had been reading all of the Yelp reviews so I knew what I should order. Of course we did the chopped salad and it didn't disappoint. The bone marrow butter and bread- pass... scallops were amazing but for the price there should be at least 2 more, only 3 on the plate for $30.00. Only 1 steak on the menu so we had high expectations- average and the potatoes and tomatoes as a side were blah. Overall service was exceptional, great drinks and entrees that they are known for are great. Need to work on other options and increase serving size of scallops!"}
{"text":"Service was just ok, especially at 4:30 when it wasn't a busy time.  Loved that they had happy hour specials on weekends so we could try some appetizers and drinks.  Flatbread with tzatiki and hummus was very good, and the olives too.  Meatloaf with the potatoes was really tasty, big portion. The Chopped salad with salmon I would come back for. Next time without the salmon, there was so much flavor anyway. Friends loved the S'mores pot de creme for dessert.  Restaurant is set in a perfect place to walk off the food and window shop."}
{"text":"CHOPPED SALAD. All I have to say. I know everyone says this but that's because IT'S TRUE. It has gotten to the point where I order this salad as takeout for dinner at least once a week. Even my boyfriend, who strays away from his traditional caesar salad like 0% of the time, has been won over by this one. We've had many other things on the menu, the scallops, short ribs etc., and it has all been pretty good! However, I'd reccommend skipping everything else and just ordering as many chopped salads as you need to fill you up completely. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"went here for new year's eve dinner. high fixed priced menu kept it from being overcrowded. we had the patio all to ourselves. scallops were melt in your mouth. prob best scallops i've ever had. will def be going back soon for more!"}
{"text":"Finally, an AZ restaurant worthy of NYC praise: high quality and innovative, like my favorite restaurants in Manhattan. We sat at the bar, served by an awesome mixologist/bartender named Brandon, who is a fellow foodie as well. Was blown away by their signature dish: Pastrami topped Pork Belly and told Brandon to tell the Chef/Co-Owner that his Pork Belly was better than the famed Momofuku of NYC. He immediately went to the kitchen to pass the message, and it was much appreciated by Chef Bernie. Drinks made by Brandon were outstanding as well, my fav was their signature drink The Im-Port (Jameson, Port, tobacco and leather bitters, rock sugar rim etc). We also had the Smoked Duck, Short Rib and Lamb Burger - all great dishes. Highly recommended and will be pushing for a No Reservations or Layover episode here soon. GO!"}
{"text":"Sorry to be that person who speak the truth, because truth is bitter.  I agree the place is trendy and upscale, but it's overrated.   The service is good, they fill your empty water glass quite often and check on you if your cocktail is empty. But the main point is cocktail and food.  The cocktails are good but not up to the standards as mentioned. Its a two way street where the server/bartender understand what you like and dislike. You explain them and they serve what you like.   It didn't happen even after explaining a lot. I had to order Scotch on the rocks, even that was served with too much of ice,  after mentioning less ice. They should at least understand how to serve Scotch.  Coming to food. I am still hungry. I am not complaining about the portions, but the quality of the food itself. We had to force eat food because we were really hungry. Appetizer were somewhat good.  Everyone have different opinions, but this is my take on the place. Peace!!"}
{"text":"A friend recommended this place.  We went in for their happy hour.  3-6 we each had adding and shared the chopped salad.  How salad taste this good? Our waitress was great.  She had great recommendations.  I had the pork belly pastrami!  Which was awesome.  My only regret?  Not having room for many more dishes!  This place was great! I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Cuatro Reyes Caterers, from New York, flew in to do the Taco Explosion event in Scottsdale before the Craftoport wedding. After some hard work and serious wedding partying we dined at CPH. Gary, our waiter, could have made Taco Bell seem like a good idea but instead he was working with some seriously well executed victuals. The much overused pork belly got new life with their pastrami pork belly presentation. The oft mentioned chopped salad was really that good. Make sure you try their scallops. Six east coast food pros loved them... those who whine \"How can you get seafood in the desert\" need to simply accept that jets exist and quiet down. And then there was the short ribs entree. Lusciously braised then magically seared to form a crust. By the time you get to CPH the menu will have changed. If the staff remains, especially Gary, have no fear, a great meal is here!"}
{"text":"Rounding up from 3.5. Solid apps and entrees. Our dessert was a miss. Of course, chopped salad was very tasty and so was the bacon fat popcorn. For entrees we got the buttermilk chx (very juicy) and the shortrib (bbq sauce was on point) and both were solid. For dessert we got both the chocolate bread pudding and the to-go bacon pecan brittle and neither hit the spot, I almost wish I didn't eat them. Service was outstanding however. I would come back if in Scottsdale again."}
{"text":"Had eaten a ton while visiting but still wanted to try this place.  I'm not a huge pork belly fan so I couldn't quite enjoy the fattiness but I can see this being very delectable to those who do.  The sauerkraut is a nice touch.  Apparently the original chopped salad has its own Facebook page, which is fun and kind of annoying because I hate having to go to Facebook for everything nowadays.  Fortunately the waiter explained what was in it, which included things like smoked salmon, sunflower seeds and raisins.  I'm normally not a fan of smoked salmon or raisins (no, I don't hate everything, I swear) but it worked out well in this salad.  Shared the filet mignon with my wife as an entree.  Absolutely delicious.  We got the Moe'scow Mule and a Sazerac as drinks.  Both were made well."}
{"text":"This place deserves all of the hype that it gets. I came here a while back and can't boast enough about how delicious everything is. Get the Original Chopped Salad. Its enough for 2-4 people to share, and it's one of the best salads (if not THE best) I've ever had. Coming here was the first time I've ever tried scallops, and I this may have been the best place to take that chance--they were undeniably incredible. I will be back to CPH again to try everything on the menu. Seriously. It's that good.  Overall, if you're looking for a delicious meal with great ambiance, go to CPH. There's a reason so many people love it."}
{"text":"Truly superb from appetizers to entrees.  My wife took me to CPH for my birthday.  It was amazing.  Again, AMAZING.  Apps: Pork Belly was sublime with perfect meat and memorable flavors.  Tracy's chopped salad earned a smile at first bite.  Our little girl liked the mac & cheese.  Had the ribs for our dinners.  BEST.  RIBS.  EVER.  The cherry-based BBQ sauce was grin-worthy.  Greens were cooked perfectly and the mashed yams/potatoes combined perfectly.  And the bread pudding was loved by all.  The staff fit us in even though we didn't have a reservation.  I think they were kind to us since we had a baby in tow.  The front staff made faces and cooed at her.  Kat took care of us and earned her 25% tip.  Orders were fast; apps hit quickly followed shortly by entrees once the first plates were cleared; drinks never went more than half empty; and she was our 5-year old hit it off."}
{"text":"Love this place. Took the mother in law out for her birthday and couldn't have had a better experience. Try the fair trade short ribs. They are fall off the bone tender and the sour cherry BBQ sauce is an incredibly unique flavor. Service is quick and friendly. Lots of fun cocktails to sample. Side wall opens out to the patio- so you can enjoy the fresh air inside when the weather is nice."}
{"text":"Great food, great drinks and the perfect ambiance. What more could you ask for? Get the chop salad it never disappoints."}
{"text":"Old Town is a charming area in Scottsdale filled with cowboy western themed places and nestled among all of it is this classy foodie paradise.  On a Saturday night this place is popping with people. The restaurant is dimly lit and the ambience is casual cool.  A good place for a group of friends, but a bit loud for a romantic date.  You have to start your meal with their Facebook famous Original Chopped Salad ($13).  All you need to know is it's not your typical salad and don't get put off by the smoked salmon, it isn't overpowering like you might think.  All of the flavors work amazingly together.  For an entree, I had the Pan Seared Scallops ($28). They were perfectly cooked and went very well with the creamy grits and crisp bacon crumble.  The only thing that could've made the dish better would've been having one more scallop.  They have a list of craft cocktails and aged liquor to accompany your meal.  The Highlands Drifter is a tasty sweet drink made with vanilla infused tequila.  For a something refreshing and fruity, but not as sweet, the Second Generation martini is a good choice.  The servers here are great at what they do.  They're knowledgable about the food and friendly.  My entire experience from start to finish was enjoyable.  Next time I'll have to save room for dessert."}
{"text":"My first dinner here a few years a go was wonderful, and  everything was delicious.  I had the chopped salad and scallops.  I went in March 2015 with some friends, and they were not impressed with their entrees.  The meat was overcooked, and they didn't think the scallops were as good a quality as they should have been for the price."}
{"text":"Their chopped salad is like Crack. Its the best thing I have ever had and I keep coming back for more. I love the ambiance and service as well. They have a great specialty drink list as well. Always accommodating and always popping! Great spot!"}
{"text":"I really love the ambiance of this restaurant. It has a warmth to it that you can feel right away. We started off with the hummus appetizer which was great. They have a wonderful bread and olive oil they bring out. For the main deal I had the lamb burger after reading evryone's review. It was awesome. I will be getting the same thing again. It is served on focacia bread with fries and pickled veggies. Someone got the chicken which was also highly rated, but it really didn't taste that good. It tasted rubbery and bland to me even though there was truffle oil on it. The highly rate chopped salad was good too although not very filling. The prices were okay. I will be going back. This is an excellent place for a nice Birthday dinner."}
{"text":"Service: A+ Food: B Atmosphere: B+   Overall, I was impressed with Citizen Public House, mainly because of their service. My waiter was awesome, energetic, and fully detailed each course on the menu. I would probably come back for the service more than the food itself.   Sausage of the Day Very tasty and something I would eat on a cold day. Would be be something I order again? Maybe, I would prefer to see what else Citizen's has to offer.   Crab Cakes Something I would not order again. Bland, and it tasted ok. Usually Crab cakes wow me. This was like something to fill me up. The waiter did a good job at putting this one in the middle because if this came at the end, I would have been disappointed.   Chopped Salad This dish saved my food experience at Citizen's. The chopped salad is very comparable to Wildflower's salad. The only exception is that here they add raw tuna. From the the couscous, sunflower seeds, dried corn, it's almost identical. I ate at WIldflower the day after and noticed that the difference was the dressing, Alaskan salmon, feta cheese, cranberries, and adds diced red peppers. The only difference is that this chopped salad porportion is smaller and cost more. I must say it was a nice touch with the raw tuna, good quality!"}
{"text":"We were a group of 9 girls on a bachelorette party that stumbled upon this restaurant after checking out a few dives.  We arrived an hour before the scheduled closing time and the hostess was able to find us a table.  To my surprise,  we were seated in a semi private area, almost like a chef's table! They call it the \"Family Room\" ,I felt so special and VIP!  We ordered a round of specialty cocktails and we each tried a sip of one another. They were all very good.  Not your typical mai tai or sex on the beach drinks but one that required some skills.  Since it was late and we've already had dinner, we ordered some bar snacks and starters.  The waitstaff was extremely patient with us in explaining the drinks and menu, taking pictures of our group and efficient with our orders and requests.  Kudos to the team!  All the snacks were delicious ! My favorite was the burrata and the bacon fat heirloom popcorn.  if I lived in Scottsdale, I'd visit again. Until next time..."}
{"text":"Great dinner and atmosphere!! Came here for a girls night dinner, they gave wonderful recommendations on drinks appetizers and food!! Being from out of town, we went solely based on the yelp and open table recommendations! Will definitely back again!"}
{"text":"The service was great but while I'm almost always happy with the special - the veal wasn't that great - merely ok.  Our waitress and the supporting  servers were always attentive but unobtrusive.  The fondue and olive appetizers were great and the old fashioned I had and the manhattan my father in law had were tasty.  The wife's filet and my father in laws scallops were well prepared as were the kids meals (off menu) but I was rather let down by the veal special... I would chalk it up to a minor miss in an otherwise fantistic dinner expericne."}
{"text":"Eat here! You will not be disappointed. The staff was fabulous and attentive. Cocktails were on point - my mother swears they make the best Manhattan she's ever had, which is a feat. The food was incredible. Get the chopped salad. The scallops and greens were amazing. My dad got the steak and it was cooked to perfection. We also ordered a caramel/chocolate dessert, which was delicious. Can't recommend this place enough. I drove from San Francisco to Phoenix over the course of a week, and this place served the best meal I had throughout the trip hands down."}
{"text":"We had a nice meal at this place while in town for the big college tour at ASU. Scottsdale is great and this cute neighborhood is lots of fun. We had the famous chopped salad (good but not as awesome as I've read about here) the crab cakes (definitely yum!) the filet mignon tacos (nice) and the short ribs. The short ribs were tender and yummy but I think I would have preferred them served with mashed potatoes instead of the parsnip purée and kale. Maybe I'm just being picky. Service was great, wine selection was terrific too."}
{"text":"We found this place while on a weekend trip to Phoenix. It just so happened that the night we stopped by was the last night of their restaurant week, so we were able to try a few things off the menu.   The ingredients of the chopped salad at first glance seemed like a strange assortment but wow did they come together nicely. It had a unique and memorable flavor, the smoked salmon tasted very fresh.  I am not usually a fan of meatloaf but the waiter made it sounds so good I had to try it. He wasn't wrong. It was moist, and perfectly seasoned, and also - a very filling portion, enough to share.   And the desserts..  Were a perfect ending. We tried both the peanut butter jelly type concoction and the peanut butter chocolate dish. They were both really tasty. Not too sweet or overpowering, really pleasant to eat.  Finally, the citi-zen cocktail is delicious. A little fruity, sour, and sweet complete with yummy rock candy.   We left satisfied but not overly stuffed. I'm so glad we stumbled upon this place while in town!"}
{"text":"I haven't tried enough things on the menu nor was I thrilled enough to give this five stars, but it was good. I would like to go back to try their famous salad! The Mac and Cheese was pretty good, the hummus plate was good, my friend's salad (can't remember the name, but it was the one with popcorn in it) was alright. I am also planning on trying the scallops and the BLT sandwich next time.   The fact that they had a Moscow Mule on their cocktail menu was an added bonus. I didn't try it yet because I wanted to take advantage of happy hour and ordered wine instead, but I will be!"}
{"text":"I had a hard time choosing between Citizen Public House or the Mission for my one dinner while vacationing in Scottsdale.  I am so glad we chose here.  From the martinis, the appetizers (pastrami pork belly is really that good!; bacon popcorn yum). the entrees (one of the best duck I have tasted and perfectly cooked), and the service, I highly recommend this place.    The only downside is that it is really loud and you need to talk in a raised voice (need to put some noise reducing elements in the interior).   Good times!"}
{"text":"Absolutely spectacular. That is the only way to describe the food at Citizen Public House.  So let me start this review with my obsessive love for the Pork Belly Pastrami appetizer. Hands down one of the best things I've ever eaten. This pork belly is just the most amazing, literally melt in your mouth meaty/fatty goodness you'll ever taste. SO AMAZING. After tasting this appetizer, I seriously contemplated canceling my main entree and just ordering 5 more of the Pork Belly Pastrami. (Note: I did in fact return a day later to again indulge in the fatty pork belly goodness. SO WORTH IT.) If you order nothing else here, order the Pork Belly Pastrami. You'll thank me.  Quick note on the service and drinks so I can continue to rave about the food: J and I came here for a late dinner on Thursday and had really great service even though we were only sitting in the bar area. We again experienced excellent service on Saturday when we returned for a late lunch (and to introduce one of his friends to the incredible food! I spent so much time raving about the food on Friday that we had no choice but to come here on Saturday). J had what he said was an amazing old fashioned, and I tried their signature Citi-Zen which had a great pear flavor and was served with rock candy as a stirring stick. Candy with a drink, that's a definite win for me.  Back to the food: Pan Seared Scallops - Delectable combination of flavors. Salty and crispy bacon, sweet and smooth corn grits, with wilted snow pea greens that added both a nice color and flavor to the dish, seared scallops sit atop all this deliciousness. And then it is all topped with a tangy and tasty Red Rock Cola Gastrique. Did I make the correct dinner choice? Abso-freaking-lutely.  Amaro Meatloaf - J's dinner choice. A lovely combination of flavors, but I personally found it to be a bit dry, J loved it though. The mashed potatoes were buttery and delicious. And the roasted zucchini was fresh and very enjoyable. But I would still choose the scallops over this any day.  So when we came back on Saturday we decided to just order appetizers. Which was of course a good choice because mostly everything we ate was amazing.   We ate: The Original Chopped Salad - smoked salmon, Israeli couscous, and a bunch of other delicious things make for a very enjoyable texture and flavor combination - one of the best salads I've ever had! Chicken and Waffles - Think fancy chicken and waffles. Another great flavor combination - crispy chicken tenders with a kick, buttery waffle with almond butter, and all dipped in honey.  Bacon Fat Heirloom Popcorn - It is what it says it is. Bacon and popcorn. It's tasty, but only worth it if it's during \"Social Hour\" when bar snacks (and draft beers) are half off (so when this is $2.50). Grits + Gumbo - The only dish I didn't really like. I have to say I was pretty disappointed with this one. I felt like it could have been so much better. The grits were tasty, and the andouille sausage was okay. But the gumbo itself seemed kind of like a thick but not very flavorful chili. I would skip this next time.  Our friend that came with us on Saturday had the BLT and said it was outstanding. Which I would imagine it was, seeing as how the bacon came from the same company as the pork belly!  This review is extremely long now. But I swear, this place absolutely deserves all the praise! I suppose I'll stop now but I'll end with this...  Order the Pork Belly Pastrami!!!"}
{"text":"The duck burger was amazing, probably the best burger I've tasted in a long while.  We also decided to be adventurous and try the pickled pig ears (didn't care too much for those) but cheers to the adventurer.   We had the chopped salad which many have mentioned is delicious and a scallop dish, equally tasty.  Everything we tried tasted great, and the server \"Ryan\" I believe added to an overall great experience.  Thank you."}
{"text":"At Citizen Public House, my Ty Largo sightings continue. I see that guy damn near everywhere I go, so it must mean Up Agency is handling PR for this place. This has nothing to do with the review.  Citizen is a really cozy, warm, and inviting space, and is exactly the opposite of every other bar in old town. It is grown up, sophisticated, and has a huge emphasis on quality and interesting food. If you're looking for a greasy burger and fries to go with a Coors Light, you've stepped into the wrong place, compadre. If you'd rather go with a bottle of Dogfish Head's Midas Touch to accompany your Original Chop Salad, then Citizen will please your palate much more. A word on the Original Chop Salad, it's the Stetson Chop that you're all accustomed to from Cowboy Ciao. Bernie Kantak, the owner of Citizen created that salad whilst working at Cowboy Ciao, and it's his to take where he wants. Easily the most famous dish in town, in my opinion.   In my observation, Citizen is a douchebag free environment, a sanctuary for those who have become jaded from the usual Old Town bar scene. This would be a great place to have a drink after a night of dining at Marcellino or FnB, not a place to go before you head to Axis Radius or Myst. The white table cloths, dimly lit and somewhat romantic environs, and overal sexiness make this a great spot for a first or second date, or a perfect place to go before heading to the art walk or an event at the Center for Performing Arts.  A couple of small knocks on a place though; they don't have a great selection of draft beers, in fact , I was rather disappointed to see they had Guiness, Bud Light, a couple of Four Peaks, and Pilsner Urquell on draft. They have some really interesting and high quality beers in bottles, but unfortunately the girl behind the bar wasn't terribly experienced with beer and couldn't tell us much about one or two that I was unfamilar with. I consider this a very minor inconvienence and perhaps if business picks up and enough people request it, they will add some good beers to the tap, otherwise, I'd rather drink a bottle of beer at home than in a bar.  All in all, this is a solid contender and I hope it does well. The Old Town scene seems pretty dead to me lately, as on a Tuesday this is one of three places I went where my group was literally the only ones in the house. I'm quite sure the weekend business is better, but you can't survive if you're operating in the red 2-3 nights a week. Here's to hoping Ty Largo does his job and gets the good word out there about Citizen Public House. He owes it to the public to let them experience it."}
{"text":"Appetizers for dinner. Started with the pork belly pastrami. It was wonderful.  Not quite enough. So I added the fried grit catfish. Also very good. Serve was very good and friendly.  Maybe I will try a main dish next time."}
{"text":"I'm gonna file this one under Summer Is The Low Season In Scottsdale.  Nice decor, but as far from the look of a Public House as The W is from a quaint B&B. Came in for a drink and apps.  The chopped salad was tasty. Weirdly it came with smoked salmon and my wife hates smoked salmon.  We didn't know this when ordering because the description on the menu was just a URL to a Facebook page(!). I guess the salad has its own page that we should have consulted.  I had the mac n cheese which was named after somebody so I figured it had to be good, but it was just regular mac n cheese with salsa on top.  No Bueno.  The kicker was that my wife's Manhattan cocktail arrived within 15 seconds of ordering it!  Sounds good but when we asked how it could be that they whipped up a craft cocktail so speedily the barman told us it was for an earlier customer who didn't want it.  And was warm.  As least he took it off the bill--when asked to."}
{"text":"Service - Outstanding!  Food -  1. Bacon Fat Popcorn -  Subpar. Overly saturated wet popcorn that becomes stale with a hint of bacon taste. 2. The Original Chopped Salad - I've had the original Stetson Salad at Cowboy Ciao. Exactly the same although I would have loved the salmon to be slightly more cold. 3. Pan Seared Scallops - Very light.  Well seasoned grits."}
{"text":"Had a fantastic dinner here.  Cocktails were delicious, particularly the barrel-aged ones: I had one similar to an Old Fashioned (can't remember the exact name), and The Import: one of the most unique and manliest cocktails I've ever had, containing Jameson, Tawny Port, Guinness foam, and tobacco bitters.  I would order both again.  The Chopped Salad was the standout appetizer, but the bacon-fat popcorn was addictive.  The hummus was good, but not a standout.  For my entree I had scallops, which were perfectly cooked, and topped with generous bacon lardons.  Service was very attentive, and our server was affable and very knowledgeable about the menu.  I hope to return."}
{"text":"Umm bacon popcorn and for the small fee of $2 how could I go wrong?  It was excellent bacon and added salt to the popcorn.  The popcorn really lacked any flavor so a handful is best enjoyed with some bacon to add the required saltiness.    I also heard great things about the pork belly pastrami so had to order it.  I really enjoyed this dish, in fact this is the best dish I had and will order it again.  If I could do it over I would just order this dish and my drinks and I would of gave it five stars.   However please read on....  OK also ordered the Butternut Squash soup and it was ok.  Not really great, just an ok dish that I would never order again.  It just did not have any spectacular flavors or any wow factor like the pork belly pastrami.  I also ordered the main entree short rib.  It came with a cherry sauce that I would never eat again.  If you smelled the cherry  sauce directly it would clear your sinuses.  It was so strong that if you inhaled it directly it would make you cough.  Not really an appetizing sauce.  It had a bitterness to  it that really was not good at all.  After coughing twice from breathing in the sauce with my short rib I stopped using it all together.  The short rib on its own was ok.  Not worth the coin and only an ok dish.  I would not order it again.  The atmosphere of Citizen Public House is great.  Very lively and great service.  I plan on visiting again for happy hour to enjoy appetizers, pork belly pastrami and drinks.  I suggest you do the same."}
{"text":"Great place for a nice dinner or happy hour. Excellent service, fantastic menu and a fabulous bar. A gem in old town scottsdale."}
{"text":"Fantastic experience from the moment we walked in the door. The atmosphere is modern and casual, staff are very accommodating, and the food is inspired. After dinner we ventured out back in the alley and upstairs to explore Citizen R&D - a hidden away cocktail bar you have to ask about inside CPH - quite an experience!"}
{"text":"This is easily the best new restaurant I have been to in the last year. Extremely good value here - great menu, I had the \"Smart Chicken\" which was out of this world yummy. The Smart Chicken had a wonderful smokiness that permeated with a sweet corn risotto below, smoked onion & shitake mushroom hash & truffle oil. Unbelievable.   The Chef is apparently from the renowned Cowboy Ciao, but I have to say that the food quality and inventiveness here to me surpass Ciao as I always found Ciao trying too hard for the \"Southwesty\" experience which to me felt contrived with too much schtick.   Some of the people in our group had the burgers, which I tasted and were all superb. As others have said, the Chopped Salad is extraordinary with a tangy dressing and just the right amount of fresh ingredients.   I Highly recommend the Fondu appetizer (served over a candle, not sterno as I read in prior reviews). The Fondu came with some sausages and crusty bread and had just the right tangy cheesiness.  Also, the bacon Popcorn appetizer was insane - what a great idea, with small charred bits of fatty bacon drizzled over the white popped morsels.   Even the ketchup for the fries was homemade from scratch!  To me this is the best new spot since NOCA opened - but with better pricing. This is a foodies paradise, and I suggest you get here soon before it becomes the hot ticket that it is surely destined to be. Winner."}
{"text":"I have been here 3 times and I am torn between 3 and 4 stars. I have had a good meal here everytime but somethings are much better than others.   Lets start with the passables, which would be almost every sandwich or burger they have on the menu. Not to say that they are bad, but for $13 you can get a much better burger or grilled cheese sandwich at many other phoenix eateries. Another item i was unimpressed with was a Fish and Chips special which was priced at $20. It came out with 2 small panko crusted halibut filets and fries. It was a somewhat decent amount of food when you added the fries to the equation, but the batter was bland and the fish was dried out. Many other places around the valley have much better fish and chips for around half the price.  Moving on to the good menu items, I would have to start with the $32 Filet which is amazing. One of the best steaks I have had in arizona and equal and if not better in quality to one you would get at any high end steakhouses. Other good choices include the scallops, which were cooked perfectly and bursting with flavor. Another one of my favorites of this menu is the chopped salad which is fantastic and a must order.  I would review the desserts but I have never ordered one since none of them on the menu have caught my attention.  The service is always prompt and professional, they have a beer list and innovative specialty cocktails. The ambiance is above average and more intimate then most \"gastropubs\".  So all in all, would I go back? Yes, but only when i can afford to order a high priced and deliicious entree, otherwise I can get my burger or sandwich fix elsewhere."}
{"text":"CPH in Old Town is one of the tops! I've been to Citizen a couple times now and both times this place brought it.  Ambiance is clean, open, minimalist and dark setting with a romantic feel to it.  We wish I could remember our server's name but he was someone we could have been friends with!  Very funny and knowledgeable of the menu and knew the dishes inside and out.  We started with the tzatziki and hummus plate..so addicting.  We shared the signature chop salad and let us make it very clear....GET THE F*ING CHOP SALAD!  The way it's plated is all separated and mixed table side. The salad has a unique blend of marinated tomatoes, smoked salmon, pepitas, couscous and a bunch of other shit I forgot. I should have said before the food I had a martini or two so my attention to detail on the menu was a little skewed. We also shared the scallops that were cooked to perfection placed on grits and spinach.  Even the bread and olive oil were delicious.  One of my favorite places to dine in Old Town Scottsdale.  Will definitely return and highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"The drinks were alright but if you don't like hard liquor, I will not recommend any of the house special. The pork belly pastrami and pub pork cheeks both tasted delicious. The pork belly pastrami tastes a bit lighter than the pub pork cheeks. The short ribs were really tender and delicious, however I didn't like the dried cherry bbq sauce it came with. It had a really intense flavor. The pan seared scallops were delicious but the sauce was a bit tense too. Overall, I believe the flavors of the food are really intense and a bit heavy for a hot day in Arizona. However, it's perfect for a pub."}
{"text":"We made a reservation, were there five minutes early and seated 20 minutes late. The service was slow and the waitress preoccupied. She told us the special and then turned around to chat with coworkers and then didnt come back for ten minutes when we were ready to order hen she gave us the special.  The place was really loud we couldnt carry a convo. Across the table and the food was mediocre. We went on a saturday night so maybe they just dont do well when they are busy; lets just say we expected a lot more for the cash we had to drop on thismeal."}
{"text":"Was eating with my sister that has to eat gluten free and there are many options to choose from!  Everything was delicious and service was excellent."}
{"text":"In one word, YUM! Loved the food here. I am known for getting scallops quite frequently and these were cooked to perfection. The appetizers were great as well and the portions were definitely generous.   Service was superb. Gina, our server, was personable and took our dining experience from good to freaking outstanding!  I'm a bit of an indecisive orderer and am therefore appreciative of the servers' opinion. Gina gave honest, enthusiastic recommendations, not only with food but also our wine pairings.   Decor was dark and comfortable. They had a great bar set up as well and have a fantastic specialty cocktail and beer list. Next time we head back, we will plan to belly up and get our drink on!  Overall, I can't find anything negative about this place. Kudos!"}
{"text":"Food is decent. I had the short ribs and they were dry and over cooked. We also had the Mac and cheese and it was cold. Way too over priced for what you get, especially since the portion sizes are small."}
{"text":"I thought this place was unimpressive.  The drinks were bland and the food was average.  We ordered a bunch of things to share with the table; one or 2 things were bad and the rest was okay, but nothing was great."}
{"text":"Good food, nice setting.  Nice date place.  Had a few appetizers and was greatly surprised.  We had mac n cheese, crab cakes and their signature salad.  I hate salads but this salad was well thought out.  Best appetizer.  Main course, you have to try the Lamb Burger...sooo awesome.  Ketchup was home made and a little too sweet for my taste but fries were good.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I kept saying \"I haven't been to Citizen Public House\" and everyone was like \"What?\".  I can say I have been and I have enjoyed every visit.  You have the best Mixologists I have come across!  Those crazy concoctions are AMAZING!  My favorites include the Old Fashioned and Manhattan.  I have been told by a close source, Mandi B., that the Handcrafted Sangria is delicious.  The Hummus & Tzatziki is the best I have ever tasted.  Everything tastes so fresh and good.  The Bacon Fat Heirloom Popcorn is a fantastic starter.  I have only been here for drinks and light bites.  The Chopped Salad was the best salad I've ever tasted and I hate salads.  I need to come back and try some items off the dinner menu to have the whole CPH experience!    P.S.  CPH has social hour everyday 3-6pm!!!"}
{"text":"Cool place in downtown Scottsdale. We were here on vaca and had dinner here. Fantastic service from everyone, especially our server Gary. He was so funny and knowledgable about the menu that he could be a food columnist. Some of our favs from dinner: Eggplant burrata appetizer, osso buco entree, chopped salad (one of the most unique I've had)."}
{"text":"Very good food and amazing atmosphere. The Chop salad is yummy!!!  The best time to go is 3-6pm, awesome specials!"}
{"text":"Like football there are 3 phases to a good restaurant. Good food, good service, and good drinks. Citizens public house is one of those places that does all 3 phases exceptionally well.   I have eaten here numerous times and the service is always up to par. Knowledgable staff who isn't afraid to suggest dishes or drinks and will be attentive through the duration of your meal.   The drinks are some of the best in the valley. If you are being really adventurous try the speakeasy style bar upstairs where thy will turn vodka into gin table side. It's a pretty great experience.   Finally and most importantly, the food is outstanding. You have to try the pork pastrami which is a deconstructed version of the sandwich with succulent pork belly, sauerkraut and spaetzle. The truffled grilled cheese is amazing layered with gooey cheese and potatoes. Do yourself a favor and add bacon which really takes this sandwich to the next level adding texture and some needed salt. Keeping on the pork them their short ribs are also outstanding.   All the deserts are made by Tracey Dempsey and are delicious. You really can't go wrong with anyone of them, but if your full take a bag of the bacon pecan brittle home. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Dishes sampled included:  Pita and Olive Oil  BERNIE'S MAC 'N CHEESE - Gorgonzola, Emmentaler, Cavatappi, chilled tomato relish  CHICKEN & WAFFLES - Buttermilk-marinated fried chicken, oat waffles, almond butter, blue clover honey  AMARO MEATLOAF - Montenegro Amaro Italian liqueur, pork, beef, parsnip meatloaf, smashed Yukon gold potatoes, roasted zucchini, veal demi-glace, mushroom cream  APPLEWOOD SMOKED DUCK - Maple Leaf farms duck breast, creamy rosemary millet, spiced pistachios, sauteed greens  BLACK & TAN PUDDING - Dark chocolate pot de creme, caramel pudding, whipped cream, pretzel brittle, brown sugar shortbreads  \"DONUTS & COFFEE\" - Bourbon glazed donut bread pudding, vanilla sauce, cafe au lait ice cream, brown sugar streusel  After another long day of moving and gathering supplies neither myself nor my mother wanted anything fancy - just something great - before she flew back to Ohio and scouring the options somehow landed on Citizen Public House, a choice we most certainly don't regret.  Serving largely as a gastropub, of sorts, and with a menu laden with all sort of upscaled American comfort food it really was not WHAT Citizen Public House is doing that would end up wowing, but rather how well they do it.  Greeted and seated at a table near the window where our server, Clark, would stop by frequently throughout the evening to make sure we were never for want of anything, menus were present on arrival and with little effort we both honed in on appetizers, mains, and desserts that fit our palates perfectly - honestly, I don't know if I have ever seen a rather short menu put together so many things I like in a trio of plates - and when these plates arrived each were as good as they read.  More or less a collection of small plates featuring big flavors the meal began with soft pita and grassy olive oil before moving into spiral pasta thick with cheese and balanced with bright tomatoes alongside crispy chicken over a toothsome waffle that could have easily fit the role of breakfast or dessert as well as an appetizer.  Next up, a plate of tender and rosy duck given texture not by crisp skin but rather crunchy pistachios and millet nearly the texture of mashed potatoes tinged with rosemary and bitter greens.  Not to be outdone, my mother's meatloaf was rich and artistically plated; a classic texture made unique with rich herbal/earthy notes to balance the briny demi-glace and pork.  Heading to the home stretch and opting to outsource sweets to Tracey Dempsey, a wise move made by many local kitchens, I think I can confidently say that what landed before me was good but what was presented to my mother is a dish she still talks about today - a layer-by-layer temporal change in texture and flavor that was not quite a budino or a pot de crème, nor a parfait - just a decadent sweet-meets-salty amalgam that was truly amongst the ten best desserts I enjoyed in 2012; a reason in and of itself to visit Citizen Public House...amongst many others."}
{"text":"Nice little place in Scottsdale. Get the chop salad. It is their signature. We go there everytime we are in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Another student schooled on the Yelp Eats menu, here to report that CPH made the grade.   I got on the short bus and started the ride with a Hemingway Daiquiri (I thought it sounded studious, it certainly tasted smart) and some bacon popcorn--no surprises here, but hey, it's bacon right? The bell rang and first period began with pita, hummus and tzatziki.  From there I got seriously edu-ma-cated on cuisine 101. Second period brought the chopped salad, it was everything it was chopped up to be, a fantastic formula of texture and style that managed to balance salmon, cous cous and freaking trail mix, which is an equation I'll never unravel. On to third period, a study break with the Lost in Translation cocktail, an immensely lush melding of tequila, yuzu juice and lemon peel. Fourth period delivered scallops on roasted corn grits with--you guessed it--more bacon! I'll just say this about the scallops: the best I've ever had in the waterless West. Oh, and I couldn't remember all the answers so when the teacher wasn't looking I had a bite of Aimee's Amaro meatloaf, which made me so fat it almost got me expelled.   I seriously considered skipping fifth period. There wasn't any room left to cram. But when the bread pudding and fudge brownie walked up to the chalkboard, all of a sudden I was hungry for more learnin', which was miraculous because I now know that \"bagel crisp streusel\" isn't just food, it's a straight-up philosophy.  This is your brain on bacon, butter and bagel. You'll be cooked."}
{"text":"Not only is the food excellent and reasonably priced but the staff is phenomenal too.  Sat at the bar and the bartenders couldn't have been nicer or better. Well done Citizen public house!  I'll definitely be back"}
{"text":"First time in Arizona and we check out Citizens for dinner. I was pretty hungry so I ordered 3 menu items for myself. I started off with their Ramen which I thought was good. Next I ordered the Mac and cheese which is to die for. It literally put a smile on my face and not many foods do that for me. Lastly, I tried the duck burger which came as a surprise to me as I wasn't expecting the nice texture and taste. I would still stick with my regular cattle but definitely something to try. The drinks were great as well. I had a similar take of an old fashion :)  Food: 4 Service: 5 Ambiance: 4"}
{"text":"I was taken here by my wonderful girlfriend for my birthday celebration and cocktails not too long ago. Our server was fantastic, the food delightful and our server was terrific.  The selection is all done very well as are the cocktails and wine selection. The fact that they have a late night bistro menu is always a big plus to me as I enjoy a little finer dining and eating on my weekend evenings as opposed to swilling back metric tons of bud light to get my kicks.  GO, and enjoy one of Scottsdale's higher tier restaurants for the casual diner."}
{"text":"Reading the reviews, I was expecting a lot more. Simply put, this is one of those places that tries to be better than it is.  If you're expecting a true \"Public House\" with local or interesting beers, this restaurant has no different beers than dozens of other places. So go someplace cheaper.  On the food front, everything was \"meh\", suffering from the symptom of having too much going on.  The famous chopped salad was smoked salmon, arugula, Israeli couscous, dried corn, tomatoes, and I can't remember what else.  It tasted like it sounds: a bunch of divergent stuff thrown together on a plate because those ingredients should be interesting together. But they're not.  I also had the roast pork sandwich.  I can't quite tell you what it tasted like.  But, the menu said it was \"fennel roasted pork sirloin, rapini, Scamorza cheese, Serbian lepinja roll, pickled vegetables.\" I don't even know what half of those things are, so it must be interesting, right? Meh, not so much.  But, everyone else seems to like it, including the Arizona Republic, so what do I know?"}
{"text":"If you want some fabulous food, go here.  If you want fantastic happy hour prices on draft beer and wine by the glass, go here.  If you want gluten free, definitely go here!  Chicken and waffles gluten free.  OMG!!!!!!  Duck breast entree GF, so delicious.  They mark their menu items with GF or V.  I so appreciate that.  The bartenders know their food and drinks and are so friendly.  Really enjoyed our meal at the bar in every way."}
{"text":"Ate dinner at Citizen last night. Enjoyed their house speciality chopped salad to start and then the short ribs for main course.  The food was very well prepared and delicious.  The only con is the restaurant is quite noisy."}
{"text":"*This review is on behalf of a party of 12!* After some bridal dress shopping some lovely ladies, two children, and I came in about 8 on Saturday night. The bride-to-be absolutely adores The Gladly, so of course we had to come here while in the area. They were expecting our party, and even though we were 15 minutes early, we waited no more than 5 minutes to be seated. We were sat at a big table, semiprivate spot.   For starters we tried the Noble Bread, Mac 'n Cheese, and one ordered the Kilt Lifter Fondue. Everyone loved the bread especially the tomatoes and yummy butter that came with it. The fondue was also far from a disappointment. But the real killer from the starters was the Mac 'n cheese. It had raving reviews from both adults and kids!  Some main courses that were ordered included: Meatloaf, Chopped Salad, Scallops, Filet Mignon, and Rib Tacos. I'm not joking when I say every single person LOVED their dish! I was the one who forked out for the Filet but I really do not regret it! Hands down the most melt-in-my-mouth piece of meat I've EVER had. Also, I'm all about sauces with my steak (not that it necessarily needed it), so (per my request) they gave me the closest thing to a sauce they had. I thought that was awesome and it really made it for me!  I didn't drink, but the cocktails also were loved by everyone who ordered one. For dessert some had the Sorbet and Peach Blackberry Galette. I only tried the Galette and it was REALLY amazing. Definitely enough to share too! And to top off this perfect experience, it was also so cool that they sold the Homeboys hot sauce. The soon-to-be-bride had to take two bottles home!   As for the service -- superb. A lovely young blonde woman was our server. She stayed on top of everything and accommodated us with separate checks. I'd recommend CPH to anyone after this visit. They were AMAZING to us and were def the right choice for our dinner party! We all left In Good Spirits ;)"}
{"text":"Great place to take a date. Two recommendations- Amaro Meatloaf (food) and Midwest Manhattan (drink). You'll thank me later guys."}
{"text":"The atmosphere here was great for a group who were looking for a place to just hang out.  The wait staff were very friendly and helpful. After recommending an aged barrel drink that was too strong the waiter gladly changed it out for another and when I was debating between two he brought a sample of one to help me decide. The only downside to the evening was that the food lacked salt and flavor. While the bacon reduction popcorn and mac and cheese sounded delicious it was disappointing once received. The staff quickly helped to remedy that by bringing us salt and pepper.  While this did help it was still disappointing that I finally found a mac and cheese that I was completely satisfied with.  I would still go back and try something else though because the place is amazing."}
{"text":"LOVE, LOVE, LOVED this place!   Came in with a large group all in town for a wedding, people were coming & going from our table and the server/other staff were all super accommodating to our needs. It was like a mini reunion of all us college friends and we could not have chosen a better spot.  Since we had a large group it also allowed for me to try a little bit of everything, including the Pork Belly Pastrami (which the hus said was awesome), Burrata, Short Ribs, Sallops, Filet Mignon, Smoked Duck and my personal favorite Bernies Mac n' Cheese (which I went ahead and completely hogged).  Absolutely everything we tried was perfection. Definitely the best meal our entire stay in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"A great later evening find for food and drinks. Rolled in a 9:30, starving, and the staff was excellent at providing great recommendations off the food and drink menu. The Chopped Salad lived up to its hype. Ingredients were so fresh and flavorful. Unique presentation given that the server mixes everything at the table. One of the best salads I've had in a long time. I'm typically a wine drinker but followed the bar tenders recs for tasting a cocktail off the barrel aged list. The Americano was perfect, and I learned it was the drink that James Bond originally drank ;) such a home run night!"}
{"text":"Gastronomic greatness, at happy hour prices! -------------------- We were in town visiting some friends, and they recommended we check this place out. We were VERY HAPPY we came here!  Sat at the bar at around 3:30 in the afternoon. Then we learned there was a happy hour with 1/2 price bar snacks, cocktail drinks, and draft beer. Score!  What we got: - house hefeweizen: just a little more \"hoppy\" than I'm used to, but still crisp and refreshing. Plus, it was only $2.50.   - chopped salad: have you ever had a salad that has its own Facebook page? Didn't think so.  This was a very colorful and delicious mix of chopped smoked salad, Israeli couscous, toasted pumpkin seeds, arugula, and fire roasted tomatoes.  They mix this at tableside. What an explosion of flavors and textures: creamy, salty, smoky, nutty, soft, crunchy.   - Pork belly pastrami - GET THIS!!! This is a popular choice, with succulent pork belly that melts in your mouth. This is paired with fried spaetzle, and sautéed brussel sprouts.   - chicken and waffles: chicken thigh meat, fried to golden crispy perfection with rice flour. Comes with a small waffle with a dollop of savory butter.  Served with a small ramekin of honey. If you aren't a douche, they might give you a bit of maple syrup as well. Extra bonus!  This place is definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"I am exceedingly surprised at how good the food is here. The chop salad was unique and excellent but the duck burger blew us away. It is by far the best burger in general I've ever had. It's the right combination of duck to beef, an over easy egg, sauce and bread. I highly recommend the duck burger. Will be back again soon."}
{"text":"Mike our bartender was amazing!!! Drinks we delicious and he took great care of us. Visit him ASAP"}
{"text":"The food was Fabulous! Brad gave us great guest service. No rush, just relaxing and enjoyable."}
{"text":"Great inventive food.  Attentive but unpretentious service.  Cool laid back vibe.  Classic cocktails.  What's not to like?"}
{"text":"Decided to branch out while we were in Scottsdale, and hubs wanted to try this place.  I okay'd it based on Yelpers.  Front of house staff were so kind and accommodating, and the service didn't end there.  Bradley - thank you for all your suggestions.  You perfectly timed the courses, helped with the wine decision, and were simply great.  When I looked at the menu a Chopped Salad was listed so I asked.  Turns out the chef at CPH was the chef at Cowboy Ciao who developed the Chopped Salad.  As far as we could discern both salads were identical and equally delicious.  Hubs and I shared the Scallops and Buttermilk Chicken.  Scallops were perfectly seared and served over corn grits w/bacon that were the lightest I've ever eaten.  The boneless chicken - difficult to cook and not dry out - was so tender and moist, served with Brussels sprouts and succotash, a great combo over the typical (or what I serve) mashed potatoes.    The only negative I would add is that this place is LOUD, and could definitely use some noise mitigation.    Absolutely no room for dessert, we waddled back to our hotel."}
{"text":"Flew to Phoenix for a work trip and I knew this had to be one of my spots to go to. I invited a few friends who has never been to show them what the hype was all about. They had very good cocktail menu but we decided on champagne, for a bottle it was under $30 which is a great deal. We decided to do share plates and got the infamous chopped salad, bread with bone marrow, and Mac and cheese were delicious and fed all 4 of use. The service was top notch with good recommendations. Unlike the weekend, it was a Monday with no wait."}
{"text":"Just had another dinner at Citizen and they did it again... The food and the service is impeccable. That chop salad is to die for (and I'm not a salad person). Gary is amazing!  Best service best food can't complain can only rave!"}
{"text":"Lucky us coming to Scottsdale during restaurant week!! We had fabulous service and an outstanding meal. Sam was our excellent server and very knowledgeable and friendly   My husband got the cocktail pairing with the prix fix menu. We started with the chopped salad he got his with the smoked salmon and I got the chopped salad with chicken. They were delicious!! Our entree we had the scallops which were rich and flavourful. I had the meatloaf which was very good. Quite rich tasting. Our desserts were really good. We had the Apple and bacon bread pudding and the peanut butter strata which was bites of peanut buttery heaven!  It was wonderful!!"}
{"text":"5 days in the Scottsdale area and this was our favorite dining experience for sure. Great energy, fresh and innovative dishes and great cocktails. Wait staff works hard!"}
{"text":"$5 HH deals on cocktails! The food was really delicious too. If I lived closer, I would come more. The patio and location cant be beat."}
{"text":"Chop salad, fondue, and scallops are my favorites.  Great atmosphere and drinks.  Never had a bad experience and I have been here a bunch!"}
{"text":"Disappointed that I got sick from the not-so-fresh scallops the following day while on vacation but the favors were good though. Their sangria and truffle grilled cheese sandwich were fantastic!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  My girlfriend and I came here for an anniversary dinner and we were not disappointed.  The ambience here is quite nice.  There was a fair amount of space in between tables but it was still very cozy.  Our waiter was excellent and helped to recommend some dishes for us to try.  We started with the chopped salad.  If you haven't tried this, you need to.  It was fantastic.  They bring it out to the table with all of the ingredients lined up separately and then they mix it in front of you.  It was one of the best salads I have ever had.  From there, I had the seared scallops and she had the smoked duck.  Both were outstanding.  The scallops were served medium rare I believe and were very tasty.  The duck was tender and juicy and had a great flavor.  We also tried some dessert.  We shared the brownie and the one with the pudding and graham crackers.  Both were very good though the brownie was very rich. (I am not sure if they still have these on the menu).  I had the Manhattan listed on their cocktail list and it was by far one of the best I have ever had.  So much so that I had 2 of them.  My girlfriend had their cocktail that comes with a sugar/candy rim and rock candy (the Citizen).  They have a great selection of cocktails and beers here.  The waiter, again, was on point.  I want to say his name was James? Either way, the service was excellent and we will definitely be back.  Expect to easily spend around $100 for two people depending on how hungry you are but I can guarantee it is worth it.  If you have not been here yet, make sure that you find time to do so."}
{"text":"Our waiter Sam was very wonderful. We had the chopped salad that he recommended, pork belly pastrami, and the short ribs and they were all excellent! Great food with great service! Definitely will come back again!"}
{"text":"Chopped salad and cocktails are all I've had but they are both great! Sat at the bar and received great service. That salad....100%!!"}
{"text":"I want to call this a 3.5. I didn't have a bad experience here. The waiter was fantastic, attentive, and funny. Things came out relatively quickly, the atmosphere was spot-on, there wasn't a wait for us, and it wasn't too busy.   But my expensive hamburger was enormous and difficult and not in the deliciously messy way but in the \"this is frustrating to eat for it not tasting completely amazing\" way. The popcorn was expensive popcorn, with a bit of bacon grease flavor. Does what it says on the tin. The mac and cheese was quite good. The drinks were... interesting, and ran the gamut from awkward and overpowering to delightful, all the standard $9 or so. I think we skipped dessert.  My guests enjoyed their meals quite a bit more (though the drinks thing was everyone having a sip; I had tea.)  Overall, a 3, maybe 3.5 star experience. I'll go back and give it another go, but I wasn't filled with a sense of wonderment. (And I tried other dishes than just the burger, naturally.)"}
{"text":"I came here shortly after they opened for the Yelp preview. I didn't want to write a review on that for a few reasons; mainly because it wasn't a true dining experience. The food and the cocktails were so awesome that night and the staff was amazingly friendly... I don't know what took me so long to come back.  At the Yelp event, I love love love loved the lamb meatball (which seems to actually be the lamb burger on the menu) and the smart chicken. It was late night and I wasn't starving, so wanted to choose a smaller plate. I have a friend who once told me, \"If a restaurant has crab cakes on the menu, order them. If the crab cakes are good, then you know it's a good restaurant.\" I saw crab cakes on the menu and thought of what he said. Now, I already knew this restaurant creates great food so didn't need to use the crab cakes as an indicator. I don't normally go for seafood items, but had crab cakes once that were delicious in DC and always wanted to taste crab cakes that good since then. I figured there was a good chance these crab cakes might give those DC cakes a fun for their money and I was so right. They were sooooooooo good. I'm still thinking about them and will be letting my crab cake loving friend know he's missing out if he doesn't ever get to eat these.  Oh yeah, do you know they have a sausage of the day? Citizen Public House is awesome.  Each month they have a cocktail pairing dinner that I keep meaning to get to. I love to drink and I love to eat. Smartest idea ever to pair foods with cocktails rather than cocktails to food. So far they've only been on nights where I have to work the next day; which explains why I haven't been to one yet. I'm just going to have to give in and use a vacation day for the following day for an upcoming dinner.  The only thing they need to do in order to completely have my heart is serve weekend brunch. Once they do that, they will become my steady restaurant boyfriend."}
{"text":"Citizen Public House is one of my favorite restaurants in Scottsdale. Everything is cooked perfectly. The ambiance and service are also excellent! All this at very very reasonable pricing.  it is worth mentioning that the drinks are great here too!  I know it did not originate here, but this was the first place i had the \"original\" chopped salad. While it did not quite blow me away, it is different and delicious.   Over the course of my business trip, i was able to try most of the entrees here . I had the wagyu burger, the filet, tenderloin, and also the short ribs.   If it is your first time here, i would start with the chopped salad and the pork belly pastrami and choose the filet or short ribs as your entree.   Everything is good here though! The burger is excellent too!  stop reading and make that reservation!"}
{"text":"Great place for a date, great food and atmosphere.  A little pricey but the food is worth it."}
{"text":"Seriously, this wonderful place really doesn't need another 5 star review but, here goes... first, we ate at the bar and received the best service!. Of course, we shared the Chopped salad,a must have... delish! Then we had seared ahi tuna with purple sticky rice....my absolute favorite. So good:) at this point we were stuffed but had ordered the pork belly pastrami. It was good, but, my least favorite; however, my husband gobbled it up. We really enjoyed every single aspect of our experience, from service to food. So happy we chose citizens!!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome food and drinks. Service was excellent the first time we went, and good the most recent time. I highly recommend the pork shank and the craft cocktails. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food with great drinks and service."}
{"text":"I wish this restaurant had a location in NYC. First night on vacation in Scottsdale, we chose this restaurant based on the excellent yelp reviews and zagat ratings. It did not let us down! Chopped salad was definitely one of the best salads I've ever had. What a unique combination of ingredients that totally worked. Short ribs were divine. My boyfriend got the piggy and waffle app which was his favorite part of the meal (although he also really enjoyed the meatloaf). I don't eat pork but I tasted the waffle and it was excellent. We shared the peanut butter banana pudding dessert and it was really really good- better than I even expected based on the description. My cocktail, the Protege, was excellent too. So interesting and complex. Our server was very helpful and friendly. If you are in Scottsdale, definitely don't miss this place."}
{"text":"Wow. We must have went on a bad day or something. Burnt popcorn, tasteless food in super super tiny portions.  Majorly bummed on this place. We drove 40 miles to try it. Waste of gas. Guess thats what we get for going on a weekday afternoon.  We did like our server though."}
{"text":"Very upscale dining experience, exotic menu items like the rabbit and duck meat were beyond expectations, their barrel aged bourbon cocktails were amazing!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love Citizen, not only is the food phenomenal but the service is top tiered! Every time I go I always sit in Sam's section. He's so knowledgeable about the food and wine that it makes the evening A +"}
{"text":"Me and a couple friends from San Francisco were in Phoenix for a conference, so we went on Yelp to find a decent place to have dinner and drinks.  CPH's high rating caught our eyes so we decided to give it a try.    We went on a weekday around 6:30pm and we were seated immediately.  I don't drink, but they seem to have a decent selection of drinks there and my boyfriend really liked the beer he got.  Our waitress (excellent service by the way) highly recommended the chopped salad ($12)so we ordered that, the cheese fondue, the seared scallops (entree, $24), mac & cheese and crab cakes.    I'm normally not a salad person - being Asian, I preferred my veggies cooked.  However, I do love smoked salmon, so I tried a bite of my bf's chopped salad.  Wow!  I was impressed.  The mix of spinach, corn, couscous, pumpkin seeds and salmon created a unique texture and the flavor was perfect with the dressing.  I ended up finishing my bf's salad after he was filled up on the cheese fondue, which was also excellent.  My seared scallops were fantastic as well.  They absorbed the flavor of the bacon bits and were very tender.  I tried a bite of my friend's mac & cheese and it was delicious as well.    Overall, we were very impressed that such a gem exists in Scottsdale.  We couldn't help but think that if the place were in the Bay Area, it would be PACKED every night.  Also, the pricing is very reasonable for the quality of the food and service."}
{"text":"Can I give 20 stars? Because the drinks get 5. The food gets 5. The desserts get 5. And the tap water gets 5. Best in town on all fronts. Seriously. And the service is also off the charts. Fantastic spot. Make reservations...its busy and fun!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Great taste, unique flavors and textures. Loved every bite. Copped salad so unique and filling. White and Tan dessert worth a few bites"}
{"text":"The salad is probably one of the best I have ever eaten. Layers upon layers of fresh vibrant flavor. Excellent ambiance. Perfect place for a date."}
{"text":"Another 5 star rating for Citizen! This place never disappoints. We go for happy hour all the time. If you're into whiskeys, etc. definitely get the Instant Gratification. You won't regret it. The salad actually does warrant its own Facebook page. The steaks are great. The service is exceptional. They staff remembers who you are and what you like to drink. I'll keep this as a regular spot for the rest of my days. They don't make them as good as Citizen anymore. It's a gem!"}
{"text":"Not bad for Scottsdale. If this was in Portland... meh. Beer is cold, people are nice and intentions are good. But there are better places in town for the kind of fare that made Portland famous. When in Phoenix, there are many better options to consider."}
{"text":"I love this place for casual drinks or date night.  The drinks are perfectly done - strong but tasty (get the Manhattan OMG), and the food is worth the price.  Not huge portion sizes but you don't need to be overly stuffed because by the last bite you'll be satisfied thanks to the flavor.  I also enjoy the ambience - very classy but not stuffy.  I definitely will be going back CPH."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for date night last night and it did not disappoint. The service was excellent, and the food was amazing. We split the Kilt Lifter Fondue appetizer, which had amazing flavor. My husband had the Amaro Meatloaf, and before he tasted it he was questioning if $20 was to much to spend on meatloaf; but after he ate it he said that it was worth every penny, and he even loved the roasted zucchini side. I had the Porcini Filet Mignon, which was one of the best steaks I've ever had. We then split the PB&B pudding jar, which was also fantastic.  We also had a few of their drinks, and I really appreciated the fact that their drink menu is full of unique drinks you don't find at every other restaurant. My husband particularly loved The Im-Port.  The atmosphere was nice also. More dressy than your everyday dining but also not overly snooty. Like I said, all in all this was a great dining experience and I'm sure we will go back. :)"}
{"text":"Fantastic speak easy atmosphere. Come here if you want to try an exotic cocktail, especially! The basics are done well, but give something out of the ordinary a try."}
{"text":"Really nice service here, very friendly. I started with a very tasty gazpacho shrimp soup, then the amazing meatloaf, very moist and delicious. My friend had the pork belly pastrami which was awesome, then the chicken. The portions are huge here. We would have been fine with just entrees."}
{"text":"The ambiance:  classy, relaxing, & unpretentious The service:  first rate The server:  knowledgeable, attentive, friendly The food:  very, very good The check:  very reasonable Would we go back:  without a doubt!!"}
{"text":"We gave CPH another try for HH and enjoyed cocktails and bites such as the nuts, bone marrow, hush puppies, chopped salad and the duck burger. All were good but glad to have split the burger as it was very rich and intense. Loved the fries as they cooked very crispy on the outside but pillowy soft inside.   Bone marrow - wasn't a ton of it but liked the mini pancakes underneath. The hush puppies were the best out of the apps. Chopped Salad is always a winner, great crunch and flavors.  It wasn't too busy for a Friday night but our Server wasn't around as much and noticed he was more attentive to the other tables around us. The only difference was that we were around 20 years younger than the other tables. Other than that, enjoyed our meal and drinks @ CPH."}
{"text":"I couldn't wait to try this place. All the reviews and word of mouth were so positive that I felt that I was going in for an awesome experience. Well, I was somewhat let down. Despite the restaurant's success and  I am happy for them,  I found it impossible to carry a conversation with my friend without constantly having the repeat myself....and that just got old real quick.  As we sat down, I already knew I wanted out. The food was okay...definitely not blown away. I had the lamb sandwich as I wanted something that hopefully would not take long to make and minimize my time...so bottomline, what could have been a great experience simply wasn't...and the noise was just unbearable and exhausting. Gastropub maybe, just not the place for me....definitely not a romantic joint....  My friend had the steak salad, and all there was were greens and meat...no other veggies ...just thought t looked kinda bland and boring."}
{"text":"If you haven't heard about Citizen yet, you soon will. Old Town's newest treasure has the perfect combination of great location and ambiance, amazing food, a smart beer list and unrivaled cocktails.   After going twice since the opening some of favorites thus far include:  Lagunitas IPA on tap, Pisco Sour, Turley Zin, Tenderbelly Pork Pastrami Belly Pastrami (a must have), Fair Trade Coffee Charred Short Ribs, and Tenderbelly Pork Tender Loin.   The staff is friendly, prompt and knowledgeable. Citizen offers a variety of seating options, making it a great neighborhood drop in or perfect setting to impress others on a big night out."}
{"text":"Citizens public house is an excellent place for a cocktail. We had great service and really enjoyed our craft cocktails. They are the real deal and boozy but well crafted and perfectly balanced. The night we were here they had the patio open which allowed a fresh breeze into the restaurant. There as a good steady crowd and the food looked amazing. The menu has small plates and offers a variety of options with some unique choices. The drink menu is also very unique. The cocktail my husband had was made with port wine, guiness foam, and bourbon. It was actually tasty and he really enjoyed it. I had a Manhattan and enjoyed it as well. This appears to be a great place for a date or special event or if you're just looking to have an excellent dining experience. We will be back when we're back in the Pheonix area!"}
{"text":"We really liked this place.  We were in Arizona for Spring Training and wanted to try a bunch of local restaurants - we came upon this place on our last night and it was our best meal of the week!  We had the piggies and waffles as an appetizer - and even though we had chicken and waffles for breakfast, it was quite different and fantastic.  They used cornmeal for the waffle - with syrup to dip it all into - it was quite nice.  The food is really good here, they also have a lot of interesting drinks and pull a lot of ingredients from local resources.  The only downside was that it's located in downtown Scottsdale and there are Giants fans everywhere - so if you can handle the smell of those people (heh), it's worth it to check out a place like Citizen Public House.  By the way - we're A's fans - so they probably enjoyed having some classy gents in there for a change."}
{"text":"I love going to restaurants where I find myself planning my next visit before I'm even halfway through the meal. With the recent hype on Yelp, I decided to check it out.   Citizen Public House has a cool vibe; good lighting, a vaulted cieling with dark wood beams, a large open patio, and a bar in the center of the room where all the drink magic happens. I didn't try a cocktail last night, but the drink list looked really good. A lot of classics with a twist.   Our server was awesome - very helpful and passionate about the restaurant. We decided to share the wagyu burger and the grilled cheese of the day. Both were excellent! They came with pickled vegetables on the side (awesome flavor) and \"healthy\" fries (if you don't like greasy fries, these are perfect) served with homemade ketchup. They also rotate a sausage dish of the day (interesting combos such as Schreiner's sausage chorizo corn dogs).   I'm excited to go back to try entrees and drinks. Yay for CPH!"}
{"text":"An absolutely wonderful establishment!   It's the perfect place for all types!   If you like to sit at the bar, the bartenders are knowledgeable and friendly. They offer a full menu at the bar as well. The happy hour is arguably the best in town.   If you prefer to sit at a table you will be graced with an attentive server with an exceptional knowledge about the cuisine, cocktails, wine list and much more.   I suggest Citizen for small or large parties. If you call ahead and need special arrangements they are always accommodating.   Personally I love sitting at the bar, grabbing a Bijou from Thomas and enjoying some of Bernie's Mac'n'Cheese.   But in a larger crowd, Gary is always wonderful at coursing our dinner and making sure the group has enough to eat and he always sneaks in a few laughs.   Overall I love CPH! And you should too!!!"}
{"text":"Loved this place! The ambiance was great and the servers were super friendly and helpful. Really liked that the indoor to outdoor seating was an open floor plan, made the place look larger and more welcoming.   They have a great HH! We started with the meat/cheese plate for only $6 and it was a good sized portion for 2. Also had some wine which was also great for $5. For our main course, the chopped salad was terrific. Very different than most chopped salads I've had but it was great. My boyfriend had the roasted pork and he said it was good but a tad dry."}
{"text":"Even without taking advantage of the wonderful specials for Yelp Restaurant Week, CPH is one of my favorite restaurant samplings.   Waiting just a few minutes for our favorite foodie friends, we sat at the bar, having a brief chat with the charming bartender, who was very familiar with the yumminess that is Tito's Handmade Vodka and other great Texas food and drink.  Our friends arrived before we even had a chance to choose a beverage, so we moved to our table. After perusing the cocktails, our friends chose a Moe-scow Mule and a Sazerac, while my husband selected the Berried Alive and I ordered the Count Negroni, never having tried Campari.  Our waitress (Gina?) was a delight, telling us about the specials and reminding us the drinks were all hand-made so there might be a slight wait.  Moments later, with drinks in hand, we had appetizers on the way (we chose the sausage of the day and the famous chopped salad, then later added the crab cakes and the bacon fat popcorn).  The drinks were described as \"another one of these would kick my butt, but it's really good\" (Sazerac), delightfully refreshing (Moe-scow Mule) and very good (Berried Alive).  Unfortunately, I was disappointed with my choice.  My husband jokes I'm the only person he knows who likes the taste of Nyquil and Pepto Bismol, and I generally do enjoy very strong drinks, but the Count proved to be too bitter for my palate.  As if she had donned her Carnac the Magnificent hat, Gina came to check in and suggested if we didn't care for our choices, she'd gladly switch them out.  Oh, yes ma'am!  I'll take a Berried Alive, please.  The chopped salad was a pleasant surprise, but I'm not sure it's at the legend status of having its own Facebook page.  The crab cakes were very tasty, my only wish was for a bit more of the aioli.  My favorites were the sausage of the day, slightly spicy and served with braised greens and the bacon popcorn, but of course, how bad can anything be drenched in bacon drippings?!?! The lovely L.C. and I each chose the scallops (at half price thanks to the Yelp R.W. special, quite possibly the deal of the century).  Wanting some wine with the scallops, I wasconsidering an Argentinian pinot grigio or an albarino from the Central Coast (intriguing because most albarinos I've had are Spanish).  Asking Gina for her recommendation, she quickly offered to bring me a taste of both, as well as another Spanish white.  Gina, you are definitely my kind of girl.  While I would have easily enjoyed any of the 3, my top pick was the Central Coast albarino. When presented with the scallops surrounded by sauteed pea shoots and atop a lovely bed of corn and bacon grits,  we both were delighted with the flavor combination.  Due to a bad experience with scallops several years ago, I had been off the shellfish for quite some time.  Chef Bernie's treatment convinced me that yes, scallops are good again.   The boys went with the pork loin (another special) and the coffee rubbed short ribs.  I didn't taste the pork, but our friend proclaimed it very good.  I did get my husband to part with a small sampling of the short ribs, parsnip puree and cherry bbq sauce.  Oh my stars, it was quite possibly the closest I have come to the flavor magic that is delicious Central Texas barbecue (for those of you who have had the privilege to sample Smitty's, Kreuz, Black's and the original Cooper's in Llano when those temples of carnivorous delights are at the top of their game, you know what I'm talking about). After all of this, we still managed to order 4 desserts.  Our friend is a major chocolate hound and had to have both the Pots de Creme AND the chocolate pecan bars.  It of course helped that they were part of the special menu.  My husband went with the bread pudding (any type of bread pudding/custard/flan/creme brulee are among his favorites).  The delightful Gina also told us about a new trial dessert not yet on the menu: donut holes dipped in cinnamon sugar and served with 3 dipping sauces.  HELLO GORGEOUS, you had me at cinnamon sugar! The donut holes were by far my husband's and my favorite, especially when I drizzled them with a bit of each of the sauces (lemon, blueberry and caramel).  Usually a fan of bread pudding, my husband admitted it was not among his favorites.  He said it maybe could have been served slightly warmer   It was probably just because although good, it paled in comparison to both the donut holes and the pots de creme. After a delightful evening made that much better by the company of our dear friends, delicious food and drink and warm, professional service, we left sated.  We will definitely return, hopefully soon."}
{"text":"Always wanted to check this place out, was disappointed that they didn't serve lunch. Finally had an opportunity for a dinner, it was delicious. This is a sister restaurant to The Gladly. If you've been there there are many similarities.   The crabcakes are to die for, fondue was good, filet mignon tacos were just OK, short ribs were pretty good but the parsnip purée was amazing!  Black and tan dessert was also spectacular.  I know it's kind of an \"in thing\" but I'm not into bitter drinks and it seems like both restaurants specialize in making their signature drinks bitter.   I would definitely recommend to a friend."}
{"text":"This is my all time favorite place in Old Town.  Great food (try the chopped salad for something light, or the short ribs if you had a good workout recently), creative drinks with super friendly bartenders and overall a good vibe.  This is my go-to place for visitors or work events.  Highly highly recommend."}
{"text":"Pros: 1. The scallops, meatloaf, and sea bass entrees were all very delicious and flavorful and cooked properly. The meatloaf is very filling; it comes with mashed potatoes that is so velvety and buttery. I loved the sauce that came with the scallops.  2. Convenient location; lots of parking (free) 3. Food arrives quickly  Cons: 1. The restaurant is very dimly lit. 2. Extremely loud, not from the music but from so many people packed into one room 3. The actual restaurant doesn't look as nice as in the pictures. The place is kind of plain.   Definitely a place to go to for the food more than the ambience, and I would go during an off peak time so that you can hear what your dinner mates are saying."}
{"text":"Lovely place, exceeded expectations!!!  Pros: Amazing food-chop salad and scallops were best we've ever had Lovely service and our server was awesome Kid friendly-despite not looking the part  Cons: none"}
{"text":"Cute restaurant in Old Town Scottsdale, close to everything. Came to eat before show at Scottsdale Center for Performing Arts.   Service; Robbie the Server was super friendly and very helpful knowing it was my first time. He was always ensuring we were ok.   Food; We split a Salad and Scallops, both were delicious.  The Original Chopped Salad is amazing just as the Menu indicated, the Salad had the perfect mixture of all ingredients.   Wine; Trued the Pinot Grigio and its was very tasty."}
{"text":"Mid-priced dining with high end flavor. I ordered the special Yelp menu. Started off with mixed green salad with fig dressing. Very good. Moved on the the \"smart\" chicken. Tender, char grilled breast with corn risotto. Yum!  Topped it off with a perfect chocolate de creme. Staff was friendly and very on top of things. Great experience.  I'm definitely coming back. give these guys some love!"}
{"text":"Holy crap! Their Chopped salad is to die for. Order it! Also their fried bologna sandwich is divine and has so many great textures and flavors that blend perfectly together. I keep craving that rum punch cocktail and they definitely make an honest drink... Which they should since they are a little pricey. Happy hour is good though!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I are new to the area, and we have been going around and trying all of these cool restuarants to eat. This was by far our favorite one! The service was fantastic and the atmosphere was right up our alley. A really elegant, but also a casual place to enjoy a great meal. My boyfriend had the Pork Shank and it was the most amazing dish we have ever had. I would highly recommend! We will definitely be coming back here in the future."}
{"text":"The restaurant has a really nice ambiance, especially for a gastropub. The service was fine, nothing poor or exceptional about it. They have a great drink menu, with good inexpensive drinks (local beers for $5-10) as well as fine wines for the special occasion. The food was good quality and very fresh, but the taste of my entree, the lamb burger, was average. All in all I will go again and try some of the other food."}
{"text":"We had a great meal - I would go back in a heartbeat.  I reccomend the pork osoboko"}
{"text":"I had very high expectations with all the great yelp reviews so I was a bit disappointed.  Similar to another yelper i just was not super excited about anything on the menu and typically I love to try new things.  We started with crab cakes and salads.  Crab cakes we excellent, salads were basic, no anchovies for the Caesar salad.  For dinner one of us had duck, one had steak,  two chicken dinners and one barramundi. Everyone thought their meal was good but nothing special at all, very basic.  Most of the entrees came with risotto that was fairly oily and salty.  Server was great."}
{"text":"Parentals brought yer boy here for bday #29. The wifey and I were early so we sat at the bar. I ordered a Manhattan. That ish was turnt to eleven. Bartender made us feel special. Sparks were flying on the conversational tip and literally as well. There was fire involved with the assembly of my drink. Fire is dope. Ma n Pah arrived so we moved from the bar to our table. The ambiance was sessy in the dining areas. Dim. Candles. Music. Booze. If you are trying to get under some garments then I recommend bringing your date here. Our waiter danced through the menu for us.. highlighting all his favorite items. Dude was like the Fred Astaire of wait staff. His charm worked too cuz my party ordered like everything off the menu. Pork belly. Fondue. Mac n cheese to start. I recommend you not order both the mac n cheese plus fondue because they use the same cheese for both. Good shit none the less. Belly was ill too. Dem brussel sprouts on the belly had me smiling.. the 16 year scotch which I transitioned to probably loosened that grin a bit too. Yum. Mom got ribs. Wife got chicken. Dad got meatloaf. Birthday boy (muah) got the duck. I tried each dish. All were spectacular. The chicken stood out though.. and usually I'm like: fuck ordering chicken at a nice(r) establishment. I remember thinking, \"For reals boo? Chicken breast?\" But oooh weee was I wrong. Delicious. Bread pudding was sweet to start then finished spicy as a damn Puerto Rican. What a great time!"}
{"text":"I came here for a friends birthday :) we had a blast.   Loveeeee this place. Candle lit, dim lights. It's pretty, classy and romantic. Definitely date night place to be.   Food? Amazing. Chopped salad was delightfu and pretty. I love my truffle cheese sandwich.  It was delicious,  first bite was heaven. Yummm The gnocchi was alright, I felt like they open a can of tomato can paste and threw it on a plate.   drinks, The hot pink Paloma was a bit bitter, but thw after taste was perfect. My friend had the sangria, all I taste was the juice. It would be nice if they made it stronger.  $2 per person to cut OUR cake..... umm yeah. There's three of us. What if we had a huge group?!!?! -he up sale my entrée without telling me, but he comp me.  I shall come back!!"}
{"text":"Citizen Public House is simply amazing!  I went there last night with a friend and we loved it!  Cool place with a great vibe.    I normally drink red wine when I go out but last night I decided to step out of my comfort zone (thanks to one very knowledgeable and helpful bartender) and try a cocktail.  Thank goodness I did!  The Moe'scow Mule was fantastic and exactly what I wanted.  I told him I didn't like sweet drinks and he picked the right one for me.  Vodka, ginger beer, lime and cucumber.  It  was refreshing and delightful.    Next up comes some little samplings of their flavored tequila courtesy of that same bartender. Now that is what I call great service!  I actually don't like tequila but these were actually decent.    Choosing what to order for din din was difficult because everything sounded great!  I decided to go for the AZ BLT which had bacon, Campari tomato, and greens all on caramelized French bread with some sort of mayo heaven on it.  O-M-G!  It was by far the most delicious, perfect BLT I have ever had!  Seriously....I couldn't get enough.   After dinner, Richie the Mixologist came over to us and my friend asked about a Bananas Foster drink she had over at the old Estate House.  Richie said he would make us HIS Bananas Foster drink to see what we thought.  Next thing you know he is lighting things on fire with a blow torch and mixing it all up.  Wow!  Quite a show and the finished product was heaven.  The perfect ending to a wonderful experience.  The staff is very knowledgeable and passionate about their restaurant and it shows.  So warm and welcoming!  Citizen Public House is a diner's dream and I can't wait to go back to try everything else on the menu.  If you haven't been, you are truly missing out!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had dinner last night!  Food and service were excellent!  We split the Chopped Salad!! So delicious!  We split the Ono Fish! Plenty of food and again, delicious!"}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic!   My boyfriend and I went here for the first time for our anniversary and it could not have been a better experience.   Our server (I think his name was Kent) was the most helpful, knowledgable, and simply fantastic server we have ever had. He definitely helped us in making decisions and making it easy to be a first time customer. He had suggested the chopped salad and we weren't disappointed in the slightest. Also, he gave me the best Shirley Temple I've ever had. He had given us a complimentary box of two little red velvet truffles for our anniversary and my boyfriend almost ate mine, they were so good.  Even if the food wasn't as fantastic as it is, we would go back because of him.   I suggest the Short Ribs with the cherry BBQ sauce. It was probably the best meal I've had in a very long time. It's immensely flavorful and will surprise your taste buds. My boyfriend had the Meatloaf and couldn't get over how delicious it was.   The atmosphere is high class mixed with a bit of rusticity and had a comfortable feel. The staff is immensely friendly and helpful. It is a bit pricy, both our meals came to $93. Definitely worth it for a date night or special occasion.   This is by far my new favorite resturaunt. If you haven't been, you should definitely go."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a fancy dinner but want to attend casual this is the place for you. I love good food but hate getting all dolled up to eat. I strolled in with lip flops and felt super welcomed. The staff was friendly and helpful despite that we looked like slobs on vacation. We ordered the short ribs... ridiculously good, the sauce- heaven! And the buttermilk chicken, cooked perfectly and flavorful throughout. Would definitely goo again and order the same thing."}
{"text":"Great food, fun atmosphere and our servers Travis Heisler and Katie were awesome with a great knowledge of the menu and even let us know about new items not listened yet. All their suggestions for food and drinks were amazing. If you like the Glady, you'll love this place too!"}
{"text":"Just repeating but chopped salad amazing! Popcorn awesome as well. Definitely will come back."}
{"text":"Loved everything about this place! I'm vegetarian so the menu was limiting for me but I ordered the chopped salad with no salmon and the appetizer mac & cheese. Even though they're both appetizers, the portions were big enough for me to get full. The drinks here were also delicious!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this restaurant.  It exceeded my expectations in every metric:  The staff was knowledgeable in their beer and wine selection, the waiter was able to provide information on how the food is prepared and about the flavor combinations.  The servers were attentive, and the food lived up to the waiter's boasts."}
{"text":"The steak salad - mouth & mind-blowing... seriously, go get it now. Chopped salad? Always a favorite, but also available at Cowboy Ciao. The fried chicken (incredible) and waffle (inedible) left us wanting more fried meat, but the truly stellar service made us forget about food we didn't care to eat.  A warning: the dessert is NOT worth 10 dollars,  Not nearly as interesting as the description implies, They were standard, too small, and left much to be desired...  the apple pie, cheesecake, and bread pudding just tasted like lies.  The ambiance, romantic, and service, quite grand. The main courses were great (though the waffle was bland). You're likely to leave CPH full of quality cuisine and glee, and if it's yo birthday, they'll give you fudge balls, fo' free."}
{"text":"Went for restaurant week, while visiting Phoenix and it did not disappoint.  Great staple entrees done really really well.  I had the chopped salad (yummy!!) the meatloaf, which was extra large, I have dinner for tomorrow night too, and then the peanut butter and banana bread pudding, yum yum but put me over on the full scale.  All for 30 bucks.  Very happy with my choice to come here.  I rarely give 5 stars so 4 stars is damn good in my book."}
{"text":"Was really excited to try this place after reading all of the great reviews and l also thought this would be a great place to celebrate my Aunt and Uncles Anniversary...  :(  Where to start.... This place is crazy loud, had to keep shouting and saying what!!!  Things started off good with our waiter Jeremy but as the night went on and he got busier rarely saw him again. The apps and drinks were good. Watermelon salad and chopped salad were great and would order again. Was perfect for four people. My Aunt and I ordered the buttermilk chicken and my uncle had the short ribs and my wife had the scallops. The chicken... for the price was expecting something amazing but it was not. No flavor whatsoever and was a touch overcooked, same for my Aunt's chicken. We talked to Jeremy our waiter about the chicken and he said that it is considered a healthy dish... So your telling me that every healthy dish you serve has no flavor??? good to know for next time... oh wait there wont be a next time.   The other dishes were great though. My wife's scallops were great as well as my Uncle's short ribs.   It was very surprising to me the way Jeremy handled the situation with the chicken. I know that if I was waiting on a table and saw that two of my guest's had a plate of uneaten food I would have done everything I could do to make things right. Especially for the price and reputation of this place."}
{"text":"Cocktails are where it's at.  Happening bar and great quality food.  Servers have always been extremely friendly and knowledgeable.  Reminds me of back East a bit."}
{"text":"A hidden gem in Phoenix. I easily give the bar 5-stars, but I've gotta go 4-stars overall. Don't get me wrong, the food and service is wonderful, but overall the restaurant is lacking just a tiny bit in the \"awesome vibe\" factor (if that makes sense). Great for a date night. My husband and I typically turn to Citizen Public House for drinks at the bar - either before dinner or for a nightcap before heading home.   The big, dark wood bar is stationed in the main attraction of the restaurant and feels very hip and mysterious all at the same time. Unlike so many bars (especially in Scottsdale), Citizen Public House prides itself on actual bar mixologists. I've seen some of the most elaborate cocktails being poured and served at this bar - it's so fun to watch and learn. The bartenders are wonderful, knowledgeable and nice to boot. You can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"The Chop Salad alone is enough for me to rate this place so highly.  It's what they're most known for.  Get it.  Enjoy it.  You're welcome (psh like i can take credit for suggesting what so many other people have already suggested).    The bacon heirloom popcorn is genius.  Instead of butter you use bacon pieces and bacon grease to flavor the popcorn?!  *deep fat kid labored breathing*"}
{"text":"Citizens is a solid date night option, and even has a pretty intense following for their chopped salad (I know that sounds weird). But seriously, stray away from that as a main dish and try something like the tacos or the short ribs. I always walk away pretty satisfied, but my bank account is a little sad"}
{"text":"Highly recommend. Table had short rib, tuna and scollop entrées - all were excellent.   The real winner was the Mac &  Cheese side. Wow - I would have that as the main course. Spicy, slight kick. Ridiculous.   Cool vibe, nice atmosphere. Packed bar and dining room Thursday night."}
{"text":"I have been here a couple times now and it's definitely a place to check out.  As so many yelpers have already mentioned, the chopped salad is delicious. Definitely something to try at Citizen. Also, the pastrami!!! Oh man, that was so melt in your mouth yummy! Smaller portion, probably not a meal for most but it was so good I would order it again. The lamb burger is a huge meal that comes with perfectly crispy scrumptious fries. The patty isn't cut down with beef or pork so the flavor is very game-y which can be a good thing if you are into that. I wasn't quite so used to it. :) I also tried a bit of my friend's Smart Chicken which was amazingly tender and juicy and perfectly seasoned! Also, really organic and fresh which I love. I tried the Citi-zen mixed drink which was very lemony and a bit on the sour side. I wasn't in love with the flavor. I did however love the rock candy that came with it. lol.  The service was awesomeeeeee!!! We came in near closing but they still happily sat us instead of shooing us away. Our waiter was very attentive, answered all our questions about the menu and made some great suggestions. He also took us on a tour of the speak easy style bar upstairs which was super interesting! Apparently you go around the side of the building and there's a posting of \"the rules\". You call the number and if they have room you will be let up to this chic modern bar. All the mixologists make special drinks from their own liquors. Really cool!"}
{"text":"Only go hear if you want amazing food.  This is the best meal I have had in the Phoenix area. We spent $100~ for 2 with a drink.  The food is amazing, creative. The ambiance is refined, but also super casual and no fuss.  Just do it...."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service.  Love the Chopped Salad."}
{"text":"Once again a great experience. The fixed menu for Valentine's Day was wonderful and the service is the best.  The scallops were so good....in fact, Ber I've ever had. The were buttery but the bacon and grits really evened out the sea saltiness! The julep hit the spot but was a little minty."}
{"text":"Yes, the Chopped Salad is as good as everyone says it is. And yes, you can order almost anything off the menu and be pleased with it (though the meatloaf is average).  What really shines through is the service here. Seriously, it's definitely in my top 5 best restaurants for outstanding service."}
{"text":"A double date dinner ensued within a strange blend of cacophony & a bit of intimacy--as long as our conversations were more vociferous than usual.  As a gastropub, nestled in the Old Town of Scottsdale, CPH equally focuses on their large, encircling bar, practically in the center of their contemporary, fine dine-esque ambiance.  Speaking of bar, I began imbibing on this weirdly calming Persian ($9), evidently consisting of cucumber juice, wild tea vodka, & the wondrous St. Germain elderflower liqueur.  DL, Angela T, Kurdy S, & I initially shared with one that's highly recommended that you'd have to check CPH's Facebook for their ingredients--we knew & tasted why.  The Original Chopped Salad ($12) was marvelously delicious & amazingly textured for its strong yet well-balanced ingredients: smoky salmon pieces, perfectly firm couscous, verdant arugula, perfectly crunchy freeze-dried corn, humble aged asiago cheese, & intricately robust yet controllable dressing.  It may look so modest, but based on the numerous items (including some I didn't list here) I can imagine splurging half of them just to amalgamate this healthy salad.  Then each of us got an entrée that we were personally hankering for.  I persistently leaned on the Lamb Burger ($13), which I thought it was juicy, well-seasoned & quite vigorously gamey.  The Kennebec Fries were consistently textured well while surmounting a strong aroma of truffle oil.  Though to be frank I would've greatly raved for this burger if the Serbian Lepinja roll (aka the buns) weren't stiff, which deemed too difficult to cut it and become safely shareable.  At 1st we were expressively reluctant to order the Buttermilk Roasted Chicken ($20), which was a white meat dish.  But after asking questions & then receiving well-thought consultations from our exuberantly friendly waiter, we're so blessed that we didn't choose the alternate (which was this Rockfish plate). It was the biggest chicken breast I've ever delved into--at 2 days of marinating, followed by some grilling sensation--pleasurably savoring into such incredibly moist, sweet & savory, & complexly scrumptious hunk of lightly colored meat.  Whether eaten alone or with the poultry the sweet corn-butter bean succotash was indescribably tasty, though the Brussels sprouts here were more in a bitter side for my palate.  Conclusively, I would have graded CPH slightly lower due to the burger, noise bouncing off the walls all-over & difficult menu-perusing in a very dimly lit atmosphere that maybe a few chandeliers would be more helpful, esp for photo-taking =P.  Fortunately, our applauding, exceptionally knowledgeable waiter &, consequently, the utmost deliciousness of the chicken and salad made a surprisingly outstanding dinner for me that I'll gladly present this Scottsdale eat a 4.5.  Although we arrived w/o reservations, the increasing crowd later in the night would speak for itself.  And if you're completely unfamiliar w/ its neighborhood, you can either park street for free at their 3-hour limit or, if they're not available, on one of those parking garages."}
{"text":"Happened to stumble upon this during their restaurant week so had a 3 course meal for $33. But I would come back to try other things on the menu, good flavors and good service!  Chopped salad - such great flavors and the smoked salmon was great add! Scallops - full portion of this and it was sooooo good. Excellent grits too Black & tan - good finish to the meal  Old fashioned was just ok"}
{"text":"Food like this exists?! In Scottsdale?! I think Scottsdale has better tasting food than San Diego! I saw Citizen on yelp and had my eye on it but was a bit tainted because my friend and I have bad experiences with \"gastropubs\" or at least the ones in Cali. It always turned out to be horrible tasting food that tries tooooo cool and overpriced... we took the leap of faith and said fck it lets do it, maybe Scottsdale gastropubs will be different, and indeed it was!  We couldn't get reservations (place is packed for a good reason) but the hostess said there were bar seats available, and we were cool with that. We just wanted food in and out. Also it was fight night, all the other bars were charging $20 each, why not spend that money on good food instead?   I couldn't believe how good the food tasted here. I was in shocked because... well it's Scottsdale, wasn't sure if this was a foodie mecca. Citizen (and amongst other places) proved me wrong. We decided not to stuff our faces and instead get 2 apps and 1 entrees.  -Chia Seared Tuna: the best seared tuna and most creative seared tuna I've tried thus far...and I eat out a lot (1130+ reviews). The chia seeds were unique and gave it an amazing crunch! Put that with the asparagus puree, black-like rice and a spicy puree...it was a burst of flavors in your mouth. We licked the plate clean. -Crabcakes: For a landlock town, they sure weren't stingy on the crab meat! Every bit had crab and the breading was at a minimal so you actually tasted the crab!The aioli was also good on it but it was flavorful itself you probably didn't need it! -Pork Osso Buco: We usually have lamb, but pork is also a good alternative. The pork by itself is dry, but if you actually mix all the flavors it was not at all dry and had sooo many flavors. The polenta that tasted like butter and cheese with the roasted tomatoes and kale... it literally made my mouth melt and fall in love with this dish. The kale was cooked perfect! I can eat this everyday.   Everything we had that night was excellent. This place sure was not the hype. Service was great, good was great, company was great... I think this is as good as it gets in Scottsdale for dinner... put this in SD and it'll be the new \"it\" restaurant. *Hint Hint* Come on over"}
{"text":"I flew in from Chicago to celebrate my 60th birthday with my family and my favorite restaurant. All the food was excellent from our appetizers of Fondue, Tuna and Burrata thru our Branzino, Meatloaf and Chicken (prepared special for my birthday) to our Desserts. (delivered by the chef) . The Pot de Creme just melted in your mouth. Let's not forget the staff. They were all so friendly from the busboys up thru the Manager. Gary was our waiter and he was amazing. They all work together as a team which makes this the best restaurant from the time you walk in to the time you leave..Thank you for making my birthday so special."}
{"text":"Great food as always! I've never reviewed CPH on Yelp and have finally got around to it. Had dinner here this past weekend and overall service and food was excellent. I have found that some Scottsdale restaurants can sometimes have some stuffy/uppity type of service (I'm better than you vibe at times.) Not the case here! Everyone is always so friendly and accommodating and they aim to please. Saturday was super busy and a packed restaurant - food quality or presentation didn't suffer at all because of it and neither did the service. Highly recommend the fondue starter and osso bucco. I would however like to see a couple more Pinot Grigio and Sauvignon Blanc options on the white wine by glass menu. All in all it doesn't matter! All around great. Keep it up, CPH! I will continue to frequent when I'm in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"We went in with reservations for a party of 9 consisting of my family, sister and her family, and a friend from out of state. They were like, whats for dinner? I couldn't take them just anywhere with sub-par food...that would make me lame. So after some thinking we went here. And I'm so glad we did. They accommodated us by giving us our own private area, which was super nice with two young children. The interior was nicely decorated and dimly lit, making it a romantic and intimate setting. However, we noticed it was quite loud inside. On to the food.   The food was fabulous. I highly highly recommend the chopped salad, which is what they're known for. It is so popular, the salad has its own Facebook page! We also had the pork belly pastrami, the grilled octopus, and the bacon fat popcorn for appetizers. Every single one of them were unique, savory, and very good. I was happy with all of them.   Our entrées were the scallops (ahhhhmazing!), Chia crusted tuna (very good!), Italian beef sandwhich (sooo good), meatloaf (big portion and savory!) and Cornish hen (though tasty, not the best dish).   We are very pleased we came here for dinner. We had excellent service from our waiter, Kent! This is a new favorite."}
{"text":"I attended a meeting here, first visit ever. This place was great. I was able to try multiple Appetizers including the bruschetta, steak skewer, and crab cake. All delicious. Then I tried their signature chop salad and I highly recommend it. For dinner I had the filet mignon which came with potatoes and a veggies.... Yumo... The other attendees ordered both scallops and the buttermilk chicken... All looked amazing. The dessert was nothing to brag about and def. not their strong suit. I had cypress Chardonnay (wow) and their coffee wAs amazing. I will def be back. They aren't cheap but the good was worth it..."}
{"text":"First, I must say I love Citizen Public House.  I've eaten here four or five times and every meal has been delicious.  My favorite so far is the Scallops but the meatloaf is great too as is the filet.  The Chopped salad is a must have!!  And they make kick ass drinks here.   The only thing keeping me from giving this place 5 stars is the overly attentive service.  The service can make of break a restaurant and the service here is good, but on two different occasions while I was dining here the servers kept interrupting to ask if we needed anything.  I was enjoying my company and conversation and both times had to let the server know to back off a bit.  And they didn't.  I appreciate attentiveness but this was too much.  I'd appreciate a little presence and intuitiveness over the constant tending to.   I won't let the minor complaint keep me away from this delicious food."}
{"text":"I don't live in Phoenix however whenever I'm here I try and stop at citizen public house. Every single time I've been here whichever dish I have ordered has been amazing, tasteful and one could even say orgasmic. I am one for paying for good food and I definitely think you get what you pay for with public house."}
{"text":"My out of town friends decided to get a lil fancy schmancy and reserve the private room for din din. I've been to the restaurant area before but never to this private room. The scenery of this room pulled all stops with beautiful chandeliers, dim lighting, and even your private bar with your own private bartender.  For appetizers we ordered the fondue to share and it was the most creamiest, tastiest fondue ever made. Yes, I'm still craving it. I ordered the pan seared scallops which was cooked to perfection. We spent A long time enjoying the evening with our group and didn't feel rushed.  This place is a must for date night and must make reservations ahead. Everything was just fabulous."}
{"text":"I'm finally getting around to reviewing this place after going a handful of times.  Absolutely one of my favorite places!   I went here because of yelp, was dying to try the salad which was amazing! The combo of flavors and textures is amazing. My mom hates fish, when I brought her here she got her salad with chicken, I gave her a bite of mine with the salmon and she's like wow that's good, I wish I got that! That's coming from someone who you'd have to force feed any type of fish. It was still good with the chicken but the smokey salmon flavor really adds to the salad. This specific trip we came here extremely dressed down, which I kind of expected weird looks or different service based on our attire (because most people are dressed up or in business attire), but the service was still amazing and the waiter even sat with us and asked if we had any questions about the menu. I love that we weren't treated different for being in shorts and a tank top.   Another visit I was having a bad day and came alone and sat at the bar, one of the waiters came over and said \"we were making drinks and made an extra one if you would like it.\" I'm not a whiskey fan but even that was good! I wish I got the name, it had a lemon peel in it, it's a drink on the menu. Very good and that type of little surprise makes for  an awesome experience and a returning customer :) made my day.  Here's some of the stuff I've ordered here:  -Tuna: it looks raw and has these little black dots on it, visually I was like, that looks gross, it was really good though, almost melts in your mouth.  -The crab cakes: these were sadly a disappointment, they were jalapeño crab cakes but they taste as if they had been frozen and were dry.   -The dessert with the sugar cookie: the house made whipped cream is really good but the mousse itself remind me of the dessert shooters at Applebee's, the cookie was really good though but overall not something I'd get again.   -Beer: most of the beers they have on tap are kind of men beers, a lot of dark or rich beers. I sampled a few beers but I didn't like them. I like pale ales, so not much selection there. Ended up getting a bottle of Stella that visit.  -Lemon drop martinis: they make them very good!  -Hummus: I don't like hummus but it was still good, the flat bread it comes with is very warm and delicious, the other sauce it came with was so good though, it's a white creamy sauce, don't know what it's called, but has a citrus-like flavor to it which I loved, I'd definitely order that again.   -The chopped salad of course is my favorite and would go again just for that!     Never had a bad time here. Look forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"Great place for social and foodie gathering.  Although they have a broad set of menu choices, they are known for an exceptional tossed chef's salad like no other you have ever had.  I concur... best salad I've ever had.  I wholeheartedly recommend."}
{"text":"Loved my night at the bar here.  Had raced 50 miles that day, so I was hungry.  The bar crew, Will, Thomas and Alex were awesome.  Patrons were fab too -ended up staying for nearly 5 hours!  Started with some pork belly and a local pale ale, then the delicious duck burger with a surprising Lebanese wine, black (chocolate) and tan (butterscotch) dessert iin a glass jar with peanut butter crumbles and a delicious shortbread cookie that paired nicely with indecent obsession cocktail, the ridiculous bacon popcorn, a tasty bonded boulevardier (altough I do wish they had the big ice cubes) and a couple of shots rounded out a really fun night."}
{"text":"Finally, I got to dine here! It was well worth the wait. I came here last Friday (2/22) to take advantage of the last day of AZ Cocktail Week. Usually this place is really busy and it's hard to get a table without a bit of a wait. Thankfully, we made reservations!   This place is so cool. The atmosphere is really hip and classy. I had been here (and Citizen R + D) a few times before but wanted to wait until I tried the food to make a review.   I had the Negroni cocktail, which was..alright. I mean, I can't really judge a drink when I've never had it before and it wasn't my cup o' tea but I'm sure if you like gin you'd enjoy it! I've had their Moscow Mule before and the Cotton Cooler (at R + D) so I'm confident in their cocktail skills.   There aren't too many veg options on the menu. There were a few things that caught my eye though-the mac n cheese and the grilled cheese sandwich. In the battle of which cheesy dish to select, I went with the grilled cheese since it seemed like a healthier option (the only healthy aspect being that it came with a field greens salad). Let me just say..this might've been the best grilled cheese I've had IN MY LIFE. This sandwich was not only melty cheese goodness, but had truffled mashed potatoes and onions on it. The salad was pretty delicious too, but the sandwich was definitely the standout.   The service was really good and our server was very informative on the menu & friendly. It was a great dining experience! And I will probably try to recreate the grilled cheese at home. It was that good."}
{"text":"Pricey but good. Excellent Short Ribs and wonderful Rack ofLamb served attentively in a nice ambiance. Gotta go back for the Chef's Salad which sounds wonderful. Disappointing array of tap beers for a \"public house.\""}
{"text":"First time here and will definitely not be the last!  Awesome bar tender who knew the menu and made excellent recommendations.   The pork shank was perfectly cooked and had a fantastic sauce with fingerling potatoes.   Combine that with a great bar stocked with top shelf spirits and you cannot go wrong."}
{"text":"The ambiance was disappointing, and the food was way overpriced. All of the promotions and photos indicate this would be a cozy restaurant with ample decor to support their \"sense of old community and public house vibe\", but this \"public tavern\" image certainly isn't what you get. There are white walls with a few collections of framed pictures. It reminded me of a Bar Rescue makeover, but Jon Taffer would certainly be impressed with the volume of business... it's like there isn't enough game in town.  The \"happy hour\" cocktails were essentially half-size, which negates the point of \"happy hour\" pricing. Even more disappointing, the cocktails weren't mixed. You could see the layer of liquor through the glass. Don't get me started on the $20 Chilean Crab Cakes that had a funky texture."}
{"text":"This place is on point in Scottsdale. Our mixologist Will was awesome. We tried some of the drinks he made in a competition recently (they are not on the menu) and they were to die for. He makes great drinks  I would come back just for the cocktails...we had some bites - the tacos (awesome) and the chopped salad (do it!!!!!!). Would love to come back and try more of the food, but I know it would be nothing short of amazing."}
{"text":"Multiple visits. Great staff.  Great menu. Fair prices for quality. Chopped salad is a must. Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Pair the pork belly pastrami with the Chopped salad (this isn't a regular Chopped salad), it's amazing!!!!  Brandon, Brandon and Brian were awesome!  The ribs melted in my mouth. The Sazerac drink was awesome. Friends had the meatloaf, isn't your mothers meatloaf, and scallops, well executed. Dessert was a cherry on top (pun intended) to the dinner. Great place, isn't cheap but you certainly get what you pay for!"}
{"text":"Arrived early for my res, hostess was sweet. Sat at the bar, had a cocktail and was promptly seated at a booth. Waitress was diligent in explaining every item on the menu. I had the short ribs cuz I make my own and always wanna judge the competition. Started with the pork-bun appy, this is 3/4 inch bacon fat, delicious if you can get over eating large chunks of bacon fat. Had the chopped salad too, its a salad with it's own facebook page enuf said.  My guests both had the filet. Loved it. I had the aforementioned short rib. Originally it appeared to be quite a large portion with 4x ribs, layer of fat, and a chunk of meat on top. After digging in I realized the \"chunk\" was really quite small and the only other meat in this dish was the tiny portion between the ribs. The flavor of the meat was quite lacking- supposed to be \"coffee braised\", the sauce provided was very sweet- apple- more along the lines of barbeque than typical braised short ribs. Not for me very disappointed..  BOTTOM LINE: Great overall experience. Short ribs fell short."}
{"text":"Food was awesome.  I think my favorite thing was the pork shank.  It was amazing.  I got the filet and the carrot purée was delicious.  Friends got scallops, also divine and then the short rib.  I really don't know how you could go wrong.  I drank the socialite cocktail the whole night because it was perfect for me.  For appetizers we had the fondue and the omfg salad with salmon.  The reviews are right, try it.  Delicious.  We split it at the table as an app.  Last but not least we had the best waiter Gary who brought me a nice scoop of birthday ice cream and had SO much fun with him.  I had a great night with great friends and couldn't have been somewhere better on my birthday."}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken breast entrée. It took 20 minutes and came out with a single chicken breast that was overcooked, dry and very bland with literally three Brussels sprouts cut in half. The small portion of risotto was fine, but the chorizo sauce was more like 2 teaspoons of Frank's hot sauce drizzled on the plate.  This meal wasn't worth $10. Much less what they charge for it. The beer was a good happy hour price. If you like it happy hour drinks this place is alright."}
{"text":"The food here was pretty good. I did not find it amazing but they have some good selections. The food was a bit pricey but thats because your paying for the atmosphere as well. The highlight of this place was the exceptional service provided!"}
{"text":"Gluten free person's nirvana! Fried chicken, waffles and a brownie- all gluten free. Love this place. I can order off the menu without substitutions and special requests. Makes me feel normal for once."}
{"text":"The Famous Chopped Salad is to die for! I think I could eat it every day. I ordered the scallops without bacon as my main course. I would have given 5 stars but my scallops came with bacon. The server quickly re plated my entree. The scallops were delicious as well! I had the Cider Shandy and Paloma to drink. They were good but I wasn't overwhelmed. They just changed their cocktail menu so I'm wondering if that had something to do with it."}
{"text":"Warning, do not let me order. This is what happens when you let me order, which you did, exactly why I do not know except for you were kind and generous and prefer to have me participate rather than to dictate. But you should have ordered for us. See what we did when I made the decision: salad, of course the salad; pork cheeks, yum and unusual; ramen, the special of that evening; and the duck burger. Large enough to feed four people, not two, now you've done it. We are going to eat beyond well. We will eat until we can't eat any more.   This place is wildly popular, over a thousand reviews, still four and half stars. That's hard to get. It's difficult to find a table, so you suggested to walk in, so we did, and we found a perfect seating at the bar, and got tended by a professional -  not too chatty, not too cold, always approachable, and he kept your water filled with ice. Something you no longer see in San Francisco. The iced water is so passé in San Francisco. It's too Americana, and San Francisco restaurants have all gone French and German on us. Only water, still or sparkling, but no ice. Not here, here, in Trump country, they still serve good n' old American style ice water. Thank heavens.   Chopped salad, is good, and it's famous.  It's filing and unusual. Kind of reminds me of Burmese tea leaf salad, found in Burma Superstar, Mandalay and Rangoon Ruby (of SF bay area). So do that if you like tea leaf salad, and then you can do a proper compare and contrast.   Pork cheek is unusual but delicious. You and I have exact the same culinary taste. Down to that love for duck. How many times have we gone out and ordered the duck? I count the cities and states we've been to together and it scared me how high the count is, dating back the 90s, when you first met me in New Hartford Connecticut. How time flies. How many wrinkles and laughing lines we've developed over the last two decades.   Try duck burger because it's not very often you get a duck burger, and with an egg on top of the patty. Running egg yolk is finger licking delicious. Then came the ramen. It's huge and fresh. Hot soup is great for a hot day, especially if you had been under the sun a lot. I know, it sounds a tad odd, but salty hot broth is really good for such occasion.  You ordered me the pisco sour. I wanted some Peruvian drink and there the bartender make something to wow us. It's got fresh nutmeg on top. You laughed. Earlier, I had been sharing a cooking secret of mine for the perfect spaetzle and mac and cheese. \"Add nutmeg.\" I proudly announced. \"You must never forget nutmeg. Even in Banana Bread (Dominique Ansel's recipe).\" There I was, drinking a pisco sour with nutmeg. The bartender must have been following us all day long. You drank your red wine while I sipped two sips and declared that I was drunk. I was, and still am, a cheap date.  We both did not have a sweet tooth so we skipped dessert. We both were too full. We both realized that we had been eating too many meals together, sharing too many recipes together, and traveling way too often together. And now we were both getting tired together like old people do.  You paid the bill. Saying goodnight to the friendly bartender who served us this wonderful meal. We stumbled back to the hotel, all the while reminiscing about this fantastical food journey we had just been on."}
{"text":"I went here for restaurant week with the Bf last friday night. It was really good. We had a really good server who was friendly and efficient.  For our appetizers, the BF got the bacon fat popcorn and thought it was fantastic.... I'm not a huge fan of bacon, but it was ok in my opinion. I got the Mirliton salad, which was delicious! It has such a variety of textures and flavors, it had popcorn, chayote (which I had never had), cheese, cucumber, onion and really tasty dressing. I would definitely order that again. For mains, the BF got the pork tenderloin, which was absolutely delicious! I was so mad that he ordered better than me (like usual). It was the pork with mashed sweet potato, chevre, and figs with apple jus... it was so delicious and full of flavor. I ordered the chicken which I absolutely would not order again (that's where the star came off). It was chicken with a corn risotto and an onion and mushroom hash. It was all kind of smokey.... but not in a good way, and did not have a flavor that I liked. The risotto was not sweet like I thought it would be... and all the flavors kind of blended together so you couldn't taste the components. I make a better risotto at home, so I was very disappointed. Luckily for me, the BF shared some of his pork with me. So for desserts the BF got the pig in the orchard, which is a bacon bread pudding with a cinnamon -y ice cream. This was good, but my dessert beat the pants off of it (woot!!). I got the pot de creme. This was the highlight of the meal! It was amazing... it was a whiskey, coffee, and chocolate pot de creme and it was so rich and delicious.... if I could eat it everyday, I would, and I would be fat and wouldn't care..... So overall, it was good and I would definitely come back HOWEVER I would definitely not order the chicken again."}
{"text":"The food is simple but about as perfect as it gets. The chopped salad is a unique combination of textures that will blow your mind. Gordon Ramsey himself would lick the plate! I followed it with the lamb burger which was delivered a perfect medium rare. The home-made ketchup was delicious on its own, and the pickled root vegetables were the perfect accompaniment. Wow wow wow."}
{"text":"This place rocks! Tasty food, high energy vibe, great service, & the cocktails are fab! We had booked a table but arrived early & instead of waiting, opted for 2 sides of a corner at the bar. Great choice, as the bartenders were chatty & generous with the drinks. The chop salad that everyone raves about is NOt over-rated, so get  it, & split it as an appy. My husband got the pork belly pastrami & I had some chicken entree, both were really good & our total tab was less than $80! I know I am used to SF prices but were happy we chose this place for dinner. I hear there is an outside patio but never saw it, but sitting at the bar is always fun & most times you can walk in & get a seat without waiting long or making a rez"}
{"text":"Impeccable service! Robbie is fantastic! He's on point and made great suggestions! The menu is fantastic! We had the chopped salad, the crab cakes, and the filet. We finished with a mint-grapefruit sorbet and the Black and Tan desserts. It's a bit loud, but we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Stoppped in for a drink and appetizer with some co-workers.  It was happy hour so a nice surprise 1/2 off drinks!  Had a really nice Cab, we also had the fondue as an appetizer, it was very nice.  If I'm back in AZ, would love to have dinner here.  Very nice vibe!  The bartender was very nice and made sure we were taken care of."}
{"text":"Good food and great atmosphere! Ok so we went to Citizen for my husbands birthday and there were 6 of us. We were seated quickly as we did have reservation and our server was pretty awesome. Some of our friends actually knew the guy which was cool and we received an industry discount which was really nice and not expected at all. I didn't drink that night since I was the driver, but I heard the drinks were great just a bit on the small side.   As for the food I tasted a bit of everything. For apps we had the pork belly pastrami (a bit too fatty), chopped salad (awesome), fernet steak salad (not a fan too sweet for my taste). For entree's I had the scallops which were good not the greatest and I shared the duck with my friend which I liked better than the scallops which were quite rich. My husband had the crispy stealhead which I really liked, but he was not that keen on it. Our other friends had the chicken and waffles, mac n cheese, and lamb burger and they said they were all fantastic minus the fries which I tried and were a very strange texture almost like they were rolled in cornmeal not 1 of us liked those at all.   All in all it was a nice place with great service and good food, but a little over priced for the taste and quality of the food.  For this many stars on yelp I was expecting City Hall experience and my tastebuds to be dancing with excitement. I would recommend for gathering with friends and would go back!"}
{"text":"Reservations were for 5pm, which (as others have noted) gives you access to the Good Citizen's Social (up until 6pm).  Off the GCS menu, we started with the Bacon-Fat Heirloom Popcorn (okay), Flatbread, Hummus & Tzatziki (very good) and the Chorizo Glazed Wings (outstanding).  From there, we had the OMFG Chopped Salad (very tasty) and the Chilean Crab Cakes (very good) and then finished off with the Filet Mignon Asada Tacos (very good and they added a fourth taco for our group's family style dining) and Amaro Meatloaf (WOW).  Service was excellent and friendly.  Would definitely return to try more of the menu."}
{"text":"This place is awesome great location in old town you can sit inside or out.  Has a upscale look and feel with affordable drinks and meals     Looked busy but we were sat pretty fast and the second we sat down the hostess brought up a few things going on and the waitress came by going over it in more detail. The staff was quick very friendly and on top of everything. Explained all dishes and drinks perfectly to us.   The drinks weren't to strong were perfect made refreshing and had the nice punch needed. The food from appetizer of the bacon popcorn yes bacon popcorn to the monkfish cooked perfectly full of flavor plated nice and presented amazingly.   This is a must stop in to enjoy a nice date night or with a group."}
{"text":"Had a nice work dinner here with a colleague on 7/17/17. Classy, darkened ambiance, white table cloths. Very solid wine list with mostly California wines but a few Europeans to fill some holes. Good cocktail list, too. Their signature chopped salad mixed tableside is delicious and filling, easily enough for two to share. I had the catfish starter which was surprisingly light -- very lightly coated and came with a pickle relish and a hot sauce that paired perfectly with the dish. I loved it. We both had the grilled chicken breast over truffled rice. This dish was okay -- the chicken was overcooked, a little too burnt and dry and I'm not sure the truffled rice worked but I liked the idea. Would def go back to try a few other items, though there are a surprising number of good bistro-style restaurants in Old Town Scottsdale. Service was very good/nice as well, from the hostess to the waitress."}
{"text":"Found this place on place on yelp by my friend. The chopped salad was quite good, unique and personable  so was the roasted Cornish hen.  The Italian beef sandwich was just ok and the french fries were meh. The chopped salad was adequate for a small or average eater. The same goes for the Cornish hen. Would need to order a side of carbs to fill a big eater."}
{"text":"Matt was our server and he was great. Great service. He was friendly and pretty dang knowledgeable. He noticed my baseball cap is from baltimore and immediately guessed I was from Maryland. Anyways, the food was fantastic too. We actually were not there to drink any alcohol and had seen the reviews for the food. I got the lamb burger and my wife the grilled cheese. It was great. I highly rate the food here. Can't say anything about the drinks."}
{"text":"Great ambience. Food is excellent. Pork belly app was cooked to perfection.  Short rib and scallops were also excellent."}
{"text":"The best part about Citizen is the BACON! Seriously, I think they put bacon on everything! Popcorn made with bacon grease and bit of bacon, bacon dessert, bacon drinks....Bacon is the way of life at Citizen and there's nothing wrong with that!  I usually hit up Citizen for Happy Hour after work. They have great prices on snacks & appetizers (we always get the fondue and flatbread), plus the Happy Hour drinks are 1/2 off and some of their specialty drinks are also cheaper. For a great Happy Hour, check it out.  That said, I always said I wanted to go to Citizen for dinner, it's just a bit pricey for a college graduate who's paying off student loan debt. I finally had a chance to be wined and dined at Citizen a few weeks ago for a work event. Man, was I impressed! Going to dinner and having work foot the bill is the best - we went all out!  We started with all of the Happy Hour snacks. Fondue was my favorite (can't go wrong with bread, meat, and melted cheese!) but the bacon popcorn was amazing as well! Again, BACON!  For the main course, I had the scallops. They were perfectly prepared, lightly seared, with veggies and a delicious garlic mashed potato puree. Gah, my mouth is watering just thinking about it! Coworkers had the lamb burger (which is to die for, I guess) and the pork chops. Again, looked super delicious - the presentation is amazing!  Dessert was the chocolate mousse thingy. It was decadent and rich, but we definitely ate the whole thing!  For the lower class, dinner is a bit pricey, but for a special night out (or every night, if you're Bill Gates) I highly recommend Citizen! If you can't afford dinner, opt for Happy Hour and you'll get to experience the delight of Citizen.  Side Note - I've also had the mac-n-cheese and it's to die for! It's a great dinner alternative and pairs well with an ice cold beer on tap."}
{"text":"All you need to know - smore jar.  Monkfish in lobster bisque was also amazing. And Kevin is the best waiter.  Go here now."}
{"text":"Incredible food and drinks, very loud and table service mediocre at best.  Not bad enough to not to warrant a second visit.  I'll give it another try..."}
{"text":"bad food. full of fat and weird dishes. went a few times. 1 salad is edible, the rest I wouldn't give to an animal to eat."}
{"text":"Hands down one of my faves in town! The food is always consistently amazing and the drinks...like whoa  Very reasonably priced and the bar tenders are funny! Never a dull moment at the bar ladies ;) Eating there tonight and I can't wait!"}
{"text":"Delicious!!!!  And everyone should try the pastrami pork belly - it's to die for. It melts in your mouth. It turns vegetarians into meat eaters! There's so much going on in the plate BUT in a GOOD way.    I got the kale salad and tried the bread pudding dessert - all are delicious!!!!  Kale salad is so good - it has smoked mozzarella on the bottom. It's so good, it almost taste like meat. So the waitress told me that was the secret to the Kale Cesar. I love the cheese on top of it, it's not too strong either. It's such a delicious salad. I love the crunch of kale and freshness of it. I am a kale girl - I love kale and everything and anything kale, especially if they can take i step a notch.   The bread pudding was delicious. It has strawberry in it and the crispiness from the chips is great! It's also soft - a mixture of textures - wow-o!  The waitress and wait staff is extremely nice and helpful.   Great gastropub experience! :]"}
{"text":"Definitely did not enjoy this meal as much as I hoped to. I ordered a shrimp with risotto and it was lackluster in flavor and disappointing, especially for the price. For dessert we got a chocolate brownie dish with ice cream. It was also just ok...again, for the price I would have expected better.  My boyfriend got braised pork and it was also underwhelming. The meat was tough so his teeth ended up hurting from all the chewing. Service was decent but the price was high. Food is not terrible, but I think there are definitely better options in the area."}
{"text":"I am going to be one of the million boring reviewers of this restaurant that confirms that the chopped salad is amazeballs. Delish. Just get it! I will be going back."}
{"text":"Citizen Public House is an upscale, modern American restaurant where you can find plenty of unique dishes and a signature salad with its own Facebook site.  My Overall Rating - 4 Stars (Atmosphere, Service, Food, Return)  Atmosphere - We checked out Citizen Public House on a week night, but it was still busy.  Lights will be dim, noise will be loud, but everything around you is modern.  If you're looking for a quiet place, Citizen Public House is not it.  But if you're ok with the high energy and noise you'll love it.  Service - Our server was better than great.  He was very accommodating.   We made reservations over the phone for a large party, and he secured a semi-private room for us and let us put in several appetizer orders ahead of time.  Throughout the meal the entire team went above & beyond, making sure we were ok, talking about our love of food, and making sure our experience would be perfect.  1 Star.  Food - The appetizers rule at Citizen Public House.  I think it's ridiculous that a SALAD has its own Facebook page.  Then I ate it.  It was ridiculously good.  The presentation itself is great, and once the servers mix it together, it becomes a fresh, modern, texture packed bite.  I will admit I doubted it but now I'm a believer. Bacon fat popcorn.  Yes.  It was even great the next day.  Pork Belly Pastrami - tender, well-seasoned, and could have been my main meal.  Which is funny because looking back, I enjoyed all the appetizers a lot more than the main courses.  The scallops were good and my short rib was not as tender as I would have liked, but after our appetizer fest it really didn't matter.  Bottom line is the pre-meal is where I'll put my money in the future.  1  1/2 Star.  Will I Return? - For the apps!  Not sure the main courses are worth it for a return visit, but I would come back and order the same delicious starters as I did that night.  Now, Citizen Public House is not cheap, so that's all I would be able to afford.   1/2 Star.  My Yelp Rating Scale (Sum of all parts): 1 Star - Atmosphere - Is it a cool dive?  Perhaps an upscale place?  No matter the type, atmosphere plays a big part and I'll give a star if I like it or thinks it has great charm. 1 Star - Service - You can have a great meal with bad service.  But that's also what can make a five star joint drop to four.  It's important to the dining experience that service is great and on point. 2 Stars - Food - I'll award up to two stars for the food, since this is the main reason we dine out.  Sometimes the extra star is given for value, but it's really all about the food. 1 Star - Will I come back? - If I know for a fact I'll return, I'll give this a star. A place has to make an impression for me to return.   Each Category can be given up to 1 star except food (2 stars) because I consider all these categories important to the overall dining experience.  I will sum them up to provide my final Yelp score."}
{"text":"Great drinks, great atmosphere. The menu was eclectic comfort food. Our server Ajay was awesome. Enjoyed it all."}
{"text":"I love everything I've ever tried here---- scallop dish, mac n cheese, pastrami pork belly, lamb sandwich, grilled cheese and of course, the infamous chopped salad. Yum, I'm drooling just thinking about it all! They also make a delicious Moscow Mule cocktail.   I've always made reservations so have never had to wait. Staff has always been attentive, courteous and prompt.   I just wish they had a more appealing and reasonably priced dessert menu."}
{"text":"A classy place where everyone is comfortable.  Great service and lots of cocktails with creative variations without loosing how to make it really good.  The food is even better.  Filet was ordered less than Med rare and that is exactly how I got it.  My wife ordered the braised short rib that was out if this world.  $90 for two entrees and three drinks but totally worth it!!"}
{"text":"Welcomed by a friendly, attentive staff to a cool bar with inventive food that soars above \"pub grub.\"  Bar bites were so good, we were challenged to choose and eat the main courses. Bites included the bacon-infused popcorn, fondue, olives, and rosemary-roasted mixed nuts. No wonder we weren't too hungry after that!  Ah, but then we enjoyed as main dishes:  chopped salad (unique and tasty), fried chicken, lamb burger, and grilled cheese sandwich. Alas, no room for dessert. Nice cocktail menu and wines by the glass.  Noise-level is pretty intense -- combination of music and acoustics -- making it hard to have a conversation and/or hear the server at times. Worth a visit in the 5th Avenue Shopping area."}
{"text":"Great food.  We ordered several dishes and each had it's own unique flavor.  Both the meatloaf and the scallops were excellent.  They also make a good Moscow Mule.  Service was great as well.  If you're in town, stop by.  You can't go wrong."}
{"text":"The food was very good and creative. I enjoyed the scallops, the flavor was balanced with the corn grits. Bread pudding was amazing and I am not big on bread pudding.  Pork belly appetizer was a little bit of a disappointment, not as much flavor."}
{"text":"Love the happy hour!  Great wine and generous yummy food servings. Always warm friendly bartenders."}
{"text":"Yaaaaaas. I'm spoiled in Austin TX with amazing and unique restaurants (food snob). I don't like stuffy, overly pretentious environments but love flavorful slightly fancy dishes. Citizen Public House is right up my alley.  Excellent service, drinks, and of course, amazing food. When our crew eats out, we order almost everything and share family style (whether it's an Asian restaurant or not). We tried practically everything, and I loved almost all of it.  Highly recommend: - burrata appetizer - cornmeal fried catfish appetizer - pork shank entree (giant entree btw) - any fish they have (they know their fish)  Hard pass on: - Mac and cheese (sounds great but had zero flavor) - meatloaf entree (just ok)  Watch out for: Paper cuts on your forearms from the paper they lay on top of the tables. SO PAINFUL!  This is one place you will leave happy, full, and ready to take on the Scottsdale party scene as the restaurant is located right in the center of the action."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in the world, and that's really saying a lot considering how much I eat out. I've eaten here at least a dozen times and I doubt it will ever get old. I cannot rave enough about this place: it's unpretentious, reasonably priced, AMAZING food. Here's a TIP: order appetizers. You'll save a lot of money and that's where the chef's really show off. The chop salad is, of course, amazing. And the Mac & Cheese WILL be the best you've ever tried.  As for entrees, the bacon-wrapped scallops are my favorite that I've tried. The desserts here have been known to make my friends and I cry from emotion. I'm not kidding, my best friend had a brownie that actually brought tears of emotion to her eyes.  I highly recommend Citizen Public House. I love that they always change their menu and I can't wait to go again."}
{"text":"I loved this place. The bacon popcorn and chop salad are money. I am glad I made a reservation, there was a two hour wait on Friday night for a table."}
{"text":"Great service. Sat at the bar, and the bartender Eli was immediately available to assist. Granted it was a slow night, so that's probably why I got immediate service. While I'm regretting not getting the short ribs, I was still reasonably happy with the venison that I received. However, I was left a little disappointed, because it was missing something. Additional searing, some salt and peppering, etc. It just wasn't up to snuff. It was tender as can be, however if I'm paying $38 for two medallions of meat, I expect to be blown away. I was less than blown away, since it just tasted like... well... meat. No complexity of flavor or aroma. It could appeal to people, but not me. This rating is more for the service and ambiance than for the food. Hope they improve this dish."}
{"text":"Nice bar restaurant with some very interesting cocktails.  The Citi-zen was especially good with its rock candy stir stick (and you can make your drink as sweet as you want).    Their famous chopped salad deserves its fame - really good.  The pork belly pastrami was different and oh so good.  And oh last but not least the scallops with grits - who knew grits could be that tasty!  I definitely need to go back here."}
{"text":"Ask for Gary. He will lead you down the path of perfection.  And order from the cask cocktails menu.  Their take on a Negroni is superb."}
{"text":"During my most recent visit to Citizen Public House, I sat at the bar with a friend and sampled several dishes from the late night menu. We had initially planned to wash down a bowl of Tender Belly bacon fat popcorn with our outstanding drinks (Richie Moe and his bar staff are the finest I know--but that's for a different show).  The popcorn was, as always, a real treat.  Crispy, fragrant, savory, salty goodness.  But then the gentleman beside us was served a pork belly pastrami, and the amazing smell was driving us crazy. So we placed an order for that and Chef Bernie's Original Chopped Salad (which he first introduced while at the helm of Cowboy Ciao and which I also find I cannot resist).  The pastrami is made of melt-in-your-mouth pork belly, and the sauerkraut provided a terrific tangy balance to the richness of the meat.  Typically, the menu at Citizen is stocked with dishes that are familiar but have their own particular twist.  In this case, the sauerkraut was made of Brussels sprouts instead of cabbage. And rather than pile the combination between two slices of rye, it was served with fantastic rye spaetzle (I learned to cook these dumplings in Germany, so I am usually leery of ordering them in American restaurants--but Citizen's were outstanding.  Chewy but still tender.)  After we finished the pastrami (and restrained ourselves from licking the plate), we dug into the salad.  It arrived on the platter in carefully arranged in rows (basically, a salade composée) of Israeli couscous, chopped arugula, tomatoes, smoked salmon, toasted pepitas, and Asiago cheese.  The dressing, which comes on the side, is a sort of slightly-garlicky Green Goddess, very fresh and light.  The friendly gentleman serving us offered to toss the salad.  It seemed a shame to destroy the lovely arrangement, but this is definitely an instance where making a mishmash on your plate is the way to go.  None of the ingredients lost their integrity, but the combination of flavors (sweet, salty, smoky, green) and textures was outstanding.  The crunch of the pepitas with the crispy greens and delicate couscous is as close to salad heaven as a girl can get.   I love desserts but rarely order them at restaurants because it's a course that can be pretty iffy.  However, I know that Tracy Dempsey does amazing work for Citizen, so I had to take a look at the evening's offerings.  I saw chicory ice cream and salted chocolate caramel sauce with chicory streusel, and any remaining self-restraint went out the window.   What a winner--again, excellent contrast of sweet and savory, perfect portion size for two to share.  My only quibble, and a minor one at that, was with the ice cream, which could've used a bigger boost of chicory.  But then again, not everyone loves chicory coffee as I do.  I'd be remiss in not discussing the actual space of the restaurant.  It would be fairly easy to pass Citizen by on the street; it fairly disappears into the bland exterior of a white building on the corner of 5th and Craftsman in Old Towne Scottsdale.  The signage, above the entrance on Craftsman, is not easily seen after dark. In fact, when standing out front once, I was stopped by a couple who asked me if I knew where the restaurant was.  The interior, while understated, is far from nondescript.  The center of the dining room is dominated by a large, stainless steel bar and the vaulted ceiling above with its exposed beams.  Seating options include freestanding tables for four, leather banquettes along two walls, an alcove that accommodates larger dining parties, and my favorite, the very comfortable barstools.  The color scheme is very simple--white walls with dark accents and clusters of artwork hung gallery style.  Still, there is no shortage of warmth in the room.  The staff is exceedingly welcoming and the service professional but friendly.  On peak nights, the acoustics of the space mean that it can get a bit loud, but noise fits right in with the idea that you are in a contemporary \"public house.\"  Citizen's combination of a lively dining room with an outstanding, innovative menu, top-notch bar and superb service will keep bringing me back.  Side note: some people seem to be confused about the difference between a \"public house\" and a sports bar.  If you want to watch television while you drink, I suggest you seek out the latter, as Citizen mercifully has no TVs."}
{"text":"Really tasty food but very overpriced for the portions and parking sucks here.  I did love the ambiance but still very overpriced."}
{"text":"Only been here once so far, but found the people very friendly and the food and wine was good. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I stopped in here for dinner with my parents who were visiting from Massachusetts.  Hands down, one of the best meals I've ever had.  My parents share that sentiment.    We started with some drinks (I had the very ginger/spicy Moe'scow Mule, and loved it) and shared two appetizers between the three of us: the Original Chopped Salad (smoked salmon, \"trail mix\", greens, freeze-dried sweet corn ... So good) and an off menu twist of the on-menu Bernie's Mac and Cheese: we had the three cheese blend, but served as a Fondue with bread, pears and a spicy meat (maybe a pastrami?) for dipping -- also amazing.    My father had short ribs, my mother had scallops, and I had duck (land, sea and air!) and all three were phenomenal.  The Smoked Duck Breast I had was cooked perfectly and will be the duck By which I measure all future duck meals.    My mother's scallops were so sweet and so tender (per our server, Chris, sushi grade) and the dried cherry barbecue sauce served with the short ribs was so uniquely sweet and spicy I left thinking of other meats it would taste good on!  We'd originally planned on going elsewhere for desert afterwards but figured that as everything else was so good, a great desert was a likely possibility.  They did not disappoint. We finished the evening with the Choco-Chili Bread Pudding.  Not too sweet, just the right amount of spicy, and topped with a scoop of delicious tortilla ice cream.   We left grinning ear to ear, so satisfied and recounting how tasty everything was for a good 45 minutes after the meal.  Do not pass this place by!"}
{"text":"The food was fabulous and the service was great but this place is so loud we could not hear each episode other and one of ended up leaving due to a headache. I know it trendy to design restaurants this way but it does ruin a fine dining experience."}
{"text":"Was there to celebrate my wife's b-day. They gave us free dessert, it wasn't that good but a nice gesture."}
{"text":"Had a great meal tonight at Citizen's. We were looking for something light, so we started out with the tzatziki and hummus appetizer served with grilled pita bread. It was excellent. I would definitely get it again. I then had the grilled cheese sandwich with a tasty cherry spread--very gourmet! I tasted my friend's chopped salad which was incredible. It was not your ordinary chopped salad, as it had couscous, smoked salmon, corn, etc. I would definitely order this salad when I visit again. The atmosphere had a clean, uptown look with nice, low lighting. What was unique about this place was its interesting menu. I loved all the new foods I tried tonight!"}
{"text":"The chop salad is a must try if you go. The lamb burger is great too if you need a gourmet burger fix.   It's a classy date spot with good cocktails."}
{"text":"Ahh Citizen Public House! Your food was so delicious and your service was outstanding!! Thank you!! The chopped salad and the short ribs were amazing!! The \"donuts and coffee\" for dessert were superb!!"}
{"text":"I am so bummed I did not make Citizen Public House as my primary special occasion restaurant to go to for my first visit to AZ. As I learn you do not need to be tied to a well known name to be put on the map and later to find out how disappointed you are with the meal & service (cough cough FNB ahem). Anyways, two of my friends mentioned this place and that was enough confirmation that this was going to be a great restaurant. So, I gave it a shot.   Walked in and was seated without RSVP or hassled for not having a RSVP.   Our server was very attentive, very engaging, and social with us and made the dinner experience enjoyable. Most places forget that you need to build relationships with your customers. It is very simple, it is not a secret, just provide excellent customer service. If you can't do that then you're in the wrong business.   So, with that I will def share my experience with yelp, non-yelp friends, and also I will come back next time I visit AZ. If I lived here, of course I will come in as a regular patron.   It is no secret CPH is known for what? Their amazing cracked out chopped salad called the THE ORIGINAL MIXED FEEL GOOD SALAD or for short OMFG! Like OMFG it should be on every menu in America like the Caesar Salad, Cobb Salad, etc. But even better than the traditional boring salads. The smoked salmon is a nice touch.   I have not had crab cakes in a while and CPH has the best, generous, heaping mounds of delicious Chilean crab cakes for you to enjoy.  I recently had a really sad crab cake at the Brigantine and yeah it did not compare to CPH's.  The last dish was the Gio Osso burger, the ingredients had me at foie gras aoili, it just sounds criminal smearing duck liver on a beef burger. The savory and rich burger was super delicious.   Did not end the evening with dessert, but I did take home a bag of bacon brittle. YUM!"}
{"text":"Omg one of my favorite restaurant after Monarch in Scottsdale. Will the bartender was absolutely amazing with his mixology skills. We had beet salad which was one of the best I ever had. Ling COD was perfectly prepare crispy on the outside accompanied by baby Bok choi and pickled papaya. The carb cake was deliciously garnished by mixed greens and pickled mushrooms wow! Great combination. My boss got the Ahi with purple rice and that was divine. Great night of food and conversation."}
{"text":"Tried CPH during Restaurant Week. My husband and I tried the salad that was a mixture of roasted corn, couscous, smoked salmon and various other ingredients all made for a unique and delicious offering. We both had the scallops which were perfectly cooked.and very tasty. The dessert was a blueberry bread pudding which was okay but not remarkable. We went with the cocktail pairings all were very unusual and a little odd. Nothing we would order again. The service was good. The bad was we were severed quickly and were out in under an hour and the atmosphere is far from relaxing, way too noisy. We couldn't hear each other; there is no way you could carry on a conversation in a normal tone of voice. Doubt we'll be back."}
{"text":"I so want to give this place more stars but my recent experience there was pretty awful. First off, on a positive note: incredible food. Best burrata I've had, and I've had a lot! Great craft cocktails and nice wine list. I took a friend out after a show; it was a very special occasion and we arrived over an hour before closing time (this is important to note). First off, the hostess was surly, exuding that air of superiority and annoyance of us coming in at 9:48pm-- they closed at ELEVEN that night. She proceeded to seat us in the farthest corner away from the front door, the bar, and all other diners. The table was actually really nice, but I think it contributed to the fact that we were neglected the entire time. It literally took about 3 min to be greeted, let alone get water. 3 minutes is a long time in this type of scenario. I'm not exaggerating. I've been in the service industry for 20 years as a manager, server, etc, and I timed it -- it was that bad. Once the server came over she was nothing but perfunctory, with little to no personality. She made us feel like she couldn't wait to get us in and out. I had planned on spending a lot of money for this dinner (which I still did, considering menu prices but I knew that going in); however, I would have splurged more if I hadn't just wanted to get the experience over with. Won't return anytime soon."}
{"text":"Went here last night with a friend and really enjoyed it. We sat at the bar and the bartender was very friendly and knowledgeable about the questions we were asking about their specialty cocktails and \"barrel cocktails\".  They had a great selection of wine, cocktails, spirits, and beers. They even have the barrel aged cocktails that they make, my friend got ' The Craftsman' and it was excellent. I went with my drink of the moment, a Moscow Mule, and they had a little twist to it with cucumbers. Their drinks are on the pricier side but they have some great specials during happy hour.  Their Chopped Salad is like nothing I have ever experienced, so different from any other with unique items but the ingredients go so good together! This is their most famous item and I now know why- excellent!.  Didn't have dinner but did decide to satisfy a sweet tooth craving and got the Sticky Bun Bread Pudding and The PB & B Pudding Jar. The PB & B was soooooooo good!  Overall had a great atmosphere and I can't wait to go back and try their entrees because they sounded delicious!"}
{"text":"First time here while on business from Miami. Great service at the front door and even better service from Sam. Energetic, helpful and passionate about what he does. Took his suggestion on the Moscow mule cocktail, chopped salad, buttermilk chicken, and fudge brownie dessert. Definitely would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Chopped salad is truly an original, I'd describe it as the bi bim bap of salads. The scallops were highly recommended and they should be. The bourbon selection is top notch as well."}
{"text":"After trying The Gladly and falling in love, I figured I had to try the older sister, aka Citizen Public House.  I am not huge on Old Town Scottsdale. Don't get me wrong - it can be fun, and there's some good eats, but I'm more of a Central Phoenix gal. That being said, this location is very nice. It's not right on Scottsdale Road, but rather on a side street, so parking isn't as crazy, which is a definite plus.  Restaurant is big, spacious, tastefully decorated, and the service is good. We were lucky enough to get in on the tail end of happy hour. I had the pacific coast cocktail, which tasted pretty good, and it was strong, which made it definitely good. It had an interesting flavor and it wasn't too sweet. My husband had boulvardier, which was also nice and good if you like bourbon.  Food wise, I had my favorite chopped salad because I'm hooked and I just can't get enough. It was lovely, as always. My husband had the buttermilk roasted chicken, which was awesome. The chicken was super moist. I love brussel sprouts so I gladly ate them off the plate - they were seasoned well and cooked al dente. Accompanying succotash was also very good. I wish we had tried dessert but we were too full.  It was very nice, and if you live nearby or haven't tried it yet, I think it's worth a trip. Since The Gladly is a lot closer for me, I think it'll be my go to place, but I was not at all disappointed with Citizen Public House. Given the choice of any restaurant is Old Town Scottsdale, I honestly think this would be my number 1."}
{"text":"I have been to Scottsdale many times over a period of 16 years, and I live in the NYC area. As such, my standards are very high, and many times I was disappointed by what many said were \"good\" restaurants in Scottsdale. I know that sounds arrogant, but the truth is when one is used to top shelf Michelin rated restaurants, one has high standards. That being said, Citizens Public House meets the high quality of New York City.   First, the Negroni is the best I ever had. I have had Negroni in the SoHo House, Mas Farmhouse, Four Seasons Restaurant, and Le Cirque in Manhattan and Florence, Italy, which is the birthplace of the Negroni, and Citizen Public House beats them all. What did they do better? They aged the drink in barrels. It was the smoothest Negroni I ever had. The pork belly was THE best I ever had. It was not fatty and no gristle. The chopped salad was spectacular. The lamb burger was amazing - flavor bursted in my mouth with each bite.   There are no words to describe how good this restaurant is. Moreover, I was there while my father was dying in hospice. I took my mother here to get our minds off of our terrible situation. The staff was beyond extremely polite. caring and courteous. They were superb. You will not do better than Citizen Public House!"}
{"text":"Where to begin.  Wow great experience.  The jalepeno hush puppies were excellent.  Bernie's Mac and cheese with sun dried tomatoes was great as well.  The chopped salad is amazing.  Every part of this salad is done right and tossed right.  A must order.  Then we had the meatloaf and the potato and zucchini was the best I have ever had!!! Hands down the best restaurant experience I have had in two years our server Gary was the best server I have ever had.  He knew when to leave us be in deep discussion.  Our water was always full.  Our food always tabled properly he deftly knew what we wanted and when we needed anything.  He represents Bernie as a down to earth amazing man and executive chef.  We finished our meal with the heart of caramel.  The chocolate was unbelievably good and the ice cream was excellent.  I can't wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"FANTASTIC experience from start to finish. On arrival, we were greeted by a few witty, friendly, and funny staff. We sat on the patio which was beautifully lit with string lights. The ambiance of the restaurant was spectacular.   Our server, Jeremy, was terrific. His recommendations did not disappoint and he was conversational, upbeat, accommodating, and attentive.   We shared macaroni and cheese for an appetizer which was out of this world. I enjoyed the pan seared scallops and bacon and corn grits, while my husband ordered the short ribs with mashed parsnip. Both dishes were decadent and delicious. We enjoyed every bite.   We shared a sticky bun bread pudding and a PB&B jar for dessert. Both were amazing! The desserts are seriously an art.  If you're into crafty cocktails, this is your place.   GREAT experience - will definitely visit Citizen again!"}
{"text":"We had the fondue as the appetizer which included bread, sausage and Asian pear for dipping- excellent. Chopped salad was amazing - thank you yelpies for the advice. Husband had meatloaf which was was hearty and good!"}
{"text":"Came here with my family that drove into town from SoCal for Xmas. Was looking to take them to a nice place for xmas-eve dinner and read positive reviews about this place.  We ordered many small dishes and 2 entrees to share: Pork belly pastrami, shrimp tomato salad, burrata, crispy chicken gizzards, amaro meatloaf, and pan-seared scallops. The waitress also recommended the famous chopped salad and boy.... was that the best decision and dish of the night! Every one of the dishes were tasty with the 2 best dishes being the 2 salads.  I'll definitely come back to Citizen Public House in the future. Once again.. that chopped salad.... must try!"}
{"text":"Finally, a place in Scottsdale that is hip without being douchey and has great food and service.  I commend you Citizen Public House.  We made a reservation here on a Saturday night.  Got there, really cool granite counter for the host stand.  We were greeted by smiles and shown to a table behind the bar.  The atmosphere is really cool, dimly lit.  Gina was our server and she was fantastic.  We ordered a bottle of \"The Boxer\" and it was fantastic.  Gina knew her wine and really seemed to enjoy talking with us about different vineyards.  She even brought out samples of another wine similar to what we were drinking so we could see the difference in color.  Now that is really great service, so great, we opened another bottle.    The food was fantastic, very well prepared and came out with great timing.    Gina's brother, Richie, is the Mixologist-Partner here and he came out to the table to talk wine with us as well.  We ended up all exchanging info and talking about a few hard to find bottles.    AMAZING service here and the food is great.  Ask for Gina if you come in, some of the best hospitality I've ever had."}
{"text":"Even though I have lived in Scottsdale for almost ten years now, this was my first trip to Citizen Public House and man am I disappointed that I hadn't been sooner. Great booze, great food, great service. It was a great experience. I had the Chilean Crab Cakes and they were fantastic."}
{"text":"Great food but you will pay for it. Service was excellent. Very load. Couldn't hear myself think. We had to yell across the table to talk. I am afraid that I will no go back."}
{"text":"An absolutely amazing Valentine's Day menu. Great staff, very quick service, wonderful drinks, food that will blow the taste buds right out of your mouth. Second in the Valley only to Café Monarch (although prices and happy hour are better)...and not by much! Thanks for a perfect evening!"}
{"text":"Wow! Outstanding food and the service was incredible. I would highly recommend this place for the ambience and location but the food and service will exceed expectations!"}
{"text":"I'm a chef. The pork belly pastrami is one of the top five things I've ever eaten. Bravo! Bravo to the cola gastrique, as well. Bravo to the chop salad. Bravo to the service. Bravo to the entire staff. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! I'm still dreaming about the scallops. The chopped salad was delicious too!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice for dinner,  once for a date and  again for a group dinner with friends. CPH has a great atmosphere for both.  The chopped salad is a must, and the scallops and short ribs are great entrees. The cocktails are crafty and delicious! Overall a good spot to visit, especially if you have friends or family in town."}
{"text":"A group of us went here for a friends 30th birthday.  What a great choice !   The waiter that we had was very knowledgeable, fun and super friendly ! Gary I believe it was. :)  None of us had been there before so we were more than impressed with the atmosphere.  Very quaint and classy.  We all ordered a variety of appetizers and we not disappointing!  Fondue, hummus and olive plate.  All were very delicious and plenty for 7 to share.  As far as dinner goes I can only speak for my boyfriend and myself as we took a bite of one anothers entree (Scallops and Meatloaf).  The scallops and grits were PHENOM!!  I am from the south so I was a bit weary about trying grits in Scottsdale, but they did not let me down :)  Meatloaf I didn't have much to compare to but it was pretty good and my boyfriend loved it.   If you're looking for a fun evening out with good food and drinks this is a place you don't want to pass up.  It's not somewhere I would find myself on a weekly basis, but I will be back!"}
{"text":"Not ARIZONA casual, good food, good wine, noise level leaves it easy to have a conversation."}
{"text":"Came here to celebrate my bday and I couldn't have been happier. Made a reservation just be be sure I got a seat without a long wait. Service was friendly and also prompt. I ordered a few appetizers, to try different things and so glad I did so! Hummus and tzatziki plate and pork belly pastrami was the best dishes I've had in a very long time! My mouth is watering just thinking of it again. Other dishes were also great, but I would highly suggest those two.  Will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Food was good but not great. Service was adequate but not what I would expect for that price and location. Probably wouldn't go back"}
{"text":"The food here is phenomenal. That is the real draw. They really take great care in selecting the best ingredients and preparing it right.   However, it IS expensive. It might be cheap by old town Scottsdale standards, but still expect to pay $20-40 per entree and $12 per cocktail.  The food is worth every penny though."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what I can say about this place that hasn't been said already. The service is beyond compare, the place is clean and fresh feeling. The drinks are unique and quite tasty. I was really happy with my selections, and the food is out of this world. Delicious chopped salad (with a facebook page all its own) and yummy scallops, short ribs, and meatloaf too. Who'd a thunk meatloaf could be so tasty??? Desert was a tad underwhelming and I do love a good dessert, so maybe next time. Great place for a romantic dinner too. Yum."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I had heard some great things about this restaurant. So when I walked in and saw a plain Jane restaurant with a concrete floor and nothing to absorb the noise, I was surprised. It is loud and there is not much ambiance. On a brighter note, our waiter was one of the best. He brought us drinks quickly and gave us good advice. Our table started off with the fondue which was very nice and great for sharing and the tzatziki. For dinner we ordered the scallops, the meatloaf, the short ribs, and rabbit (not my order). Overall it was okay, but not amazing. Apparently the rabbit was the best meal on the table. My short ribs were a little dry but the parsnip purée that accompanied it was delicious. We had the dude jar for dessert which won me over. I would give the food and ambiance three stars but because of the waiter I bumped it to four stars."}
{"text":"1. Great Location 2. Did a kinda sorta blind date  (Enriched experience, new place and new person.... interesting) Well in short, I really like Citizen Public House and the menu rocks and the staff makes killer suggestions. Now on the other hand, nothing to do with the restaurant, but no more meeting anyone from Tinder.  That would of been the only part of this meal that was not so appetizing.   But as a good sport, went with the flow and enjoyed myself and let the food, ambiance and alcohol do the trick.  I just wish the reviews on Tinder were as accurate as Yelp. lol...  Strongly recommend and will be back... sooooon."}
{"text":"Well, not a great start.  Asked the bartender what was better between a couple drinks and and he starts harping on me about subjective taste for a min before he actually starts acting like a bartender and starts actually exposing the drinks.. no I don't expect you to know my taste just know you are the bartender and should have tried both drinks and can give a subjective ( not objective) opinion on how I may perceive enough the drinks.  This did not happen, but if I ask what is good.. again I am not expecting you to know my taste, but rather giving you an opportunity to showcase your skills, maybe you make something you think is just killer, maybe you make something everyone loves... tell me about it! Don't try and make me feel stupid because you chose a profession. Of answering questions! Take that moment to showcase what you have, what you know! The drink was good just not as enjoyable when you feel patronized! I'll find my next drink else where!  One suggestion on the drink! Torch the peel a little and rub it in the glass.   It will bring out the oils a flavors a little more!"}
{"text":"I was expecting better based on the reviews. It was just okay. I got the duck burger, and it was pretty good, but the fries were not. They were lukewarm at best, and... chewy. How do you make fries chewy? Maybe some of the other menu items are better, but.. meh. I don't think I'd go back if I find myself in Scottsdale again."}
{"text":"Excellent! We got to sit outside on the patio on a very nice evening. Service was informative and attentive. Tried a local AZ wine that was good; cocktails were outstanding. Had the chopped salad with chicken instead of salmon - loved it. Filling enough for a meal with a shared appetizer (crab cakes). Husband had the scallops and thought they were great. The pot de creme dessert was ridiculously good. Would definitely come here again if in the area."}
{"text":"Best place to go on a fancy date in Scottsdale. The environment is classy and the food is SUPERB! If you go during AZ Restaurant Week, you can get a three course meal for an excellent price. I highly recommend their famous \"OMFG Salad.\" Fantastic."}
{"text":"If there's a place in old town that you can rely on for quality in food and service, this is the place.  You get what you paid for.  Based on my last few visits, it seems to always be busy, which as you know is a great sign.    This is a place where you come for a date, birthday or just about any type of occasion you can think of.    These are what I consistently get and enjoy:  + Chopped Salad: BOMB.  You cannot come here and not get this.  If you don't have a big appetite, this is a must.  The corn, salmon and dressing does it for me every time.  You just can't go wrong here.  + Lamb Burger: Its very tasty and juicy.  It can be a little messy if you mishandle it.  So I suggest just slicing it in the middle.    + Kale Caesar Salad: BOMB.  Kale is a super vegetable that is packed with nutrients.  They make the Kale anti-bitter with a great balanced Ceasar dressing, served with a cheesy, toasty bread!   Some things can break your wallet but if you manage to try to share your plates in your party, you will walk out okay.  Drinks aren't too pricey.  But if you want to keep the night going, I suggest heading up to their sister bar, Citizen R+D, a speakeasy that is around the building and requires a secret phone call to reserve a table.  There's not much to complain about really.  For its consistency and quality, I will always have them on my go to places."}
{"text":"We arrived late and the place was packed so we decided to eat at the bar. Waitress was nice and friendly. Place was hopping  Started out my dinner with a Manhattan. Excellent drink and the smoky / citrus overtones of the drink were a great marriage.  Ordered the Pork Osso Buco for dinner. This was the only let down of the night. While the pork had a nice flavor, the meat was cold near the bone (so I could tell it had been  pre-cooked) and the mashed potatoes were pretty flavorless.   Followed up dinner with a Guinness beer. Got to give it to the bartenders, they looked like they were having a blast. Kind of guys I would love to hire for my business.  While my overall rating was a 3 (based primarily on the food) if I am back in town I will be glad to give the place a second chance."}
{"text":"Great new addition to the Old Town neighborhood. Citizen is versatile -- the perfect place for a romantic date, a small gathering, or for just meeting a buddy for a drink. A place with a great vibe.  My first impression was that they are intently focused on service quality. Lots of smiling staff to greet you as you enter. Every employee is attentive to every table. Our server was gregarious, accommodating, gracious, and highly proactive. We definitely felt the 'warm and fuzzy' atmosphere.  They pay attention to the little things -- such as house-made ketchup for your french fries.   The food: about as good as upscale bar food is going to get. For apps we started with the calamari and the crabcakes. Portions weren't large, but very high quality. The calamari was flash-fried and not greasy, and seemed very fresh. For my entree I had the wagyu burger, which was prepared perfectly and served on a fresh challah bun.  Overall impression: Citizen will have staying power, unlike many establishments that open in Old Town. The formula is really pretty simple -- offer high quality stuff, equip the place with great staff, and don't go overboard with prices. I'm looking forward to returning!"}
{"text":"Everything is SO good. I kind of laughed when the host told me their best dish was the chopped salad and then it had a link to Facebook under the description of the salad. Ordered it anyways. It is incredible. At our table we had ribs, scallops, and steak. I mean across the board the meats were so perfectly cooked. I can't wait to go back. Such good food. Their chef must be quite talented. Oh and also, their customer service is impeccable."}
{"text":"I have been 3/4 times when traveling on business.  The staff are friendly, approachable and really know the menu.  Their descriptions and recommendations are always spot on. The food is amazing - the menu is really intriguing.  I have had the bone marrow, the hummus platter, the burger, the meatloaf and the chicken - all were outstanding. Although I do miss the mortadella sliders (as awesome as they sound) I will be back at CPH on my next trip."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Scottsdale. I recommend this place to anyone from out of town looking for a nice place for date night. Great wine selection and friendly staff. I recommend the scallops with bacon grits."}
{"text":"We spend one night in Old Town and I'd read reviews on this location. We weren't sure where to commit to dinner with so many options. We stopped in for beers and shared an appetizer. It was very busy for an relatively early Tuesday night. We ended up going elsewhere for dinner as we were tired from our early East Coast flight, but the fondue was great and staff at the bar was super attentive and had great personalities. Would return if back in the area!"}
{"text":"Came here for restaurant week and I was impressed!  The chopped salad was interesting, looked beautiful, and very tasty.  The scallops were cooked well and the grits were creamy and delicious.  I scraped up every last bit of grit off the plate.  The PB&B banana pudding was good though I did wish I had chosen the mint chocolate cake instead.  For restaurant week I usually slightly lower my expectations knowing that the kitchen is preparing large quantities of the same dishes for less $$, but Citizen Public House did not disappoint!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for Happy Hour on a Saturday evening with no wait for a table. We sat at the bar. We ordered the Chorizo wings, bacon popcorn, salmon salad, the fondue and shrimp cocktail. The food was amazing! The Chorizo wings are a must try! They are flavorful and tastes great with the house ranch!! They gave a good amount for happy hour, you won't be disappointed. The bacon pop corn was ok but I wasn't too excited about it."}
{"text":"This place was a bit of a dissapointment with all the raving reviews on Yelp.  My first reflection is that the place looks much more cosy on the pictures and that the sound level is very high. Feels more like a bar with food then a restaurant.    The food then......  I had the fair trade short ribs with coffee rub , dried cherry bbq sauce, roasted  parsnip purée and seasonal veggies for 28 $. I love shortribs if they are made right and the coffee rub made me think of the calfs liver in coffee/veal reduction i loved at Ralp Lauren's Bistro in Chicago so i had high hopes for this dish.    Im sad to say that i didnt feel that Citizen Public House delivered.  The short ribs (on the bone) was tender and not bad put i could taste any of the coffee rub. The cherry bbq sauce was so so and the parsnip puree that might have been the best thing on the plate was not veru much of. It was a smaller \"pile\" hidden under the veggies that also was ok.   My companys filé of beef was better in my opinion but at 120 $ for two mains and 2 glasses of red i think this place was a little to expensive for the food and the experience. With so much great food in Scottsdale i just dont think this place is worth the hype.   Service was ok but nothing special. Location in old town is great though!"}
{"text":"1) Best chopped salad I've ever had (they can even make it Vegan too).  2) Best Manhattan I've ever had!    The staff is very friendly and the environment is very cool...I also like the unique foods on their menu.  If you have not been there before, then you have to try the chopped salad."}
{"text":"Fantastic food. Started with the chopped salad and tuna appetizers. Then went with the scallops and meatloaf. Oh my both were fabulous. Finish up the the cocoa the sponge cake. Left so full but so satisfied and happy.  The atmosphere is definitely on the noisy side. The service was excellent with three folks constantly filling water and clearing plates. Great food ."}
{"text":"I was visiting from Las Vegas, where we have a plethora of food options to choose from. I am spoiled by the variety and therefore hard to impress. Citizen Public House did impress, though.   We arrived around 7pm on a Sunday night and didn't think we would need reservations. The wait wasn't long (20 min), but I would suggest reservations.   We started with the Mac and cheese with tomato relish. I can't say enough good things about this dish. The Gorgonzola gave it a slight tang, and the tomato relish blew my mind.   I had the scallops and my date had the rack of lamb. I'm not a fan of lamb, but he said it exceeded his expectations. The scallops definitely exceeded mine. They were plump and cooked to perfection. The plating was both beautiful and delicious. I am recommending this place to all of my family in the area."}
{"text":"Great service, great drinks and an amazing chop salad!!! I will eat here every time I visit."}
{"text":"How is it that I don't write reviews for places I absolutely love to go.    I think that when I truly LOVE a place, I get writer's block.  I generally don't know where to begin, so let me start with the item that drew me in.... Bacon Popcorn.  If you read my reviews, you know by now that popcorn is my favorite food.  My second favorite is bacon.  When a place takes those 2 things and puts them together in one dish, it won't take much to make me a fan, for life.  When I walk in Citizen Public House and pull up a seat at the bar, I feel like I'm in a craftsman style supper club.  The interior of the building itself is beautifully appointed, yet simple with those beautiful wooden beams.  There is a lovely patio area as well.  I've dined on several things from the menu.  I've gone for dinner with reservations and I've stumbled in late night for a bowl of popcorn and libations.    By far my favorite thing on the menu, save the Bacon popcorn, is the Chopped Salad.  I enjoy it every time I've gone.  I'm a creature of habit and it is hard for me to order something different at a restaurant when I've found something I enjoy a lot.  HOWEVER, I love it that I have some adventurous friends and I've managed to try several of their drinks and menu items.    I like the fact that they host a monthly cocktail tasting.  Come in and taste their crafted cocktails for about $65 with some food pairings.  Their drinks are adventurous, but to be honest, I've had better crafted cocktails around Phoenix.    I would give them 5 stars, but I did order something once that was not prepared correctly and I had to convince the server that it wasn't.  I didn't have to twist his arm but he tried to tell me that it was correct and etc, but I said no, I don't think so.   I suppose after the server took it to the back and examined the food item more, he discovered I was right.  They remade the item for me and the night kept going.  But that makes me wonder if the menu is being prepared correctly.  I wouldn't know, probably never will since I'm stuck on that salad. (SN: I think their chopped salad has a facebook page.)   And the menu doesn't change often enough.  Another downer is the fact that there is no audible music.  I'm on the fence if I'd want it there or not, but when I've gone, I notice I look around thinking, we could use some atmospheric music.  I also think that place would rock with a really good Jazz band playing live music there.  Please don't get me wrong, this place has excellent service.    The fact of the matter is that I will definitely be back  CPH has the chance to earn 5 stars from me."}
{"text":"Great location.  Food was good. Loved the bacon popcorn. Some very tasty interesting drinks."}
{"text":"I came to Scottsdale for vacation and didn't want to leave CPH because of how good their lamb burger is. Mine was a little rare, with tzatziki sauce.  SO good.  I also had the Pig in the Orchard Bread Pudding and the Irish Coffee Pot de Crème...which were fairly adventurous choices for me, and enjoyable.  CPH has a really great atmosphere and great service too."}
{"text":"CPH was fabulous! Everything we ate was wonderful. We started out at the bar and the girls had cocktails while I had the bartender create a mocktail for me. It's a lively place and very trendy. For dinner, we split the pork belly pastrami and chopped salad as appetizers. They were both so amazing! The pork belly was tender and delicious and just awesome. Seriously, get these two apps and you won't be disappointed! For our mains, I had the scallops, and the others had the bavette steak and duck burger. We all LOVED what we had. The scallops were perfectly cooked and the grits underneath were to die for. The steak was super tender with awesome flavor. The duck burger was the same.  We topped it off with a fabulous cab from Conn Creek. I highly recommend trying this restaurant. We would certainly return if we're in the area again!"}
{"text":"Great dinner spot in Scottsdale AZ, and with 900+ reviews, we knew it was a must try spot.  Came here for business and with friends and had a great time.    The food and drinks were great, and the service was awesome.  I ordered the Pork Osso Buco.  The portion was \"Fancy Restaurant\" size, but every bit was flavorful and satisfying.    Great spot to have a dinner meeting, not too loud and given great service by the staff.  The restaurant is located in a great convenient location where you can walk to various other restaurants or bars."}
