{"text":"I have been here a couple times pre-Yelp and the experience was so-so, but I thought there was potential for greatness. My last couple check-ins have not disappointed! 

The service has been good backed up by a woman I believe is one of the owners or is the owner, not to mention a chef! She works the kitchen and mingles with the diners. It is a nice touch that doesn't seem common in the restaurant industry.

The menu and beverage selection is excellent. Mill St on tap along with Peroni for a more Italian  flavour to compliment the Italian cuisine. Appetizers are awesome - truffle butter popcorn and mussels (weird combo, but so good)!

Pizza is one of my favorites here. Mainly due to the half price wine and pizza night hosted on Wed or Thurs ( can't recall which as I was mildly hops and malted barley infused on a Sat afternoon). Pizzas are done in a brick oven. There are also great appetizers such as the garlic popcorn and the antipasto platter.

San Remo gets a lot of mixed reviews - I say give it a try!"}
{"text":"Our second visit here (the first was worth three stars) and we arrived at 5:50 pm on a Sunday night without a reservation. There was no line (no one, at all, waiting), half a dozen empty tables, and a few seats open at the bar. We live in the area and thought we would check out the $10 pasta night.  We wouldn't have minded waiting, but we were told it would be \"at least\" 45 minutes, and we (very brashly) couldn't sit at the bar, there was \"no room\". The experience overall was quite unfriendly - they clearly didn't want to take our money.  I don't think we'll try a third time."}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night with some friends who live in the area. They claim it's a stand-by for getting a last minute reservation on nights like Saturday. The space was comfortable, nice ambiance etc. Odd musical selections playing for a nice Italian place and fairly loud.

Appetizers/ salads seemed reasonably priced. Pastas and entrees possibly slightly over-priced but this is Calgary, and in trendy Marda Loop on top of that.

Had the the caprese salad which was pretty good with nice presentation - not your classic caprese. Not sure what the olives added to the dish but then again, I'm not a huge oilive fan. Friends had the sambuca prawns appetizer which looked pretty good.

Decided to go with their spaghetti and meatballs - which was recommended by our server out of the pasta selections. \"Nonna Rosa's traditional Bolognese\" and the \"house made San Remo meatballs\" seemed like it would be a solid pick. Not so much. Bland sauce, overcooked noodles and the meatballs were tasteless and hard. The sauce also had chunks of meat in it also which might be a touch excessive. Definitely disappointing. I can make better meatballs. You can buy better meatballs pre-made. Maybe I caught a bad batch. I should have clued in when my friend ordered the spaghetti without the meatballs... Friends said the gnocchi was good and the summer puttanesca pasta also looked at least visually appealing. 

My meal cost me $74 including tip and included half a bottle of French Cab Sauv which was decent. Had my entrée been better I would have been ok with that. They have cheap pasta nights on Sun/ Mon which might be the time to hit this place. The pricier entrees that I saw coming out looked pretty good but at $30/ plate they should be. Better Italian food out there I'd say at this price point. They have the advantage of location in Marda Loop which seems to play to their advantage here."}
{"text":"The first time that I went here for dinner was four years ago on a Tuesday night when they have half priced pastas. My first impression was ok but I did not return until last month....this time was on a Thursday night and it was awesome! The menu is slightly different than on a tuesday night (although I know you can order from the reg menu as well on Tue nights). We started with the bruchetta and a spicy sausage which was  pan fried, in a roast tomato garlic sauce, oven baked with bocconcini & parmesan cheese. Both were amazing. I had the spaghetti Caprese and my husband had the Braised Beef Short Ribs...again both were great. It was quite busy but worth the wait. The service was also good...the waitress made a very nice wine selection for us. We sat next to a fire place and enjoyed listening to the not too loud music that seems to be a recent fad in most restaurants! We will be returning soon for another great meal!"}
{"text":"Went in on a Saturday night, not busy at all. We were seated right away but after about 20 minutes and no sign of a waiter we ended up leaving. Front of house staff didn't even have an apology for us, just \"ok\" when we told them why we were leaving. Will not be back."}
{"text":"Came for a wedding dinner. The place was totally unprepared for this PRE BOOKED dinner. Waited over an hour for my meal which was mediocre at best. Over priced and understaffed. Save your money. DO NOT EAT HERE. Worst restaurant experience EVER."}
{"text":"Decent spot for Italian in the heart of Mckenzie town. $10 for all pastas on Sunday/Monday's, but they're not the biggest portions and not homemade. Nice décor and delicious. Ask for the meatballs appetizer which is not on the menu anymore but you can still get it. Was a little slow last time I was there."}
{"text":"First and last time eating at this restaurant. 
I came here with my boyfriend and little brother. A table of 3, in an empty restaurant besides a birthday reservation -  it shouldn't have taken us 10 minutes to get a table. Because the hostess wasn't present, a woman in a chef's coat greeted us and took us to a table. She told us we had to be gone by 7:30 pm. We entered the restaurant at 5pm so we figured this wouldn't be a problem.
Not an exaggeration when I say this - 20 minutes passed and we still had not gotten our drinks ordered. No one approached our table. After the 20 minutes, the same woman in the chef's coat came to our table and asked if we had been helped and we said no. So she took our drinks and our orders because we had plenty of time with the menu. 
The menu is a piece of white paper on blue construction paper. The paper is not even mounted on very well. Low quality. Not much variety. For an italian restaurant, you'd think they would have more than 4 pasta options. 
Our server came with our drinks, and apologized because she thought we were part of the birthday reservation. We were in a booth secluded from the birthday area, so I didn't understand her logic. We were then served bread with hummus, no butter came with the bread. The bread was cold and hard.
Appetizers took 32 minutes. We timed it. We ordered the mussels and the beet salad. The beet salad was for myself but they split it onto 3 plates assuming we were sharing, so I had 3 plates of salads in front of me to eat..?
Another 28 minutes for our mains to come. Disappointing. Definitely not worth over 20 dollars a dish.
We ended up leaving at around 7:15 pm. Couldn't believe how long everything took.

Extremely disappointed in this restaurant. Expensive, bad service, and low quality food. Will not be returning and would not recommend."}
{"text":"This is an expensive and incredibly classy-looking little restaurant in Marda Loop that plays authentic Italian tunes by the likes of Radiohead and metal bands. My wife and I were there for Valentine's day, and we were the second couple there (empty place except for us and the other couple for a little while after there) and waited 20 minutes to have our order taken by the waitress--the first time, because she came back twice to double-check our dead-simple order. Our appetizer came out maybe 20 minutes later, and then we waited 40 minutes after that for our food, while other people kept getting theirs. All the time, she kept asking us weird questions like, \"Are you living the dream!?\" Wat.

1 hour 15 minutes after we got there, my dinner finally came out along with not-my-wife's-dinner. Ms. Living The Dream said she'd be back in \"2 minutes\" with the right one. Comes back 5 minutes later to tell us it'll be another 5 minutes. Meanwhile, my food's getting cold, and we're both fed up and hungry, so we say we'll pay for the drinks/appetizer and leave. She snaps back that it hasn't even been an hour. So yeah. We ended up leaving."}
{"text":"We went there yesterday evening expecting a quick dinner, had dinner reservations at 7pm and didn't get out till 8:35, it took a hour and 15 minuted for them to bring the appetizers out for us, and when they brought dinner they brought my wife's before mine, she was already done her food by the time my pizza came out. We ordered bruschetta and watermelon salad for appetizers and gnocchi and reme pizza for main meals. The appetizers were good we liked the bruschetta a lot it was the best thing that we had. The gnocchi was terrifying to look at and eat but it was still better than the pizza. They left one olive un-pitted on the pizza so that wasn't pleasant, the pizza tasted like i was eating dirt absolutely disgusting, I am not over exaggerating when I say it was the worst pizza I have had in my life! 
 they had a pile of arugula on everything! On the pizza gnocchi and watermelon salad. So unless you have a weird fetish for arugula dont go there. I would never go there again and wouldn't even recommend this to my worst enemy.  I really didn't want to write a bad review for anyone but this was completely justified."}
{"text":"Was there with my partner a couple weeks ago.  Nice spot, good ambience, good crowd.  Service was good, not much of a wait.  My partner had the risotto and I had the pizza.  Both dishes were bland and not worth the price.  Based on value for money, we will not return."}
{"text":"My fiancée and I went in for dinner tonight without a reservation. It was full so we were seated at the bar. Service started out great. Dinner was delicious and reasonably priced. But when the servers started to get busier we were pretty much ignored for about 25 minutes or so. As we were finally paying our bill the manger broke a glass in the ice. Anyone who has very worked in a bar or restaurant knows just how annoying this can be.  Regardless the behavior of our server and the manager at fault was totally rude and unacceptable towards another employee. She was obviously quite new and still learning. After our server snapped at her for the second time that I saw, the manger basically threw a fit and kicked her out from behind the bar. The poor girl was only trying to do her job!  Unfortunately situations like this will prevent me from going to this restaurant ever again. Which is really unfortunate because there aren't a ton of decent restaurants in the suburbs. Maybe the employees need to be reminded that while customers are obviously important, respect and kindness towards fellow employees is just as important. Shame on the manger for the poor example she is setting."}
{"text":"Ahhh... You cookin for me!!!??? This wanna-be Italian enclave in Garrison Woods is weak on authenticity and big on bad, warm, red wine. The menu is a headshot for an attractive actor who in reality is only good enough for an Oliveira frozen pasta commercial. 

I don't recommend this place and I'm Phattony so I know a thing or two about carbohydrates and Italian food. My friend Fredo says stats always too!!! Capisce? 

At least until they get the flys outta da place."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner with the family last night, third visit and will be the last. Staff friendly but seemed too busy and service slow with really really long wait for food (this has been an issue every time I have gone).
Menu choices terrible, waitress said new menu just a few weeks old. Food was just weird, felt like we were guinea pigs on Top Chef with an inexperienced chef trying to be too upscale. Bread comes served with some type of hummus dip, was okay but would have preferred butter. My Seafood Risotto was acceptable. Other dining companions had dry pork chops with an awful odd tasting mashed sweet potato. All way overpriced to top it off.
The table next to us actually complained so much about their food they didn't even pay! 
Definitely the last visit here."}
{"text":"Our party of 4 was extremely disappointed with the horrible service we received at this restaurant last night. Our server was in attentive, scatterbrained & very slow. He made mistakes and then laughed them off casually and insincerely. He seemed rushed and the restaurant seemed under staffed. The food was fine but I feel overpriced for what we received and how long it took. Even after we voiced our issues to the hostess, nothing was done to remedy the situation. It has been over a year since I visited this restaurant & sadly I won't be returning because the service is still horrible!"}
{"text":"Nice and close to home makes this a convenient stop for a nice family dinner or special occasion celebration. Sunday and Monday they have $10 pasta and Thursday's, my personal favourite - buy one get one pizzas! The funghi pizza is delicious! 

I do wish their regular weekly menu had more variety and I find it disappointing that gnocchi and yummy gnocchi poutine are no longer on the menu as this by far their best dish."}
{"text":"It's the SE what your options ? The Keg, bad Indian, pizza??!! Please enjoy some sophistication in the Deep South. Or, spend $120 cabbing it downtown."}
{"text":"I believe the Yelp reviews of this Mckenzie Towne pasta place are a little too lenient. Perhaps the deep-south dwellers are cutting San Remo some slack as the nearest ideal options are closer to downtown. 

I've been here twice, and on both occasions the service was so mind-blowingly slow--with incompetent servers and front-of-house--that the rest of the review may as well be a writeoff. I will say that the head chef appears to be quite engaged in diners' experience--she actually showed up more than our server. Can't find good help, maybe? If you're like me and get anxiety from watching kitchen staff trip over themselves with no semblance of build order or station efficiency, you might want to avoid it altogether.

But in the interest of informing future guests, I'll continue. I had the Lobster Tetrazzini, which featured pasta that I am almost certain came out of a box and lobster which smelled a little off and tasted like rubber. While the plate was hot, the food was partially cold and pasta was starchy.  For $25, it is expensive, featuring a small portion size.

The trend of fighting to make upscale or gourmet Italian food is an exhausting one that tends to result in overpriced basics. It doesn't appear to stop business from attaching inflated price tags to uninspiring pasta.  I have same criticism of the Banff Springs Hotel's \"Castello\". 

My father had mussels, which again tasted like they were previously frozen, very gamey and rubbery. Not surprisingly, despite his iron stomach, he was sick a few hours after eating.  I did caution him to maybe not eat them and tell the staff, but he did not want to appear rude (dads, right?). Another in our party had the Remo pizza--should be good, right? Wrong. Soggy crust, skimpy toppings, poorly seasoned, and generally poorly executed and overpriced.

A review below from a fellow Yelper states \"It's the SE what your options ? The Keg, bad Indian, pizza??!!\" The correct answer is none. It's not a matter of food snobbery, it's simply a matter of obtaining good value for your dollar and having a much better experience. Sorry people, but you have to drive or cab.

If Italian is what you crave, don't settle for a nearby option. Go for the good stuff. For a classic experience, check out \"Buon Giorno\" on 17th. For a modern and well-executed truly innovative Italian, check out \"Bonterra\". Yes, they're downtown, and yes, they are worth the drive."}
{"text":"Our server was interupted with our wanting a meal. The thin crust pizza was ok. We had the antipasto sampler and it came with proscutto wrapped around a stale breadstick.  Our server argued with another customer about why they had not received their meal yet?? We will not return or reccomend this place."}
{"text":"Arrived at 12:30 for lunch only12 customers

Service excellent

Had the penne aarabiata, took 20 minutes but arrived over cooked and split 

Sigh"}
{"text":"I might have given more than two stars, but it took an hour to get my food after I ordered."}
{"text":"The food is fairly average and not worth the price we paid. The fiance called it an upscale Olive Garden (minus all you can eat bread basket). We had to request for a second drink after the waitress came to our table twice without noticing our empty glass and asking us. We more than likely will not be coming here again."}
{"text":"This place totally won my heart over on this visit! I didn't have very high expectations to be honest. Going into it I thought \"Oh just another over priced corner hideaway that stuffy rich people go to!\". Man was I wrong!

I can't say a single bad thing about this place. The service was over the top. (Although, we ended up knowing our server which may have made a difference). Her name was Lindsay and she was one of the most pleasant people I have ever met. SHe recommended some really great dishes that definitely lived up to her review. We ended up staying for longer than expected just to enjoy our wine because the atmosphere was just perfect for a nice intimate night out to have a great conversation. 

I will definitely be back, and I highly suggest you take your next date here!"}
{"text":"I had never heard of this place before although I've spent time in Garrison Woods (just south of Marda Loop), most notably across the street at the Starbucks, but I met a few friends for dinner here (one of them chose this place).

We had resos for 4:45 and we were the only people there. By the time we left at 6:30, it was almost full. So I would recommend calling ahead to reserve for sure..

What I really liked about the place was our waitress was very personable. She went through the chef's special, was easy to talk to (didn't feel like she was trying to be nice) and she was dressed very formally. I don't go to a restaurant to look at the waitresses so it was nice that she wasn't showing a lot of leg or cleavage.

She was very prompt in bringing out our drinks, the bread and taking our orders. She knew the menu really well, as we had questions about some of the entrees and she was able to answer them easily.

The food itself was delicious (I ordered the seafood pasta) which was a large portion, but it was ok since I was really hungry :)

Our waitress (notice I'm not saying her name - she never introduced herself to me and I neglected to ask) was great throughout the meal, topping up our drinks and seeing if we needed anything. She wasn't overbearing though, so just the right amount.

I would highly recommend going here if you live anywhere close to Garrison Woods. I highly enjoyed the food :)"}
{"text":"Fabulous fine dining down in McKenzie Towne. I recommend the squid ink pasta; Nero de sepia pasta with black cod. Also, one night a week wine is half price!

Just a heads up, as is true anywhere in Mckenzie Towne the parking lot is about 1/10th the size it should be. Terrible lack of parking."}
{"text":"The good - the food was great! And our server was fantastic!  We were seated at the pizza oven and when offered a table we opted to stay where we were for her. She was so accommodating and even let us sample the wine before we chose one.

The less desirable - pizza oven seats are hot... and the kitchen staff did not have their hair tied back, or in hats, or under a harinet for the ladies... and there were some with long hair... 
Our food came out hair free ... but with my cooking background I know that the hair should at least be tied back."}
{"text":"Like others, I'd classify this as a true little gem, this restaurant didn't disappoint! 

We arrived early to our reso and were promptly seated. Our server was kind and informative and helped us select a nice bottle of wine while we waited for the remainder of our party to arrive. 

We started by sharing the antipasto platter, while our littlest guest (8 years old) had a Caesar salad. (\"the best salad evarrrrr!\"). The platter was awesome - blue, Brie and bocconcini cheeses; a variety of meats; garlic toast flats and sesame seed crisps; olives, mushrooms & marinated roasted red peppers. The portion size was huge and between the three adults, we didn't finish it. 

The little one enjoyed a child size portion of spaghetti and meat sauce while two of the three adults chose pasta (sea food and pasta aggio), the third choosing chicken wrapped prawns with veggies in a white sauce. 

The meal itself was high quality and fresh; the service was fantastic (which continued even after we'd settled up and sat and visited for awhile). 

The only areas where I'd suggest a bit of improvement would be around the ambience. The music was a little too loud in the quaint dining area, and the ladies bathroom was all but out of soap. 

Overall though, this was an outstanding experience - we'll definitely be visiting again!"}
