{"text":"Top Gun Burger was a delicious place to go, I had the Maverick Burger and it was very juicy and delicious, the meat was cooked to medium so they got it right and the Top Gun sauce was excellent, I would give it a 5 star but my wife had the B52 steak sandwich and that was just average as I had a sample, overall top notch and would recommend it if you are in the Kensington area."}
{"text":"I tried the Maverick Sandwich (lamb) and was really impressed.  The sandwich was quite large, but that was due to the generous meat portion, and not filler items. Everything tasted great, and it definitely satisfied my hunger.  Of further note, the fries that came with the combo were also really good."}
{"text":"I didn't find the steak on its own all that great but the various combinations of toppings intrigue me and I definitely plan on going back some day. Their poutine is the best (halal) poutine I've had and their service sure is friendly."}
{"text":"I had the MIG34 includes Beef, Cheddar Cheese, Onion Rings, Beef Chili, Avocado Garnish & Sour Cream On A Side  *Title:  Messy Goodness*   *Overall, this burger was good *There was a lot of flavor when all the ingredients were nicely integrated  *The beef chili was alright and fell outside the frame of the burger at times which is expected *The choice of bun (egg roll bun) was a good choice, very soft and complimented the burger.  A harder bun would have ruined the experience   *The beef tasted more like lean ground beef and would be better if they used 50% chuck *The burger was hand pressed which is a nice touch and preferred!   *The assembly of the burger could have been a bit better but hard to succeed given all the additional toppings *The onion rings were NOT paced well within the burger, it was more to the side hence you did not get the taste of the onion rings with every bite *Did not get the advertised \"Avocado Garnish & Sour Cream On A Side\" *I would order this burger again!"}
{"text":"I went with a few friends on a weeknight, I personally had wanted to go to their sister restaurant again, Top Gun Steak, but I was happy that I checked it out. So it's much bigger and brighter than top gun steak, which is a plus.   I ordered the star fighter, this yummy burger that has a patty of portobello mushrooms, cream cheese and cheddar cheese in addition to the beef patty. I also made it a combo.   While it was delish, it was messy, felt like the bun could have been a bit bigger maybe, but I finished every last bite! It was pricey, I paid with a small tip just about $20.  Customer service was great! The lady at cash took care of us well and gave us extra aioli sauce to dip our fries, which I definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"The best steak sandwich in the world I love the way they make the sandwich the skinny crispy fries is my favourite so yyummy"}
{"text":"Quality food. Arrived in the evening with a big appetite. Expectations were exceeded. Juicy, saucy, burgers that explode with flavour. Use of cheese, sauces and toppings is excellent, and portions are great. Very filling, the only struggle to finishing your meal is how big your order was. Big fan of the poutine - try it! My main dish was the Bearcat Burger, and I was thoroughly satisfied. Messy experience and not for the faint of heart, but the level of indulgement is hard to match.  This restaurant is great. You can eat casual or challenge yourself at the table, but the taste and enjoyment are top-notch. I shall be returning once again."}
{"text":"Awesome place! There's nothing to complain about other than how much room there is inside. Feels super stuffy and crowded if you go in with a lot of people. But the workers are super friendly and the service is decently fast. The food is out of this world! Best. Burger. Ever. Their burger and fries combos are $9 and totally worth the price cause you get more than enough. I shared the burger combo with a friend and we were both full from the burger alone. Great place overall! 10/10 recommend it to everyone looking for a great burger or steak place."}
{"text":"If I lived in the area, I would've definitely been a regular here. Their steak sandwiches are always on point. My personal fav here is the Take my Breath Away and Maverick. The servers are always helpful and friendly. Never had a bad experience yet and hope it stays this way"}
{"text":"The lamb sandwich was pretty good. If you're in Kensington pretty late and looking for a place with a nice patio, Top Gun is great."}
{"text":"I had a STARFIGHTER with Poutine. It was too much for me... but they were so awesome that I could have them all! I wanna try a different burger next time."}
{"text":"Went last fall with my family. The food ended up being excellent which is why I am giving 4 stars. The service was not spectacular. My daughter's boyfriend ordered a burger with nothing on it but cheese and we had to send it back twice. The rest of us had ordered various steak sandwiches which arrived one at a time even though the restaurant didn't seem busy. It seemed like they would cook and serve one before starting the next one. We were a group of 6 and 5 of us ordered milkshakes with our meals. I had finished my meal and none of us had gotten our milkshakes. I was getting pretty thirsty. When I asked about the milkshakes they told me they were coming soon. A few minutes later an employee came in the front door carrying 2 bags of milk and then a couple of minutes after that I heard the mixer fire up and one by one the milkshakes were finally delivered. They did bring a couple of free orders of fries to the table to make up for the slow service but I had already eaten my meal and wasn't hungry at all. Overall I enjoyed the food and we have laughed about how bad the service was many times since then. I will definitely give it another shot sometime."}
{"text":"Yes it's a burger but it really is \"quality you can taste.\" That chain has got nothing on Top Gun and this is definitely a cut above Umami Burger - if you're a burger fan, don't skip this place."}
{"text":"I would have given this place 4 start but the poutine cheeseburger combo with a Jones drink came to $17????   Decent food, clean and very busy. Would recommend it, just get something cheaper."}
{"text":"Decided to eat here for dinner. The owner and chef were very welcoming of our group.  Ended up ordering the Iceman along with a milkshake. The food was great and well worth the money."}
{"text":"Really love this place! usually sandwiches fall apart and end up crumbling but this really holds up. I add a fried egg to whatever sandwich i get for extra flavor. The staff is pretty friendly too , i just wish the pricing was a little more reasonable."}
{"text":"Very good beef burger. Staffs are friendly. Burger is juicy and testy. Lovely place to hang out with."}
{"text":"I was here top gun steak. The customer service was so good. And chef mohammad made fantastic steak for us :)"}
{"text":"I wish there was an option for zero stars. So I was having a bad day and decided to turn it around by ordering a hearty meal (bad idea to change your mood with food I know I know). And I turned to Uber Eats after work to find something nice. Top Gun seemed like a good idea and I ended up getting the Top Gun burger ($22!), the aoili fries ( around $4) and chocolate milkshake ($7!). It was steep but I decided I was going to throw my budget out the window for the day.   So anyway, food arrived on time, which says more about Uber Eat than the restaurant and the positives end there. Let me break it down:  1) Fries: the fries were not only cold but they had also clearly been refried. They tasted and looked like the leftover fries a restaurant would have before closing time that they'd be about to throw out but instead were able to pawn off on an unsuspecting customer like me. I basically ended up paying $4 for fries as hard has rocks.  2) Burger: I got the Top Gun which includes a grilled chicken fillet and beef along with a deep friend mushroom and cheese patty. The chicken, much like the fries was tough and dry and smelt kind of wonky. The beef smelt off too. So I had a few bites (because I was SO hungry) but gave up cuz it tasted like garbage.  3) Milkshake: The milkshake tasted average but for $7 it was a terribly small portion.   All in all, 85% of my meal was thrown into the garbage just 15 minutes after being delivered.   After factoring in the taxes I payed $40s total for the most ridiculously disgusting, stale, smelly meal of my life. NEVER ordering from here again, NEVER going to this place again. NEVER.   On a personal note, still in a bad mood, my long hard day has just been made worse by the gross taste left in my mouth.   Rant over."}
{"text":"WHO the HELL makes the burgers here? WHO makes the fries ? ALL I gotta say is that the food is FREAKING amazing, fresh and tasty ASF. Good portions for reasonable prices.  Will come again for sure!"}
{"text":"Really wanted to try this place and I finally did. I got the Starfighter burger which is Beef patty, herbed crusted portobello mushroom stuffed with cheddar and mozzarella cheese, rosemary garlic aioli, lettuce, tomato, and pickle. I wasn't crazy about the type of bun they use (it was kind of dry) the bun to patty ratio was not what I expect when you are paying 12.99 for the burger. The bun is much bigger than the patty in my opinion. I also got a poutine which was really good but 10.00 for a large which in my opinion was quite small. We waited around for a while for a server who we were greeted by and it turns out you need to go up and order and pay upfront and then wait for your order to come to the table. Would I go back ? Not sure. It's quite expensive so not a burger you would have all the time. It was also super cold inside. Tabled were a bit dirty."}
{"text":"Loved the environment of this place. The burgers were quite much but so worth the money. Pretty quiet spot given it's in a very busy neighbourhood.  If you are looking for an awesome burger joint this place won't disappoint."}
{"text":"OMG Their food is incredible!  I forgot to take a picture until we got through some of our poutine, but WOW you have to come here! LOTS of veggy options!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite restaurants! Thank you chef Muhammed for the amazing tasty meals."}
{"text":"Would not recommend it to anyone! We ordered the flying zone burger which was not good at all. The chicken strips were tasteless the fries weren't even salted and poutine wasn't good either. Will not come back for sure!"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to go to Top Gun Steak since I read about the place on BlogTO. Walked by a few times in Kensington Market but was never in the mood for a steak burger.  Today is my lucky day!   We ordered the Top Gun Birdy (special of the day) and the Cheerful. The special came with deep fried chicken breast, pull beef in BBQ sauce, mozzarella cheese, deep fried onions, lettuce and tomato in a burger bun. The special also came with fries and a pop for $13.99. My boyfriend really enjoyed the burger. Mine came with steaks, Brie cheese, sautéed onions, mushrooms and red peppers for $8.50. What a steal!   Overall, great value, no-frill and what you see is what you get kind of burger joint!   Recommend!"}
{"text":"Made reservations for 10. I think the service was the worst I have ever seen. Never offered us drinks, while we waited for the whole party to arrive. Menus were on pieces of paper, that had the prices marked out the black marker Had to get up ourselves to get cutlery. SOME people got French fries, some didn't. But, when asked, he said all come with pop & fries. The place was freezing ! One guest asked for extra crispy fries, but, got under cooked. I gave it a 2 just because I liked my sandwich, but, will never go back."}
{"text":"I loved the Fly Zone Sandwich, it  was delicious, juicy and amazing special taste.  I came with my family and I got warm welcome from a worker \"Mohammed\", he was very friendly, helpful and smily.  I loved the combination of having steak and chicken stripes in the burger. It was light and special.  I definetly recommand that, if you are looking for a special taste."}
{"text":"Hand Slaughtered HALAL beef burger place thats super creative and delicious... Whats up!!!   I have had:  \"Take My Breath Away\" -- Beef patty topped with a breaded cheese patty -- I liked it!  \"The Flying Zone\" -- Beef Patty topped with 2 boneless Buffalo Chicken Strips - AMAZING  Poutine -- Its good, but not amazing as their burgers. portion is really small when they say \"Large\"   ---   Definitely going again -- need to try the STEAK/BEEF stuff -- costs a bit high. Food range is from $10-$20   For example: \"The Black Eagle\" costs $20 - however its a big Sub bread with lots of beef/steak plus 5 buffalo wings on top -- so its huge and heavy!"}
{"text":"This place is an absolute Must GO!! Right in Kensington Market I've been wanting to go since I have read all positive reviews. They have an outfront patio to enjoy if you dont mind the busy and loud market noise.  There is no table service which I suppose is to keep prices more affordable. The sandwiches not just looks incredible they tastes delicious!! Note: Washrooms are clean Note 2: If you're Muslim they have a prayer room in the basement"}
{"text":"Hands down the best burger I've had in Toronto. Ordered the firefly burger and I am still reeling from how amazing it tasted. The bun they used had a crisp texture to it. The patty was flippin fresh and tasty AF. Will definitely be back to try some other burgers.   Keep up the great work! 5 out of 5 stars no doubt!"}
{"text":"I took note of the empty establishment as soon as we entered it, but my son loved the name and was hooked by the lamb burger offering.    We didn't like the burgers.  After 1 bite, neither of us could finish eating it.  My son ordered the lamb and I ordered the vegan.  Both were bland.  The staff tried to fix it by adding sauces.  Unfortunately the sauces lacked flavor as well.  Graciously, our money was refunded."}
{"text":"Paid this establishment a visit after frequenting the affiliated Burgernator up the street. Had the Philly cheese steak special, all in all the meal was ok, was turned off that they used a slice of processed cheese, was expecting better quality real cheese. Staff were friendly, I'd visit again and order off the menu next time."}
{"text":"This is a 4.5 in disguise, but finally ate here for the first time tonight (review posted in May 2017 but likely was in during fall/winter 2016) and it was awesome!  Service was quick, friendly, and the food was amazing. On that, they have (hand butchered! aka properly done) halal, vegetarian, gluten-free, and possibly vegan options, so really, what's not to like?"}
{"text":"As far as a burger and fries goes, Top Gun burgers knows what's up.  I had the lamb burger, with some green leafy lettuce, onions, tomato, some grilled jalapeños, some grilled mushrooms, and I went with the garlic aoli rather than the mint sauce. I like mint in my tooth paste, not on my food. However, they stayed true to lamb culture with the mint sauce.  And let me say, that the sweet potato fries were cut right, crispy on the outside, and soft in the middle.  Lovely meal. Great staff.   Kenny Loggins."}
{"text":"Something different, so he said. Top Gun Steak is a halal certified restaurant, which is fine and adds another layer of diversity to the market. I had the basic sandwich and fries. Nothing too extraordinary, basically meat on a bun, with some caramelized onions and a mayo-type sauce. Good value for the $6.50 although for my taste it was kinda bland and could use some hot sauce for kick."}
{"text":"Omg ... The BEST burger I've had in my life Better than in and out... Better than burger priest or any other popular burger joints that are around or atleast that I have tried so far  I ordered the maverk burger (I think that's what it's called) and my brother ordered something else which I cannot recall. The person over there suggested what to get according to what we like. I had steak and pulled lamb in mine which was so juicy and yummy!!! Best part was that it was halal... The sauce was good... They had to give extra on the side cuz it wasn't spicy enough for me. I will for sure go here again to eat.  It was very cold inside though.. They do need to get heating or atleast turn it up a bit more when it's -24 outside hehe!b"}
{"text":"One of the best steaks in the area. Period! Cooked to anoerfect medium rare, seasoned to perfection! If you need a steak fix, top gun will not dissapoint. Took my mother here for her birthday a few months ago, and she loved it! I enjoyed it so much I even took the time 4 months later to reccomend them!"}
{"text":"5 stars!!   I had an amazing lunch here. I ordered the chilli cheese fries and it was delicious.  The service was very nice .   You can definitely tell that the chilli is made from scratch . The fries were wonderfully crisp. I'm going to be back here for sure."}
{"text":"This restaurant replaces the previous cheesesteak establishment, Big Al's. I actually went there wanting to eat a simple cheesesteak: steak, cheese, sauteed onions, and perhaps a light seasoning or sauce to coat it. Imagine my surprise when there were no simple cheesesteaks available -- every single steak sandwich on the menu included the kitchen sink. I don't want lettuce and tomatoes on my steak sandwich; give me a real, philly-style cheesesteak!  Turned off by the menu trying too hard to be fancy, I ordered their sloppy fries, which was a mix of cheese curds, mushrooms, peppers, and spicy mayo. It was way too salty, which made me shudder at the thought of trying their poutine.  Big Al's was definitely the better establishment and I'm sorry to see it go. Top Gun Steak doesn't give any options to double the meat or add additional toppings -- you are forced to order whatever crazy setups they have on their menu."}
{"text":"Wow! What a steak!! What a sandwich! The best steak sandwich in town till now!!! I gonna come here and try all items to the end of menu each time. It's a little bit greasy, but can't be delicious in any other way. It's clear it is grilled with natural fat of meat and it is a good point of it. Freshly prepared in a delicious way. Can't recommend it more!"}
{"text":"If you're a burger fan - this is one you've gotta try. They have a big menu of different burgers, and it was good food. And the prices were not bad at all either - very reasonable. The quality of the burger was good, the meat was cooked well, and the fries were well cooked as well.  Not really much else to say - they have A LOT of options to pick from, and they have massive burgers too if you're hungry, so as long as you like burgers, you'll most likely like this little restaurant. It's not too big, but they make the food quick.  I'll be back to try another burger soon!"}
{"text":"Overrated. Had the opportunity to try this out today, not worth the wait. First off, the prices are stupid for what you get. A small patty and beef bacon for $12. The bacon was almost impossible to bite through as it was probably leather before being sold as bacon. The burger fell apart as the grease was incapable of holding it together.   Once I placed my order, I sat and waited for another 20+ minutes. They brought me out my fries 10 minutes before my burger, so they had time to harden before I set eyes on my full meal.   All in all, will not recommend nor return.  Update-spent most of afternoon in washroom. I doubt it was food poisoning, but there was definitely something wrong with it"}
{"text":"I've come here a few times and it's a great centrally located spot for halal burgers and sandwiches. Most recently I had the freedom fighter (beef burger). It contains jalapeño poppers inside which is quite creative. It makes the bigger impossible to bite into so best to take them out and eat. They were delicious. The burger itself was a bit dry in terms of sauce so ketchup is required. The Wild Cat beef burger is also tasty but the beef bacon makes it a little chewy. The place needs to be a little cleaner in terms of tables and washrooms."}
{"text":"The best burgers I've literally ever had. This place is absolute quality. And it's not even overpriced either. Amazing...simply amazing."}
{"text":"I decided to check out this burger place after reading their promos for a $10 deal to celebrate their 3rd anniversary which ends on Apr 4, 2018. This place was packed around 6 PM on a sunday, and one of the staff said it was even busier just an hour prior. The people around us weren't ordering the $10 deal so presumably it's normally this busy as well.  We were seated, handed a menu, and then asked to go to the back to place the order. Asked the staff what the deal was and he pointed out which items we would get, and then headed to the back. We asked for the exact items that were listed, but the cashier treated it as a regular order. After requesting for clarification, we got the promo rate. A bit questionable in terms of customer service, but not a big deal.  Our orders came after 15 minutes. The table beside us that were there before us also waited quite awhile. It's a busy restaurant, so perhaps that's why it took awhile to come out, but the order numbers that were called out weren't sequential. There were a few complaints from other tables, but not a big deal.  Having eaten at Harvey's and A&W recently, it was clear that the meat patties at the large franchises were inferior in size, taste, and texture. It's almost like, I haven't had actual meat in a burger for awhile. It was definitely an enjoyable burger.  The (regular) fries, on the other hand, were disappointing, even though they give you so much of it. They were soft and quite flavorless to me. I like a crisp exterior and soft chewy inside. Preferably hot off the fryer. I normally do not add anything to potato fries because I enjoy the natural flavor of potatoes, but even ketchup didn't salvage it for me.  They have a number of other types of items like hot dogs and chicken sandwiches if you're not feeling like a beef burger, but I can't say the fries are a good deal."}
{"text":"Very good burgers .. flexible on spices .. steak sandwich was a typical American style Philly steak sandwich with a variety of toppings. Flying zone burger was lip smacking. Sloppy fries were better than poutine .. kids loved their beercat and other beef burgers. Overall amazing experience, and tough competition for burgenator a block away .. will visit again to seek consistency, and figure out the winner :)"}
{"text":"Crazy overpriced. Whats essentially a burger combo (fries + pop) is $18.00 Tastes pretty average. Meat is supposed to be premium but you can't tell when its cut up into well done strips. Random fries. Took 20 min to get the order at 10pm and the place was 40% full.  Drop the price to $12 and use decent not premium beef and its worth it."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by the real steak strips in these sandwiches, the broad selection of toppings and the quick and friendly service.  Not a huge fan of the milkshakes and the fact that there's no place to put you used tray (meaning that you have to clean up after others when it's busy), but overall this is a great establishment at a competitive price."}
{"text":"As a Philly native I have to say the cheesesteaks here are pretty damn good. Different in some small ways than the Philly original but definitely fills the void in a big way. Staff were very friendly. Everything is confirmed Halal!! Awesome!!"}
{"text":"I've been here about a handful of times and I've never left unsatisfied, If i'm ever visiting a friend at UofT St George or around the kensington area I make sure to stop by. The burgers here are amazing and there's a huge variety in terms of which ones to order. The customer service is great i've always had a positive experience.   On my most recent visit I ordered a \"freedom fighter: burger and the \"sloppy fries\" both items looked and tasted amazing. the burger came with cream cheesed filled fried jalapeno peppers which was awesome (how did they even come up with that). The fries were also nonetheless great but it's best to be shared among others (way to much for one person to eat, or at least for me )."}
{"text":"Pretty good lunch spot. I went for lunch with some co-workers and we all ordered the Wildcat burger combo that was on special. It came with fries and a can of pop. The beef patty was delicious and the portions pretty big, I definitely could not finish all the fries. This place is better than your average burger joint but definitely not the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"The food was good. When you are here to eat you get 2 options Burgernator and Top Gun.  The burgers and chicken strip were tasty and everything was great but personally I prefer Burgernator.  The taste was better there. Overall the ambiance, staff, food quality and cleanliness was good."}
{"text":"Had the Stinger and fries - steak was slightly dry and bland tasting. I also ordered some gravy for the fries and received a watery brown colored beef au jus which had no flavor. When I order gravy, I expect it to be somewhat thick and meaty tasting of which it was neither. We were so disappointed despite the positive reviews."}
{"text":"It was a good burger, had the maverick which i believe had pull lamb which could been more tender and fired egg as well other things. The patty was well cooked and flavorful... while it not best burger I had, i was good. Thou I probably stick to Burgernator if Im ever in Kenginton again"}
{"text":"I kind of don't want to review this place cause its so good I just don't want other people to slow me down from getting my food when I go. But they deserve it. Its only been open for about a month but hers the deal. Best Burger place in the city.   Let me give you all the background on this. I've been big on the artisan/gourmet/high quality/low quality but trendy burger kick around the city for the last few years. I've tried them all. Burgers priest at the beaches before it turned into a chain with mediocre quality. Rude Boy. stockyards, and a dozen other hip over overrated burger joints. Not trying to sound pretentious I just really like meat and burgers in particular. always have. Anyway discovered this place cause I went to their cheese steak place down the street and another really good (but not as good as these guys) burger place down the street. But there can be only one. and this is it.  Un-believable. honestly just seeing the way they handle the meat and smell and the quality I've never had burgers this good. takes a few minute s for them to make it but so worth it. they take your order quick super friendly staff and the place has tons of seating (way to think ahead) and is very clean.My hands down favourite: B-52 6oz lamb with 6oz beef onion ring, sauces and cheese . oh.man. Honestly who cares about being eloquent- place is guuuuud."}
{"text":"Ordered a \"medium rare top striploin steak sandwich\". What I received was ground beef on a bun. Should be called \"Worst Gun Solsbury Steak\". Fries were good though."}
{"text":"This is by far the best burger I have ever had ..... they need to open one in Miami. Definitely a Canadian hidden gem ! We were a group of 5 and each got a different burger. We all tasted each other's burgers and they were all phenomenal in their own way. The meat is very juicy and flavorful but what gives it the unique taste are the different sauces they use and combinations."}
{"text":"First visit here and liked the simple decoration. We chose avengers, maverick and chicken strip. All the meals were delicious and it was more then enough food for us. We also got a large fries which we could not finish. The only negative I could think of was that the buns could not handle the meat but we  are not complaining. We would definitely visit here again."}
{"text":"The worst place to have food in Kensington market. The food is too greasy with no taste. the service is horrible. They missed one sandwich from our order and We end up cancel it. We also found hair in the other sandwich."}
{"text":"Saw this when I was driving through Kensington and somehow I have never clocked this place before. Went in dor their $9.99 everyday special and was very impressed. Store was dead inside and I got to talk with the workers quite a bit. Was a little feverish while enjoying my Steak and Mushroom sandwich but damn that sandwich was on point. If in the area I would definitely hit this place instead of My Big Fat Burrito hehehe."}
{"text":"I honestly don't get the hype!!It was just an ok burger.The pattie was super fresh and moist but other than that nothing fancy or special about the burger.For halal meal seekers their burgers are halal.  So we went on a weekend can't remember if it was a sat or a sun and decided to try them as late lunch option we walked in around 3ish and was hoping to get quick service.The order was taken quickly and there weren't many people .I would say it was sixty percent occupied.  What ticked me off completely was after the order was placed it took them 45 bloody minutes (excuse my language) to flip our two burgers.It was probably the longest wait I experienced for two burger even in LA's in and out with their long lines burger flipping doesn't take this long.I mean I was already so unhappy.  And when they came out , it was fresh, and the pattie was delicious and like I said earlier it didn't blew my taste buds away.  I may give them a second chance but will definitely ask them about the wait before placing an order cuz I definitely don't have that much patience for a burger."}
{"text":"We had the #1 Wolfman Steak Sandwich.  The place is pretty new and clean.  We took our sandwich to-go however it was finished before we had gotten to the next block.  It smelled to good to wait until we got home.  The bun was super soft and fresh.  It could had been toasted a bit more.  Steak was cooked very good (not over done) and very juicy.  The pickle added a great flavour along with the top gun sauce.  Prices are good for the quality and the amount of food that you get.  Looks like a great patio, so we will probably be back when the weather is nicer."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. I've actually dined at Top Gun Steak and sandwich place about half a dozen times since last Spring. As their name suggests, many of the sandwiches are named after the movie of the same name.   I've tried the Wolfman (6oz. beef, top gun sauce, grilled onions, lettuce; $7.50) and the Chipper (similar to the Wolfman except it comes with cheddar cheese and a pickle; $8.50). Both are delicious, with the Chipper being my fave (who doesn't love melted gooey cheese?) My friend always orders the Cheerful, which includes 6oz of steak, Brie cheese, mushrooms, green and red peppers, top gun sauce, lettuce, tomatoes and pickles ($9.50). These were served on a sesame seed bun.  One thing I noticed on my most recent visit was that the sandwiches that once featured thinly sliced beef now appear more like a burger. Same juicy flavourful meat but texture is different between a philly style steak sandwich and a beef patty. I have a preference for their philly style beef as that to me sets them apart from being just another burger place. If I wanted a burger I could walk down Augusta Avenue and head to their sister shop, Top Gun Burger.  The food is affordable (most menu items less than $12) and leaves you feeling like you've had a warm meat hug (to quote a friend of mine). Their fries are pretty good too. There are maybe about 20 seats in the restaurant but during the summer we sit out on the patio to observe the unique sights and sounds of Kensington market.   Despite being a little disappointed in the change to beef patty-style meat, I will be back as friends and I appreciate we can get a quick, inexpensive and satisfying lunch.  (34/100)"}
{"text":"Visited with a couple of girlfriends for a quick bite before our girls night out.  We were initially confused about the ordering process, thinking that the server would come to us however you are supposed to go to the counter and place your order there. Whoops!  I opted for the Falcon burger (portobello mushoom stuffed with cheddar and cream cheese rosemary garlic aioli) with fries and really enjoyed my meal.  My friends also seemed to enjoy their food as well. Would return when in the area!"}
{"text":"Okay straight off with a name that has 'steak' in it you'd expect a whole piece of meat which wasn't exactly the case. What they serve is a coarse ground chunky 6 ounce burger made from rib eye or sirloin cuts.  Overall it's a tasty burger. Loved the homemade chilly pepper sauce. The  fries are thin cut and crispy, which I like. Everything was nicely seasoned. Service was friendly and accommodating.   3 1/2 stars because I really was craving for a whole piece of meat rather than ground chuck."}
{"text":"The best burgers!! The one with the fried chicken is the BEST! The only reason I didn't give it the 5th star is because the buns could be better. Otherwise have been coming here again and again for about 2 years. The place is small and if it's cold outside don't sit by the door. The poutine is pretty good...love the gravy it's dark and thicker...mmmmmm."}
{"text":"Really good quality burgers here. Enjoyed them and they were very filling.  But with so many burger joints popping up in the city I didn't find that this one stood out."}
{"text":"Had heard many great things about this place so decided to try it out whilst in TO. It's located near Kensington Market alongside many hip and various cultural eateries. We were immediately greeted very warmly by the owner/worker Mustafa and Mohammad... both extremely friendly and helpful.  Everything sounds amazing in the menu and so I had difficulty choosing. Finally we decided on 'The Freedom Fighter' burger for myself, 'Black Eagle Steak' sandwich for the hubs and Chilli cheese fries. The meal literally blew us both away! Everything was presented well and looked irresistible... the fries were handcut with the skin (my fav) drenched in a delicious meaty chilli! The quality of the meats were amazing and all the ingredients were locally sourced and very fresh. Even the salad inside the burger had a unique crisp to it. This truly was a very 'gourmet' burger and sandwich. The handmade burger patty was the best I have ever tasted and I even tried the meats in my husbands sandwich- that consisted of delicious steak pieces, buffalo chicken strips, pulled maple bbq glazed lamb... ahhhh every piece just melted in your mouth and tasted heavenly!  Even the toppings such as jalapenos stuffed with cream cheese and the selection of cheese used such as swiss and havarati were all unlike any burger or sandwich I have ever had in my life! These guys are truly creating food masterpieces and you can see the passion and dedication that they put into these creations as they present it with a smile and asked us many times how we found the meal.  I was truly very impressed and will definitely be recommending the place to everyone I know! Keep up the great work :)"}

{"text":"Surprisingly, I didn't intend to come to Top Gun, I had my sights set on another burger place, but when they decided that they weren't going to serve any more customers even though they were still 15 mins from closing time... I was forced to find another option.  Luckily when walking through Kensington, there seems to be plenty of choices.  I was really looking for a burger and walked past this place and then thought, that could be a decent burger joint.  So I turned back around...  Walking into the place it isn't much, a bunch of tables lined up along the sides with a few benches here and there.  Ordering is dead simple, grab a menu and choose from the 20 or so different combinations of burgers (beef, lamb, chicken).  Then order your fries.  On the back side of the menu is a Sandwich menu.  But I wanted a burger.  Ordered a \"Combo\" even though it's not on the menu, basically for $5 extra you get fries and a drink.  The gal has having internet issues so she couldn't initially take my credit card to pay... then she just did the swipe.  She put the exact amount in and had me sign.  No Tip.  I wasn't carrying cash, so there was no opportunity for tipping.  I was given my order # and then I took up a seat.    There were a few tables that were in need of clean up, but there were still quite a few open spaces.  The sign on the outside said they close @ 9p, but well after 9 and they are still serving people (unlike the other place I went to ::cough::nator).  My order was fairly quick to come out and the burger looked delish and the fries were fresh out of the fryer.    One bite into that burger and it was a winner !  Good Job Top Gun ! The bun was an egg bread bun.  It doesn't hold up as well, but much better tasting than those of the regular bread buns.   Fries were shoestring style (not my fave) but they were still really good.  As I was eating more and more people were piling in and by the time I left there were very few seats left open.    Overall, Great tasting burgers, and fries, and love the egg bun too.  The place was a bit messy, and a few tables needed to be cleaned up.  But really this was the only fault of the place.  I think I found a new burger joint that I want to keep going to !!"}
{"text":"Fresh, flavourful burgers! I don't remember exactly the name of my burger but it comes with a fabulous crispy layer of onion rings on top of its well-cooked juicy beef! Another one that my partner ordered was creative too, a layer of beef bacon on top! The pleasant sound of having these crispy parts under teeth doubles the pleasure of eating!  The price was very reasonable and the staff were friendly and accommodating.  Unlike some other reviewers here, we did not have a long waiting time; our order was ready in 15-20 minutes."}
{"text":"Heard this opened up recently, so I decided to check it out for lunch. They have some seriously great sandwiches here. I tried their Goose, with a generous portion of chicken combined with havarti, guac, chipotle mayo, and jalapeno peppers, and it was both delicious and filling! Their steak sandwiches sound (and look) even better, so I'll have to come back sometime to try those, but definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"The poutine was amazing although a bit small portion wise.  The fries were very crispy, the cheese curds were melted and the gravy was great. I got the starfighter  with the cheese stuffed mushroom similar to the option at burger priest which I prefer more. Overall the burger was quite bland. My friends enjoyed the poutine but thought their burgers were okay too."}
{"text":"The steak sandwich (Eagle) was pretty good, but the beef chilli cheese fries were a huge disappointment."}
{"text":"Heard a lot about this place so finally made the trip to Kensington market. Service is good. Burgers are made fresh so it takes a while (10-15 minutes). Poutine is full of flavour and doesnt let you down. Burgers are great too."}
{"text":"EDIT :   UPDATING my review from poor to excellent.  After my following review I received a message from the owner, he offered his apology and sincerely asked for another visit and a gift certificate.  We went in there last night, and we got what we used to at this place, awesome , wholesome food in a family friendly environment.  Everything turn out to be amazing. Thank you Ibrahim and Muhammad for your hospitality.  You have won us back as your loyal customers.   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- HORRIBLE Experience. Went in Feb 14, because Bergernator was closed early, We order Goose, Bollywood and Topgun, First off the guy taking orders was in the rush for no reason, there was only one other table occupied. Goose was ok, properly done, nothing special though. Other two were uncooked from the middle, almost 60% of meat was RED and PINK. When complained they changed the burgers but it was still uncooked. All the time the two asian guys working were bickering, swearing and fighting with each other. WILL NEVER GO BACK AGAIN"}
{"text":"Food is okay, but not worth the price. Service needs to improve, especially the cashier, very impolite."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday around 12:30pm. The place was dead and the workers were in the back preppy food. When he finally came out to take my order, he seem a bit confused when I was ordering. Don't know why though cause you should be use to the menu so I was a little skeptical about this place. I ordered the B52, cheese fries and a coke, which sounds pretty simple to me.   From the time I order till the time it was ready, it took a good 15 mins. But I guess thats cause I was probably their first customer and they had to make everything fresh. When I got my and took and look I was quite shock at the size of the sandwich. This sandwich was HUGE and is best if you split it between someone. They did not cheap out on the meat, toppings or sauce cause there are places that give you hardly any meat. The meat had tons of flavour and not just plain beef taste and the toppings did help. However, I guess that since it was freshly made, I did find it to be a bit oily to my liking. But you want some greasy food to cure your hangover, I would come here. The cheese fries though were just okay....it was sprinkled with warm cheese. I was expecting like a warm gooey cheese whiz kind of cheese. If you order the cheese fries, I would recommend eating it quick.   Overall, this place surprised me when I had little expectation going here. Even though I did order just 3 items, the bill came up to be around $23....kind of expensive but totally worth it. I will definitely come back here in the future."}
{"text":"Sadly, my second visit to top Gun steak and burger was APPALLING!!! I placed an order online only to show up and to be told \" we have no trace of this order !\" I figured this was just a mishap even though they offered no apology or empathy. I was told I had  to replace  the order and was told to wait 15 -20 min. Although I didn't mind the wait , I felt as though the employee could have been a little more polite and sympathetic.  As I sat and waited for the order, one of the \"cooks\" who was not wearing a hat or a hair net wiped the sweat off his forehead and proceeded to continue to make my food. When I questioned the restaurants  hygiene practices, the employee became defensive and said \"he is not the one making your food !\". Another off duty employee sitting on the bench in front of kitchen then proceed to laugh at me . When I told him that was rude he said \" I finished work already ! \" When I asked for the names of the employees and pointed out the unprofessionalism of the employees, the cook left the kitchen to approach me he puffed up his chest and said \"You will not get my name or the name of my friends !\" REALLY ??????? To add insult to injury, I was missing part of my order! What kind of business treats customers in such an unacceptable manner ? This place will NEVER get my business again !!!!"}
{"text":"Small family run halal burger place that definitely does not skimp! The patties are thick and very meaty, and they offer gourmet toppings like breaded cheese stuffed mushroom caps. The small size options of fries and onion rings are very generous. The bun is soft and soaks up all the juices without being soggy even till the last bite of the huge burger. The place is always packed!  Plenty of seats on a patio that is great for people watching, with nice jazz and Latin music from the shops across the street. Inside is a bit dark and industrial looking, but keeps within the top gun theme of the joint. Very reasonably priced for the quality."}
{"text":"Amazing foood. I had the steak with the pulled lamb with Havarti cheese..incredible..but has lots of fat in the meat"}
{"text":"I am visiting from Detroit, Michigan and can I just say this was the best burger I've ever had! Very nicely seasoned patty and the fresh cut fries were amaze balls!"}
{"text":"The owner was very welcoming, greeted us at the door. The food tasted exceptional.  The quality of the meat was great. Wide selection and a lot of things to choose from. I had the chicken burger it was amazing."}
{"text":"Great burger, had the Tornado #17. Was amazing, really good. Will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"I heard lots about Topgun Steak how great the food was. I went to Topgun Steak to try myself, the food was great..  I think you all should try it.. Every bit I took it. It was breath taking. Even my friends like it."}
{"text":"A essayer ce fast food par hasard et je ne le regrette pas car leurs burgers sont tous simplement exceptionnels. Pour 14$ burger et canette. Le choix est conséquent et leurs recettes originales. J'ai testé un burger à l'agneau et uf, il était goûteux. Même le pain du burger est de qualité. Les frites également sont très bonnes, vrai flux de patates sans être trop huileuse. Je reviendrais vite"}
{"text":"No words need. One of the best burger place in Toronto. It's not easy to take a seat there so it would be easier to take food out. However, they just put food in a bag with no ketchup and paper tissues. That's the only negative point"}
{"text":"Had a fantastic steak sandwich here. It was the perfect combination between tasty and fresh, the guys behind the counter were real nice and overall I loved the vibe. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"It was really good. Prices were reasonable. The meat was very tender and well flavored. I was not a big fan of the bun they used. My family didn't enjoy the beef bacon that came on the burger but I did. I love that the burger was not messy or greasy because it felt homemade."}
{"text":"Grabbed a quick sandwich while walking around. The service was good and the sandwich tasty. I thought it was a little pricey, paid $18 for a sandwich but added mushroom. While they were pricey they we very worth it, plump portobello! The restaurant is dark but feels like a steak shop, lots of options a fixings!"}
{"text":"This is a really good halal option for a nice juicy steak burger."}
{"text":"First off the place looks good and the cashier i had was really polite and it gives that family-ran restaurant feel that we all want because it feels like home. I got the firefly burger with fries and i gotta love their buns with the thick patty it came with it. If i have any complains, it would be the fries. It felt like it was store bought fries judging by the slices but other than that, i would recommend the place for someone looking for a place to eat when in Kensington"}
{"text":"Being around downtown toronto i had bookmarked top gun steak .. It was now or never .. Decided to walk there, it was a bit of a scary walk and the neighborhood didnt look very safe but lets get to the real deal ! I was welcomed by Mustafa n Mohammed at the restaurant with a great smile and great hospitality! My better half and I didnt know from where to start and what to order !   My dilema was between the destroyer (allot of meat) the Hawk (main feature : pulled lamb) and Black Eagle (main feature: 5 buffalo chicken), i asked if by any chance they can acomodate by putting 2-3 buffalo chicken and some pulled lamb so I can try both and satisfy my cravings.. Allot of restaurants in general refuse such requests but surprisingly they both agreed and told me they will take care of it and ill love it :) i was so happy :)   We ordered as a side some chili fries, we expected fries sprinkled with chili powder and some cheese but it ended up beeing the \"mexican type chili, with ground beef beans and cheese\" way more heavy than expected but it was tasty :)  Keep up the great customer service skills and quality of the food   Cheers !"}
{"text":"Awesome juicy burgers! The meat is perfectly cooked. Quick service. Food is always consistent. My only tiny problem were the buns. I wish they were a bit less soft so they wouldn't absorb all the hamburger juice and become soggy before I finish my burger."}
{"text":"I had stomach issue after having their \"bobcat\" burger with fries. I was in the washroom for hours. My boyfriend did not feel well after either. We are not normally sensitive to food. aside from that the service is okay."}
{"text":"Great food and service. The space and seating is tight but thankfully it wasn't full when I went. Very causal with no servers. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"After walking around in the Kensington District we decided on this place.  One because it was newer than a lot of the establishments, plenty of seating and had air conditioning. You order at the counter and they bring your meal to you. We split #4 the Bearcat and poutine fries.   Burger was quite messy.  Had to fork and knife it but oh so much flavor. This was my first time eating poutine fries  and won't be my last.  A very calorie indulgent meal but all worth it."}
{"text":"You can tell the quality of meat is really good here. The staff is very attentive to what their customers want. I really liked the service here and how personable the staff was.   I loved the sweet potato fries. Very addictive especially with the sauce, mayo.  The beef sandwich was huge! The portion was really really big so I definitely did not finish it all. It was really good, like I said quality of meat is great. It could've used a bit more sauce though. I asked for the deep fries mozzarella on cheese lol but I shouldn't have because it was already filling on it's own!   Overall, I'd go back to try some more of their sandwiches and burgers :)"}
{"text":"Not usually a fan of really messy sandwiches but when its beautiful strips of steak falling out its great. Huge sandwich with tons of meat and toppings. Nice variety too. Will definitely be a regular here."}
{"text":"As an american wandering around Toronto i was happy to see a cheesesteak place waiting for me when I got to kensington market. Being from San Diego, where a lot of Top Gun was made, it was awesome to see the theme of this place. Usually cheesesteak places have pretty simple menus, but not here. I dont think there is anything you can't get on the sandwich. I went with a standard cheesesteak and sadly it just wasn't that good. Someone might want to take a trip down to Philly and see how the steak sandwiches are supposed to taste."}
{"text":"so i'm walking along the streets of Kensington market, and i see this guy holding a GIGANTIC hamburger, i'm thinking i got to get one of those. I check yelp of course for burger places and this place has 4.5 stars so i try it. This was definitely not the place where he got the burger. These burgers were Tiny. I got the #9 flying zone i think it was called with the chicken, very yummy. one burger and fries and a bottle of water cost me $20.36. I got the fries with all the veggies on ti and it was yummy too. Honestly there are better i probably won't be coming back, but who knows they do have a BIG menu, maybe to try something different. The steak sandwiches coming out looking big."}
{"text":"Friend and I decided to try this place. You walk in, get seated and given a menu, then you order up at the front. I decided to order the Bobcat burger plus medium fries. This came out to about $13. My friend ordered B52 and medium fries as well, and hers came up to about $20 or so.   The service took a while, but the food was amazing. Burger patty was great, and the fries were the perfect crisp. The burger buns were not that special though; the buns got saggy due to the moistness of the patty.   Also note, I don't think they give any complementary drinks unless you order it, since I remember just asking for water but I never got my water. From what I saw, however, you can bring your own drinks?"}
{"text":"Mohammad!!!! Amazing chief and gentleman. I had a great experience! Best burger in Toronto also Kal you guys are the best. I Will be back"}
{"text":"This place is everything I expected and more. I went in with high expectations when I saw google had a 4.6 rating from almost a 1000 reviews and it did not disappoint. My fellow foodie nephew eats halal only which makes finding burger joints downtown for him a tricky matter; so when I came across Top Gun at Kensington market, I had it ear marked. We had the Avenger burger, B52 sandwich and shared the Beef Chilli Cheese Fries. Portions are more than generous so if you aren't particularly hungry, you can easily split a burger and poutine between two. The philly cheese steak style subs are easily shareable between two (even three if you are getting other stuff to share and try). I can see myself ravage an entire B52 sub myself if I am famished so the portion size is not a issue for me (you can always take out the left overs, they have containers, so no biggie). This philly cheese steak IS the next best to the one I had in Philadelphia, so you could visit just for that. For my vegetarian friends, they have a Portobello patty stuffed with mozzarella or cheddar (à la the Option at Burger Priest) so you are set here. We went for dinner Sunday night and even then this place was pretty full, so I say call ahead if you are a bigger group. All in all, 5 star experience for me.  I will come back here for the Vegetarian burger for sure."}
{"text":"Just tried Top Gun today for the first time this year - they made a lot of changes (for the worse!!)  First of all they increased their prices by as much as 50%... what's the deal here? The burgers are nearly the same as before - which used to be good but are now way too salty.  Customer service also took a huge fall. They tried to tell me I had to order a combo to claim the student discount (only 5%), but when I saw the person in front of me get the discount without a combo. Then she said there is a minimum order price to get the deal. I then asked what the minimum was and she had no response. Eventually she reluctantly gave me the 5% off - was it really worth trying to argue for 50 cents? Disappointing.   I will not be eating here again unless some major changes are made. Bring back the Top Gun of before - this new place is hardly even worth 1 star."}
{"text":"Top Gun Steak serves good tasting burgers as I discovered on a recent stroll through Kensington Market. I'm around here often and have always been curious about this place, especially since there is a 'Top Gun Burgers' just a few steps south on the same side of the street. For whatever reason, I didn't try them out until now. I'm glad I did. For just $10 I was very satisfied. The everyday special includes a soft drink and fries.  The gentlemen were just opening the shop and were pretty friendly, making conversation with me and cleaning up all of the tables. The cheesesteak doesn't quite look or taste the way I was expecting, but it's still pretty good. I can only describe it as chunks of ground beef with a tangy sauce on top of it. I'll definitely be sampling some of the other offerings here. They're a solid, reliable place to grab a meal under $15."}
{"text":"Ordered the Flying Zone, beef burger with three chicken strips. It was pretty good, patty was juicy, chicken was great. It's a big burger with a tasty bun and their sauce is great as well. Fries are sub par, same with the onion rings. Inside is quite small like most burger places in Kensington Market. Top Gun is pretty similar to Burgernator from what I remember. Not the worst burger I've had, but not the best either. Would go again to try a different burger and steak, the menu is very interesting."}
{"text":"Holy crap so good. I've been there twice in two weeks getting food to go. You go in, order a cheeseburger special, and for $10 including a tip you get an amazing burger, amazing fries, and a pop. You can stand there and watch them take a ball of fresh ground beef and squash it into a patty.   The fries are the thick cut skin on kind that are slightly soft and have exactly the right amount of salt. The burger toppings have been fresh and crunchy both times. The first time it was a soft egg bread type bun and wrapped in paper, but the second time it was a normal bun in Styrofoam, which was a little disappointing but not a deal breaker. Both times the fries transported me to my favourite food truck from undergrad, and the burger was definitely sit down restaurant quality for fast food chain price. And it seems to be run by a family, which I super love. Will definitely keep going."}
{"text":"Well the steak was not quite what I was expecting.  I thought it would be philly cheese-steak style, which it was not.  There's also different sauces, but how did I know that. Given they are listed under the drink section for god's sake!   Move them under where you list your steaks.  And no one asked what sauce I wanted either, I would have tried the garlic sauce....sigh.  What no one is talking about is the AWESOME onion rings.  SERIOUSLY amazing.  And frankly, rings are becoming an extinct species.  Look around, how many rings do you see in restaurants?"}
{"text":"Very good burgers... actually pretty damn amazing. Even the kids burger had the best tasting beef I've ever had. Definitely a place worth stopping by when you're in the area. My boyfriend had the destroyer... 4 huge parties stuffed in between a grilled geese sandwich. I had the Take my breath away burger... burger w a big mozzarella cheese stick on top. We're thinking about coming back later to try the cheese steak."}
{"text":"I'll be honest, the only reason we even ventured into Top Gun was because for whatever reason, there is a veritable lack of seating inside* the cafes of Kensington Market. When you're COLD AF to the point where walking a quarter of a mile toward Dundas seems impossible, you'll take what you can get as long as you can rest your weary, hungry, freezing bones. Being in the multicultural city of Toronto, we were on a quest for a more exciting culinary destination.   We were pleasantly surprised by our experience here! We ordered a plate of poutine to split and a burger. It was the best burger I've tried in ages. The meat was juicy and absolutely delicious. The poutine was perfect.   *Notice I said \"inside,\" because it seemed to be the norm for people to eat their meals while sitting outside with the freezing wind for company. I'm from MI so I'm no stranger to the cold but does anyone else think that's crazy? Lol"}
{"text":"4 out of 5 Hey, Need lunch, so I was debating btw TG steak or burger. Decided with the burger. Ordered the  burger with a runny egg on top(forgot the name)and poutine. Wanted it with grilled cheese but couldnt combine. Overall, thumbs up on the joint and good eats.  Would recommend and will be trying TG steak soons.  Cheers, Happy Nom-ming!!"}
{"text":"Really good burger. Burger #11, Take My Breath Away. It was better than burger priest. Juicy patty filled with guacamole, pico de gallo, and cheese."}
{"text":"This pace was absolutely incredible! The staff was so welcoming and sweet and the food was just as great! I would suggest to bring a big appetite with you because in my case my eyes were bigger than my stomach (probably from sampling my boyfriends meal too). The neighborhood is one of my favorite places in Toronto so much to explore and admire. I will definitely be back many times to come!!"}
