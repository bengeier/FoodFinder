{"text":"Best tacos and tortas I've had in the Charlotte area. Don't let the gas station location trick you. The food is excellent."}
{"text":"Great Mexican street tacos - 4 for 6 bucks.  I usually get 1 chicken (pollo), 1 beef (asada) and 2 al pastor.  They come with green and red hot sauces - green is mild, red is usually flaming hot.

Don't be put off by a taqueria inside a gas station convenience store.

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"A favorite to grab a quick lunch of great Mexican street food. Tacos and burritos are two of my favorites and are consistently excellent. A bonus is their sauces served on the side that are full of flavor and spicy!"}
