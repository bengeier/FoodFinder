{"text":"I'm sorry to say that Zorba's is simply not the same... food is not special anymore.  It is confusing to just be in there."}
{"text":"I can't believe I walked past this place for three years.  What is more sad is that many of those times were likely while I walked into Subway across the street on a Tuesday afternoon to drop $5 on a Veggie Delight.  Little did I know I could get a delicious, warm, and fresh vegetable hummus pita across the street for a little over a dollar.  At least I have many more Tuesdays ahead to take advantage!"}
{"text":"One word.  Disappointed.  Good looking interior, and even had some of the old tables from the original Zorbas.  I ordered my food and waited to pay.  The cashier left to take orders, and the line started backing up.  The fifteen minute wait time would be forgivable if the fries weren't old, overcooked, and the portions of meat, small.  There was literally 30-40 people crammed into this place ordering food and still got bad french fries...  Green St. never really had good quality food, but there is a disturbing trend of places like Beef Stand and Sliders charging EXPENSIVE prices for college students and making subpar food.   Nero's on university charges about the same price for what I got, and their fries are fresh and hot, give you huge portions on gyro meat and have it cooked well.  The only thing I paid for was the convenience of eating on Green St.    As a college student, and someone who works summers and breaks to pay for food during the year, I'm looking for a DEAL or at the very least, willing to pay the price for good food.  All I got was something overpriced and meh."}
{"text":"I was very skeptical on going to Zorba's under new ownership. I have to say everything was wonderful! The mushrooms were the best I have ever had there and the Gyro had the same great taste it always has. I'm so glad that the new owner has kept everything the same. Nice to know I didn't lose a hometown favorite!"}
{"text":"good ole z-bots as we liked to call this one back in the day.  yes, this place is an institution...been around since green and wright was just spaceport, garcias, and mcdonalds.  hasnt changed much cept that now i can drink the beer.  wonder if they will still accept my stamp card from way back."}
{"text":"A Champaign Institution, great gyros, with even better service.  Definitely a can't miss when you are on Illinois' campus.  Check their daily specials before you go in some of them are great.  The fact that you can order a small, medium. or large gyro and customize it however you want make it good for any size appetite."}
{"text":"Zorba's has the best gyros, hands-down. I grew up in Champaign and this was a favorite stomping ground! Having lived all over the US now, I have never found a better gyro anywhere, and have even been known to drive from whatever corner of the US (currently CO :) I'm in just to get Zorba's for the weekend. So glad that they rebuilt!! Coming back in July, Zorba's!!"}
{"text":"so greasy it burned the fuck down ! i am sure each gyro and basket of fries i ate there each knocked 6 months off of my lifespan. All I can say is I;m still alive so I obviously didn't eat there enough"}
{"text":"I was in college in the 90s and used to go Zorba's all the time. Then I continued to return to campus annually, and would always go to Zorba's for gyros. The food is always nothing short of excellent. On our last trip, even my kids asked to go two days in a row. Plus the service of course. It is run by a family that  carries on the tradition of a local family style joint with a loyalty to the campus town. It is a staple, and a local landmark. Long live!"}
{"text":"The joint that launched my love affair with the gyro. Their tzatziki sauce is still my favorite, and the chili is delicious."}
{"text":"Not a gyro expert but this was the most tender gyro I've ever had. Didn't know a gyro could achieve the melt in your mouth consistency. I usually am hungover when i eat gyros, but I was not hung over when I ate this. I almost want to binge drink so I can eat here the next day. Good stuff."}
{"text":"Had some before the fire, had some after the fire. Still amazingly delicious gyros. Zorba's is the only place I've had a gyros where the meat is not only tasty but doesn't have the texture of cardboard."}
{"text":"I am going to be the dissenting voice on this place, but I don't think it isn very good.  Everything it does, Niro's Gyros does both better and cheaper.  I honestly think Zorba's has kind of a privileged place due to nostalgia - it is an institution and one of the few places on Green Street that hasn't changed in the last decade (and beyond).  So maybe I am not the target audience.  But the thing is, I love gyros!  They're greasy enough that I don't get them too often, but I do love them.  This brings us to the main problem: Zorba's gyros are not very good.  I have been used to the gyros in my hometown (gigantic), the ones in Naperville (huge), and the ones from Niro's (also huge).  The ones at Zorba's are comparatively small.  This is not a deal-breaker - I don't need the mountains of meat all the time.  The problem is that the meat is not very good.  It has kind of a gritty texture and an off flavor.  It reminds me of the frozen gyro meat you can get at grocery stores.  They offer an array of sauces, but the tzatziki is key and it's not very good either.    I see rave reviews of the fries, and while they are good, they aren't exceptional.  Even on a discount day, the fry and gyro meal is more than other places in town and I just did not like it as much.  I thought the first time might've been an unfair representation, but on the next visit I could not finish the gyro - the texture of the meat got to me.    Decor is old-fashioned as fits a local institution.  There is sort of a grease-haze that hangs in the air."}
{"text":"My goto spot in Champaign. Great gyros, awesome Jerusalem salad! I'm so happy they re-opened after the fire. I've been a customer for 30 years"}
{"text":"Ah Zorba's, makes me feel young again.  I frequented this place all the time when I was a student at UofI.  YUM their gyros are some of the best.  I like that they have different sizes of gyros.  Definitely get the fried mushrooms, you won't be disapointed.  Pass on the spinach pie though, it's not very good.  They aren't the cheapest if you're a poor student, it can add up if you get fries and mushrooms and everything.  Cheap beers.  They used to have free jazz on Tuesdays, I think, not sure if they still do.  YUM their cucumber sauce is awesome. They also have a wonderful honey dijon for the chicken gyros.  My bf sometimes has to go down to UofI for career fairs, I always make him to go Zorbas and get me a gyro with extra cucumber sauce.  I will eat it 3 hours later and cold, and it's still delicious.  They call out your name when your order is ready, my friends and I would give them funny names like Shaft and one time I was Captain, and my friend was Tennille, but they called Tennille first, that blew."}
{"text":"I have been here multiple times and it is truly the best place for food on Green Street. I have gone with the gyros both times and have not been disappointed. The food is delicious and the prices are very reasonable. On top of it, the atmosphere gives you a feel to what our culture at U of I is like. Pass up the chains and go to Zorba's. Take it from an ILLINI - you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Every now and then I gotta have a gyro at Zorba's! Just as delicious now as it was in the early 80's when I was in college here. Of all the places on campus that have come and gone, I'm happy that Zorba's has endured."}
{"text":"Love the food at atmosphere.  And they keep that line moving.  Fries are something special and if you get the combo you get a small enough portion so satisfy your fryer need.  They don't have beer anymore which has helped university productivity."}
{"text":"It's pretty good. Nothing too special; I normally get the grilled chicken sandwich, which has been dry a few too many times for my taste. It's also a bit expensive compared to some of the other Campustown locations, but a nice change of pace every once in a while. I'm never unhappy at Zorba's.   I will say that I wish the place hadn't caught fire- the memorabilia collection they have is nice, and I would have loved to see the old one."}
{"text":"The food is bland and average. Also got yelled at by staff for hanging around too long even though I was still eating fries and the place was empty (they didn't like that I had my laptop out). Overall just not really worth it when there's mashawi almost next door."}
{"text":"Yum!! Pork & chicken souvlakis are super moist. Gyros is a little dry but nothing a little tzaziki can't fix. Portions are good. Flavour is awesome!"}
{"text":"No better place in C-U for a gyros.  This place has always been a favorite of mine.  I'm so glad they came back after the fire, better than ever.  I especially like that they offer a small size of their gyros sandwich.  They have excellent fries as well.  Service is always fast and friendly.  Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Definitely some of the best falafel I've eaten. This is a great place to go for lunch or a casual, light dinner.  The employees are friendly, the location is convenient, and the prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"A great place for gryos, their cucumber sauce is the best! I also like that they have different sizes of gyros so you can choose based on how hungry you are."}
{"text":"Just sayin there are NO places serving Tzatziki like this place. The owner was there to tell me that its homemade and he has hopes of bottling it and I hope he does as I will def. buy some more next time I'm back visiting.    Sure, Niros Gyros exists, but this place has the closest truly authentic Greek food experience in town. Note, only 2 places in town to get Tzatziki.    Get your Gyros, greek salad n friendly service at this place. And fries, if that is your jam.   But FYI, the owner is looking to sell :( and while I am tempted to move back, the service from Millennials is dicey at best and I would be a bitch of a boss.  But I'm happy to see that the owner has the patience to manage this plucky group of staffers and get them on board to make this place worth a repeat dine-in visit.  Notice that it's worth the price compared to the corporate sandwiches and burgers that surround it, besides Murphys, which has the dumbest staff, but is also a mainstay on Green.   And NO ONE else sells Gyros for your hangover on Green St besides Zorba's."}
{"text":"Came back after many years. I had the large gyros with everything. It was good, but not as good as I remembered.   Most of the staff was good, but the lady who took our order was curt.   I'd come back."}
{"text":"Zorba's has been the only place in town to get a chicken gyro and my mouth just waters every time I think about it.  Though the restaurant was damaged in a fire many years back, the restaurant still maintains its vintage vibe. From the classic rock that plays from the speakers to the vintage style artwork on the walls and tables, it feels like you've traveled back to the 1970s.  Their chicken gyros are to die for.  I highly recommend ordering it, especially if you haven't one before."}
{"text":"Cool place for lunch on campus... It's right next door to Za's, where I've going a bit too often, so I'm glad I finally gave it a try. They're specialty is gyros sandwiches (on pita bread): pick your meat (lamb or chicken), size (small, medium, large), and sides (get the combo which comes with fries and a drink). I tried the chicken, and it was good, although I wish the meat had been a little more grilled (it wasn't crispy at all). Their fries are great! They also have a few other things on the menu (regular sandwiches etc), and they're open late most nights. I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"This was my favorite place to get Gyros in town. Despite the heated debate over who had the best gyros (Zorba's vs. Niro's Gyros), I always sided with Zorba's, the 'fixins' added to the gyro (tomato, onions and whatever else you wanted) were always fresh and great quality, something that NIro's seemed to lack on more than one occasion.  Zorba's had daily specials (like Groovy Tuesdays: one dollar off classic gyro meals) which kept me coming back every Tuesday I attended classes at the University of Illinois.   However, on Wednesday March 23, 2011 Zorba's was affected by the fire that started in the apartments above the business. As of now, I don't know when, if ever they'll re-open their shop on Green St. But here's to hoping!"}
{"text":"Welcome back Zorbas! Green Street didn't feel the same without you since you burned down.  Zorba's new space is much more roomy with the cashier on the right and near the back, directly opposite from where it was located before. Although the ambiance is much improved, my gyro lacked taste. Sure it had all of the fixings without me asking: yogurt sauce, cucumber, tomato, onion...but the meat was bland.  My expectations for food quality are high even though this restaurant is located in the midst of collegiate-drunken-food-ville where food in this area is generally bland."}
{"text":"The gyro's are amazing! They also have mac and cheese balls and fries that are pretty good. Hooked usually has a pretty good deal going on so check that before you stop by!"}
{"text":"Tasty, reasonably priced food. I always love seeing the chalk designs they have outside their entrance. The service is fast and the staff are all very nice. One time I went there and sat in the outdoor seating with my dog while a friend ordered for me, and the staff brought a bowl of water out for her to drink from under the table."}
{"text":"My friend introduced me to Zorba's, I love their special, it keeps me awake at night, drooling for it...  Fries are good as well, overall great experience."}
{"text":"I am incredibly sad that I did not discover this place until my fourth semester at the University of Illinois. I made something of a ritual out of going there every Tuesday for their reduced vegee gyros and fries, and always left satisfied. They have incredibly fast service, the place is always clean, and I *love* all the sauce choices! The salad always came fresh and crisp with the dressing automatically on the side, which was great too. I think the world could definitely use more Zorba's locations..until then, I'll have to make sure to swing by every time I head back to the U-C."}
{"text":"They serve average store bought food. When asked if they make anything in the restaurant, the answer was NO!! Staff is not friendly. Also, most places serve halal gyros and shawarma as it's easily available at Restaurant Depot but here nothing is halal."}
{"text":"What a disappointment. Chicken souvlaki very small and dry, rice watery and potatoes dry. This place could learn a thing or too about good Greek food."}
{"text":"This restaurant's customer service sucks. We ordered through EatStreet and an hour and a half later, we call Zorba's to find out that not only did they not put our order through, but they lied about having even gotten the order request. We had called EatStreet and they confirmed that the order was sent and accepted by Zorba's (because otherwise, we would not have received a confirmation email for our order). They refuse to accept responsibility for forgetting our order and did nothing to rectify the situation."}
{"text":"great place for weekly jazz music, amazing gyro sauce and falafel and hummus and fries and imported beer. when i ate meat the gyros were very good too! service is always friendly and the ambience is nice: i dig the high ceilings with its detailed patterns. i miss this place wish there was one in chicago."}
{"text":"Reliably decent gyros, although I haven't seen much else that's very exciting about the place as of yet.  It does have its location going for it, though."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant right around the university.  Phenomenal gyros. I'd say I still hold Zorba's as the golden standard of gyros.   I was there every Tuesday in college for Groovy Tuesday - $1 off gyros - and i was probably there at least one other meal each week. Quick, cheap, delicious. Can't get better than that.  I have a gyro or two every time I'm back in Champaign.  Everyone should eat more Zorba's!!"}
{"text":"Matt and his gang do a great job. Love the chicken Gyros."}
{"text":"I usually eat healthy, well-balanced meals.  However, I occasionally indulge with something less health-friendly.  When I indulge, I go to Zorba's.  I order an enormous gyro with mountains of onion, tomato, cucumber sauce, and feta cheese.  A Zorba's gyro is heaven for the tastebuds.    Unfortunately, I usually get massive amounts of heartburn after eating at Zorba's, but it's totally worth it.  I've been told that Zorba's has live music some nights, but I've never actually seen it."}
{"text":"Great gyros and fries. Often crowded, so plan on a wait for food and a table.  Go on Tuesdays for discount prices."}
{"text":"I just love this place.  I've been going here for 25 years now and it's one of the few places I MUST go eat at while in Champaign.  If you're looking for a casual bite to eat and you like Gyros, this is a place you should check out!"}
{"text":"Best gyros (authentic, taste great, and affordable) on campus. This place is a U of I must-eat!"}
{"text":"Checked out this place as it's close to my work.  The place is small, but nice. Mom and Pop run place.  Food was pretty good, had the gyros dinner, was a little small for the price.  Best tzaziki i have ever had.  But the service is very slow, and they take long time clearing the tables, nothing like sitting down next to a couple of table's full of dirty dishes."}
{"text":"The best gyros I've had anywhere, which is saying something since I was born and raised in Europe, and live in Los Angeles.   The meat isn't dried up and charred like I've hat at so many other places - it's fresh, juicy, and flavorful. No bland, thin pita or cucumber sauce here. The only downside is that there aren't any Zorba's in LA, because now I'm addicted."}
{"text":"The penultimate gyros and honestly the best fries I have ever had in C-U.  I love this place so much that if I were ever on death row and had to order my last meal, it would be a medium gyros, hold the onion with a basket of fries from Zorba's!  The only negative is the pervasive lack of parking in campustown."}
{"text":"I think it says something that my friend has searched far and wide throughout all of Chicago and failed at finding another gyro place as good as Zorba's in Champaign.  Throughout my 4.5 years in Chambana, never once did I have a less than spectacular meal here. Both their chicken and original (I believe it is a mix between beef and lamb) gyros are mouth-watering. I was afraid that the lamb would have that weird gamey taste, but it only made for a more complex flavor, which I totally didn't expect.   They have a great selection of sauces that I am guilty of drowning my gyros in. Their fries are made to order and come out piping hot and are even more delectable with a dipping sauce concoction of my own (made by combining their honey mustard and cucumber sauces - must try). What I found surprising is that no one knew about their unlimited and FREE toppings list. You can get a whole assortment of other toppings on your gyro all at no charge!  Two years ago, they started catering to the drunk, after-bars crowd on Fridays and Saturdays. However, those gyros are a fraction of the size and a fraction of the goodness of their regular ones. So I'd stick to One World to fulfill that drunken craving if I were you...  *Also, I don't know if anyone else has noticed this, but I always come out of the restaurant smelling like I've dipped myself in frying oil. I'm thinking that their made to order fries has something to do with it."}
{"text":"Gyros are soooo tasty, I keep coming back for more. Price is okay and service is fast. Only complaint would be portion size for their salads...their small was much smaller than in most places, but it was yummy. Seriously try their gyros."}
{"text":"The classic chicken gyro is one of the simplest and best gyros I have ever eaten though the taste could have been more exotic. The Hooked deal of getting a meal in the cost of a gyro for take out is quite cheap and worth the price. Also I would recommend fish lovers to visit on Friday as they have some amazing deals and fish  dishes on friday."}
{"text":"Hands down the most underrated place on campus. Everything they offer is at least good, while their gyros are nothing short of amazing (for Chambana, at least). The jazz shows are a nice touch, the prices are very reasonable, and the staff is always friendly. One of my favorite places to spend a break, whether it's between classes or during work.  It doesn't offer enough food on the level of their gyros to warrant a five-star rating, but it deserves a strong four."}
{"text":"I don't know if it's my love of Zorba's or my love of gyros that's compelling me to write this review. Either way, when I'm down at U of I, I try to stop here. Zorba's has spits of chicken and lamb, as well as sauces to complement them. I've been happy with both kinds of gyros. Now, I only wish there were a Zorba's in my college town."}
{"text":"You like gyros? You like fresh fries? You like Green Street? Well, then you'll love Zorbas.    Zorbas was a staple during undergrad and it hasn't lost its taste in the years since I've left.  Regardless of where I move or visit, every gyro I have is compared to Zorbas - they're the gold standard in my mind.  The meat is always juicey and the fries always salty.  Perfect for a social lunch or a recovery meal.    Word to the wise - load that sucker up with extra meat and tzatziki sauce (or \"cucumber sauce\") for maximum flavor."}
{"text":"This is some incredibly tasty and greasy food. I walked around like a confused tourist for a moment while looking for the menu. I'm pretty indecisive so I would prefer a menu that wasn't taped to the counter where you order. Being able to peruse a bit would have been nice. Even so, I ordered a falafel with feta and jalapenos and it was fantastic. Even the fries were delicious and I'm just not a potato fan. The biggest pro - They have a tzatziki dispenser! Most places charge you for extra and considering condiments are the highlight of my meal, this was fantastic! I also thought the gyros were delicious although it is tough to mess that up I think. The price is great, you can eat here for just about $5."}
{"text":"Great restaurant! Being that I was hanging out in Everitt for most of my stay in Chambana - I got very familiar with Zorba's!  What to say about it... Service is always great. The people that work there always seem happy and treat you well. Prices are totally reasonable. I went almost every Tuesday as it was cheaper on Tuesday. Their gyros are great - though if you get a normal gyro you will be left smelling, well, like a gyro. The chicken gyro never had that effect for whatever reason. So good.  I went almost every Tuesday and I'd get a large normal gyro with a side of fries. I'd bring a textbook and study for an hour or two while enjoying my amazing food. Great place to study ( at least for me) as there was always enough noise to keep my mind from wandering - but little enough noise so that I could concentrate.  Never eat here before a test. You'll go into a food coma and not do well on your test. I learned this the hard way. The very, very hard way."}
{"text":"I've had Niro's Gyros, Downtown Dogs in Chicago and finally Zorba's. Except, this foodie adventure was full of fun because I used the Yelp Eat 24, in the comforts of my casita- laundry day. I ordered the giant gyro 8oz and I swear to you it was more of like 16oz- ohh yeeeaaah this gyro was loaded! They should call it more like Gyro: Fully Loaded. I ordered tomatoes, cucumber and cucumber sauce, as well as the falafel and French fries. Little ole' me....Now if I'd eaten all of this, surely I wouldn't be able to write a Yelp review and my jeans would shed tears. Sad. Thus saying there will be Zorba's lunch tomorrow and Zorba's snack. Now, the gyro was very standard- I did love the moist and flavorful meat but it wasn't mind blowing, secondly the falafel was very fried and a bit too crunchy for my liking. The fries were just okay. I'll say the whole order was standard and expected. However, I do like the cucumber sauce, it was super yummy and it paired well with Pepsi and the little falafels. The Eat 24 driver was amazing, fast and friendly- yet I'm an outdoors girl and ready for new adventures! Now...where am I going to put all this food???"}
{"text":"This is simply one of my favorite spots in town. They say that consistency is the hallmark of excellence. Well I've been stuffing my face with their delicious gyros and assorted fried side dishes since high school, and I've yet to eat one that wasn't just totally fulfilling and delicious.  Actually, the hallmark of excellence is probably just making really fantastic gyros, which is a thing that Zorba's is all about. The staff is always friendly, and even at their busiest you're going to get your order quickly.  My go to order has generally been the large chicken, however you can't go wrong with the classic. You can take either and pick a size to fit your small-large appetite, and then customize it from there, which is a little different, and better, than most other gyro joints I've visited. I also prefer subbing in onion rings or fried mushrooms for fries. The location is a little small, so it can get packed during the lunch hour, but even so there is usually a table open, or you can easily get your meal to go.  If you find yourself on campus and don't check this place out, you're doing yourself an enormous disservice."}
{"text":"Came here for the 1st time under the new ownership. Previously been here 10,000 before:) Food quality has suffered greatly as the fries were cold and still solid in the middle, onion rings were hard as a rock and toooo salty, gyro meat was bland. And the service was good, maybe more training would of helped as 2 different employees tried too give other people's food. Very loud rap music drowned out my own thoughts of why i came here."}
{"text":"LOVE Zorba's. I was so happy when it reopened. The remodeled place is a bit smaller than the old space and it doesn't flow well, but that is just cosmetic. The food is still fantastic and the prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Grab decent sandwiches and gyros, and enjoy live music if it's scheduled.  I was addicted as a student and still enjoy stopping in when I visit C-U, but it's a simple joint.  Right on campus near the quad."}
{"text":"The pita and meat were good, but the gyro was rather lacking in the tomatoes, onions, and sauce department. The crinkle cut fries didn't taste particularly good, it reminded me a lot of those frozen fries that you can make in the microwave. Despite going in on a Tuesday, when it's supposed to be cheaper, it still cost me $7 for a medium combo. Hardly enough food for the money, but decent if you want some greek."}
{"text":"Yep, it lived up to the hype. Great gyro sandwiches with a cool local feel. The pita is soft and the gyro meat is some of the most tender I've found. Brilliantly seasoned too, the meat is definitely what sets these gyros apart. I also liked that there are multiple size options for the sandwiches.   The place has a nice, local college hotspot feel. Not wild and crazy, but more the kind of place students stop by on their way to and from class."}
{"text":"2.5 stars. I have a feeling that at some point in the 1970s this place was serving amazing family recipe homemade gyros and built some kind of mystique. Well, now it's clearly just Kronos fast food, and they misfire on all cylinders.  The meat is barely roasted and heated through, it's supposed to be super charred. Cucumber sauce is just some yogurt. The pita isn't olive oil crispy, it's microwaved or something. You can get a sandwich like this anywhere in Chicago, prepared a lot better.  Prices are good, portions are fine for the cost, flavor is substandard to most gyros I've had elsewhere. I'd still eat junk food here over Chipotle, which is fresher but a heartless corporation, but this place is a big disappointment considering the lore that comes with it.   Find that old family recipe and get back to doing things the old fashioned way!"}
{"text":"Loved the Greek salad and gyro plate. This is a staple in  campus town for good reason. The inside displays classic Illini newspaper clippings, and the staff is kind and welcoming. Check them out if you're in the mood for a gyro."}
{"text":"This place was delicious! My roommate and I came here on default because the other place we were trying to go to was already closed! But good thing the gyros & fries here were delicious and made-to-order!  And the gyro meat tasted super fresh!  I loved how you can get extra cucumber sauce and the \"hot sauce\" obviously was mixed with the cucumber sauce...all delicious! The establishment has been open for awhile and I can see why college students would come here after partying!"}
{"text":"Mmmm... gyro.  I know that Zorba's isn't authentic Greek food-- I go to Chicago for that, but for what it is, it's excellent.  The service is always very friendly and speedy, and they have a fairly large menu and is inexpensive.  They also have Killians on tap and a fairly large bottle selection.  Zorba's is probably my favorite green street eatery."}
{"text":"Came to Zorba's on the suggestion by a cousin who has, and I quote, \"never given a bad food recommendation\".  And it was another hit!  Chicken gyros and fried mushrooms for dinner hit the spot.    At other Greek spots, I'm used to having a humongous foil wrapped hunk of a mess of gyro served to me that I inevitably finish... and end up feeling like a blob because I didn't want to waste food.  But Zorba's is here to help you with portion control!  I like how they offer their gyros in 4 different sizes.  Oh, and try the cucumber sauce.    You know you're in for a treat when it takes 9.8 seconds for the grease in your meal to seep through the bottom of the paper bag."}
{"text":"Based solely on their gyros: 5 stars.  Absolutely delicious.  Not too much sauce, succulent meat, crisp onions, tomatoes, all on fluffy, chewa pita bread.  I am wowed by the fact that you can choose your size of gyro.  I think a medium gyro (4oz) is perfect for filling you up without overwhelming your stomach.  AND, it's under $5.  Yum, yum, yum."}
{"text":"I was so happy when Zorba's opened in my neighbourhood! Their breakfast is delicious and well-priced, and their chicken souvlaki is juicy and seasoned perfectly. Best Tzaziki I have ever eaten. I definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone who loves Greek food."}
{"text":"The gyros are okay at best. They're dry and not very flavorful, even with all the toppings. The fries are decent, at least. If you're in the mood for gyros just go to Niro's. It's within walking distance and has much better food."}
{"text":"For the price, I've gotta say it's not bad. It's filling food that doesn't tastes average and is a killer for the value. But for the theme and subject of their menu, I've gotta say I've tasted better for the same price. I've always loved mediterannean food, and since it's a hit at college campuses, i've had quite a sampling in the past several ears. Zorba's is, pretty much just average. The gyro meat was not too flavorful, the pita they used was extra thick, and I was pretty impartial to the cucumber sauce they used. As a college student on a budget, this place is amazing due to their large portions, decent food, and cheap price. As someone who has moved on from the pizza/ramen diet and who is starting increasingly to value quality more than quantity, this place is just aight."}
{"text":"Good food, my only concern is with the process for weighing the meat for the Gyros. They use the same weigh machine whether you get chicken or lamb. This results in getting pieces of the other meat option mixed in with your Gyro."}
{"text":"This past weekend, my bf and I did a quick trip to Champaign, because we just needed to get out of Chicago for a couple of days.  When we parked our car and walked down Green St., there were a whole bunch of NEW restaurants compared to when I went to college years ago.  One familiar restaurant was Zorba's.  Got two med. gyros, fries, and drinks to go.  When we sat outside on the quad, we upwrapped a tightly rolled gyro.  So eating it outside on a windy day was not a problem at all!  Really good and the pita seemed fresh and light, not super greasy like the joints here in Chicago.  Don't think I'll go back to Champaign for a long time, but it's a great lunch/dinner option."}
{"text":"First time trying this place, wouldn't eat here again. They either need smaller take out containers or bigger portions - all of the containers the food came in were 1/2 empty which made me feel like the portions weren't worth the price. Some of the gyro meat was burned, the salad had a weird chemical taste like when it's not washed well, and everything was cold even though it was delivered in the estimated time frame. Overall nothing special."}
{"text":"Finally made it to the store, having always enjoyed their gyros at Taste of Champaign.  I'm sorry we waited, the food in the shop is even better!"}
{"text":"Zorba's is still my favorite gyro place of all time.  The food is delicious and they have some pretty unique sauces.  The meat is always tender and flavorful, never dry or bland.  Definitely check out the Groovy Tuesday deal = $1 off original gyros (lamb + beef mix) and half off fries.  The fries are the best I've ever had--crispy yet not too skinny, and always piping hot.  Check them out!  I always stop by for a bite when I'm back in town."}
{"text":"Not a bad lunch spot. Don't think the food is anything to write home about but will do in a pinch. Cool that they do jazz on some nights."}
{"text":"I've been back several times since the reopened. Everything is just as good as it has ever been. This is still on my must eat list when I come home for a visit. During these holiday periods, you can get in and out in under and hour if you are a quick eater like me. There are a couple TVs that play sports (from what I've seen) if you wanna relax and take in some games. Check out the daily specials. Zorba's is currently up for sale. I hope they get a buyer cause these are best gyros ever."}
{"text":"Went to Zorba' s on spring break, a tradition to avoid crowds, though it used to be busy with locals doing the same.   We were sorely disappointed with the new Zorba' s.  Everything was seemingly the same, besides getting a number instead of calling your Name, and you ask for the cucumber sauce which is fine. The problem, unfortunately was the food. My friend saw them keeping cut meat from the spits in water, to keep it warm. The result was bland gyros. What a shame.  The fries were ok, tho after the gyro, nothing was the same. Why change anything about a good successful restaurant? It was so bad I won't have a craving to go back."}
{"text":"This is where I spend 20 minutes every Tuesday night.  Good gyros, cucumber sauce, etc., and thanks to Groovy Tuesdays you can get a kickass feta (+hummus, if you like) veggie pita for a little over $2.  Service is fast and it's not usually too crowded.  Nice, tall tables too."}
{"text":"Not a big fan. Sometimes they got deals on Hook. The people who work there seem to be confused with orders and not exactly friendly either."}
{"text":"I was trying to think of places I would miss when I finish my Master's program here in Champaign-Urbana and the top three are Murphy's, Canopy Club and Zorba's.   I've always been a fan of gyros and I have to say that these are right up there with the ones I get in Chicago. In fact, Zorba's is better than some of the gyros I've gotten in Chicago before.   This is my favorite place to eat on Green Street. Besides Antonio's, it's probably the only one that not a chain and I unequivocally love the Large Gyro combo plain with a Cherry Pepsi."}
{"text":"This restaurant moved into the O'Connor area from the Danforth. Price, portions and tastes were good! This is a great place to eat in the area of O'Connor. We had the fish and chips and a souvlaki dinner! Food was good!"}
{"text":"The gyros were pretty good, but their fries came with this amazing sauce.  It was a delish combination of honey mustard but smelled and tasted like there was bacon in it.  I'm not sure what exactly it was but we couldn't stop dipping our fries in it - so good!"}
{"text":"Good food and I love all the dipping sauces.  Best gyro I've had on campus.  Not a huge variety of food, though."}
{"text":"Decent gyros at a decent price -- a large gyro combo costs around $7, and less if you manage to get a deal on the Hooked app. The meat is a tad dry, but the sauces somewhat make up for it. 3.5 stars"}
{"text":"They never gave the correct sauce I ordered. They used to be a good restaurant but now they only provide disgusting foods with stale ingredients."}
{"text":"I love the gyros here. I love their cucumber sauce even more :) You can pick the size of gyro you want, so you can load up on as much as as little meat as you please.  Service is good and there is plenty of room to eat right in the restaurant.  The only \"problem\" is that you'll smell like gyro, onion, and grease when you leave."}
{"text":"i used to eat the gyros here as a student and loved them...now that i'm all grown up i still love to eat here but i just eat the veggies on a pita with that yummy cucumber sauce and still love their fries.  i think what i love about this place more than the food is the fact that every single time i come here, i run into a friend, who is likely another uiuc alum, who happens to also have ended up living here, we strike up a conversation and realize the place feels even better when you're not procrastinating studying for an exam."}
{"text":"The food is always great & service is friendly. We almost always get the chicken & rice soup and their amazing hummus with pita bread."}
{"text":"I felt too nostalgic here to give this place one star. I used to come here in the mid 90's as an undergrad. Cut to 20 years later, and this is one of the few staples still left from that era.  That it has lasted this long is a testament to the simplicity of the business model and loyalty of its following. But coming here so many years later, and without the influence of alcohol to impair my judgement, I have no idea how this place has survived.  The gyros are good, not great, and the tzatziki sauce is below average. We were here in the mid-afternoon, so it wasn't like we had a sitting batch. The prices were decent, if not a little on the high side for a greasy spoon.  The most disappointing was the chicken fingers, or what they called \"chicken fingers\". More apropos would be chicken cake (think McDonald's hash brown shape, but chicken), sliced into 6 pieces. It was shockingly small and if I was smart I would've taken a picture and returned it, but the kids were hungry.  The best part of this place is the history that is catalogued on the walls in the form of painted murals, photos, and memorabilia of years gone by. I also thought the fries were pretty good and the staff were kind and friendly.  Order a gyro if you're craving one, but there's plenty of better food values and quality down the street."}
{"text":"LOVE Zorba's. Amazing food, quality customer service, you can tell this business takes pride in their work and values their customers."}
{"text":"Love this place...food is delicious....large portions too.  I wish their hours would be longer though."}
{"text":"What can you say about a campus institution like Zorba's? If you crave great gyros sandwiches and fries served fast, this is the place to visit. Super Niro Gyros serves good food but Zorba's has them beat for a quality product. Not a place to come for ambience, unless you like hanging out with self-absorbed Millennials with hands permanently attached to their iPhones. The tzatziki sauce is worth the price of admission though. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Overpriced, not a very expansive menu, gyros were average, ugly interior, I took my friend there from out of town because I thought it would be ok and was incredibly disappointed. Location is great. Won't go back"}
{"text":"They have closed down the one located at pape/danforth for almost 3 years now and I've finally came across it again at O'Connor, the best thing about it is that the chef still remembers me! Haha. Yes this place is still great, unfortunately I found their portions to have down sized from pape/danforth and one of the reasons why I kept coming back was the meal portions! On the contrary their souvlaki dinners are still killer and tasty!"}
{"text":"I would have always given this place five stars but I don't know what happened to it. The meat is dry like beef jerky and the cucumber sauce taste like sour cream and cucumbers. I don't know what has happened to one of the best places in town to get a gyro but I know I won't be going back."}
{"text":"I only went to Zorba's a couple times before it closed, and I remember being disappointed with it because I could get much better gyros back home.  I had given up on gyros on campus (until I went to niro's but that's another review) but I was willing to give Zorba's another chance when it reopened.  Many of my friends thought I was crazy for preferring niro's, so maybe I just remembered wrong?  Well, it was pretty much the same as I remembered.  The meat is mediocre, and I feel like you definitely get more for your money at niro's.  I do like that they have different sizes so you don't have to get a giant gyro if you're not particularly hungry.  Had I rated Zorba's before coming back, I would have given them four stars.  The food isn't bad; I've just had better.  But my favorite part of a gyro is the cucumber sauce, and it just wasn't right here.  Correct me if I'm mistaken, but isn't it supposed to be thick, white, and yogurty?  And nice and cold so you get that contrast between the cold sauce and the warm gyro meat?  Well, the sauce here was runny, warm, and almost clear.  I don't know, maybe something was just weird when I went, but with Niro's in my backyard (where I know they have the right sauce) and graduation in a month, I doubt I'll be back."}
{"text":"Zorba's is another place that my parents remember from their time as graduate students in the late 70's, and it appears to be somewhat of an institution now in Champaign.  I went with my parents on a summer Tuesday right at opening time and our food came out quickly.  It's cafeteria-style seating and the place filled up within a half hour.  We got 2 of the beef/lamb gyros and a Greek salad.  I thought the gyro was okay.  I mean, totally acceptable, but honestly I've had better at the Greek-fest thrown by the little Greek Orthodox church across the street from me in Boston.  The one I'm used to has a lot more of the meat, better sauce, and way more tomatoes and more thinly-sliced red onions (instead of the white onions used at Zorba's).  The fries that came with the combination platter were not good at all.  Those were mostly left untouched.  Overall, Zorba's delivers reasonably good value, and was a quick, convenient lunch stop in Champaign.  I didn't think the food was great by any means, but it gets the job done."}
{"text":"Super tasty. They actually used to be located at Pape and Danforth.  Definitely a mom and pop operation - took about 20 min from ordering to get food, but well worth the wait.  Food was fantastic.  Cost around $30 for two large dinner platters, which seems reasonable to me.  Food is more comparable to restaurant than fast food, so it's priced accordingly.  You can dine there or pick up/take out - calling ahead would address the wait if you're looking for speed.  Highly recommend trying Zorba's!"}
{"text":"Ordered from this place ones and asked for no onion meal as I am allergic to it. When I got it onions were inside.  Today I went to get lunch (soup and salad with chicken) and again asked for no onion, as I picked up an order I double checked if there's onions and was assured it's not on my salad. But when I opened my lunch sure enough the onion was inside. I also got a chicken rise soup that was rather good. Salad was nice seasoned but swimming in the oil.  I wouldn't recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"After my horrendous experience with Niro's I was optimistic that Zorba's might have a better gyro.  The store is right on Green street and impossible to miss walking by. Inside is pretty cool, open style kitchen and lots of indoor seating. The menu is on the counter where you order, which could be problematic if you are like me and take 5 minutes to look at a menu and there are people behind you!  I decided on a 4oz gyro and mac and cheese bites. My name was taken and I was called when it was ready. Interestingly enough, you also pay right when your food is ready, which was different, but I liked it!  I dashed home and unwrapped everything, anxious to try it. My gyro was actually pretty small and almost resembled a taco in size and shape. I did think that this gyro was really on point though. The meat was thicker, flavorful, not too greasy and of a good consistency. The tzatziki was really good, too! Kind of creamy but not too yogurt-y or watered down like some places. The mac and cheese bites were also surprisingly good. Usually these are just dry pieces of mush but on the inside they were warm, gooey and tasty!   Overall I would definitely say the Zorba's has the best gyro in the CU area, but I still need to try more places.  The only thing I did not like was the portion/price. My gyro was not very big, I probably could have ate 2-3 of them. However, quality over quantity any day of the week and this was one tasty gyro that would really give my suburban favorites a run for their money.  I'll be back to try more!"}
{"text":"Gyros, tzatziki, fries, and friendly cooks and cashiers make this place a must-go.  My parents graduated from the U of I in 1981, and Zorba's was there back then!  Considering the relatively high turnover rate of Campustown restaurants, I think that's pretty impressive."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. Everything from their gyros to hummus to fries are all on point. Live jazz is great (I forget which nights) and their special deal on Tuesdays makes this a great lunch spot on Green Street. This place definitely exceeds expectations in Chambana, and I hope it continues to thrive!"}
{"text":"Really delicious! This is a good place to stop by for some quick and tasty food. It is near campus, which is convenient for students. It was my first time there and I took a while deciding what I wanted, but the person behind the counter was patient. I will definitely go back if I'm ever in the area!"}
{"text":"They sell their gyros in 4 sizes: 2 oz, 4 oz, 6 oz, and 8 oz. This is pretty neat as a large or medium gyro should be enough to suffice a hungry person. However, I have to say that their gyro meat isn't as succulent as I thought it'd be. The Greek salad wasn't anything special either. I gotta say that I prefer Niro's Gyros more."}
{"text":"The food is relatively good. The fries are the best. What I eat most from here are the gyros which I think they are stingy on the amount of meat you get for the price that you pay, but hey it could just be me. It's an ok restaurant, check it out!"}
{"text":"Good good fast! Pricing was reasonable. I was a bit taken aback by my hummus and pita arriving as a sandwich instead of separate. The bread was great, the hummus was just average. I really liked my gyro though!"}
{"text":"Best Gyros in Illinois. Fast and delicious. A campus treasure. A Champaign treasure.  The gyros are authentic and the santiki (?) sauce is second to none.  Greek salads are another highlight."}
{"text":"Have only been there once but was a big fan of the gyros. Had an large original gyro with fries and was a pretty good deal for $7.50. Very tasty"}
{"text":"I tried this little spot today. Had a hell of a time finding parking because it's on the edge of campus. I went here based on the great reviews and although the food was good and I was quite satisfied with my meal I think it's average. Nothing special about the gyro, the sauce or falafel. I would eat here again but I would not go out of my way in the least bit to return. I forget sometimes that college town reviews are different than city reviews. Good food decent price."}
{"text":"The gyros here are decent and they have live music on certain days. Expect to pay a cover for the music."}
{"text":"Well bellow average Gyros. Soft, tasteless pitas with bland meat and sauce. Seriously, turn the corner onto Wright street and step into Wonderdogs for an absolutely fabulous Gryo. Not the best I've ever had, but easily the best in town."}
{"text":"Great Greek food including awesome Gyros!! They also have live music here a lot which is a great escape from doing your homework!  This place gets busy as lunch because it's right by the quad!"}
{"text":"My first and maybe last visit since the new ownership. Very disorganized, the scale is next to the line so anyone could sneeze on your food, the meat was cold, the tables were dirty and no one was wiping them off. I hope they get to the standards I expect from Zorbas but it will be a while before I return."}
{"text":"One of the regular spots on Green street, every time I make the painful decision not to eat at Antonio's and instead eat here, I'm a little surprised as how much I like Zorba's. I see a review saying Niro's is better and cheaper - Zorba's isn't that expensive - but I've never been to Niro's, so I can't compare. I will say that Zorba's has great fries - crinkle cut.   Not much else to say - it's standard gyro stuff, for a pretty reasonable price (huge portion, fries and drink for like $7), and it's definitely one of the few places on that first block of Green that hasn't changes in I think 35+ years."}
{"text":"Restaurant review: Look for gyros in Champaign, you can choose Niro or Zorba's as the most popular restaurants around, but on my recent lunch visit I was not that impressed. This location is right in the middle of campus and is super busy during lunch hours. We arrived before the rush and easily found a table, but if you come late, good luck. There is no large menu on the wall, but rather a menu at the table where you order which is sort of annoying as you can hold up the line if you are waiting to order or the menu along the wall. There are daily specials which is posted on the sign outside. Today Tuesday was dollar off classic gyro or 1/2 price fries. Other than that the combos are about 7-8 dollars a pop. This is where it falls short. The fries that come with the combo is a very small portion. I can't imagine that it is just a small helping of fries on a little serving basket. Usually that is a highlight when you go to gyro restaurants because it adds to the grease appeal. Additionally, they are quite stingy with the meat, i.e. they actually weigh and measure how much gyro meat you are getting. I have never been to one where you can get 4 different sizes of gyro meat. Overall a little disappointing. I can't say the large was very filling for me.. but who knows. One plus is that they have a dispenser for yogurt sauce so you can douse your gyro to your heart desire.   Pro: fast service, self service no need to tip  Cons: limited seating, very small fries portion, personally the gyro sizes that are measured seems a little stingy come on...  Hidden gem: 1. You can use the belly card to earn points toward free items 2. Daily specials Monday- Medium gyro, sm greek salad, pepsi 8.25, large greek salad and pepsi 6.25 Tuesday- 1 dollar of gyro and 1/2 price fries, 1 dollar off veggie sandwiches Wednesday- 1/4 lb beef hot dog, fries, and pepsi 6 dollars Thursday- BBQ pulled pork, fries, pepsi 7 dollars Friday- Fish sandwich, fries, pepsi 7.50"}
{"text":"I never was really bold enough to try gyros until I landed in Chambana and was told Zorbas was worth a go. I do like their classic gyro and the price is good and it always goes well with the crinkle fries. The location is great for students on campus but often you need to work around the busy lunch hour or wait until summer when all the undergrads are gone. Watching the sports on television or listening to jazz on Thursday is also a draw in case you decide to come alone for lunch/dinner."}
{"text":"It was good but not stellar or anything. I think it was a bit overhype's to me so I was disappoint when it wasn't life changing.  Their chicken strips were just a fried chicken breast that had been sliced. The amount in one order was kind of pathetic.  Their fries tasted like the kind I can heat up from the freezer section.  Their gyros were good but they weren't better than any other gyro I've ever had.  I'd go again if I was craving gyros but I could also go anywhere else that sells them and get one just as good."}
{"text":"Tender gyros meat at decent prices. Just stick with a gyros sandwich (the fries are mediocre). This place has been around since my parents were on UIUC's campus in the early-mid 70s and it's a great place to take them. I can't speak to the seating during peak hours because I usually would drop by here if there was a deal on Hooked midafternoon if I hadn't eaten lunch."}
{"text":"I absolultely LOVE gyros so this is a no-brainer for me. I feel like this place is a staple of quick, delicious campus food. It's pretty much a total hole in the wall, but it's totally Illini, everything about the decor just screams it. Not to mention the gyros are bomb. Go if you haven't already!"}
{"text":"The service should be improved. Ordered the combo, and tipped. Directly give us plain bread with meat without source, not ask if we need source..."}
{"text":"Zorbas is amazing and an important part of my UIUC experience! After a hard work out and swim at the ARC, there's nothing like a zorbas's gyro and their iced tea. Will be missed greatly once I graduate!"}
{"text":"Awesome gyros. Especially when you're listening to Spyro Gyra. On iTunes."}
