{"text":"Amazing food, amazing service!! I would recommend Blue Adobe to everyone!! The portions are large and the menu has so much to choose from!! The live music Saturday night was great! We usually go to the one in Mesa, but I will go to this location from now on!!"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness the food here is fantastic...I had the raspberry pork tenderloin it was to die for if this place was closer to my home I would become a regular great prices, fantastic food,wonderful atmosphere,this place has it all...make some time when you are in Scottsdale you won't regret it."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is fine and the service was good. The food was average. I had the stacked christmas enchiladas with chicken. It was a mess of flavors: the chicken was bland and the salsas drowned each other out. Add to that too much pico and the enchiladas turned into a sloppy mess."}
{"text":"Amazing food, great service and wonderful atmosphere!  We went on Valentine's Day and did not need a reservation. We got right in and our waitress had great recomendations.  I had the Chimichilada! Mmmmm out of this world. I mean mushroom enchillas, who knew? !? Plus, we couldn't help but sing along to the live music.  This is our new go to spot for diner. Plus they have an extensive margarita menu."}
{"text":"Over the last few weeks I've been wondering about this restaurant based on the seemingly always full parking lot.  Curious, I perused their website and was impressed.  Their claim of  \"flavorful spice\" left me intrigued, so I had to see for myself if all the conundrum was true.  It was a beautiful evening, so we decided to sit outside. However, walking through the restaurant I felt the quaintness vibe and liked the simplicity of the decorations.  The bar was down to earth and I'm pretty sure I saw Norm sitting on the corner.  It was charming.  The outside patio area comes equipped with standing heat lamps, so when the sun set behind us, we still felt very comfortable.  The fact that the patio also faced inside the shopping area was nice, so that you didn't notice the busy traffic on Frank Lloyd Wright.  Service was very prompt and I noticed that my glass of tea and water were never allowed to reach empty.  In fact, when they asked to grab my glass I was surprised to find it half way gone.  They serve chips and salsa while you peruse the menu.  The chips are very tasty and no extra salt is needed.  The salsa on the other hand was okay.  We found out later in the meal that they had a salsa caliente, which I would highly suggest.  It was spicy, but anyone could handle it and it had more flavor than the mild salsa.  Tuesday is taco day.  A very good deal if you are on the lookout!  $6.95 for a choice of two tacos and a variety of fillings for any taste bud.  I tried the stacked enchiladas smothered in christmas style sauces (red and green chile), carne adovada, cheese, corn tortillas, and I topped it off with a perfectly over easy fried egg.  It was very delicious.  The pork was tender and flavorful and I'm pretty sure I was licking the plate to make sure I didn't miss anything.  I preferred the green chile sauce, but if you're not sure which way to go, like me, getting the christmas style was the way to do it!  Also, I cannot say enough about the rice.  It was the most flavorful, exciting rice I have ever gotten at a restaurant.  Gone are the days of ignoring the boring rice and beans here, so definitely make sure you try them.  If you're into happy hours, they were offering a dollar off all beers and seemed to have a good variety to choose from.  I also suggest checking out their website.  Every day something different is going on--True Blue Night, and Fresh Catch Friday, to only name a couple.  I'll definitely be checking out their blackboard specials, and perhaps stumble into a couple margaritas as well!    I was hoping to find the spice and flavor they boasted about and I left completely satisfied.  This is a great place to hang out for practically any occasion without leaving your pocketbook empty.  Why is the parking lot full, I wondered?  Because the restaurant was packed with happy customers."}
{"text":"My mom and I came here for lunch a few days ago and it was delicious! The green chile chowder is so so so good. Our server was very attentive and sweet. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place is off the hook. From the smoky salsa to the portabello enchilada with a side of smoked chili's. Robbie S. took great care of us. The ambiance was nice, contrary to other opinions. Don't miss this gem of a joint. I look forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"I love the food and service at this restaurant. Very different food than a traditional Mexican restaurant. More New Mexican flare. The chips and salsa are great and it is easy to fill up on them but don't as the main courses are fabulous. I always have the Land of Enchantment which is a play on surf and turf. A steak, shrimp and an enchilada. A great price for the quality of the food."}
{"text":"We used to love go to Blue Adobe. It was our favorite place in the area. But this year they started charging for chip refills. That's a turn off at any sit down restaurant.  Because of this, we won't go anymore. Sounds silly but when we're feeding a family and spending a decent amount on food and drinks, it just seems silly to charge for chip refills. That's usually a perk that going to a sit-down restaurant - chip or bread basket refills.  Anyway, we're disappointed in this change Blue Adobe made so we no longer go there."}
{"text":"I ate there last September with my boss.  It's definitely a Southwest cuisine kind of place.  I'm not a big Tex-Mex fan, but my boss loves Mexican food.  It's kind of a funny story, but a couple of days before we went here, my boss said there was a Mexican restaurant across the street from the GD plant (the old Motorola building) on McDowell Blvd (Locals know what I'm talking about).  I didn't recall any Mexican places there and sho'nuff, it was a Cajun restaurant (and closed).  So we walked a mile and  half in 108 degree heat until we hit a Mexican restaurant -- TACO Bell.  I didn't think it was possible to F--k Up a cheese quesadilla, but it was awful.  My boss hated his meal and got a bad case of the runs all afternoon.  So I felt bad for my boss and took a bullet for him.  I found Blue Adobe to be a highly ranked place and invited him to meet me there.  It was a bit of a drive, but definitely well worth the trek,  He ordered a Mexican dish (I forgot what it was) and truly enjoyed it.  I had the chicken stuffed with chorizo and liked my dish as well.  Chorizo is the one Mexican item I do enjoy.  Margarita's were good, but a bit smallish.  I highly recommend Blue Adobe."}
{"text":"Jason was really cool.  He recommended amazing dishes.  The food was excellent.  The music was perfect.   All in all it is a 5 out of 5 (for the review).  On a scale from 1 to 10, Blue Adobe is a 10.  It's a real treat.  I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Adequate at best.  A step above restaurants like Macayo's (maybe).  Definitely not worth the drive.   My feelings are that it receives such high rating from the locals in that area who are essentially :locked: in place in such a remote area and never make in town to any real restaurants.  Food was decent, service was terrible."}
{"text":"They acknowledged our gift card, indicated it had a $50 balance, then said that due to 'new management,' they weren't going to honor it.  If it were possible to give them zero stars, they'd have it."}
{"text":"This place is a perfect spot for Sunday football and brunch 10am-2pm). The Huevos Rancheros and Hatch & Stuffed Sopapillas are both delicious!"}
{"text":"Great Mexican-Southwest soul food! 4/5  This restaurant is just right next to our house. Per J's colleague's recommendation, we checked out this place right after we moved in to our Jenan's house a year ago. The atmosphere is great with great food. All Blue Adobe's dishes come in BIG portion. I would recommend sharing there. Anything we tried there was good."}
{"text":"Amazing food! And Great service. Perfect guac, nice salsa. I recommend the chorizo-stuffed chicken breast that comes with veggies and potato."}
{"text":"I went to visit a friend up in N Scottsdale and we decided to try this place with our families. I had no expectations going in. I was just hungry.  We were seated almost immediately. There were 7 of us, so prepping a table was in order. Immediately we were introduced to our waiter and drink orders taken.   They served the complimentary chips and salsa. I could have satisfied my hunger with that. The chips (and those who know me well, know I am not a chip person, nor a salt person.) were not salty, not oily, and the salsa was so delicious!! It had a great roasted flavor and just enough heat to satisfy me, but not spoil my taste for my dinner. Yum....  I ordered the seafood enchiladas. My friend ordered the chorizo stuffed chicken. Once my friend to her first bite, she was hooked. I actually heard a groan of satisfaction escape her. That says a lot considering she ran her own restaurant and is pickier than I am with my food. My seafood enchiladas were delicious! The seafood wasn't rubbery and overcooked. The salmon inside was tender and perfectly cooked. They didn't tell me what the catch of the day was though. I didn't care. It was GOOD. The side dishes were good too. I was happy to hear that the pinto beans were cooked with a chicken stock and not pork products. Whew!  Since this was my first trip, I am hoping that they are consistent. I want to go back. As I'm typing this up, my stomach is screaming at me to fill it.*"}
{"text":"Fast friendly service with quick refills on the excellent chips and fire roasted salsa. Had the Caesar as a side salad to entree; very average. The stacked enchiladas with shredded beef with fried egg on top with rice & beans was very good. So was the chile relleno. Overall great service and very good food. It is not gourmet but much better than average."}
{"text":"We usually prefer the more hole in a wall kind of Mexican, but got a coupon in the mail so decided to check Blue Adobe Grille out.  The servers were a bit overwhelmed by the lunch rush (it was later explained to me that one did not show up for work).  The room's large and comfy.  We ordered the Santa Fe where you get to choose uno or dos items out of a selection of enchiladas, tacos, burros, tamales, etc. - we picked the carne adovado and lobster tamale ($9.50 plus \"Up Charge\" of $1.50 for the lobster).  And also the Soup and Salad: Posole and Adobe Salad.  Verdict: 4 stars: Lobster Tamale - generously filled with large chunks of lobster 3 stars: Adobe Salad - plain solid 2 stars: Carne Adovado - pork itself is quite bland and the sauce tastes like the adobo sauce I get from a can 2 stars: Posole - bland especially after having the complimentary chips and spicy salsa   If all we had ordered was the Lobster Tamale, this could've been 5 stars.  Check out Feasting in Phoenix for a detailed review from Seth: http://feastinginphoenix.com/?p=206"}
{"text":"Came here today for the first time with 2 friends.  Great atmosphere.  We sat at the bar which was nice. The bar opened to the outside and it had a few nice flat screen tv's.  Lauren was our Bartendar and she was very nice and attentive. We were served our margaritas and chips and salsa right away.  Margaritas were really good.  I got the Muy Flaco and my friends got the Cruz and blackberry pomegranate margarita.  The salsa was very tasty.  The hot salsa had a nice little kick to it.  For the food,  I got the carne adovada.  The pork was really tender.  My friends got the stacked enchiladas and the fish enchiladas.  They both loved the food and said it was very tasty..  Very generous portions.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Staying at the Fairmont in Scottsdale, my husband and I were looking for a New Mexican Cuisine restaurant within an easy drive, and we selected Blue Adobe based on its reviews on Yelp.  We arrived during Happy Hour and were greeted with the wonderful smell of pecan smoke from their wood fired grill.  The restaurant is very casual with comfortable booths.  The outside patio looked nice, but we chose to sit inside and enjoy the AC and college football on the TVs.  We had their Killer margueritas, which were delicious and potent.  Complimentary chips and salsa arrived and we loved both.  Ordered the guacamole, and were presented with a large bowl of chunky green goodness.  The entrees we ordered were delicious..their menu has many great choices.  Service was excellent, and prices were a bargain.  We loved our experience here, and will be back the next time we're in town."}
{"text":"Great food and team!!! Would recommend to everyone! Thanks for an awesome lunch! The Mexican food was incredible and the smoked meats were awesome!"}
{"text":"Based on the reviews I was disappointed with my entre...chicken pasta (linguini, basil and cream sauce). Too heavy and thick with an excess of heavy cream. Service however was 5 star so I'd give it another try. Might just have been an off night. Glad they had one of my favorite brews...Dos Equis amber!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Awesome mexican food, cozy atmosphere, and live music! I recommend the lazy tacos with shrimp!"}
{"text":"Wow!  I just had an awesome dinner at the Blue Adobe Grill and not only did my husband and I enjoy our meal the service was great!   I can't remember the name of my entrée but it was a lobster tamale with a seafood chili relleno....yummy!   My husband had a blue corn seafood enchilada that he loved.  We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Blue Adobe has a new WEEKEND daytime Happy Hour, open to 4:00 pm!! Excellent food as usual, large portion sizes, two people can easily share one lunch entree and $5.00 drinks, fabulous Margaritas! I have been here for dinner many times but will be back again for Weekend Happy Hours!!"}
{"text":"First of all salsa is very different but we loved it, more chiles than tomatoes...Great nachos, lazy beef tacos and shrimp tacos...all very good would return, and we are food snobs!"}
{"text":"One word...delicious. Started with drinks and ended with dessert. A great waitress, sat on the patio with live music on a beautiful Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Really good, I like the vegetable enchiladas.  I've been here for a variety of occasions....work happy hour, adult dinner, dinner with kids, and it worked well for all of the above.  The servers have always been pleasant as well."}
{"text":"My husband and I LOVE this place.  We live nearby, so we are fortunate to have it in the vicinity.  I see some reviewers expected BAG to be a traditional Mexican restaurant... it isn't.  They bill themselves as serving a Sante Fe-style cuisine.  So, calibrate your expectations around that description.  The Margarita Flaco is superb!!!!  Not too sweet and lower in calorie than other margaritas.    It's the homemade, proprietary salsa and warm, salty multi-colored tortilla chips that kick off every meal with a BANG!!!  Very delicious, especially for someone like me who isn't really a lover of chiles and hot sauces.  The smoky goodness of the salsa is outstanding.  The hot lobster dip is decadent, but oh so yummy!  I'm from CT, so I know me some real, fresh lobsta meat, and this dip delivers.  Try it if you're up for a rich meal starter.    I've tried the shrimp pizza and have had their version of a caesar salad with chicken and shrimp.  All great!  My husband loves the tacos and the super fresh and savory chili rellenos.    Above all, it's been excellent service every time we come in!  The hostess always greets us with a friendly hello, and every single server has been friendly, attentive, and responsive.  This bespeaks of great training and knowing how to choose your wait staff, so kudos to the owner/manager, who has stopped by our table on several occasions to say hi.  Nice touch... gives us that neighborhood feel.  For those who like more of a bar scene, it looks like lots of fun on that side of the restaurant.  We'll bring our out-of-town guests in because their seating area can accommodate large parties.    Needless to say, we'll be back!!  Give Blue Adobe Grille a try!"}
{"text":"Short Version:       Food - Excellent      Service - Decent but not stellar      Ambiance - Relaxing All in all, this place should receive a 5 star review but there is always something that doesn't go quite right on each visit so it falls from the lofty 5 to a 4.  Longer Version: Every year we come to phoenix for 2 - 3 weeks.  Blue Adobe is always a must for at least one night of dining.  The Blue Adobe night starts with an afternoon baseball game followed by a walk in the McDowell Sonoran Preserve.  A short drive latter puts us in the restaurant at twilight.  Because of the time we have never had a wait.  Coincidently enough on our four visits we have always been seated at the same table.    The restaurant is dim but not gloomy.  The ceiling is high and painted black for the faux outside ant night feeling.  The tables are not crowded on top of one another. The floor layout is clean and there are dividing walls to keep the place from being just one big room filled with table.  It is well decorated with charming simplicity.  The overall effect makes this a relaxing and comfortable place to eat.  The host staff warmly greeted us adequately took us to our table.  Upon leaving they said goodbye (and not in that fake hostess that really means get the heck out of here).  The servers have all been fast, efficient and friendly.  The wait staff has always worked well as a team.  Meaning that if our waiter was doing something else, another waiter might help bus a plate as she past.  The wait staff seemed knowledgeable (to a degree) on the menu and was willing to help us with our decisions.  While each sever did a better than adequate job it always lacked something from a stellar or amazing experience.  None of them were amazingly friendly or attentive - just more than enough to get the job done.  Plus there were always two or three things that each server did that was not quite right.  Like on the last trip, my quesadilla did not come with enough dipping sauce so I asked for some more sauce.  The server said no problem but he had neglected to mention that there was a $1.00 charge for extra sauce.  Now the one buck was not an issue it is just that he should have given me the information and an option to make a decision.  Add to this: reaching across me to get another dinner's plate instead of walking around the table and not waiting for us to respond to his question \"how is everything?\" before leaving.  These are small issues but take the service from high (5) to just over average (4).  Now for the reason to dine out: The Food! For four years I have used the Blue Adobe as my benchmark for judging Mexican restaurants in Phoenix.  I have only come across one that I find is truly serves better food (Los Sombreros Mexican).  The lobster dip appetizer is creamy and flavortastic!  The shrimp quesadilla with mango salsa makes my mouth water months after having eaten it.  The two make a great way to start off a meal when shared with the whole table or combined for a single meal for one.  Over the years we have tried various menu items and have found all to be tasty.  Items of note are: Big D liked the staked enchiladas. He described it as a unique and fun way to eat excellent food.  He loved the Taos combo (but traded the shrimp enchilada to J for some of her Chimichanga.  J calls the chimi one of the three best she has ever had.  She also shrimp cocktail rellenos and complains that she has to choose between the two entrees.  While M may tri other items on the second visit each trip - the first one she gets the Raspberry Tenderloin.  She finds the unique combination of raspberry, mango and pork to be awe-inspiring.  I stick with the apps as a meal.  We have even tried the Oscar Medallions as an appetizer - wonderful choice.  Delicious meat with the taste of crab is a unique thing to savor.  Add some sweetness through the mango salsa and you are one step closer to heaven.  On the down side food wise:  While the lobster macaroni is almost to die for, they charge $25 for a portion that is too small to be called a meal for even a child.  We all agree that the crab cakes are passible but nothing to rave at and have a weird after taste.  The seafood enchiladas, the lazy tacos, and the Las Cruces kabobs all come with salmon and shrimp but feature the salmon with shrimp as almost an afterthought.  Since we are not big fans of salmon this was not great for us and they did not seem willing to cook it with just halibut and shrimp.    Overall, the food is outstanding.  For most items the price is reasonable, portions are good and the sides fitting.  Because of some less than great experiments - the combined feeling of the foods is a 5-.  This place should receive a 5, but the service just pulls it to the 4.5 and I can't round this one up."}
{"text":"Great food and even better service. Not your typical Mexican spot with great margaritas.! We had Lauren as a server and she was awesome. Made everything fun and knew all the specials! Get the lobster dip and the stacked enchiladas with egg on top."}
{"text":"This was one of the best Mexican restaurants we've been to. All four people at our table raved about their dinners. Our server, Melissa, was extremely helpful with our questions about the menu: how spicy items are, whether items were totally gluten free or now, etc. I prefer dishes with a kick and the Las Cruces Kabobs hit the spot. Jalapeno Hollandaise over a very generous serving of fish kabobs, served with rice, beans and sauteed vegetables, done to perfection. Next time we are back in Scottsdale we will definitely return to Blue Adobe Grille."}
{"text":"I dined here for the first time on 12/30 for lunch and sat at the bar.  The owner, Michael, was behind the bar and was very accommodating.  The service was excellent, no complaints!  I finished my last chip and they were right there to refill them, and my water as well.  I ordered the beans and queso dip as an appetizer, it was very good, ate it all.  I also ordered the Chili Relleno with tenderloin and a shredded beef taco.  Both were excellent.  I particularly liked the fact that the chili pepper was large and held it's shape, and was not at all mushy like many I have had.  I also had a delicious frozen margarita and I have to say it was not at all sugary and tasting like mix, loved it!    I will for sure be back to this place, no question!"}
{"text":"Great Southwestern restaurant.  The food is incredible, especially the stacked enchiladas.  Normally I do not eat heavy foods, but this was way too good to pass up.  The chips and salsa were very tasty as well.  Service was very friendly and timely.  The interior is pedestrian at best, but still a pleasant environment."}
{"text":"We love Blue Adobe! The food is DELISH and the specials are great! What makes this place \"As good as it gets\" is the live music Thur-Sat and the cool, layed back ambiance. Great place to unwind and enjoy!"}
{"text":"So far I like this place. Good food good staff. Decently priced. I have yet to eat in. I order take out for lunch. I'll update once I've eaten in."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Blue Adobe, and have been for years.  The food is consistently fresh, delicious, and as well as unique compared to the dozens of other choices in the area.  The owner Michael puts his heart into his restaurant and his committment and passion comes accross not only in the food, but in how well he treats his staff and his customers.  If you haven't had the opportunity to enjoy Blue Adboe...I highly recommend giving it a try...it's earned a place in my top restaurant recommendations in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Doing a happy dance now. Just got back from a great meal at Blue Adobe Grille. Took my 90 year old parents for an early dinner, and the owner came over to our table to see how we liked the food. The food rocked - big, hot, and delicious. Parents had the Friday night fish and chips. Service was perfect, atmosphere peaceful in the early evening. I'll be returning later with friends for margaritas, music, and more food."}
{"text":"Love this place...every time.    The food is always great.  Live music that is not so loud you can't enjoy conversation at your table.  Very friendly hostess, servers and owners/operators.  And excellent margaritas.  What more could you ask for."}
{"text":"We went for lunch after visiting Taliesin West.  We sat outside on the patio which was nice despite being in a parking lot.  I tried the peach sangria which was great.  We all were happy with our menu choices, altho i was surprised that the \"soft\" tacos were not rolled, but the ingredients were simply sitting on the tortillas. We would definitely go back when next in the area."}
{"text":"Blue Adobe is our meeting place for Abby Bella Dance Scottsdale. We meet new emloyees, have meetings and just have lunch and happy hour. Every day there is an amazing special for just $10, my favorite is the seafood enchiladas. Stuffed with shrimp, salmon and other delights from the sea combined in a blue corn tortilla and topped with sauce and cheese. Everything I have tried is great!   The patio is a great place to meet with friends and wind down from your day.   Great chips and salsa. The service is always good and Michael always stops by with a joke and/or a story."}
{"text":"The staff was pleasant and courteous. The service was slow paced at lunch. The pork tenderloin was tender but not freshly prepared since plate was heated. The salmon was good but lettuce was old. When mentioned lettuce to staff as cleaning table they poked at plate and stated sorry.  Ok place, not as good as Blue Agave."}
{"text":"A decent southwestern restaurant if you have a hankering for it.  The margarita was good and the Taos combo was also good.  The service was attentive and bumped this up to a three star review.  Otherwise, the food is good not great."}
{"text":"Salads are amazing. Chips and salsa rock. Great atmosphere. Don't order the Chimichanga- not a great meal and I love Mexican food.  Also, the service sucks. My waiter (dude in his late 20's/early 30's) was aggressively rude to me- I was there with my mom, and I had asked three staff members for extra sour cream. No one brought it to me after 10-12 minutes of waiting. Our waiter graced our table again, and I commented as he walked away that it took forever- he came back and actually asked me in a confrontational way what I had said. I told him- I think he was shocked that I didn't back down. But what type of waiter confronts customers like that? 2nd time I've been there- same waiter- same arrogance b.s. service. It's interesting food, but not that great. I'd recommend other restaurants personally..."}
{"text":"This is the first review I have ever given on any restaurant.  This is the best and most consistently good quality food I have ever had living here from Boston for 23 years.  Yes...we frequent many different restaurants.   This reminds me of the Cheers bar in Boston where you walk in and it is as friendly as can be.   Although we have not had everything on the menu,  but getting close, neither my wife nor myself has every had anything that was not outstanding.  Love the salsa, the lobster dip and the guacamole.  If you like spice...they've got it...if you don't they've got that too.   Enchiladas and chimichanga to die for.  All meat and perfectly spiced. Chili Rellenos...the best.  Plus we have all the different steaks and they are melt in your mouth.    Plus I think it might be impossible to finish any entre as the portions are so generous.  For lunch today we will have one of the chimichangas because we had to split one last night for dinner...that we took home.   Every week we have clients who fly in from all over the country and outside.  I think over the past 3 years we have sent upwards of 150 people to Blue Adobe.  Some who have gone there for lunch end up back there for dinner.  All I have gotten in follow up emails from clients is - we loved Blue Adobe.   Last night while we had a drink and guacamole, while waiting for out food, I looked over at the guys plate who was sitting next to me and asked what it was. He said - Last Night's Meat Loaf.  He said he has it all the time and will have to take it home for breakfast tomorrow.  It is next on  my list.   My wife and I are not easy to please but when we find a quality restaurant we stick with it.   The owner Mike is friendly and the bartender Rob is one of the best we have ever had. Watch how fast this guy moves.  And as a neighborhood bar and restaurant you get to see the same faces over and over.  What does that tell you?  I was surprised that one of the reviews had 1 star.  I don't know what planet this person is from but disregard what was said.  Did they want Italian?  This is Blue Adobe Santa Fe Grille.  I will challenge you to find better food anywhere.   Come join us. You will love it."}
{"text":"Used to frequent here in the past but stopped going about 6 or 9 months ago.  Always seemed a bit more pricy and we weren't too into the attempt to upscale standard Spanish cuisine.  Anyway, it's been a while and we went twice in the last month... neither time did we get to eat.  The first attempt was a few weeks ago.  Went inside and was waiting on the hostess.  A couple walks in and asks a waiter about seating.  He said \"The bar and patio are open seating\", so the couple walked back.  A few minutes later a hostess comes up and asks if we have reservations.  We say no, but verifies 3 people (2 adults and one 5 year old) and she said it would be a few minutes.  I assumed if there was a wait there were 4 or 5 patio tables open and we'd sit outside.  A few minutes later another hostess calls us up and tells us it would be an hour wait.  We asked about the Patio and said it was full.  When I left I looked and there were 4 patio tables empty and clean.  Second attempt was today.  Went inside at 5pm and same hostess was busy seating a large family and kids.  We weren't recognized and if seemed more of an afterthought when we finally were.  She said she'd be back and disappeared for a few minutes.   Restaurant was about half full and many open tables.  Another woman comes up to the hostess counter and asks if we have reservations (seems to be a pattern here).  Both HS and party of 4 behind us say no.  She tells us both that it'll be a few minutes (same thing again).  At this point we both decided to just leave and try another place (which we rather enjoyed, might I say).  In the past I always remember the takes on dishes.  A lot of interesting items but few were appealing to me.  And it wasn't an inexpensive visit either.  All in all I don't really remember my main reason for stopping 6+ months ago, but I know now why I'm never going back."}
{"text":"This is one of our neighborhood haunts. We love the bean dip app, chips & salsa, crispy crab cake tacos, stacked enchiladas w egg, & the corn chowder. Love the live music, bar & good atmosphere for families as well."}
{"text":"Cool local spot. Not huge but great atmosphere especially with live music. Carne Adavada is excellent."}
{"text":"Based on the rave reviews, we went to Blue Adobe last night. The service was excellent, the wine list fine, and the food was good. However the salad was drowning in dressing (order it on the side) and I expected a lighter touch to the food. We ate outside on a lovely evening. I am still searching for that spot where I can eat a nice meal while watching the sun set over the distant mountains....."}
{"text":"I've never given a 10 rating or 5 full stars to just about anything ever before, but this place served me the best plate of pasta I've ever had at any restaurant, bar none, and I lived in and around NYC for over 20 years! Do yourself a favor...check this place out!"}
{"text":"Every time we go the food is fantastic! Love sitting on the patio for a couple of drinks before/after dinner. Great food, good service & a good atmosphere - what more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"We found this when we were hot and tired and hungry.  It was a total treat.  Lovely patio with a great breeze.  Amazing food.  Different but tasty recipes.  If and when I am back in Scottsdale, I will certainly stop by again."}
{"text":"Visiting scottsdale from Washington state.l can't say enough good about the blue adobe bar and grill,my wife and I have eaten there 4 times in the last 3 wks,the food is fantastic,portions are huge,drinks are so good and the staff totally delightful.We are so impressed,I think we found our new Cheers.Hopefully will enjoy for many years to come,5 stars not enough!!"}
{"text":"So delicious! Our server, Austin was top notch. We were able to be seated right away at 7pm on a Saturday night. The salsa is so flavorful. We ordered the stacked enchiladas and the beef chimichanga. Both were delicious. Very fresh and flavorful. The chimichanga might be the best I have ever had! I loved that each dish had layers of flavor that all worked well together. If I am in the area visiting again this will be on the list of places to come again!"}
{"text":"Had foul tasting water undrinkable.   Said you had to buy soda then No apology Refused to substitute  vegetable for fries without upcharge"}
{"text":"Fabulous lunch on the patio.  We had cups of the green chili chicken corn chowder and the lobster tamale. The service was great too!!"}
{"text":"Five of us enjoyed a casual and wonderful dinner at Blue Adobe. The fresh chips and dark salsa were very good - it took a lot of willpower to stop munching the chips and salsa before our meals arrived. I ordered the chicken chorizo which was accompanied by twice-baked potatoes served in a jalapeno pepper half - unique and zesty - as well as grilled vegetable strips.  All five of us truly enjoyed our meals. The atmosphere was comfortable and casual. Our server, Ashley, was excellent. I would definitely recommend Blue Adobe if you are in the Scottsdale area."}
{"text":"We've died and gone to heaven.....started with the Cruz Caddy Margarita and it was a perfect blend of lime and agave nectar with tequila and a grand Marnier floater.  The chefs daily guacamole could have used a bit more seasoning but it was fresh with onion and tomato.   Luckily, we took Daniels recommendations and ordered the pork tenderloin with raspberry Chipotle sauce and the ocean front. ..a lobster tamale and shrimp cocktail relleno.  Wish we had room for dessert.....next time - which will be soon."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!! A regular \"go to\" for my family of 5! Food is always on point!  Staff and Mike the owner are always great and accommodating!  You will not be disappointed at Blue Adobe."}
{"text":"Greve venue  Delicious crab enchiladas But it's is not your typical Mexican food  Mostly stripped down flavors Trade ofs on the menu for the sake of healthy   Good experience overall"}
{"text":"I love this place. The margaritas are great I love the guacamole and salsa. The service is attentive. I recommend this place to anyone.  Try their steak and portobello mushroom enchilada."}
{"text":"Checked this place out tonight after a friend referred me. The reason why I'm giving this a 3 vs a 5 is due to staff, not the food as it was awesome In brief, front hostess very nice, the bar, the bartender could be more attentive, and friendly(not crazy night here, early sat), develop a personality(blonde male) Very shorr in answers, and non conversational, poor PR,  female bartender I asked to skip the enchilada with steak and was informed if I  ordered a salad, that's considerred an upgrade, despite I'm not taking enchilida????? Really it's lettuce, at the very end she asked her manager and than the salad itself, not edible,  loaded with oil or dressing. So, so my suggestion switch up staff, poor for your business.   On to the positive food was excellent for the value beyond the salad.  Enough that I ordered a meal for my husband.   Music awesome......I will be back despite the issue , just won't sit at bar.  I gave this a 3 perhaps that someone would review and improve."}
{"text":"I like this place. To be honest I come back for the service but I like the food too. It's not my favorite combination of cuisines but the food is always fresh, the quality is super consistent and it tastes exactly as the menu describes. Great staff, the manager is very engaged and makes his rounds almost as often as the service team."}
{"text":"Came in for Valentine's Day, great couples special. Our server Pablo was very friendly and attentive. My Steak Oscar was cooked perfectly and so tender I could cut it with a butter knife. My wife had the Lobster Macaroni, it had very generous pieces of lobster and great flavor overall. We live in Buckeye so it's quite a hike for us, but we will definitely return."}
{"text":"Great Southwestern food and the staff and owner treated us like royalty.  We share all 5 of our entrees as we each wanted to prove to one another who picked the best entree.  Great drinks and apps as well."}
{"text":"Good and quick service by our waitress.  The menu was very interesting.  I had the lunch item of Halibut enchilada  and a margarita.  I thought the food was very tasty and generous enough portions.  Nice vegetables of grilled carrots and zucchini.  The only \"con\" I would say is that the entire meal was very salty.  I suppose it could be that we use very little salt at home so the meal had so much more than we are used to."}
{"text":"Don't believe the closing time, the staff decides when they are done seeing guests.  My 4 friends and I were looking for a quick bite at the end of our night. Knowing good and well that it's somewhat uncouth to walk into a restaurant a half hour before closing time we were just looking for a few appetizers and drinks. As we walked up at 9pm, a waiter met us on the front patio and said, \"sorry ladies, we're closed\". Not only was that a lie, but there were plenty of guests still eating on the patio.  Rather than explain our intentions that night, I accepted his dismissal and thought it better to just let everyone else know that they are content with their current customer base and not looking to accommodate any new patrons at this time.   Congrats, Blue Adobe, that you have the type of success to turn business away!"}
{"text":"I grew up in NM eating arguably the best authentic Mexican food in the country....when we moved out here we looked for a great Mexican restaurant and when we finally found Blue Adobe we instantly fell in love. The food is really very good and the chili comes from Hatch NM, chili capital of the country. We've made it a regular on our list and so far after several years we have never been disappointed.  The owner is very customer focused and will visit with you. The bar tenders are the best in the industry (be sure to say Hi to Rob and Mattie). The menu is pretty diverse but honestly I found a few favorites and have stuck with them: Cruz Kitchen (Tenderloin Relleno, Smoked Pork Tamale and Carne Adovada), Stacked Chicken Enchiladas (get 'em Christmas Style), Soft Corn Lazy Tacos (Ancho Salmon, Shrimp, Crab Cake, Chicken, Shredded Beef or Carne Adovada), Chorizo Stuffed Chicken(this is Awesome!!), The burgers are really good and they have a Garlic Shrimp Pizza that's to die for...oh and the nachos are awesome but ask them to add Carne Adovada (wow!!)......guess i've tried more dishes than I thought....."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Blue Adobe, The food is fantastic. I must mention that they have some of the best ice tea. I wish I could eat there everyday. Thank you Mike for keeping the place going. AWESOME!!!!"}
{"text":"Not impressed. Do NOT get the lobster dip over priced and not good. Was upset they up charge for everything. Owner was there and I expressed my disappointment in the dip. No response and I had to ask several times for my water to refilled Won't go back again."}
{"text":"We made reservations for a party of 8 on Friday night.  Arrived a little early and the table was ready.  It was our first time to visit and we were all impressed with the uniqueness of the menu, surrounding Mexican dishes.  Jenny H. provided great descriptions of the menu choices and threw in some of her favs.  We all enjoyed our choices.  Her service was impeccable and the next time we are in town we will ask for her again!  Thank you for taking time in wrapping up our to-go stuff!   She also had a great team that helped in taking care of us."}
{"text":"Here we are singing the praises of Blue Adobe SFG again...this time for their weekend brunch.  While I couldn't resist my favorite Chicken Enchilada plate, my wife tried the Nebraskan...3 eggs with bacon, Monterey Jack and cheddar cheese with sides of Asiago potato cakes (which were out-of-this-world delicious), fresh fruit and a Sopapilla.  She rated it one of the best breakfast dishes she's ever had anywhere, which is quite a compliment.  This was our 7th visit over the 3 months since they opened (first for weekend brunch) and are we ever glad we found this place!  Great food and great service at reasonable prices."}
{"text":"We went back to Blue Adobe on 3/31/16 and much to our delight we didn't see the problems on the original visit almost a year earlier. Our dinner was fantastic and the happy hours prices, esp. the salads at 5.00, are the best we've seen. We highly recommend a visit to Blue Adobe Santa Fe Grill on Frank Lloyd Wright Blvd. in East Scottsdale."}
{"text":"If you like New Mexican food, in a relaxed neighborhood environment, you'll really enjoy it here."}
{"text":"We stopped here on our way home from golf. The house margaritas are okay a little sweet for my taste, but 2 for happy hour worked! Salsa is homemade and so good. We each had something different for dinner. ALL the food was delicious! Liked sitting outside on the patio. Will keep this on the return list for sure!!"}
{"text":"As much as they claim to try hard at this place, management hasn't got a clue how to run a restaurant.  After countless attempts in good faith of trying to get a meal properly prepared from this establishment, they continue to mess up the orders and laugh it off.  The atmosphere is OK but servers must intentionally mess up orders for people they would prefer eat elsewhere.  We gave them plenty of tries to get it right but they still couldn't do it.  Go somewhere else.  Make food at home.  You will have a better experience than at this restaurant.  Maybe some day they will figure it out and actually serve the right food to their customers.  Until then... try the AM-PM Mini-market around the corner for a mini pizza.  Your service will be better and you get what you want."}
{"text":"Great service and live music. The food needs some serious help, especially at that price."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a fabulous Valentines dinner experience. From appetizer through desert, the food was awesome. The service was spot on and the owner stopped to chat. The Pinot recommendation (including a sample taste) was perfect. The live music was a bonus! My wife and I highly recommend the Blue Adobe."}
{"text":"Amazing! Definitely a special occasion place. Can get noisy in the evening due to the volume of people enjoying food."}
{"text":"Great food, Margaritas and LIVE Music, on Thursday night! With my daughter Andrea. Had the stacked enchiladas New Mexican style, yum!"}
{"text":"Had a great, fun dinner here last night celebrating my sister's birthday. Service was excellent as our waiter balanced food allergies, non-meat eaters, and general indecisiveness with the terrific menu.  We lingered over first course chips, salsa (just spicy enough to please all, a little light for those of us who really enjoy heat), chunky guacamole (in need of a little salt) and perfect bean queso (mashed, not pureed, beans, just enough cheese, same spiciness as the salsa).  The Don Culio margarita was cool and spicy, and good enough to have two.  Our party enjoyed all our entrees: the panko breading on the Shrimp Rellenos was unusual and worked wonderfully, standing up to the Christmas sauce and maintaining some crunch; Pork Adovado Stacked Enchiladas were tender and flavorful - get the fried egg on top; Crab Cake Tacos are unbelievably yummy - didn't sound like it would work, but they were so much more subtle and delicious than the typical fish taco; Chorizo Stuffed Chicken was the only average dish - just fine but beware of portion size, it was the only dish of the night that might leave someone a little hungry.  We finished our meal with a complimentary birthday dessert of a cookie pie with ice cream.  I'm sure you're rolling your eyes at the mundanity but hold on, this was a slice of actual cookie pie at least twice as thick as whatever you're imagining.  Not just the best of its kind we've had but simply delicious on its own, no comparison necessary.   Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"My friend lives way out East. North East that is. Scottsdale on the boarder of Fountain Hills. This is one of her favorite places to go. I have never been till this visit. I drove out there to find it quite easily in a nice spacious parking lot. It is beautifully decorated inside and out. A nice man opened the door for me as I came up and said Teresa, we have been waiting for you. My friend told him she was waiting for me. But, it made me laugh. He escorted me to the booth where she waiting.   The server came right away and offered me a drink. I chose water and coffee. She said ,I will make you a fresh pot. Which she did and I always greatly appreciate that. We both got the special of the day, Fish and Chips. They were wonderful! Big pieces of cod lightly breaded and nice FF. Along with a side of fresh cole slaw made with apples. Since it was 107 outside it was divine. Our service was wonderful, she refilled our water and the other drinks always on time. When it is cooler outside it would be nice to sit on the patio. It looked lovely. The ladies room was also, clean and nice. I would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Stopped in last Saturday night for a late dinner. Was pleased to sit out on the nice patio. Enjoyed some live music and a pitcher of red sangria. Delicious. The service was spot on for sure. As soon as we were seated, we received water, fresh/tasty chips and a verde salsa. The waitress was very attentive but not overbearing.  My hubster ordered beef lazy tacos and I had the waitress surprise me with anything off the gluten free menu (except salmon). The tacos, per my husband were delicious. I received chorizo stuffed chicken. It was fabulous. I would have liked a little more spice in the sauce and more excitement in the grilled veggies, but otherwise for a gluten free meal - amazing. There were a lot of gluten free options. I was very grateful for the menu and the knowledge of the staff."}
{"text":"Came out on a Friday night for their fish fry. Surprised that a southwest restaurant had a Friday fish fry. Wonderful! The cod was beer battered using Modelo beer. The coleslaw had some apples which gave the slaw a sweet tasre. Also there were a couple cornfritters along with the fries. Service was above par. Management staff came around to tables checking on customers, which was a nice touch. Place is busy, suggest a reservation on the weekends."}
{"text":"Sooooo good!!! If you must be gluten free like myself this place has great options. Enchiladas tamales rice beans and a few others that are nearly impossible to find! Definitely try the enchiladas Christmas style and a beef tamale."}
{"text":"If you go to Taliesin West, or are just looking for a great Mexican restaurant, go here!  Unlike the Blue Adobe in Mesa, this is the original -- with the original chef, and the food and service is awesome! The tamales, pulled pork, and especially the stuffed peppers are to die for.  I ate there yesterday afternoon, and I a still stuffed!  My brother from Virginia Beach recommended this place, and he was spot on!"}
{"text":"Not as good as reviews.  Can't sit outside unless u r friend of owner and not crowded.  Dishes ok. Not special. Had the carne adovada. Wait person very nice.  Host not so much. Cold inside definitely took away from the experience. Music horrible.  Not what we expected.  Rushed out in 40 spent 70 for 2."}
{"text":"I had forgotten how delicious this place was! My husband and I stopped by for a late dinner. The place was busy, live music, lots of fun. I had an incredible chicken corn chowder. My husband had a beef tenderloin crusted with panko and served with rice and a tamale. He loved it. We splurged on the sopapillas served with apples and ice cream...amazing!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I just left Blue Adobe, and this place was spot-on. Our server, Jenny, was on top of her game and you can tell she works her a** off to make it a great dining experience.   Our food maybe took one or two minutes longer than a typical restaurant, however that's because everything is fresh with an excellent presentation. And we can't rave enough about the in-house salsa. I had the chicken chimichanga, of which the chicken was freshly sliced (not just waiting in a pan in the kitchen) and the tortilla was perfectly fried. My wife had the chicken enchiladas and I don't think I've seen her this satisfied with a meal in a long time.   We'll be going back there quite a bit in the future!"}
{"text":"Still our favorite neighborhood treat.Mike is a great host and the food is consitently great,the beer chilled to perfection and the staff as attentive as you need them to be. great for lunch,brunch, dinner or happy hour."}
{"text":"Best place to eat a reasonably priced meal when staying at the Biltmore.  Service was great, as was the food.  Combined with the pleasure of looking out at the golf course during your meal and you can't get any better.  Coming early in the day?  The Bloody Mary's are top notch!"}
{"text":"This place was recommended by some local friends and it was close to the hotel.  We arrived late, 20 minutes prior to close.  We were punished  a bit by waiting for the hostess for 5 minutes, we politely asked if we could get a seat for eating and I was surprised that the response was not an immediate \"of course\".   That part aside once we were seated we had a fantastic meal.  We split a bean queso dip which was served quickly and was delicious.  I ordered the spooning relleno peppers with cheese and chorizo, breaded and fried, a huge plate with 2 relleno and rice and beans, very tasty.  The house salsa is homemade and very good as well.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"So yummy! I had the chorizo stuffed chicken which was great, but my favorite was the chicken corn chowder - best I've ever had. Husband had the chip chop salad with pulled pork which was fantastic. The service was great, too and food came out quickly. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"We been here a few times and had a positive experience each time. I usually get the garden enchiladas. The margaritas are great. Love the decor."}
{"text":"I actually lived in Santa Fe, New Mexico for half my life and probably experienced some of the best cuisine in the world. This place was recommended to us by 3 people for the authentic green Chile enchiladas and the salmon sandwich. Well I'm here to tell you that the only good thing about this restaurant were the chips we ordered and the salsa that came with it. The salsa had a nice kick to it. Salmon sandwich was overcooked and enchiladas with Chile were just ok.  The restaurant is decently decorated and has a nice patio with misters on it and I can see where it would be an ok place to have a drink if you want to look at a parking lot but if you want to talk about the food we ordered, we had a bland meal here, so so service from a distracted waitress and just an all out basic bland experience."}
{"text":"Great drink, food, and service.  Have been here numerous times and all have been a pleasure. The bartenders are always on top of their game!  I met up with a friend here a few weeks ago, and we were pleasantly suprised to walk in to some great live music.We ate a chronic dinner, and followed our meals with their ridiculously good \"Chocolate Chip Pie\".    Blue Adobe has something for everyone. Their tequila selection is the best in the neighborhood, and the barkeeps can whip up a proper margarita!  The pulled pork adobo sandwich is money!!  Always a pleasure coming here."}
{"text":"Was searching for restaurants in the area during spring training.  I have eaten there two years in a row and the food has been terrific and the price is right. Love going to this place."}
{"text":"This is a great establishment to have in the neighborhood. The owner and employees have always been exceptionally friendly when I've been here.   I haven't made my way through much of the menu because the nachos  (\"Navidachos\" because they have red and green Hatch chili sauce) are some of the best I've ever had. I'm usually not impressed by nachos...typically the first few chips are nice, but that's about it. Blue Adobe's nachos have excellent shredded beef in generous portions. A table of 4 could easily share the Navidachos, each have a bowl of soup and call it a meal.  I'm a big fan of the enchiladas here too. Seriously, though, I could put their Hatch chili sauce on anything and be a big fan of it."}
{"text":"I would like to write a bad review because I know I could get a free please forgive us make up dinner. I cannot and I must be honest.......the food is always consistent. The service is always great. The atmosphere is always enjoyable including the live music.  Good place for date night or a group of friends."}
{"text":"Good food and lots of things on the menu.  Nice option of indoor and outdoor seating.  Be warned, it's always too cold inside because they run tons of fans.  Also, they keep switching their happy hour rules.  One time, you can enjoy happy hour anywhere in the restaurant and then the next time, you have to sit in the bar.  Not accommodating to families.   It would be nice to see happy hour anywhere."}
{"text":"This is an incredible Mexican restaurant! I truly have not been to such a wonderful place with tremendous authentic Mexican food with a flair.  The service and people are incredible and the prices are very fair.  It's got it all: friendly and efficient service, good food, A great location, and great prices. I will be back here when I'm next in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Our lunch here was really delicious! The abodabo was tender and flavorful without being overly spicy. The tamale was excellent and the multi colored chips and salsa also really good. The waitress was friendly and helpful in guiding us to less spicy choices. We didn't have margaritas, but are always happy to find Dos Equis amber on tap."}
{"text":"I wish we would've gone somewhere else for my mother's birthday. My family has always gone to the other Blue Adobe location and after hearing this is the sister location we were very excited. We booked a reservation ahead. The staff was friendly and the place was clean but those would be the only thumbs up I'd give.   First, the menu. Why did they chose such an odd and confusing layout for the menu? It was hard to follow. We each ordered and received our food about 30-45 minutes later. Why so long? I could sense the staff still felt uncomfortable about the menu and process. We had a server come to us twice explaining the items we had just ordered weren't available. That there were no vegetarian options for certain dishes in which we had already ordered twenty minutes prior.   Once the food came out half our dinner party was disappointed. The soft tacos were plain as was my mother's Chile relleno. On her own birthday.   Disorganized and mediocre food. Not worth the price nor time. Hope they can get it together."}
{"text":"Made a reservation Wed afternoon for Friday at 5:30. Got to the restaurant on time and walked in the door and at the host stand there were 3 employees and 1 other customer. No one acknowledged us, nothing. Couple minutes later we told the girl at the desk we had reservations. She all we have open is outside. It was still 106 degrees outside. I asked again nothing available inside? No. So we left. Was one of our favorite places, was being the key word. Won't be back. Bummer that there wasn't someone more responsive at the host stand willing to do anything to help instead of stand there and look at us."}
{"text":"We love this place- it's our regular Mexican go to spot!!!"}
{"text":"We just can't say enough about this place. Happened upon it by accident and have been back half a dozen times. The food actually has flavor! And lots of it. Great variety in dishes, awesome service, and fantastic atmosphere. We live 45 minutes away and look forward to making the drive!"}
{"text":"Blue Adobe is definitely one of my favorite places to go for tacos. I ordered my usual lazy shredded beef tacos with double rice. Their beans taste similar to cafeteria food so I skip on those. The tacos and rice were perfect.   My daughter ordered the chicken (the go-to food for picky kids). I was baffled to see she only received 3 small pieces of chicken. Granted, she loved the taste, but if you're going to charge $7.95 for kids plates, you could add a little bit more food or lower the price. Restaurants usually have kids menus for no more than $5 bucks. That's the only reason I gave 4 stars.   Besides that, food is always amazing. Staff was amazing. This will forever be my taco place!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here due to their stellar Yelp review. They did not disappoint. All 4 of us enjoyed our lunch. The Mac n Cheese got the highest rating of all!!"}
{"text":"Not a bad place to grab a beer or a glass of wine, margaritas could be better (very sweet).  Inexpensive, casual atmosphere and nice staff.  The happy hour food is not my favorite though.  Actually, it tastes like they just grab a bunch of frozen junk at Costco, reheat & pass off as their own.  Will try one of their dinner entrees some time to see if it's any better."}
{"text":"Delicious food! We had the lobster dip and the garlic shrimp pizza. Both were really good. I would give 5 stars, except the service wasn't very good. Still, I'll gladly go back."}
{"text":"We go here nearly every week because I love the carne adovada, although we'll eventually make our way through the entire menu.  The stacked enchiladas get rave reviews, but you do need to like cheese.  I like the adovada lettuce wrap, too, though it's more like an iceberg wedge than wraps."}
{"text":"Been here twice now and both times were really good. Service has been very good both times and they have a nice outdoor patio area. Chips and homemade salsa are a great way to start.  The corn chowder is great as a lunch alone or just a cup with something else from the menu. Our table tried a variety of menu items and everyone enjoyed their meal.  Will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"We went here because it was down the street, but it totally exceeded expectations. Margaritas, wine, steak, and enchiladas were all savory and delicious. We'll be back."}
{"text":"We dined at Blue Adobe Santa Fe Grille on Frank Lloyd Wright Blvd on Friday. Our server was BRANDON...this was the first time we had Brandon as our server...HE's WONDERFUL!  The FOOD was FABULOUS, as usual...thanks to the chef!  Our service from Brandon was exceptional...if we didn't know better, we'd have thought he was an owner!  He kept us informed of the status of our order and checked back after the dinners arrived...he chatted-us-up for short intervals during our dinner...as does Michael, the owner!  He was attentive to all of his tables as well.  Brandon is definitely an asset to Blue Adobe Santa Fe Grille! We have dined at Blue Adobe Santa Fe Grille for ~10 years now.  We always enjoy our dinners at Blue Adobe Santa Fe Grille and look forward to future dinners there!"}
{"text":"The food was great. I had an issue with my server Eddy who was too busy talking with his co-workers to bring us napkins, refills on our drinks, or the margarita I ordered 20 minutes ago. When I asked to speak to a manager Diana came over, she seemed over worked, frazzled, and looked like she hated even being at work. I explained to her how bad the service was and she proceeded to give me excuse after excuse about how busy they were. There were only about 6 small groups eating. Once again the food was great but the service was less than what I expected."}
{"text":"I'm a chile fiend. So I was happy to try this place out while house hunting. They have an affordable happy hour, margaritas made without that slightly neon mixer.   I am surprised it wasn't busy when I went, because the food is really good and my server couldn't have been nicer. It was a new cuisine for me, so she answered all my questions.   The green chile salsa still sticks in my mind as a reason to return."}
{"text":"Fantastic dinning experience, Michael and his staff provided a great  atmosphere and better dinning experience. Sat at the bar, great selection of micro brews.  My meal consisted of the Chilean Sea Bass, with a side of shrimp enchiladas. The bass was nicely blackened, the shrimp flavorful. Even the rice was above average.  I would recommend Blue Adobe to anyone looking for a casual atmosphere, friendly service, and favorable food."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch on a Monday afternoon. The host was pretty nice and entertaining and we were promptly seated on the patio. The service was okay. I ordered a shredded beef enchilada and carne adovada combo, and I really loved the enchilada and shredded beef, but the carne adovada was pretty bland, and the rice and beans were really not that great.  But perhaps I am just not used to this Southwestern type of rice and beans. I also thought the menu was somewhat confusing. The chips and salsa were pretty good. Overall it was a fairly good experience; eating that great enchilada on the patio was memorable; but I do think this place is just a bit overpriced for lunch."}
{"text":"I picked up a jar of fresh-made salsa and chips for the Superbowl party I was attending last Sunday because they are that outstanding!  They were a big hit!    If you are dining at the Blue Adobe, definitely try the chips and salsa.  I am not a big fan of chipotle seasoning... it is definitely one of the key ingredients, but regardless I think it tastes great.  If you like it, you can buy a jar of the fresh salsa and take it home with you for about $9 (it is a good sized jar)."}
{"text":"Ashley was great! Came in for a beer and ended up with posole! Yum it was delicious, I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"We met with family at Blue Adobe recently.  I had the Cruz Kitchen plate (Chile Relleno, Tenderloin and Carne Adovada) and my wife had the Carne Adovada.   The red chile on my Cruz Kitchen plate was delightfully spicy but not a challenge.   The Chile Relleno was crisp on the outside but not soggy or overdone. The tenderloin was wonderful.  The Carne Adovada was wonderful.  My wife enjoyed the prickly pear margarita with dinner.   All in all a very solid restaurant to add to our New Mexican cuisine rotation."}
{"text":"Another fabulous meal at BA!  Absolutely fabulous employees who know our names, our \"usual\" drinks! Live music is especially fun! Local place, local people, loyal staff, Awesome and consistent food! Owners, managers, bar and wait staff is by far the best around! Thank you Blue Adobe"}
{"text":"Went last night for the first time.  Asked if we wanted salsa and guacamole. Sure....food was good. Comped our second round of drinks, which was nice. Got the bill and the guacamole was $9. Didn't tell us when we said ok. Rum and coke $10! Really?  We'll go again but this place won't have the crowd that Jimmys had.  I'll go to Teakwoods! Bill almost $70. Very nice staff. I wish Jimmys hadn't closed!!!"}
{"text":"**Original review from 6/2/2011. Updating new profile.**  I went to visit a friend up in N Scottsdale and we decided to try this place with our families. I had no expectations going in. I was just hungry.  We were seated almost immediately. There were 7 of us, so prepping a table was in order. Immediately we were introduced to our waiter and drink orders taken.   They served the complimentary chips and salsa. I could have satisfied my hunger with that. The chips (and those who know me well, know I am not a chip person, nor a salt person.) were not salty, not oily, and the salsa was so delicious!! It had a great roasted flavor and just enough heat to satisfy me, but not spoil my taste for my dinner. Yum....  I ordered the seafood enchiladas. My friend ordered the chorizo stuffed chicken. Once my friend to her first bite, she was hooked. I actually heard a groan of satisfaction escape her. That says a lot considering she ran her own restaurant and is pickier than I am with my food. My seafood enchiladas were delicious! The seafood wasn't rubbery and overcooked. The salmon inside was tender and perfectly cooked. They didn't tell me what the catch of the day was though. I didn't care. It was GOOD. The side dishes were good too. I was happy to hear that the pinto beans were cooked with a chicken stock and not pork products. Whew!  Since this was my first trip, I am hoping that they are consistent. I want to go back."}
{"text":"good but NOT amazing.   My Dinner - ordered stacked enchiladas - not impressed with the quantity at all. Such a small serving with too much rice and beans for such a high price  My Dessert - really good - chocolate chip cookie  His Dinner - chicken chimichanga - edible but not impressive  His Dessert - crem brulee - very good   We give it 3 stars because it was a good meal but not amazing...wouldn't go again  Still looking for an amazing mexican spot that isn't a dive!"}
{"text":"We arrived with a group of 10 people - all foodies. the service was great, but the food was even better. Michael is a gem.  There is some really interesting and unusual stuff on the menu and we tried many dishes - all were really good.  Don't miss this place.  It's great...."}
{"text":"two stars based solely on the bar and happy hour. Service sucked and happy hour prices don't make me happy"}
{"text":"Passed this strip mall place a thousand times, finally tried t out. Much better than I expected... Food was original, very well prepared, and extremely delicious. I had a pork adobada thingy (spelling???), and my Wife had a southwestern chicken pasta bowl that was really great! Service was outstanding, replenished our chips and salsa numerous times. No 4 star rating for the lack of ambience- Sort of a sports bar mentality, not a date place or fine dining room. Great place, otherwise!"}
{"text":"Best chile rellenos ever!  Quick and friendly service.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We tried Blue Adobe Grille last night and it was fantastic.  The food, drinks and service were all A+.  We will absolutely return and recommend this place to anyone who likes  Mexican/Tex-Mex cuisine both authentic and with a smoky pecan wood twist.  Try it, you will not be disappointed here."}
{"text":"Was amazing. I Had the chorizo stuffed chicken and my daughter had Carne adovada. My granddaughter had the open faced cheese crisp, fruit and the strawberry lemonade.   Such great service, food and atmosphere. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Overall, the food was great and the service was wonderful! We had the double barreled enchiladas and they we're delicious."}
{"text":"We love this place! It is nearby our house and the food is excellent. When family visits from out of state, we like taking them here on nights with live music. Great food, service, food, atmosphere and musicians."}
{"text":"To start of with Blue Adobe Grill has great service. Our server Daniel was on top of his game and made us feel welcome. As Mexican food being one of our favorites we thought this would be a great place to try. I'm disappointed to say that the best thing we ate of the night was the chips and salsa. Yes the manager fixed what was wrong and apologized once he came over and talked to us. However, my moms chimichanga was way undercooked and not stuffed. My Carne Adovada was supposed to have a smoky flavor to it, and it did not. When the manager asked me what was wrong with it I told him that it tasted as if it had been burnt or cooked to long. He then told he tasted it himself and said I was tasting a smoky flavor not a burnt one. As someone who is pursing a career in Culinary I'm 100 percent sure I know the difference between something being smoky and something that has been burnt. In conclusion I would not go back again. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"We have been coming here since they opened years ago but never posted a review so this is long overdue. We come as often as we can with friends for Taco Tuesday and occasional weekend visits. Never a bad meal here, have had almost everything on the menu. Not to fond of traditional Mexican fare so their New Mexican style is what I like.  Michael the owner always stops by our table for a chat and makes us feel welcome and part of the family. Bartender Rob knows how to make our drinks perfectly the way we like. Blue Adobe has become our favorite neighborhood place and we bring all of our out of town visitors there to their delight."}
{"text":"Every visit we've made to Blue Adobe has been a great experience. The food is authentic NM style which is much different than Mexican or Tex-Mex. Our favorite choices are the Spooning Rellenos and Cruz Kitchen. Their red and green sauces are both delicious. Wine pours are generous. Servers pleasant and professional. The owner is frequently present and is very customer oriented. Prices are reasonable. They have a pleasant patio which is where we usually sit. They do have live music inside on certain nights, too.  This is a super place. Give it a try if you haven't!"}
{"text":"A few of us stopped here for happy hour because we heard the patio and the margaritas were great.  This was definitely true!  The patio is perfect: nice tables, feels comfy and ceiling heaters for the chilly nights.  We all ordered Cruz Caddy margaritas since they were on special.  We had chips, salsa and guacamole to go along with our drinks.  Everything was really good.  Our server was lovely, she made sure we were always looked after and had full drinks."}
{"text":"Delicious everything from start to finish. A bit noisy due to music at the bar but very festive. Fun place with great food and ample portions."}
{"text":"Second time there and I'm compelled to write.   Please don't ever confuse this place with the historic Pink Adobe restaurant in Santa Fe, New Mexico.   First of all..  as an (almost) native Santa Fean, I don't find much on menu that is \"New Mexican\". And the food that is \"New Mexican\" doesn't really measure up to the food served in restaurants from Santa Fe and Taos. The green \"chiles\" are really bland and I suspect not from Hatch.  (Even though I've been told they are)   Secondly:  why are Arizona \"New Mexican\" restaurants so much more expensive than Santa Fe and Taos?    Onto the food:  The green chile chicken enchiladas are OK, it just seems that they never put enough green chile sauce or cheese on them which again as a New Mexican, is unheard of.   Additionally, chimichangas (Tex-Mex) are not supposed to be soggy with gigantic cuts of un shredded roast beef.  Just an FYI...  The green chile corn chowder is just \"ok\". Again. Not much flavor. If I order green chile corn chowder, I want to know the green chile is in there.   The chicken quesadilla is probably the best thing I've had there.  However the salsas are not.   Lastly nine dollars for an ice cream scoop size of guacamole is ridiculous.   And 13 dollars for small margaritas?  Ok then...  save yourself a dollar and get a horny toad margarita at Maria's the next time you're in Santa Fe..  Oh. And the patio?  Good idea but since it's basically in the parking lot, not too great on atmosphere.   For as expensive as this place is, I really had high hopes. But no...    I give two stars because I like their rice."}
{"text":"Good Tex-Mex, go for lunch, it is the same as the dinner menu, but less expensive.  I love everything there, the rellenos are great.  I also love the candies they give out at the door.  The service has always been good.  Eat here now, the prices constantly go up!  The restrooms are tucked away by the bar, nice private clean stalls and stocked, 4 Flushes."}
{"text":"Another favorite local place with authentic delicious food.  Always good service whether eating inside or out. TV's for the sport fans so you don't have to miss a game!    Taco Tuesday is a hit."}
{"text":"Ran across this place on accident, but glad I did.  Good food, live music, good drinks and awesome staff.  Will definitely be back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"There was nothing drastically wrong, but there was nothing memorable either. We were in town for a week and had several people refer us to this place, so we were excited to try it. Sadly i can get better SW/mexican food in Minneapolis. The highlight was the salsa you get before the meal. Very different unique flavor that we really enjoyed."}
{"text":"Excellent local restaurant. . Fire roasted salsa is yummy,  as well the salmon wraps and stacked enchiladas with Christmas sauce."}
{"text":"Thanks to all who gave Blue Adobe a positive review. We went there and were thrilled with the results! I like that they serve unusual Mexican dishes and Santa Fe Southwestern cuisine. That is hard to find. Our dishes were outstanding- the pork shoulder with adobo sauce and the shrimp with a Asiago sauce. Service was attentive and the atmosphere is fun. And don't miss the killer margaritas!"}
{"text":"YUM! Highly recommended - the stacked enchiladas were excellent and the salsa is to die for."}
{"text":"Blue adobe grille is a wonderful restaurant with its exciting Mexican dishes. One thing I love about the restaurant is that they give free chips that are warm and delicious. Another great dish was the chimichangas, which were fresh and cooked just right! We walked into the restaurant and wanted delicious food and they gave us delicious food. Usually, I would give the restaurant five stars. However, I ordered a sprite and they filled it up with ice. It didn't really matter because drinks are refillable. I would be coming back."}
{"text":"This was our first time here and we will be back! The chef has a great feel for Mexican food. The contemporary take on each dish with spices and presentation was great! I highly recommend!!!!  Best salsa I've ever eaten! And you can buy take home!!!!"}
{"text":"Service was good but the food was blah.  I had stacked enchiladas and my husband had combo plate.  The chicken in both the enchilada and burrito were plentiful but essential tasted the same.  The enchilada had cheese but the burrito was just chicken!  No lettuce, pico, nothing but chicken.  My stacked enchilada was essentially the same too, lots of chicken and cheese.  I think the food is better at Taco Bell were at least you get some garnish.  I have no idea why people are rating this place so highly!"}
{"text":"Great new place in the neighborhood!  Excellent food and service. Chip chop salad was delicious and very filling! Pozole was so good too. We were very pleased with our first visit not to mention they were playing great 80's music over the speakers the night were here :)"}
{"text":"There's an outdoor seating area, which is nice. The interiors are simply beautiful, and there's a bar and TV where ESPN is playing. Sometimes a musician is playing in the corner with a guitar and usually he's okay. The place is not usually packed on weekdays, but the weekends and Friday nights are pretty full. If you have a large group of people, I recommend reservations. The waiters up front are really nice. The kids menus have super cute triangular prism shaped crayons. The food is great too. Chips and salsa come free. For an appetizer, I like the Hatch Catch, which is a little bit of everything. Crab cakes, fried tortilla chips, and grilled prawns with a really good lobster dip. I tried the corn chowder, but I found it overbearingly sweet. It was good for the first ten spoons, but afterwards it was too much sweetness, at least for my taste.  One minus is the greasiness of the food. It's not too bad, but bad enough to make you feel like you just came out of McDonalds. Overall, I like the atmosphere, and the food, for me, is a hit or miss. ;)"}
{"text":"Came here after a round of golf round for dinner  Service: 1. Our server Alex was amazing. She took care of my group and she was super attentive. 2. Management is not that great when a. Order was incorrect  Ambiance: 1. We sat outside to enjoy the wonderful az weather  Food: 1. OMG, the food is amazing here.  Recommendation: The raspberry pork tenderloin  The hatch catch"}
{"text":"This place rules.  The service is fast and friendly and the food is amazing.  Coming from Detroit, I was a little intimidated by the menu at first  because I had never seen half of what was on it.  The first time I went I ordered the salmon BLT which put me off when it arrived because it wasn't a sandwich at all.  Of course it ended up being one of the most delicious things I'd ever eaten and I have returned several times to try other dishes.  The wait staff are great and always take time to explain the menu to newcomers.  I've never waited more than a minute or two for a drink and the food flies out pretty fast as well (I guess it has to, this place is always packed for dinner)."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I've been here several times and everything on the menu sounds great, but I keep getting the carne adovada stacked enchilladas (Christmas style with a fried egg). Its just incredible.  The roasted salsa before the meal is also some of the best I've had and they have excellent prices on specials every night."}
{"text":"Great dining experience. Excellent service , fun environment and courteous staff. Food was on point. Amazing salsa and guacamole. Food is fresh, well prepared and generous portions. Will visit again. Great outdoor patio and live music."}
{"text":"My wife & I met my parents for dinner at Blue Adobe looking for something different we haven't tried before.  We met at 6 p.m. on a Saturday night and were seated promptly.  Alex was our waitress on this night and she was awesome!  She always made sure our glasses were full and checked back on us from time to time.  We started out with the complimentary chips and their homemade fire roasted salsa that was killer.  I had a frothy strawberry margarita to start with and it was blended perfectly.  it was so good I had 2!  For dinner I was in the mood for a steak so I had the Jala Holla Steak.  it was a beef tenderloin served with a jalapeno hollandaise sauce, shrimp enchilada, rice and beans.  The steak was cooked medium and was perfectly tender.  You could cut it with a butter knife, seriously it was that tender.  I would order this again.  It was a perfect balance of flavors.  For dessert all of us at the table split this plate with a flattened sopapilla filled with cooked cinnamon apples and vanilla ice cream.  Very good and very big.  It's a dessert built for 2+.  We will be back.  They have a nice patio where you can eat at that I would love to sit at next time we go."}
{"text":"Delicious food and friendly service! Quality food worth every penny. Family friendly."}
{"text":"Ate there for the first time recently.I ordered the oscar medallion filet,topped with blue crab, excellent as was the lobster con queso,shared by me and a friend. My buddy ate the green chili burger and was equally impressed. Place immaculate, service great ( Nathan) . All in all a top shelf experience.Will return for sure and highly recommend.Manager came to table and thanked us for our business,impressive!"}
{"text":"Really great atmosphere and service. Aubrey is the best server. Excellent food quality and value. They have a really nice patio and bar too. Highly recommend this restaurant if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Mike Savoy and the crew at the Blue Adobe know how to cook excellent, savory dishes, much to enjoy. Perhaps you will recognize Mike as he is s hair model for GQ Magazine. We are regulars and keep comedy back."}
{"text":"i Live right by this place but i never stopped in because it doesn't look appealing from the outside.  But after trying most other restaurants in the area and my need for something quick and close kicked in I decided to give this place a try.   GLAD I did.   It was actually very good.   THey give you chips and salsa to start.  And quite a big portion as well.   It was delicious.   I ordered the taco salad.   They call it a different name but that's pretty much what it is.   ANd that was delicious as well.   It also came with these large cracker looking deep fried chips that were awesome.   My friend had some chicken and rice which looked great and my friend said tasted great as well.  I will definetely be going back soon.    One of my faves for mexican food.    The only reason for not the 5th star was because although the service was nice and pleasant everytime we needed something we had to flag our server down.   She wasn't too attentive.   So overall 4 stars in my book and I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"We were a little put off to see this restaurant in a strip mall, but from the moment you walk in, it is Southwest all the way. Decor is cozy. Staff are friendly, and the food is fantastic. We started prickly pear margaritas and the house salsa with chips. I forgot to ask if they sell it by the bottle! Then the 3-dip Dippity Do Dah. Guac, mango and bean dips, all fabulous. The menu is innovative, and it was hard to decide, it all looks good. I had Ocean Front, NM, a seafood plate with 3 items, the shrimp relleno was incredible. \"Shrimp Cocktail Relleno on a painted plate of Shrimp Cocktail Sauce, Lobster Tamale with Mango Salsa & Raspberry Chipotle. Crab Cake Taco with Cilantro Tartar Sauce\" Portions are huge. If I am back in the area, I will return!"}
{"text":"Amazing service! The waitress was so friendly and helpful and the manager was even better! The food was really wonderful as well. I got the garden vegetable enchiladas and they were so delicious! Definitely bringing my friends and family back here!"}
{"text":"Wow. . .sooooo awful what a shock. . .we had a very broad range of food from 4 bean con queso, guac, special cheese/tortilla concoction to chimiganga, enchiladas, tacos, pork tamale, shrimp relleno. The smoky salsa was really good and these other items were just the opposite.   . .either bland or just \"slop\". This is so hard to absorb given the reviews, the busy restaurant with a wait when we left. Just. Plainly. Awful. If you like this kind of stuff then you have no business reviewing on Yelp. The end. :("}
{"text":"GREAT FOOD. We had seen the great reviews on Yelp and decided to give it a try. The atmosphere was very fun and rustic, which I loved. The food was excellent. We had a big group and they were very accommodating and it gave us the opportunity to try many different menu items. Everything we tried was great! We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"I have no idea what this restaurant is all about but the menu is so confusing and it doesn't make sense.  Then forget about the good, I can get a steak at the corner food truck.   My steak came in with a sauce on top which I had for no sauce.   It looked like some kind of hollandaise sauce.  I sent it back and within a minute a got a new steak, wow!  That's fast!  But unfortunately it was the same steak I just sent back.  They scraped it off and flipped it.   My families  dinners were also horrible.  Never again!"}
{"text":"The Blue Adobe serves excellent  Santa Fe and New Mexican cuisine.  Sorry, there's no Tex-Mex, or piled high nachos or sizzling fajitas here.  New Mexican food focuses on Hatch green chiles and what they call a Christmas Tree sauce, that is half red and green.    In New Mexico they put the green chile in and on almost everything, from bagels to burgers*.  You can even get dried red New Mexico chile pepper pod as Christmas ornaments in Santa Fe!  The Blue Adobe was founded by Chef Jose Leyva. It was his ability to deliver spice while maintaining incredible flavor that makes Blue Adobe different. As they advertise: \"Our Fire Wood Grille uses Pecan Wood and our Chilies are Hatch.\"  One of the hallmark of Blue Adobe is their Fire-roasted Salsa and tri-color chips. These are so popular, you can order a 27 oz jar to take some home. On our most recent trip, we started off with this, along with an order of Guacamole ($5.95).   One of us had their shredded beef Chimichanga ($14.95).  Very flavorful and not overly spicy. We also tried their High Desert Pasta ($13.95), which had a delicious EVOO garlic and Asiago sauce, served on a Tortilla (photo).    For dessert, we had a New Mexican favorite of sopapillas with honey.  It's a very special puff dessert for only $1.50, and is not on the menu.  Our bill, including three drinks came to a fair $66.73 including taxes, but before tip.  Everything was delicious and exquisite. And, yes we're a fan of the Blue Adobe!  Enjoy!  I have created a Santa Fe and Taos list, if you would like to know more about the area and cuisine: http://www.yelp.com/list/taos-or-santa-fe-nm-santa-fe  * If you are interested, there is actually a blog for the New Mexico's Green Chile Cheeseburger Trail: http://www.santafe.com/blogs/read/new-mexicos-green-chile-cheeseburger-trail"}
{"text":"visited again last night with out of town friends.  We each had different meals and one was better than the next.  Highly recommend the seafood kabobs, done New Mexican style.  GREAT salsa VERY reasonably priced wine.  Some clever margaritas.  Well worth the visit.  Good vibe to the place, as well!"}
{"text":"Ah-amazing!  Definitely hits the restaurant trifecta with great atmosphere, great service, and outstanding food!   Visited after a long day of hiking, so was probably under dressed, but not made to feel out of place. Enjoyed the patio and a draft beer (probably only real drawback was lack of much selection in draft)   But their house made salsa is to die for!! And found you could even purchase a jar to take home!   The waiter recommended the enchilada stack as a house favorite and I completely understand why! A fresh take on the standard enchilada with the note tender pork I've ever had at a Mexican restaurant! I'm pretty sure any dish would have been great, but this one was outstanding!   Fresh, tasty, and perfect for a casual dining outside of your ordinary Mexican place."}
{"text":"First off I will say I am a New Mexican and have lived in NM most of my life so I came into this place thinking I was going to be disappointed. Well... I was wrong. Blue Adobe knows how to make some killer New Mexican dishes. I had there Carne Adovada enchiladas which were excellent. The Carne Adovada was tender and cooked to perfection. Chips and salsa were also really good although there chile and salsa could of been hotter it was still good. The only thing I was disappointed with were there margaritas. There silver coin margarita was weak and not worth the 10 bucks."}
{"text":"Favorite entree of 2018. So good. I actually ordered the\"last night's meat loaf\". I never ever order red meat.  It was suggested and I gave it a try.  So happy I did. It was perfect in all aspects.  You'll luv this and you'll be happy you did."}
{"text":"Food and service were outstanding. Waitress recommended the spinach dip..... Incredible. Like no spin dip we have ever had. Wife had raspberry pork loin. It was the most tender piece of pork either one of us had ever tasted and the flavor was sweet but not overwhelming. I had the tex-mex pasta and chicken. Delicious and not too filling."}
{"text":"My cousin was in town last week and we picked somewhere we both hadn't been, we had a lovely evening! The white Sangria hit the spot, the food was delicious, the atmosphere was great, the live music was nice background noise and our server Alex was fantastic (Seriously. Super attentive, gave great advise and had a big, beautiful smile!)!!! I loved the New Mexico decor and vibe, would definitley dine here again!"}
{"text":"The food was very good. This is a definite would go back type of place but not one of my \"take the out of town friends to\" type of places. The best part each time I go is always the salsa. I'm not typically one for a super chunky salsa but the flavor is amazing. This is the type of place you can take a picky eater to and still get a slight culinary experience as well. The menu has a number of great options worth checking out."}
{"text":"This place has quickly become one of our favorites! My mom loves the mango salsa on the dippity do appetizer. I love the Moscow mules and chicken chimichangas. My husband is from New Mexico and has lived everything he's tried, but he ate the meatloaf tonight and I think that's his new favorite! My kids (6,4) ate their entire Mac and cheese and chicken finger meals and their ice cream too!! Service is great and the atmosphere is perfect. So glad we have this gem in our neighborhood!! Try it out...you won't be disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"We live super close to this restaurant but rarely dine here. Prices are a little high and when you have kids, it get expensive. Don't get me wrong, the food is delicious and I suggest you trying it if you're visiting the area. With the amount of Mexican restaurants, Id rather visit somewhere else where the prices are affordable."}
{"text":"I give them 5 stars because they are 5 stars. Our server Maddy was a Super Stars also. Beautiful looking and very tasty food. So many choices. There are plenty of places to get Mexican food in Scottsdale,  but if you want more than the usual beans and rice, check out this home run joint."}
{"text":"This restaurant is SO tasty!  I had the lobster macaroni and my husband had the Christmas enchiladas, both were fantastic.  We also got the dippity doo dah appetizer which was a trio of dips (beans, mango salsa and guacamole). All of it was great.  The atmosphere was lovely.  There was music playing, but it was at a level where you could have a conversation.  And the service was phenomenal.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Kaitlyn, is a remarkable server and person.  She will be a success for sure.   The Resturant is great.  Food terrific.  In addition we met the manager who is quite pleasant and a plus for sure."}
{"text":"Always outstanding!  Food will knock your socks off.  The cooks need an award, never in 10 yrs had a bad meal. Management is.....your lucky if you hire JR as your manger. Waitstaff if spot on. Atmosphere is upbeat and love the music. 10 stars always. See ya soon."}
{"text":"We were still on a search for New Mexican food and I read up on this place and it was also recommended by a friend.  It was average, not very New Mexican.  I tried the pecan grilled shrimp tacos and they were good! My boyfriend got the stacked enchiladas which was just ok.  Still on the hunt for good New Mexican food in AZ."}
{"text":"Great food with generous portions. Lots of different flavors using chiles and regional spices, herbs and ingredients. Fantastic staff & service.  It was busy on the Saturday night during dinner but we didn't wait.  This place is a winner!! Try it."}
{"text":"My favorite New Mexico Mexican food restaurant in the entire valley. The senses come alive from the moment you step out of your car and take in the aroma a pecan wood smoking the meat you will soon savor. The \"Cruz Kitchen Signature\" is a great combo where you can taste a variety from their kitchen. Absolute favorite is the Carne Adovada. The servings are huge enough to share, but you won't want to!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Waitress and greeter fantastic. Love the salsa chips and Santa Fe style food. The dish not on the menu but put it back on lobster dip grilled shrimp crab cakes  love it. Hubby had the green chili pork. Not enough pork too much radish and potato's. Great flavor tho. I'll be back again"}
{"text":"Several years ago this place was not quite as good. It is close to where I live so I have been going back. Each time recently it has been better and better and deserves five stars. Great service, live music on Saturdays, and really good margaritas which is vitally important."}
{"text":"Bland Tex mex for those afraid of real Mexican flavors, and despite the name there was little NewMexican on the menu. I could best describe it as eating at a hotel style meal.  We opted to sit on the patio and enjoy the nice weather, it was odd that we were escorted out of the front door to get to the patio. The lighting was dim making it hard to read the menu.   The chips and salsa did not arrive for over 10 minutes which is a bit odd. Some one at the table ordered a bean dip appetizer that came in a small dish, and was a bit lacking of flavor. The tri color chips looked nice but were a bit stale and the salsa lacked any green chilies spice I would expect from a NewMexcan spot.  I went with the Enchanted Garden Enchiladas, with red and green sauce, The veggies inside were crisp but the enchilada sauces again were very bland and spice less, the rice and beans were nothing special. $11.95.  Aside from the lack of flavor the other issue was the long wait, in all it took 1:25 to eat here, waiting for the meal and then the check seemed like an eternity.  I say go elsewhere for Mex style food."}
{"text":"Another great meal.  Wonderful ambience outdoors.  The misters kept the temperature perfect.  Excellent service.  Excellent food."}
{"text":"The menu had a wide variety of options which satisfied each person in our party of four.  The food was hot and flavorful. Some of the prices seemed high, while other prices were expected.  The environment was comfortable and family friendly."}
{"text":"Good local place the carne anob...is really good.....margaritas are awesome...If u live in the area u will probably run into someone u know."}
{"text":"Great food, ambience and friendly, attentive service!  A neighborhood gem!  Great for groups, happy hour, family...you name it...it's the place to dine for ALL!  Sit inside or out, at the bar or at a table...  I've never had anything that I didn't like.  Try BLUE ADOBE...you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I was in town for a quick get away and wanted some good ambiance and food.  Little did I know I'd be happily surprised with the Prickly pear margarita.  I wish Blue Adobe Grill was closer to San Jose, CA so I can have it all the time!  As for the food, the portions were huge and everything tasted great.  We basically had to roll ourselves outta there."}
{"text":"This is a busy place with an inexperienced waitstaff. The restaurant is located a pretty good hike from mainstream Scottsdale, so the advantage is little, to no tourists.   The servers are covering a lot of tables and the menu is extremely broad, maybe too broad for the kitchen. It seems they are Southwest, but there's no rhyme or reason behind the pizza's and other items on the menu. I tried a combo plate and thought this was ok. The tamale was a bit dry but the tenderloin relleno was really good.   Reasonable prices, good food, ok Ambiance and fair service."}
{"text":"We ate here twice the week we were in Scottsdale. The food is good for the price, the service is friendly and the place was packed both nights we  went.  We especially enjoyed the soups.  They also have great outdoor seating."}
{"text":"I am not a big fan of Margaritas so I didn't know what to order to drink.  I decided to try the Sangria and was very happy with my choice.  For dinner I had The \"47\" Ranch which is kind of a combination plate.   It was a lot of food enough to share or take some home for tomorrow's lunch(which is what I did).  Great food, great atmosphere, we will be back"}
{"text":"My husband and I used to go to this location back when it was something different.  We happened to drive by today and decided to try it and boy howdy I'm glad we did. The restaurant is totally remodeled and the bar is beautiful. We started with the cheese curds and they were yummy. Conner took amazing care of us and the chili relleno was DELICIOUS! We opted for veggies instead of the rice and beans and they were very nicely cooked and not soggy like some restaurants.  Their salsa is also fabulous. Major compliments to the Chef and Conner.....we will be back and will start coming back for our big group gatherings!"}
{"text":"Great margaritas, chips and salsa. Nice selection of seafood on the menu. I had the shrimp and halibut street tacos. Very tasty. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"It was hard to decide what to pick.  We had the chicken w: mushrooms and a trio of enchiladas, tamale and rellino.  Great outdoor seating.  We would go here again.  Came back for a 2nd time and had the chicken pasta and it was amazing!  Love their menu and outdoor dining."}
{"text":"I have been going to this place for over ten years but never again. We were sitting at the bar and ordered our regular guacamole and chips. We received stale chips and runny guacamole. I told the bar tender it was not good and he said it was because the avocados are not really the best right now. He said he would take it off the bill. Then we waited an abnormal amount of time after we finished our first drink to get another. I saw the bartender take the chips and guacamole over to the kitchen where Mike the manager was standing. He tasted the chips and shook his head. He never came over and apologized or asked us if we wanted fresh chips or a different order of guacamole. Nothing, not one word. After 10 years not even a word. Very unprofessional and dismissive. Needless to say we will never go back there again. We used to live close by and now we do not but we made the trip there for Mexican food. They no longer deserve our business."}
{"text":"Ordered take out tonight and it changed my life! Haha blue adobe is AMAZING!! Absolutely loved my chicken enchilada! My boyfriend ordered a hamburger and said it was in the top five he's ever had in his life!"}
{"text":"It was Saturday night and I faced a major dilemma -   I had 0 edibles in my kitchen (save for some butter and ketchup) but I was not motivated to put any effort into going out for dinner in (North) Scottsdale.  I needed something super easy and casual, so my first instinct was \"Let's go to Chilis\".  But wait, I had recently seen a review for the Blue Adobe Grill and knew it was right around the corner.  I threw on an old pair of jeans and a hoodie, hid my greasy hair with a baseball cap, and headed out.  It was exactly what I needed.  Casual environment.  No wait for a table.  Moderately priced food and a $25 gift certificate from restaurant.com purchased for $4 (god I love that website).  The food was good enough and definitely hit the spot.  I wasn't coming here for a culinary experience, I wanted something on par with Chilis and they definitely delivered and then some.  And BTW, it's not Tex-Mex as Chip suggests, it's New Mexican (which is way different).  The atmosphere was laid back, the server was friendly, and the food was bountiful.  Thanks Blue Adobe Grille for the quality alternative to Chilis."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Great service and good atmosphere. I completely recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Went here on a recommendation from a friend. Very glad we did. Great service, excellent chips and dark medium-spiced salsa. Margaritas were great too. Our entrees ranged from rellenos to nachos, salmon Caesar salad to the signature adobe plate. Everything was amazing and portions were huge! You must try this place,it's a sure bet."}
{"text":"Sat outside on Taco Tuesday. Wife had the beef tacos and I had the Spooning rellenos. Both very flavorful. Rice and beans tend to be a throw in but these were really good. We'll be back for sure and bring friends"}
{"text":"I'm trying to keep it classy since I'm in Scottsdale, but, to be honest, I feel like licking every single dish-- the salsa cups, my entree plate, and, of course, the dessert bowl. Every single bite is truly an experience! The flavors are uniquely delightful. Speaking of delightful, our waiter, Brandon, left NOTHING to be desired! His service was absolutely impeccable, and we were dumbfounded to learn he's only been here for six weeks! He was a natural, who seemed to be dishing up this friendly service for YEARS! All of this loveliness was accompanied by a lively band and beautiful ambiance. ALL of my senses are currently happy!"}
{"text":"Highend and Well thought out.  Great service!  Quite a few things I want to try on the menu!   Great to see the best of scottsdale come to gilbert!"}
{"text":"Just as good as the Mesa location.  We had an excellent experience.  And love that this location just opened within walking distance to our home.  I had the margarita flight, all 3 were delicious and full of flavor, their salsa is one of the best I've had out.  I liked the Lobster Con Queso app and my dinner was awesome; The double barrel ENCHILADAS - a must try."}
{"text":"Pretty fun atmosphere, live music, etc... Chips and salsa and guacamole were good.  I had basic cheese enchiladas, that which I judge all Mexican places, and I didn't even eat 1/2, it was made with cheddar cheese and the sauce was a red vs brown sauce, not good.  So I just filled up on chips and drinks.  My companions all liked their food, but they got entrees and seafood enchiladas."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed everything about this place. The atmosphere was great and clean (including a nice clean restroom). The margarita I got was really good and the food was outstanding. I had the Jala Holla steak which was very tender and perfectly spiced. I ordered this off the gluten free menu so I believe the enchilada was prepared a bit different than normal, but it was delicious. I am not a huge fan of shrimp so they exchanged it for chicken which was very tasty. Also want to mention that the waitress was very attentive, helpful and pleasant.  I only wish it was a bit closer so I could go there more often. :-)"}
{"text":"Solid food, just overpriced for what ya get and service can really be hit-or-miss."}
{"text":"If you are looking for New Mexican food, this is your place. I ordered the cheese enchiladas with a fried egg. It was delicious. I  highly recommend this place. Service was great"}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for lunch and had a very nice experience.   The chips and salsa were delicious.  I ordered the blackened shrimp lettuce wrap and it was a nice light but filling flavorful lunch.  My husband got the enchiladas and also really enjoyed them.  Our waiter, JR had a very fun personality and provided great service!  Nice atmosphere and reasonable prices.    We will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Of course the owners going to post public comments saying my claim is unsubstantiated, do you really expect him to take ownership of their failure? Funny how he mentions multiple co-workers and guest when there was only 1 employee that was anywhere around us & NO guests except my party. As for \"many\" seating options being offered to us read the original review again, I was offered to sit outside or at a high top & the women who checked us in very clearly stated the table we wanted to sit at was NOT reserved. Also keep in mind that the owner responding was NOT there & all his information is coming via paid employees."}
{"text":"I would totally recommend this place to everyone very nice decor and very good food I especially love the Carne adobada."}
{"text":"I was not hungry and thought I would eat a little bit with my hubby then go home. But I ended up eating the entire lobster macaroni because it was AMAZING!! For $22 you get a good amount of lobster. I also like my appetizer lobster dip. They have $2 off all margaritas on Monday and killer mango is my favorite. It's a nice place to have a date with your beloved ones"}
{"text":"Just got home from dinner.  There were 3 of us.  We had fish tacos, chimichangas and chili relleno.  A+ on all except the relleno, as it was a bit doughy.  Really like the restaurant, nice  atmosphere, great service, very prompt but way too noisy with the live music.  If we come back, it will be earlier or when weather is warmer and we can sit outside.  Just to hard to chat and the guy wasn't that good."}
{"text":"Went to Blue Adobe on Tuesday.  The Owners greeted us and remembered us from our previous visit.  Tuesday is Taco Night and a Taco Plate is only $6.99.  I ordered the taco plate and a margarita. My wife and son split the pulled pork salad.  Both meals were excellent.  The service was also impeccable. I would highly recommend the Blue Adobe."}
{"text":"Tried this place after reading the yelp reviews. First of all, great service. The salsa was outstanding. We tried two different kinds of the salsa. There was the standard salsa and spicy. I had the tamales and they were the best I've ever had! Can't wait to try more. The bottled beer wasn't as cold as we like it. And the lights in the restaurant were a little bright."}
{"text":"Wonderful food and service.   They were happy to accommodate my special request.   The margarita specials were an added bonus.  Visiting from PA and were looking forward some good southwestern food and found it here"}
{"text":"The best chile corn chowder I've ever ate. I've got to figure out how they made it. Chips and salsa were delicious and margaritas too!"}
{"text":"We went here for dinner on New Year's Eve.    The jala holla tenderloin steak was so tasty.  For a $25 steak, it was mind blowing.  Definitely 5-stars.  The shrimp enchilada that came with it was good.  Rice and beans were so so.  The strawberry margarita was good too.  A solid 4-stars.  The lobster queso was decent.  A 3.5.  Complimentary chips were stale and the salsa was a 2.5.  Service was good.  Will be back to try some other dishes.  Update: 01/09/2017  The red chili pork posole was decent.  I was really disappointed by the rave reviews.  It did not live up to the hype.  3.5 stars.  The chili relleno was pretty fresh.  The red and green sauce and cheese on it was good.  The chili itself was very fresh and crunchy.  4 stars.  The small caesar salad is a 3.5 stars, mainly for adding a unique taste to the typical caesar dressing."}
{"text":"Wednesday evening, not so busy. Nice evening to sit outside.  No hostess at stand, no employees recognizing people at the door. Hostess finally arrived and said no available seats for 2 on patio....5 empty tables at 7pm!! Not reserved-just big (4 tops). We left.  I love the margarita selection and food but found a more accommodating staff down the road.  Employee mentality  not good for bottom line.  ?"}
{"text":"This is the place to go for great food. The place was very clean and friendly staff. It food was prepared very quickly and was fantastic. We had the stacked tacos, which were the best shredded beef I've had in Phoenix. The smoked pork tamales are great, especially when you get them with the tenderloin relenos. If you're hungry and in the area then do yourself a favor and stop here."}
{"text":"Good and service was great. Nice way to enjoy dinner in the air conditioning. Megan V excellent service and had great suggestions for our dinner choices. The salsa is exceptional and I out on everything I had!"}
{"text":"Really tasty Mexican food with zest and unique spices. Skinny margarita was lovely!  I wish the tables slid together though. We had a party of ten and had to sit apart which was weird!  Dallas, the server, made up for it. She was really good and super friendly!"}
{"text":"Excellent food excellent service...all round wonderful establishment  Michael the proprietor seated us and spoke with us at length...it was a most insightful look at the philosophy of this restaurant, and its daily struggle to fend off the deleterious effects of the Obama-economy.  We took Mike up on the ingenious marketing scheme they have which allows you on Mondays to order any of the daily specials served through out the week for $10  Carne Adovada Stacked enhilada's, A green chili cheeseburger, and the green chili corn chowder.  All the food was delicious, Mary was our server and she was working her butt off to keep 10 tables all happy at once.  I must call Robert M. on the 4th of July 2011 out on his bullsh*t review!!  Not worth the drive???  Step above Macayo's??  Locals locked into area???  Remote???  never make it into town to real restaurants??  Robert how about you head back over to that Panchos buffet down in South Phoenix where you obviously spend a lot of time and leave the good places for those of us with a clue!   Robert...these are HARD WORKING people trying to make a living...may I suggest you cancel your Yelp account?!?!?!"}
{"text":"Cannot say enough good about Blue Adobe!   It's our very favorite \"go to Happy Hour\" bar/restaurant in Scottsdale, for the two of us.  We were met at the front door by Olivia, and who was warm and welcoming.  Lauren was our waitress and she was super.  Knowledgeable, friendly and attentive.  JR, the manager came over several times to make sure that everything was alright and even asked us if we wanted bottled water to go, since it was so hot last Friday. We have always loved the wine choices (who doesn't love KJ Chardonnay :-), & The Hatch Catch  has always been incredibly delicious and a consistent favorite of ours that never disappoints!  And, their guacamole is some of the best we've ever had! We always sit in the bar, at the cozy booths and enjoy watching baseball, football, or golf, depending on the season, but always able to still enjoy good conversation .... Never too loud!"}
{"text":"Been back several times, still holding up! The 'Red Chili Pork Posole' is truly awesome! The Pork Adovado is great too. Now that it is winter time, I've found the interior to be way too cold - I end up keeping my coat on which sucks!"}
{"text":"I really have tried to give this restaurant a shot.  I've been 4 or 5 times now, and other than the friendly staff, I just don't have anything positive to share about it.    The food is always glistening with oil/grease!  Everything from the rice to the corn tortillas is shiny.   Today, I just wanted some fish taco's a-la Rubios or Baja Fresh and instead spent $13 for uber greasy (hey- a little grease now and then is just fine, but this is beyond gross) tacos.  They tasted okay, but I couldn't help but wonder if Crisco is their main friend???  Ewwwww.    Sorry, I don't have a better review, but I gave them 4 or 5 tries to make something that wasn't dripping in gooey lard!    Better luck to you.    Warmly,  Kirin :)"}
{"text":"Food is amazing and love how they play soft live music . The owner is so nice to his customers and came by the the table asking how everything came out. Chips & salsa are so fresh I always order the chimichanga  and it never disappoints. This place definitely deserves a good rating."}
{"text":"Amazing Mexican food! They roast their veggies they use for their salsa over pecan wood which gives it a unique and amazing taste!"}
{"text":"Delicious unique menu.  We ate in the bar and had the crab cake appetizer and salmon blt sopa/sandwich. Subbed posole for the fries and it was worth every penny of the 1.50 upcharge.  The broth was spicy and flavorful. Both were delicious and full of flavor. Margaritas were pretty decent too. So why 4 stars not 5? It's pretty pricey for what it was."}
{"text":"Not that impressed. I was told to go here by friends and family but we must of had an off day. Our waiter was too busy covering what looked like the entire restaurant.  I think this is why our food took so long and it's my guess that it sat for a while before it actually made it over to our table.  By the time our food made it to the table I was hoping for the flavors to make up for the service but I was unimpressed. Not sure if I'll come back, maybe for happy hour to give it one more chance."}
{"text":"Stopped in for happy hour.  Good deals in the bar and patio.  Enjoy the patio now while you still can. Margarita was good, got the dip trio to share.  Plenty of food for two."}
{"text":"Blue adobe has quite an eclectic but tasty menu. My wife and I love the lobster appetizer... It is exceptional. It's just a nice neighborhood restaurant with a really unique menu. We have never had an issue with service. What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"My husband and I had dinner here last night. We've been in several times before but it's been a few months. It's always been good, but I definitely feel like they have upped their game!  Loved the chips and salsa. I had The \"47\" Ranch combo, and my husband had the Christmas Stack enchiladas. Both were delicious. No regrets on sharing the chocolate chip cookie pie for desset! Our waiter was attentive and our drinks were always refilled before they hit bottom.  The live music makes it a fun atmosphere for a Friday night. This Southwest restaurant just replaced our favorite \"go-to\" Mexican place!"}
{"text":"Omg. Such rich flavors in everything. What a delight.   It smells like roasted chiles from the moment you walk in, and the food is so satisfying.   Very glad I stopped by!"}
{"text":"I would have give it 5 stars if there weren't some issues with airheaded service and the outside patio type furniture with wire tables, so when i dropped a little sauce on the table it went through the table and onto my lap i.e. dress. EEEK.  Lobster dip is to die for. The Sampler starter, which has lobster dip, huge delicious grilled shrimps and 4 delicious mini crab cakes is perfect and fairly size for the price. then the entree of the Lobster Tamale and Shrimp stuffed Anaheim pepper was perfectly delicious and robust. Really good table side Salsa too. YUM"}
{"text":"I could write a whole book about why this place is so amazing and 5 star worthy. The margaritas and tacos were delicious and full of flavor. The server next to us, his name was RJ or JR, was AMAZING. Our server was good but he helped the table next to us and he did great with the young kids at the table and super excited and really enjoyed his job, it seems! But Michael, the manager, is what won us over. I saw an OSU license plate hanging up (Ohio girl here) so I got super excited & he told us all about his football traditions every year and how he keeps the national champions up on the wall. Even though he's a Nebraska fan, he was great, friendly and an attentive manager. We will definitely be back for more margaritas and friendly ambience!"}
{"text":"Delicious.  Loved the salsas as they were super fresh and you can request a spicier version.  Our dinners were just as delicious."}
{"text":"One of our favorite restaurants since the day it opened.  Consistently delicious, from the complimentary chips and fire-roasted salsa to their freshly-made guacamole and addictive bean/cheese dip, on to their stacked enchiladas, lazy tacos, ancho salmon, chimichangas..... we've never had anything less than an awesome meal.  Combined with one (or two) or their margaritas, a glass of wine (great selection!), or any other beverage from their full bar, we always leave stuffed and happy : )   Fun  atmosphere, nice outdoor patio, efficient and friendly staff..... doesn't get any better."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious, some of the best Mexican we've ever had. Definitely consider this if you're looking for authentic Mexican food with incredibly friendly staff"}
{"text":"So I reviewed this place once already after my first visit, but stopped in there again and it is worthy of an update :)  Taco Tuesday!  Went here with the wife and a couple friends last night for Taco Tuesday, and the food and service were even more amazing than the first time in.  Kenlee was our server and she was absolutely fantastic.  I told her to surprise me on the tacos and I'm so thankful I did because I had quite possibly the best tacos I've ever had.  Carne adovada and crab cake! I don't even know how they came up with that combination but it was absolutely delicious.  Do yourself a favor and stop in here as quickly as possible and hey if you can make it for a taco Tuesday even better!"}
{"text":"We had a great last night with friends who live in Scottsdale.  This place was perfect choice, fun atmosphere, family friendly and not too loud so everyone can talk.  We had table of 6 total and it was perfect and reasonably priced too.  Great, fresh food.  I had wine but others at table had a Sangria and a beer and rest were non-alcoholic and all seemed happy.  We will definitely come back here for a meal when we are back in town!"}
{"text":"Edit Update: The owner called me and apologized, waived the meal and sent a gift card. Also indicated he is implementing a new protocol for allergies. Good customer service. Still a painful couple days but will try the restaurant again. Upgraded to 3 star  I specifically requested a meal to be gluten and dairy free (I am allergic). The bartender taking the order assured me it would be and that they are very good about allergies. I get home with my to go order of tacos, take 3-4 bites and then realize there is cheese all over the bottom of the inside of the taco. Thanks Blue Adobe for the pain I am about to suffer for the next 4-5 days."}
{"text":"The chip chop salads are the best! The service is always friendly and is fairly quickly."}
{"text":"Tasty food, attentive but not overbearing waiter, live music - very nice."}
{"text":"Unique take on New Mexican, especially their lasagna-like stacked enchiladas. Good atmosphere, and friendly service. The owner is a good Nebraska guy, and very personable with the patrons."}
{"text":"Very disappointing experience. My day was on a roll, then I stopped here for a very late lunch. Too late, actually, as a diabetic, so my blood sugar was tanking badly.  I ordered the filet with crab and béarnaise sauce, \"cooked to order\" it said. I ordered it MEDIUM RARE. Took a while to get there (at 3 in the afternoon??) and it was cooked medium, headed for medium-well. The waitress noticed and did offer another one. But I had to explain my medical condition and I honestly told her I literally COULD NOT wait another 20-25 minutes to eat. When it came time to pay, I wasn't looking for a free steak, but a discount would have been a fair gesture...if you are going to pay for filet \"cooked to order\" and the chef screws it up...  Not only did I NOT get offered a discount for his fubar, but I got charged $3.25 for my cup of decaf! When you make a business mistake, a gesture of goodwill and accountability keeps customers coming back. I was looking for a new favorite eatery in my new neighborhood...and it WON'T be the Blue Adobe Grill.  But it could have been... With some accountability and good customer service..."}
{"text":"I think Blue Adobe deserves 3.5 stars.  Its good, but not great...and not quite up to 4 star status.  We go back primarily because of consistency & proximity.  Right now, I enjoy their salmon salad.  Its a decent piece of salmon on a large salad with tons of toppings.  My boyfriend usually gets the halibut tacos.  Also, they have this great (crazy cheesy) bean dip to order as an appetizer.  The margaritas are a bit watery, at least for my tasting.  They don't skimp on the chips and salsa, though I have had people come with us who didn't enjoy the salsa flavor!"}
{"text":"Being relatively new to the area & always eating out we tried BA last night. We had a res but still had to wait even though there were 4 empty tables outside the hostesses would not seat us. Then JR the Mgr came over & took care of that. He was great to the point of bringing us a taste of carne something or other. Brandon our waiter was terrific as well & his recommendations for dinner were right on. Hubby had chili relleno & I had pork tenderloin ( which was a first for me ). Plus we had guacamole. It was all really great & we will be back. The special patron margarita were lacking a little luster & tasted mostly of just the mix. I ordered a shot to pep it up , therefore minus one star because it turned into a $27 one w the $15 shot. Other than that we enjoyed it."}
{"text":"We love this place. We are neighbors and regular customers since they opened. We support their success.  But, Michael, walk into the bathrooms.  They are worse than Mexico.  Please talk to your cleaning crew.  This is disgusting!!!"}
{"text":"Traditional margaritas are very good. Food is fresh and flavorful.  Staff is very good. Family atmosphere is welcoming. Had a great meal there."}
{"text":"The atmosphere of the place was very nice. The waiting was great and I love the design of the place. Only thing was I hated my dish, granted that was the first time I've tried it,but I left there with a empty stomach. I really hope if I go here again I could get something I'd enjoy."}
{"text":"I love this place!!! Try the \"Taos combo\" or the \"spooning rellenos\" they are incredible!! Have had both my parents and friends visit from out of town and this was at the top of my list of recommendations.   Wait staff have always been helpful, especially if you are unsure of what to order.   I will definitely continue to be a regular patron!"}
{"text":"South Western cuisine. we started out with fresh guacamole a smoked salsa and chips. The entrees were big portions on the combos,loved the tenderloin Chile reannos and enchiladas.the tamale pork was a bit too sweet. Excellent meals over all"}
{"text":"Really love this place. I've been here twice now and the service has been very friendly and efficient.  The vibe is comfy and cool.  The food has been great both times.  Healthy and flavorful.  More of a modern Mexican fare that I prefer.  Drinks are great here too!  Loved my margarita."}
{"text":"It was average. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't incredible. I had the stacked enchiladas, which were boring, but my husband really enjoyed his Carne Adovada. The margaritas were too sweet and overpriced in my opinion. I would go back, but won't put this at the top of the list."}
{"text":"Just returned from dinner at the Blue Adobe with my wife and have a mixed response to the experience. I had the chimichanga which was excellent and my wife had the blue seafood enchilada which she also loved. Staff was also outstanding. No problem with the meal itself and in fact I would have given five stars if not for the very weak margaritas. I had a premium margarita which cost eleven dollars and tasted great but seemed to have very little tequila which was advertised as 1800 reposado and probably was but very weak. I drank about half the drink but when the waitress asked how everything was I mentioned my disappointment. First time in my life (I'm sixty one years old) that I have returned a drink. She returned with another and told me the owner bought me which I appreciated. It was the same as the first. Very little buzz from all that so frankly, I have to say in my opinion these expensive drinks are a rip off. If I return I will stick with beer."}
{"text":"I liked this place but I felt the interior was like a hotel restaurant from 1985.  It has a dated southwest shlock about it.  I would love to see it re done as we need restaurants that have more style.  I am sensitive to ugly restaurant interiors so I stick by the adage, 1/2 is in your head....the other 1/2 is in your tummy.  Dining is multi sensory .....the food was good but my senses were deprived.   They do deserve their success on the food side.  I loved my dish..."}
{"text":"I had my birthday dinner there on Tuesday evening with my daughter. This was our first time there, the food was amazing and we enjoyed it. The lobster con queso was absolutely delicious!!"}
{"text":"We were on vacation in Scottsdale and wanted flavorful Mexican food. This place has it all. We had dinner on a Saturday night- accompanied by a guitarist playing live music. Started off with a very yummy margarita and chips and salsa. For dinner I had stacked chicken/shredded beef enchiladas with a fried egg on top. Sooo good! My husband had shredded beef tacos he said were the best tacos he'd ever had. The shredded beef was my favorite. Also after asking for no sour cream and no cheese on my husband's dinner the waitress was thoughtful enough to come back and ask if he had a dairy allergy, which he does. She then pointed out to him that there is butter used in the rice. We were very surprised she was so attentive (most places aren't) and cared enough to bring it up. Overall extremely impressed with this restaurant. Good drinks, good food, good service, good atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. I love it so much I tell people I sit next to at the restaurant.   I sat next to a lovely lady at the bar. I asked if she had eaten there before, she said she had eaten there some. So I went to outline how everything was amazing. I love stacked enchiladas, my husband has eaten everything and loved it. I raved on the salsa. She said her husband was working here and she was just here to eat.   Guess the best person to tell about their great food, is the owner. The owners are down to earth, really compassionate people. And it shows by the people who work for them, and the FOOD.   I love their menu, their great representation of New Mexican flare. And as a gluten free eater, I can eat the red and green sauce.   Just go try it!"}
{"text":"We went last night for the third time for Taco Tuesday. This is seriously the best deal in town. Get the carne adovada! My main motivation for going to Blue Adobe is the sangritas! Yum! Great sangria swirled with frozen margarita!"}
{"text":"Unremarkable with the exception of the Jalapeno Cucumber Margarita Darcie ordered.  Staff was friendly. We sat at the bar. Unfortunately, the food was bland and devoid of the Kick and green chili flavor you expect from a place that derives its name from capital of New Mexico.  Even the chips seemed subpar. Maybe it was a rought day at the BASFG. Dunno. Darcie and I will probably give it one more Go in a couple months just to get another one of those tasty Jalapeno Cucumber Margaritas."}
{"text":"Located in our neighborhood, this place was hidden in plain sight....I've passed it at least 100x and for some reason, never noticed it.  Then, one day a colleague who lived in the neighborhood told me about a good Mexican restaurant in the neighborhood and I was like \"what? where?\".  Since that conversation, we've been here a few times and it's pretty good.  Here's what we've ordered:  Four Corners Bean con Queso (Blend of Cheeses, Tomatoes, Leeks & Green Chili, Pinto Beans. Pico De Gallo & Sour Cream), $5.95 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/blue-adobe-grille-scottsdale?select=bQp-AlHA8-NBSVc38Gouqw#bQp-AlHA8-NBSVc38Gouqw http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/blue-adobe-grille-scottsdale?select=F0fgEO8Du8oGMeal95NTCA#F0fgEO8Du8oGMeal95NTCA  Cheese Crisp, $5.95 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/blue-adobe-grille-scottsdale?select=dLQdukiVyMb4LZHonyPmpw#dLQdukiVyMb4LZHonyPmpw  Chicado Melt (Fire Roasted Grilled Chicken with a Jack Cheese Melt, Avocado and Tomato Relish on a Potato Bun, Fries), $9.95 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/blue-adobe-grille-scottsdale?select=PXiCT913Yc0-zZK1DPS0JQ#PXiCT913Yc0-zZK1DPS0JQ  Enchanted Garden Enchiladas (Corn Tortillas filled with SauteÌed Mushrooms, Spinach, Zucchini, Corn, Onions, Cheese), $13.95 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/blue-adobe-grille-scottsdale?select=g-ClybmxGE02-83Vf9RhyQ#g-ClybmxGE02-83Vf9RhyQ http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/blue-adobe-grille-scottsdale?select=P2qf4BlV9ROaG7TOzxnboQ#P2qf4BlV9ROaG7TOzxnboQ  Chicken Chimichanga, $13.95 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/blue-adobe-grille-scottsdale?select=NKZ61nuczbrIzqjTJ1qBGQ#NKZ61nuczbrIzqjTJ1qBGQ  Everything is really good.  It's not your traditional Mexican food....the chef here is very creative with their menu items and the flavors are really unique despite using traditional ingredients.  The Bean con Queso is delish and addicting....good thing they don't give you too large of a portion, otherwise you could blow your appetite on the 1st appetizer!  LOL  The Enchanted Garden Enchiladas is an awesome Vegetarian option for the non-meat eaters.  I decided to give it a try one day just to be different....and it was really good.  I also didn't feel overly stuffed despite the large portion.  The Chicado Melt and Chicken Chimi are awesome as well.  The servers here are pleasant and friendly.  The vibe is pretty cool and great for a family night out.  Return Factor - 91%"}
{"text":"Looked the part but lacked the Mesa location flavor (and prices). Will not be back sadly. Will continue to travel to Mesa."}
{"text":"Great food. Not your typical Mexican food. I would put it more on the gourmet side. Drinks are great also. We did not leave hungry."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time tonight. I'd give the service 5 stars but the food a 1 1/2 stars. Other than the ridiculous amount they charge; the lobster was rubbery which leads me to believe that it was frozen then overheated, the breaded Chile relleno that they serve was quite soggy, and the beans and rice were just gross. I really wanted to love this place, but unfortunately I cannot."}
{"text":"The best I can say for this restaurant is that the service is friendly.    The food was so-so and very over priced for what you get.  I had the high desert pasta and there was barely anything in the bowl.  My husband had the stacked enchiladas and he got a lot of food.  When everything is said and done I would not recommend this restaurant, nor would I go back."}
{"text":"Great place to eat!  The food is fantastic and the service is excellent.  The stacked enchiladas are great and the margaritas are excellent too.   The staff is always friendly."}
{"text":"Love this place - I guess you could call me a regular here. Probably my favorite place for southwest food in the Valley. The stacked enchiladas are my go-to, and are to die for especially when you go with the pork and christmas-style sauce. Another favorite is the steak and portabella which is masterfully cooked over pecan wood, giving it a slightly sweet and savory flavor. On occasion I go with the \"Last Night's Meatloaf\" for something different and its definitely stellar and unexpectedly good for a meat loaf. I guess you really can't go wrong at this place!"}
{"text":"Pretty solid spot to try some New Mexican cuisine. (If you're curious about it, as I was, the back of the menu has detailed some of the specialties and methods of cooking in New Mexican cuisine. I love learning about the foods I'm eating, so this was perfect!)  Starting off with the chips/salsa - YUM! Under the blue lighting outside, I definitely thought the salsa was purple and utilized special ingredients...but it is not purple. It IS good though!  After struggling to order, we had our server point out a couple of her favorites. And boy, am I glad we had her guidance! Ended up splitting the 47 Ranch, which gave us a sampling of shredded beef enchiladas (my fav - so much cheese!), a chicken taco (perfectly crispy tortilla and LOTS of sour cream), and a carne adovado mini burro (this was an interesting flavor profiled or me - possibly too smoky for my taste). Also, the tenderloin enchiladas were excellent (probably my 2nd fav). The side of pinto beans and rice were flavorful, and the option of red or green (or Christmas!) chili made for hefty portions that I'm still feeling the day after.  If you're at all like me and feel a rush to try a bit of EVERYTHING on a menu, Blue Adobe has some great options. Worth checking out if you're curious about New Mexican food!"}
{"text":"Very interesting menu.  The food is well prepared and looked as good as it tasted.  Our waitress was friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch on a Saturday arriving around 12:25. Within 20 minutes this place got really busy with lots of people arriving for a later lunch. We found this place on Yelp because we wanted lunch after a great tour I of Taliesin West and this spot was in the vicinity.    We sat outside in their shady patio enjoying the crunchy chips, fresh smoky salsa and refreshing margaritas.  My wife got a little side order of guac which was just the right size, about 1/4 cup, for her.  We decide to share the Cruz kitchen sampler which our server said would be enough for the two of us while allowing us to try several of their best items. We couldn't even finish it although i might have had a few too many chips prior. It included a poblano stuffed with beef, great roasted pork in a luxurious mole along with rice and bean.  Definitely worth a stop."}
{"text":"1st timers here and the service was very good and the food was good. More of a New Mexico style (like La Rista in Gilbert but not quite as good) we had the \"47 Ranch and the Double Barrel Enchiladas,\" nice proportions and both dishes seasoned well but needed more green sauce. Our biggest issue was the margaritas, $14 for a silver patron and they used a powder mix (almost all margaritas use powder mix) instead of fresh lime juice. Would like to go back and try the lobster con queso."}
{"text":"Food was good, but a little bit on the bland side for me. I guess as an AZ native I expect Hispanic food to have a little more kick. Admittedly, we were there opening week. The service and atmosphere we're top notch."}
{"text":"Best authentic southwestern food I've had in a long time! Great customer service, bar menu, wine list and a great selection of dishes made with southwestern sauces, regional peppers and spices."}
{"text":"Blue Adobe has the best salsa and chips in town! My favorite thing on the menu is the steak and amaretto cream mushroom and chilada combination. I also really like the chicken quesadilla. Believe it or not their hamburgers are amazing although it's really more New Mexico Cuisine"}
{"text":"Excellent, creative food and very good service. Had lobster dip, which was great with generous liberated, and the fish skewer. Maddie, server and bartender, was very friendly and engaging-- and offered a custom margarita. The manager checked in to make sure all was good. Lots of TVs. Only downside is beer selection -- nothing local,  virtually all from mega-breweries."}
{"text":"Blue Adobe is one of those places that I love so much it makes me reluctant to leave a review because I don't want to share it! But alas, I have overcome my selfish ways and want to share this amazing place with you!  My fiancé and I generally go on Saturday nights because there is live music. It's a great, casual vibe and the bands are always good. The menu is vegetarian friendly but offers a wide variety without overwhelming you.   The margaritas are excellent. The food is amazing. The service is always good. Prices aren't bad at all. This is definitely one of our favorite places for date night. Please give it a try!"}
{"text":"Definitely not authentic Mexican food that I was looking for, but was good enough.  The waitress was very nice and helpful."}
{"text":"Service excellent. Jenny is a rockstar. Didnt hesitate when asked for a recommendation. I love that. Servers know rhe food dont hesitate.  Guac great  Crab louie salad needed a bit of citrus easily solve by lime from bar.  Salmon excellent.  A respectable choice in the far east Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Excellent food and drinks!  We loved everything we had - guacamole, bean dip, blue seafood enchiladas, crab cake tacos, stacked steak enchilada with an egg, and beef chimichanga. Everything is amazing. We are stuffed."}
{"text":"Great service by Gary.  We began with the Blue Adobe Ceasar Salad, with lime tequila dressing. Delish.  The we split the layered enchilada. Pork. Also, wonderful.  We ended with a sopapia (sp?), although tasty, it was the only \"okay\" thing.  Very enjoyable and filling.  We would return if we didn't live in Indiana!"}
{"text":"Wow! What a wonderful neighborhood gem! The ambiance was great...not too close other diners, music at a reasonable level and clean.   The service was spot on from the time we arrived to final bill. Our server was extremely knowledgeable about the menu and the offerings. The best part about this place is that it is New Mexican style food - different spices and options to choose from!  Both plates we ordered we delicious and the chips and roasted salsa were delicious! We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Got there at 8pm and closes at 9pm. The staff was great and super friendly, explained the menu items and recommended the Halibut... oh boy that was amazing. We sat outside and was a terrific atmosphere"}
{"text":"I was a little weary about coming here, because for some reason in my head I was thinking it was a Baja Fresh/Rubios type place, boy was I wrong.  Most importantly, I think they made me the freshest squeezed margarita I've ever had. I also ordered some food, the delicious Adobo Pulled Pork sandwich, and guess what, it came with fries AND onion rings! I hate having to choose.   Other than our entire experience being positive, the only thing I'd say could use some help is maybe the decor. Kinda bland, the bar is the best part, we didn't hang out inside much since we sat on the patio, so maybe some more plants on the patio to block the view of the parking lot."}
{"text":"Blue Adobe had very good food. The fresh catch halibut was one of the best pieces of fish I've ever had and everyone at the table was very happy with their food.  The chips and salsa with guacamole on the side was the perfect appetizer."}
{"text":"Delicious Mexican food with an amazing outside atmosphere.  I had the beef chimichangas and they were great! Definitely recommend the prickly pear margarita, frozen. Service was great as well!"}
{"text":"Picked The Blue Adobe for my husband's b'day lunch...so glad I did!! We were seated by a pleasant young woman..chips and salsa followed within a minute or so...love the salsa!!! Our server, Scott, was attentive without hovering and accommodated our requests for just a few more minutes to check out the menu. I chose the Pecan Grilled Chicken sandwich w/a fantastic Chipotle Tomato Relish. The slightest hint of the pecan wood used to grill the chicken imparted a nice extra layer of flavor but the Chipotle Tomato Relish was DELIGHTFUL!!!!  I suggested that the Chef really needed to bottle and sell it..it was simply addicting..sweet and spicy..loved it. Husband had the Carne Adovada. He finished every bite but did mention that he felt there was just a bit too much of the Red Chile Adobo sauce..it kind of overwhelmed the flavor of the pork..that would be the only small negative we experienced. We both felt that there was a nice blend of spices and flavor in our meals w/o being too hot. Had a good conversation w/Michael, the manager. He is truly concerned about the quality of service and food...we will definitely be back. Thanks again Michael and Scott..see you soon!"}
{"text":"Awesome food and service consistently for years."}
{"text":"The Blue Adobe Grill is probably more New Mexico... as in Santa Fe than Mexican cuisine. The food was good but not what I expected at all.    I had a chimichanga and it was okay but the tortilla was not crispy. The filling tasted good tho. My friend had the seafood enchiladas and said they were just okay too.   The host and servers were very attentive and pleasant.  Excellent service which is why I'm giving 4 stars. 3 stars for the food and 5 stars for the service.   I will try it again but order something different."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good, but the drinks way over priced. So, if you go, skip the cocktail."}
{"text":"Food was good For this type of place it seemed over priced to me. Entrees should be $12 instead of $18. The place is clean and new but no ambience.   We visited on a Monday and they had more employees than customers  I doubt that this place will be in business for long. Do not plan to go back"}
{"text":"My husband and I tried this place for the first time and were beyond thrilled. The service was amazing, the margaritas were delicious, and the food...omg. so good. We started with chips and salsa with guac, and I probably ate way too much of it because I seriously couldn't stop. There were several things on the menu we wanted to try, so we will definitely be back. I ordered the Chimichilada, and my husband ordered the Christmas stack. Very flavorful and perfectly cooked. I ordered the black pomerita and was pleased that it wasn't too sweet or tart. Nice balance of flavors. My husband ordered the Cruise Caddy which he enjoyed.  The atmosphere was pleasant, nice lighting, appropriate music that was not too loud. Our server was very knowledgable about the menu, and had such a great attitude.  Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Recommended by a local we had to check this place out.  Words can not even begin to describe how truly amazingly delicious the food is. The flavors are truly original, unlike anything I have ever tasted.   We dinned on the following: Chorizo Stuffed Chicken Cruz Kitchen    I'm so impressed with this place I wold plan a vacation around dining here!"}
{"text":"Awesome!! Dude next to me was gonna kick my ass if I was about to give a bad review.  JK, but speaks to the loyalty of the locals/regulars! Corn Chowder=Killer."}
{"text":"The reviews do not disappoint!  My colleague and I came in on a Monday night and had a fabulous meal. To begin with the Margarita's are fabulous! My colleague had the Stacked Enchiladas which I took a bite of as well and they were divine. I had a hard time deciding and ended up with the Ocean Front which was also very good. To be honest we could have eaten here every day and not run out of choices.   The staff was really friendly, the atmosphere casual and there was a nice outdoor patio as well. It was a bit windy the night we were there so we stayed inside. March is a great time of year to visit the Phoenix/Scottsdale area!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Sticky situation with a reservation gone awry handled appropriately with aplomb, humor and professionalism by the manager. Kudos. Food stupendous, esp the main courses. Margaritas sweet and tasty, sangria delish. But the rub here was the service and the manager's professionalism. Should be given a major 'Attaboy' for an exceptionally well done job."}
{"text":"We tried a BAG in Mesa and the food was so-so. My wife loves Mexican food and we usually try different restaurants around the valley. When she mentioned this one in Scottsdale, I was kinda hesitant.  But to my surprise, this restaurant rocks. The server was friendly and the manager came around to ask if we enjoyed our meal.  BEsides all that, the food was amazing. We will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Delicious food + Excellent service. A great combination for an enjoyable evening out. Our waitress tonight went above and beyond meeting the needs of two little ones with severe food allergies. The atmosphere is relaxing and inviting. It's a great neighborhood restaurant and bar. I have been coming here for several years and noticed that tonight, the servers and manager were much more attentive than in the past. I liked that."}
{"text":"Food is awesome. Service with Doug... Outstanding. Chips and salsa were plentiful and fresh. We'll be back."}
{"text":"The Chicken pasta is the best here.  Healthy creative Tex-Mex food.  Lot's of fancy cocktails."}
{"text":"Delicious! We ordered to go, and I had the chicken tacos. They were terrific! I can recommend this place highly."}
{"text":"My wife and I love this place! We try to eat out here at least once a month as our dining out budget allows. The service is solid, the food is Santa Fe style and excellent, and my wife especially loves the salsa and chips (although she tends to eat all of the blue corn chips before I can get them!!!). Prices are fair for dinner (except margaritas are a bit pricey), and the weekday specials are great. Had dinner there last night with some out of town friends. 6 adults, 4 of us had margaritas, tab was about $150 ($25/person). Most of us ordered from their \"Blue Plate\" menu, which tends to have their specialty items, and cost more per plate. You certainly can have a great dinner meal with drinks for between $15-$20."}
{"text":"First off, when we arrived we elected to sit in the bar area because the game was on.  We waited a little bit for our server, but it wasn't too long before another server noticed us and came right over. Very attentive waitstaff took our drink orders and checked up on us frequently, but wasn't overly clingy. Very good.  Food was excellent. We had the lobster dip, stacked enchiladas with a flavorful shredded beef, and I had \"Spooning Rellenos.\" Everything was delicious and flavorful.   The cloth napkins were a nice touch and the happy hour looked decent too."}
{"text":"Great food, good service, nice atmosphere. The daily specials are a good touch, the menu items are not run-of-the-mill, many are quite tasty. The staff is unusually friendly & efficient.  Margaritas can be good but are pricey. The ingredients are fresh, tequila quality is good but not always enough in there to taste it. They usually have a guitarist later in the evening Th/Fr/Sa.  November to April, you often need a reservation. Taco Tuesday's are highly recommended. Good value."}
{"text":"It's been a while since we've gone here, our last visit was such a turn off I guess we'd just forgotten about the place.  We both ordered the Chip Chop salad with shredded beef. Another 'meh. The Beans con queso were all the way at the bottom, so I didn't even notice it to be able to get any until I was nearly done. The meat was cooked well but had no flavor. Perhaps if I had asked for more salsa....  Our waitress was quite nice, I believe that Alex was her name. There was a man waiting tables, I think that he was also tending bar. He was zipping through that place WAY too fast. I saw him nearly run over his own co-workers a couple of times  Then nearly ran me over both on my way in to and out of the restroom. No apology, just a swerve and a near-hit. My hubs ran into him on a restroom trip, too, at least the dude acknowledged him.  I see that they have 4 Stars... ???  I can honestly say that I have no idea why."}
{"text":"Great restaurant!  The food is excellent!  The meat is all cooked over pecan wood!  Mmmmm....Amazing flavor! I love the chicken but the salmon and steak are also delicious! Margaritas are yummy!  Cervezas are cold!    The service is outstanding!  The manager hires wonderful attentive intelligent people!  They are always happy and smiling!   The manager and assistant manager are both super personable people!  They take the time to get to know their clientele!  We always feel very welcome!  Love this restaurant!  Don't miss out!  Try it sometime!!'"}
{"text":"Awesome restaurant!! Today was my first time to visit this wonderful New Mexican joint tucked away in NE Scottsdale. The service was amazing and the staff was very friendly. The Adovada and Salsa is the best I've had in AZ so far. The place had nice ambiance with a wonderful sweet mesquite aroma. The restaurant was clean and I would love to go back during happy hour and dinner."}
{"text":"I do like this place the food is pretty good the wait staff is wonderful and the music is great! When we were there the live music was amazing!, then the either owner or manager was talking to a table and literally said \"shhhhh\" to the gentleman playing and then said something like \"not so loud\" I thought it was a little rude. Don't have live music if you can't enjoy it. Other than that this is a great place to eat just a little expensive in my opinion."}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner.  I'll say the Food was good, but we were expecting much more in the way of green chili  flavor. What little green chili they used, tasted more like it came out of a can, than fresh.  Quite disappointing in that respect.   Additionally, they had live music, of which the guy\"s amp was turned up way too loud for dinner time, and it echoed against the walls. We couldn't even hold a conversation at the table, because nobody could hear each other.  This place is way too small to have loud music going on during dinner.  People at the table next to us were also annoyed.    Would have given 3 starts if the music wasn't so annoying.  That needs to be saved for later, not during dinner.    As for the physical aspect, the bar area takes up about 1/2 the available space, and the feeling of the place seems like they can't decide if they want to be a restaurant or a local hang out, but they're not really pulling off either one."}
{"text":"The salsa is yummy!! Service is good. I ordered the chorizo stuffed chicken and was NOT disappointed. Great food!"}
{"text":"Have taken my family here several times and always a great experience. Food is always good. Manager is very friendly and never had a complaint. But today I Ordered a steak basically the same meal I order every time. I requested a salad in place of enchilada and rice and beans as I always do. They wanted to do a double up charge for the salad replacement. I have been here 3xs before with the identical order and never had a double up charge. I asked why a double up charge since I was removing a shrimp enchilada and rice and beans and only wanted a side salad. The waitress told me lettuce was more expensive than a shrimp enchilada and the rice and beans. Really weird. Won't return"}
{"text":"So I show up. I sit at the bar. 7 or 8 people are at the bar. I watch the bar tender and even the manager or possibly the Ownet behind the bar. I sit...and sit...and sit...sort of like last time when I sat for  10 minutes  never being recognized...I look at myself to make sure I'm not made of glass...except this time that good bar tender who rescued this place last time wasn't here to do the same...and I sit...8 minutes goes by and I'm not even acknowledged by the bar tender or manager...I leave. You lost my business forever...you need to perform at least the basics folks!!! Acknowledge a freaking customer!!! Immediately...you're failing at training your employees!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious!! They recently updated their patio and we loved sitting outside. Food was amazing! This is our favorite Mexican restaurant now."}
{"text":"We like Blue Adobe and have visited both locations numerous times.  The Scottsdale location is close to home.   Love to support the locals and these guys make it easy.  Their wait staff is always attentive and friendly.  It seems to be well run with management very involved, you can tell the difference.  Chips & salsa are favorites, although don't fill up (like I usually do) because you'll want to experience the main course.  My special favorites are crab cake tacos - yum!  Great sauce that goes on them, sometimes just not quite enough sauce.  Also some great soups - both Pork Posole & Chicken Corn Chowder are especially good.  We've tried their $10 specials (each night something different), most recently the blue seafood enchiladas.  As I said, I tend to fill up on the chips & salsa so half of this went home w/ me.  I was a little surprised but thought it was even better the next day.   New Mexican cuisine is a nice change from the traditional.  Blue Adobe does it right."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere. Live music on Thursdays and Specials for dinner that include awesome Corn Chowder and Creme Brûlée. I recommend the Chorizo stuffed chicken."}
{"text":"Place has a lot to like and a lot of potential.  For the most part, great service, but slow drink service.  The salsa is good but not spicy.  They charge you for salsa refills.   My 'catch of the day' was the Adobo Halibut. It was overcooked.  The mixed veggies were good.  Bar area looked cozy and nice.  Will be back."}
{"text":"I had a really scathing review of this place and the owner emailed me and asked me to take it down, so I am.  But I have to say, I think the food here is dull and tasteless.  I would never go back.  One of my critical remarks about the food in this valley is that many places are dumbed down without heat or flavor.  So maybe this place is just fine for those people who prefer that type of food."}
{"text":"A friend suggested we go here and I'm not quite sure why. I have heard great things about it, but personally didn't really see the value. I had the crisp chop salad so maybe that's why; I didn't have legit Mexican food. My problem is that the food didn't really taste or seem upscale, but they charged upscale prices. Guess that's Scottsdale for you?"}
{"text":"I've been to Blue Adobe twice now, once for lunch with coworkers and once this past weekend for dinner with my boyf. Both trips were delicious and all around awesome. I think this place totally deserves all five of my stars.  The New Mexican twist on most of the dishes makes for a unique and fresh twist on standard Mexican food fare. Their salsa (it comes to your table in a cute lil glass pitcher!) is to die. It's smokey and chunky and the perfect way to start a meal.  My first trip included a portobello enchilada with a side of their sauteed veggies. The enchilada was covered (but not drowning in) with an Amaretto mushroom cream sauce. It was absolutely delicious, and something new. The side of veggies I subbed in were a nice variety: carrots, asparagus, onion, zucchini, mushrooms, all nice and buttery and still crispy instead of veg-mush. Not the healthiest lunch, but definitely not a gut-bomb.  For my recent dinner trip, I went with the garden enchiladas topped with their green chile sauce. The aforementioned sauteed veggies were folded into tortillas, and were delicious with a light topping of cheese (again, not completely smothered in goo, which I appreciate) and the citrus-y chile sauce. I tried some of their red sauce and it was beyond. Almost like a mole, with smokey, chocolatey undertones. I'll need to go \"Christmas style\" (food topped with both red and green chile) next time!  Boyfriend got a glorious looking variety plato: A relleno stuffed with tenderloin (I noted that the relleno wasn't drenched in eggy/crazy friend batter. Good!), smoked pork tamale and carne adovada. He said it was one of the most delicious mixed Mexican plates of life. It looked like it!   All in all, I'm really glad this place is so close to home. We'll be back, lots!"}
{"text":"BEST. SALSA. EVER. If salsa is your guide to your dining experience, you will not be disappointed with their fresh food. From the Carne adovado to the Chile rellenos to the fresh bread on the sandwiches, it is fantastic! And, you will always be served with a smile. Love this place! P.S. You can take jars of salsa to go!"}
{"text":"We went in search of NM cuisine and Blue Adobe boasted that was their niche. Patio is lovely.  Bar scene at 530 on a Thursday night was very vibrant.  Restaurant was decorated very simply with a few NM style items.  Service was prompt and friendly.  As the restaurant got busier service slowed a bit, but was still solid and good during our dinner.  Chips and salsa were tasty, but to us not really comparable with NM salsas.  Green chili corn chowder was our starting point.  Lots of large pieces of chicken and green chili.  Very sweet taste to the chowder from the sweet corn used.  It overwhelmed the heat of the chili and became the main attraction in the chowder.  We dined on various enchiladas, carne adovada ( rarely found outside of NM and favorite amongst us), tamales and rice and beans.  The enchiladas were all topped with their red chili sauce.  It was darker than NM chili and has a very profound sweetness.  Almost like BBQ sauce and red chili mixed together. Sadly not our favorite.  The tamales were traditional and tasty, the rice and beans were good and the carne adovada missed the mark because of the immense sweetness in the red chili sauce.  We finished with sopapillas which had a fine bubbly texture on the outside.  We've never seen this before.  They were okay.  We like traditional sopapillas.  Overall this was an average to good experience.  Mostly we were looking for a true NM dining experience and felt this missed the mark for that.  However, it still had some solid choices and flavors!"}
{"text":"I dropped in here on a Sunday evening, based on the reviews I had read here. Cozy place and ALL of the wait staff were friendly and attentive!  While I had been craving Mexican food, their New Mexico menu changed my mind and I knew I had to try one of those dishes. I opted for the chorizo stuffed chicken with that AMAZING mushroom Amaretto sauce. The side vegetables were cooked to perfection.   I suppose I must mention how wonderful their salsa and chips are also...but back to that sauce!  I had to force myself to quit eating so I would have some to take home. Am so glad I discovered this place and can't wait to go back and try more on their menu (although it will be hard not to get that chicken again)."}
{"text":"Its Taco Tuesday again. The weather is amazing and the patio is divine. The guacamole melts in your mouth. The owner is attentive and kind. He remembers everyone. We go every Tuesday for taco Tuesdays, it is a great value. The iced tea is amazing unsweetened tropical variety."}
{"text":"Excellent food! It is not your old time family run Mexican restaurant. It is modern and has an upscale feel with with home-cooked flavors that actually works. Not the cheapest place in town, but the portions are plenty and the quality makes it worth the cash."}
{"text":"Grabbed some dinner here about a month ago on a Tuesday. Walked right and sat down. Not busy at all. I really enjoyed the salsa. Being new to the Valley of the Sun, this by far has the best salsa in the Scottsdale area. At least among the restaurants I've tried so far... Blue Agave, Salt & Lime, Ajo Al's, Julio G's, Barrio Queen. If I'm being honest, the food was great, but was a little too rich/heavy for me. I ordered The \"47\" Ranch and was not able to finish it. Again, the did not disappoint, I just disappointed myself with my inability to finish it. The staff was great! Never was there an empty bowl of salsa in front me. (It's how I judge EVERY Mexican restaurant.) Pass the 'never-an-empty-bowl-in-front-of-me' challenge and score rave reviews. Will I return? Yes! Will I consume an unhealthy amount of salsa again? Of course yes! Do I hope to enjoy a margarita on the house? Yes! Mr. Manager, whadda say?"}
{"text":"What a welcome to Scottsdale! Great food, great service and a place that made us relax and enjoy our family time.  Michael made sure everything was served up the way we wanted and the nachos...I couldn't believe their size!!!"}
{"text":"We had the opportunity to try the Blue Adobe Grille while visiting friends in Scottsdale last week. Our friends are regulars there and they rave about this place...and now I know why! It's located in an unassuming strip mall, but don't let that fool you...this place is awesome! We enjoyed the evening air while sitting outside on the covered patio - something we don't get to do often this time of year in the Pacific Northwest. The décor was festive and cute...and the service was great, too. I didn't catch our server's name but she was very friendly. I will preface this by saying that I grew up on good, authentic Mexican food in Southern California so my standards are pretty high. This was my first time experiencing \"New Mexican\" cuisine and I am definitely a fan! The salsa was fresh and delicious. The tri-color tortilla chips were thin, crispy and wonderful...not greasy or overly salty. My prickly pear margarita was unique and tasty. I ordered the stacked enchilada made with their Carne Adovada. It was delicious and the chile sauces was amazing! I tried both the red and the green and they were both excellent. I also tasted the Raspberry Chipotle Pork Tenderloin that my friend ordered and it was spectacular, too. I highly recommend the Blue Adobe Grill and l look forward to going back on our next trip to AZ!"}
{"text":"Good, but not as good as expected. Nice to see a non conglomerate restaurant in the valley and the cocktails were very tasty but the meat in the Taos sampler and the stacked enchiladas was dry as a bone. Spice level was also lower than expected, had to ask for hot sauce. Back to Los Dos Molinas!"}
{"text":"The entire experience was great.  It was I beautiful evening to sit outside on the patio, the chimichangas tasted wonderful, and the staff was very attentive.  Neither my wife nor I had room for dessert."}
{"text":"5 stars for the chicken, green chili, and also the corn chowder, which was amazing.   But the rest of the food was nothing special.   My chimichanga was really greasy. And it's the first time I have ever NOT eaten all the Guac at a restaurant.   Okay, waitress just came and we weren't charged for the chimi. That was nice of them.   But since we would never go back, the place gets 3 stars from me."}
{"text":"Food was solid. Price was solid. Nothing amazing to push it over the top.  The margarita I had wasn't great.  Blue Adobe Grill is a solid option if you're looking for a decent Mexican restaurant in the area. I went on a date night with my girlfriend and honestly the best part was the location.   Their guacamole could have been better. The good news is their salsa was great. I may go back sometime to try a few more things before I make a final decision on if it's a good spot."}
{"text":"The only reason this gets two stars is because the service was average. The taco salad we got was bland, soggy and downright disgusting. The description of it sounded wonderful, but it came out so gross. Their burger was average. Nothing that special. Something that ruined the burger was the raw bacon on top. The chicken was dry and sickeningly sweet. The kids burrito was below average as well. The worst thing was food in some of the glasses. All in all, very disappointing. Extremely expensive for below average food. Would not recommend to anyone visiting Phoenix."}
{"text":"Margaritas were fantastic. Jalapeño cream soup to die for. Service was good and fast. Portions are enough to take home s doggie bag"}
{"text":"The food was excellent and the live band was very good too.  We had the nachos and the fresh seafood which was sea bass.  I must say the nachos were the best I've had and the homemade enchilada sauce and fire roasted chiles were amazing."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and great food. The chips and salsa are delicious. The staff is really friendly too."}
{"text":"This place is a real gem! Amazing food and excellent margaritas topped with a great setting. If you haven't tried this place yet you are missing out. Oh and did I mention they have live music too. Do yourself a favor and check this place out! I got the pecan wood grilled steak and it was cooked to perfection. My hubby got the shredded beef lazy tacos which were super tasty.  The wait staff is very nice and attentive. I've been searching for a go to southwestern food place and now I don't need to look any further. This. Is. IT!"}
{"text":"Incredible. The restaurant is described as Mexican food on yelp and I think that is incorrect. There should be a category for amazing. I am from California and eat Mexican food weekly and have never had food like this. The flavors were intense and rich without being overwhelming. I had a pork dish that was Smokey and beautiful on the palate.  The management is exceptional. We were served by a gentleman named Michael who runs the service side of the restaurant and he was nothing short of perfect. In fact my car battery died when we left and when I went in to call AAA he came out and gave us a jump. The only downside is that its in Scottsdale and not in California. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Blue Adobe Sante Fe Grille Gilbert is a great place to eat dinner,  have some drinks and listen to live music.  The food is excellent , service fantastic and live music is Awesome. I especially enjoyed Fab Two Duo tonight with Scott n Doug.  A great place !"}
{"text":"Went here yesterday for lunch while my car was at MINI being serviced. The place for starters has no feeling of arrival. There is just a door on the side of a building with no awning, patio, etc. There was no one there to greet me when I came in so I made my way over to the bar. There were a couple of middle aged women running the bar and doing a mediocre job of it at best. I ordered the chimichilada, MAN, you gotta REALLY like mushrooms to eat that thing. The chimi part of it was ok, but nothing really to write home about. This place has been dubbed a direct competitor to Richardson's? get real. The chips were the only good part of my meal. I'm a big guy with a big appetite, and I didn't even have a desire to finish my meal, it was just not a good dish. Besides the food, the restaurant was just really akward in layout. The bar top seemed as if it were a removable piece of furniture from Ikea... not cool. One of the waitresses even had her two kids hanging out in the restaurant running back into the kitchen, eating, etc. Pretty sure that would violate some sort of health code. I'll stick to Richardson's thank you.  UPDATE 6/26/08:  Went here to please my co-workers... they all wanted to go after taliesin west tour so I figured I would give it another shot. Worse than the first time... the service was worse, the chips and salsa was worse, and the food was even more bland. Not as many mushrooms though. I'm gonna keep it at 2 stars though, because I hate to give out onesies."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Amazing drinks. Very good salsa. Guacamole honestly leaves a bit to be desired. But my steak and crab were absolutely wonderful"}
{"text":"Went on a Friday night with wife and daughter.  We were told it would be a 10 minute wait, but were seated right away.    There was live music which I thought was a tad too loud.     Great chips and salsa.  It had a subtle kick.  The owner came by to say hello which was nice.  I really liked the atmosphere.  My wife ordered a Margarita Flight which is a sampler.  The prickly pear one was the best.  My wife ordered a Chimichanga and I got fish tacos with crab cake.  We both thought the servings were small, but surprisingly filling. Rice and beans were great.  My Fish Taco with  crab cake was meh. Rubio's fish tacos are better.  Overall, it was a nice experience and we would come back."}
{"text":"Why anyone would give this place less than five stars is beyond me. We went to Chompie's Sunday to have the Mish Mosh Soup (YUMMM), but the hostess when asked how long it would be for a table for two said UUMMM, I don't know. What the heck...you're the hostess, if you don't know. WHO DOES? Put them at the hostess stand. But I digress....  We said UMMM, no we'll go somewhere else and wound up at Blue Adobe Grill. It was our second visit and we were just as pleased this time as the first time.  The service was impeccable even though our server was doubling as the bartender. The owner stopped by more than once to make sure everything was okay.  And now the food. I ordered a Southwest version of a Caeser Salad with Chicken. It hit the spot perfectly. My partner ordered a combo which, while very spicy was very good. What did he expect, bland Mexican food?  We're going to head back for Happy Hour sometime very soon! Please don't believe the naysayers, Blue Adobe is GREAT!"}
{"text":"Blue Adobe catered the Toys for Tots Poker Tournament sponsored cStor and Larry Gentry. The food was amazing, the pork loins tender, the size of the shrimp outstanding with many condiments to make it even better The chipolte sauce had a great tangy taste. Also the mini chimichangas were great. The two gals there had smiling faces and kept the set up stocked. Can't wait to see this place for a meal in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon \"Taco Tuesday\" - buy any drink (alco or non) and get 2 tacos for ~$7.  Our party all partook the special offer and were all pleased with the results.  We had an array of taco flavors, my personal fav was the tenderloin (beef), while I found the chicken to be a bit dry.  The chips and salsa they serve pre-meal were fantastic, really great flavor in the salsa.  Great place"}
{"text":"This place such a great atmosphere with the live music and the excellent service by rob the bartender. I would say this is a hidden gem of Scottsdale. If your looking for an excellent entree get the Southwest meatloaf! By far one of the best meals I've had to this day. Check this place out because the drinks are strong and the food is excellent!"}
{"text":"Good, solid New Mexican food right in my neighborhood.  Friendly staff and good drinks.  Family favorites include the Enchanted Garden Enchiladas and the  Cruz Kitchen \"Signature\".  Be sure to get the Skinny Dip \"Signature\" Margarita at least once to photograph and share with your friends."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in Scottsdale!!! Loved the live music and ESPECIALLY the food and drinks! Blue Adobe offers the best New Mexican cuisine in Arizona!"}
{"text":"This was a recommendation from one of the managers at the Sheraton Desert Oasis. My husband and I shared the Cruz Kitchen - tenderloin Colin relleno, carne adobada, smoked pork tamale, rice, beans and Flour tortilla--each one better than the other!! Even the rice and beans, which normally are shoved to the side, were wonderful!  Splitting this huge entree was perfect - but we were wishing we'd ordered two so we'd have leftovers to take back with us!   This may be our new favorite restaurant!! Fabulous service - oh, and did I mention the roasted salsa?? I bought a large jar to go and they threw in 2 bags of their yummy chips!"}
{"text":"Having appetizers and drinks with Monica and Jeff Cohen. Wonderful Possole and the Hatch Catch is to die for. Fun evening!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  Looks like a true hole-in-the-wall from the outside. Very unassuming.  But inside is actually quite nice with colorful chandeliers and a nice bar area - bathrooms were nice too-    The food is phenomenal.  And cheap!!!  Go on Tuesdays - special is the carne adovada.  And the carne adovada is to die for.  Two people can easily split one order and be totally full.  You can cut the meat with a spoon.  Mmmmm so yummy just thinking about it.  I want to try other food choices but I just know I won't be able to tear myself away from re-ordering the adovada.    Everyday of the week a different menu choice is on special so make a week out of Blue Adobe :)"}
{"text":"Our first time trying this place and they were severely under staffed, but Kenlee was a ROCK STAR! Not only did she bartend, but she covered a 1/3 of the restaurant as well! This poor girl worked her tail off and did an amazing job!! The food was on point for Taco Tues and I highly recommend the lobster queso!!"}
{"text":"Went there for my Birthday dinner. I was impressed. The place was very busy so make sure that you make a reservation no matter what. We did and got right in. Pablo was our server. Nice guy, great service, great food. We will go back again. (we drove a half hour to get there)"}
{"text":"Went here a couple times since moving to the area and I've had nothing but good experiences. Live music on the weekends is great and really brings in a good crowd. Rob is a great bartender and always makes sure you have a drink! Food is great and you can beat complimentary chips and fire roasted salsa!"}
{"text":"I loved this place! Tried it out for the first time last night. Had the hatch garlic shrimp, YUMMM! was a tad bit on the soupy side, but the flavor made up for it! Everyone at our table loved it and we will be back!!"}
{"text":"Awesome service. Sami was very attentive and nice. Really good food across the board. Chicken was tender and tasty. Green and red sauce were both above average . Chips were fresh. Salsa on point.  Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"early evening, mid-week arrival. Place was busy but not packed. Seated immediately.  Friendly people. Clean place.  Chile rellanos and stacked enchiladas. Both impressive portions. Well plated. Good, unique, flavors. Very happy.   Wish they offered black iced tea. Not a fan of \"tropical.\" Waitress didn't suggest dessert so we didn't order any.  Would not travel out of my way to go back. But, when in the area, I'd definitely go back here."}
{"text":"While I'm typically not a big Mexican food fan, Blue Adobe definitely won me over.  It was a beautiful night to dine outdoors and Blue Adobe had a spacious outdoor dining area.    Our appetizers with guacomole and lobster dip were pretty good although I would agree that the chips are greasy.  My lobster tomale was really yummy and unique.     I'd definitely go back!"}
{"text":"In search for outdoor seating with a mexican food on our mind, we ended up going to Blue Adobe for a birthday lunch.  The patio is nice and once seated the manager stopped by to see if there was anything he could for us.   The server promptly brought out menus and brought us their special 'ritas which hit the spot.    Customer service was the best I have seen in sometime and the food was awesome.  Loved the salsa that came with the chips and the veggie enchiladas were first class."}
{"text":"It was decent. Overpriced we thought. Got the Garlic Shrimp Pizza, burgers and Chimichanga at the table. Server was good."}
{"text":"Terrible terrible food. Flavors were over powering and clashed. I had two bites. Son had a few bites. Husband had a few also. We all ordered different food and it was all disgusting."}
{"text":"It is so rare, to me, to find a Mexican restaurant that has Posole on their menu.  Then, when you do find one, it usually falls short of my expectations as my Father-in-Law use to make the most wonderful Pork Posole stew.  The Red Chile Pork Posole is absolutely delicious - hearty, smokey flavors, spice and aroma... it's all spot on delicious.  My tummy could not be happier!    My husband LOVES the Carne Adovada, the Smoked Pork Tamale, and the shredded beef enchilada with the smokey red sauce - what can I say he is a meat-a-saurus - but he is also pretty picky and even he was impressed.    We're already recommending it to everyone who comes to visit that feels like having a delicious Mexican meal."}
{"text":"This is definitely my new favorite restaurant.  We live just around the corner and have been meaning to try it for months and were definitely not disappointed.  The atmosphere is rustic and cozy, but still fun and vibrant.  Daniel was our server and was wonderful.  Very nice, genuine, and gave us the space to enjoy our meal while still making sure we had everything we needed.  The food was PHENOMENAL.  We will absolutely be coming back here again!"}
{"text":"Blue Adobe Grill, how do I love thee?  Let me count the ways.   I love you every day of the the week, but especially on Thursdays!  I love the way you greet me with a plate of tricolor chips, And the jar of chipotle salsa to pour into a bowl so I may dip.  I love to hear Ivan sing and strum his guitar away, As I savor every bite of my free caesar salad and creme brulee. (Thursday night special if you order a Blue plate)  I love you as I devour your salmon, rellenos, tacos or tamales, But don't forget those delicious beans, they also make me jolly.  I love that you have great specials everyday of the week, Of delicious New Mexican fare does the menu bespeak.  I also love your kids menu and your exceptional staff. One last tip, don't forget to order sangria by the carafe."}
{"text":"The restaurant has a nice atmosphere and the decor is really modern.  Good chips and fire roasted salsa.  Chicken enchiladas with red and green chile sauce were very good.  Service was excellent. I will be dining here again."}
{"text":"I'd add a half star if I could, but not to 4.  Caveat, came here for Cinco de Mayo, so expected it to be busy ad boisterous.   But, even though we were on the other side of the restaurant and behind a separating wall, the music was so loud as to be headache-inducing for our group. Worse, when one of us went over to the bar to ask about reducing a bit, they were just rebuffed. I went up to the manager a few minutes later, and he was more reasonable; did remind me about the day, but still managed to reduce the level enough to be reasonable.  Now to the food...  The guacamole was good - nicely chunky and tasty. I had one of the seafood mixed dishes and it was OK, just nothing special. All of our (8) dishes came out so fast that they were clearly pre-made and just quickly heated.  i also thought that $37pp with T&T was a bit high for 1 drink per person, main dishes, and just two guacs for the table.  Still, I might try again on a less busy night, given some of the reviews here."}
{"text":"Excellent Sunday lunch Great food, even better service  Salmon BLT ... better than a salad !!!"}
{"text":"I'm from New Mexico and was so excited when I drove by and saw this restaurant. The menu looks great, the food is good. I was bummed out when my food wasn't as spicy as I expected it to be. Service was great, Maddi was very polite and attentive."}
{"text":"WOW!  Is all I can say!  We went here on a whim for dinner Saturday night, based mostly on the positive Yelp reviews, and that it was close to where we were staying.  All I can say is the food was AWESOME!  But, making that even better was the fantastic service.  Everyone was so friendly and polite.  We had a little trouble making a Margarita decision (they all sound so good!!!), the waitress kept coming back, understanding the whole time, offering suggestions, but in no way overbearing.  We ordered the the Skinny Margarita, and I had a Beer and a tequila shot.  For dinner, my wife had the Tenderloin Rellenos, and I had the Carne Adovada.  Simply spectacular!  They were delivered by the owner himself, now I know where the staff get their friendly nature from!!  Michael asked if there was anything he can do for us, and after some thought, we've decided he can.... OPEN IN VEGAS!!!!  Too bad we live in Vegas, but next time in the Phoenix area, this place will defiantly be on our schedule!"}
{"text":"You want to know why I am giving this place 5 stars after a bunch of local hacks give it 3 or less?  Let me tell you.  The food is quite good.  Let's all not over analyze the situation here.  It's Mexican food.  And better than many other local places.  You went here for lunch one time and the service was marginal so you give it three stars?  Did you taste your food?  Are you comparing this to Taco Bell?  Do horses wear socks?   The bottom line is that Blue Adobe has great food, great beer, and you should eat here.  The wait staff is very good. As much as I come here for business TRUST.  You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in this restaurant. I took a friend here today for lunch on a Saturday afternoon. It was around 1:45. I was looking forward to a salad and she some mexican food. When we walked in there was a wait in the dining room. So we sat in the bar area. It wasn't busy but I could tell they were under staffed. (Should have been better prepared, after all the TPC tournament's only been here in Scottsdale for 30 years!) So we sat. And we sat and we sat. I noticed that the couple across from us  hadn't been waited on but a couple that came in after us had chips and salsa and water on their table. The owner acknowledged the couple next to us and said \"i'll be right with you folks\" He then came over took their drink order, took their food order at the same time, grabbed their menu's and never said a word to us! The other servers walked past us as if we were invisible. For the owner to be so blatantly rude is inexcusable! He should have handed us the menu's from the table he just took the order from, apologized to us for the wait and at the very least gotten us our drinks!  We got up and left and went to THE OFFICE BAR on 116th street . It was busy, we were waited on immediately, when it continued to get more busy the bartender came from behind the bar and helped out, took orders delivered food and drinks. Maybe Michael should take a lesson from The Office on customer service !  I quit going to the Blue adobe  about 5 years ago because of his rudeness, I recently started going back in when I had family in town. The food and service was good. But I've decided not to patronize this place ever again, there are too many nice restaurants in the area where you are welcomed and treated with respect."}
{"text":"Awesome food and customer service! Highly recommend! The owner even came out and spent time with us!"}
{"text":"I stumbled across this restaurant while dropping off some clothes at the dry cleaner next door...wow, what a find!  It's clean and has an industrial/modern feel with an open floor plan. The service was friendly and timely, and we met the owner onsite; he's a nice, hard working guy!  We decided to try the lobster queso based on the positive Yelp reviews and it did not disappoint!  It had large chunks of lobster in a garlicky, cheesy goodness dip that's served with a side of baked pita chips. It's clearly not diet friendly, but trust me, it's worth the extra calories. ;)  I also asked for a side of their housemade guacamole and their spicier salsa, which were also great. It's clear that their food is prepared with skill and made from scratch. My husband had the tender pork adovada with a red chili type sauce...he loved it!  I had the perfectly cooked salmon (a nice sear on the outside, the inside was cooked medium rare). The salmon was served with a tasty tomato relish with a side of chipotle mashed potatoes in a halved roasted anaheim chili, and a side of seasoned zucchini. SO DARN GOOD!  They also have a full bar and a generous pour of wine, which made for happy customers after a long day at work.  We will return and I encourage you to give them a chance."}
{"text":"The first time I came here I was very disappointed but I must have ordered the wrong thing. My brother & sister-in-law hosted their wedding rehearsal dinner here & everything was delicious and fresh. Come for Taco Tuesday - 2 tacos of your choice a la carte or 1 taco with rice & beans for $8.95. When the weather is nice, ask to sit on their lovely outdoor patio."}
{"text":"After a few bad meals in Scottsdale this week,  we tried this place and we're very happy.  Loved our waiter, JR,  he was very fun and personable and had great recommdations when I couldn't decide.   We are very particular about our margaritas,  we both got the. Cruz Caddy on the rocks with salt and it was good.    The salsa is fabulous,  even my 8 year old choked it down.   I was feeling seafood.... Our waiter,  JR, said the Blue seafood enchiladas were one of his favorites,  they did not disappoint.  Anyone can slap enchiladas together,  including my own,  which are rather bland and boring,  but these had tons of amazing flavor in them and I ate the entire plate even though I was stuffed.   My daughter had the kids beef taco,  I was worried since she is used to steak tacos and doesn't eat much.   She ate the whole thing!!!!!!   The husband ordered,  the Cruz Kitchen Signature plate.  Also a recommendation out of his two choices by the waiter,  JR.  The meat was super tender and delicious.    I was a little leary of the live music when we got there,  but we actually enjoyed it.   Out waiter was very attentative,  which was a nice change from a week of dining out."}
{"text":"GREAT FOOD, TERRIBLE SERVICE.  We went in on a very quiet Saturday afternoon and were some of the only patrons in there, and service STILL took so long, we nearly canceled our order and left.  Manager on duty was told of our unhappiness and didn't even apologize for the poor service, and was even glib and obnoxious toward us (though, in all fairness, this was perhaps not so much due a service issue as it may have been due to the whole \"Snottsdale attitude\" that I am discovering seems pretty prevalent among most businesses in the North Scottsdale area).  Possible they were having a really off day; because everyone is entitled to at least one second chance, I will give this place another try... but if I find out that manager on duty happens to be the owner, I will leave on the spot without  ordering, because his service to us was absolutely unacceptable."}
{"text":"Came here on a whim while visiting Scottsdale on business - it's close to Frank Lloyd Wright's Taliesin West which I visited that afternoon.  My server, Nick, was very helpful in recommending menu options - I don't eat red meat, ended up with seafood enchiladas which are very good, but a large portion - don't come here if you aren't hungry!  Good local beer on tap and also, on request, they'll mix up some special spicy salsa for your chips."}
{"text":"The food was delicious!! Austin had come in to see me for a haircut (I am a stylist down the street) and he invited me to Blue Adobe for taco tuesday, and I was not disappointed!! The atmosphere was cool, I feel like you could go there dressed up, or just in jeans and you would be comfortable either way. Try one of the specialty Margaritas, they are fabulous! We will be back. Thanks Austin!"}
