{"text":"Ordered using SkipTheDishes. Had the Beef shawarma and Greek salad.  While the lettuce in the salad wasn't the freshest I've ever had, it was still relatively good.  The shawarma was really good though.  I've gone to a lot of shawarma places and felt the wrath of sour pickles veggies and sauces that seemed off BUT none of that happened here. It was a good experience, will eat there again!"}
{"text":"We ordered two chicken shawarma plates and were severely disappointed. Not only did we wait over 20 minutes for our order even though it was dead, the food was terrible. It wasn't even your typical shawarma meat, more like peeled roast chicken with absolutely no flavour and over a third of it was skin. The rice was just plain white rice and even though a quarter of the dish was hummus, no pita was included. We each threw out most of it."}
{"text":"I was dissapointed....be sure you ask them exactly what ingredients go into ie any of the sandwiches u order... the food was average, the prices were average and thats about it. i must admit it is kind of weird that u dont get to see an actual shawarma spit, or any ingredients, as its all behind closed doors"}
