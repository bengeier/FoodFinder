{"text":"The food was pretty good.   We had a weiner schnitzel and it was nice and crispy.  But the really bad thing about this place is its location,  which will be the downfall of this place.  I'm really not sure why they moved from their old place at Little Budapest,  but for the amount of their clientele,  this new spot is cavernous.   They'll never fill this whole place.  At one point we were the only customers in the place,  which was just weird.  Still has an office building feel.  Unfortunately,  this location is where restaurants go to die,  and I'll give Ambrosia until the end of the year.  They shouldn't have messed with a good location and what they had going,  cause their food is decent.  This location is bad news."}
{"text":"We were there this past Thursday around 6 pm as usual not disappointed.  The new location is spacious and very nice,.  However I had no problem with his other location.  There is more to choose from the new menu but we just came for the best Weiner schnitzel anywhere.  The dumplings were light and fluffy again the best I have had at any restaurant.  We had the the chicken noodle soup l
And my friend had the dumpling soup. No complaints.  The cucumber salad seemed a little different but still good.  It was a little pricey 6.00 seemed a lot for the portion size.  Will be back my favorite place for comfort food!"}
{"text":"Thank you, Jozsef and your staff for a wonderful evening.  Last night we hosted a party of 36 family & friends for a wedding rehearsal dinner.  The food was fabulous (as always).  All of the guests raved about their meals and Carol and staff were very attentive.

Congratulations on your new location.  We look forward to returning again soon and enjoying your new patio!"}
{"text":"Went there about a week ago on a COLD Monday night. It wasn't busy so getting excellent service was not a problem.  The food was wonderful. We ordered chivken paprikash, weinersnitzel, and stuffed cannage. All were very tasty and served at the perfect temperature. The sides were equally as good. The owner personally came out to greet us . Very nice, warm decor. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"They went out of business? Who would think? Really poor excuse for Hungarian fare there. We were so embarrassed to even sit there as i recall."}
