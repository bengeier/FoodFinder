{"text":"I travel for work sometimes and had almost two weeks in the sea of Indian restaurants that is Brampton, Ontario.  After a week of hunting for something else half-decent, Yelp took me to the Golden Stool!    The first night I came here, it was 40 minutes before closing, the ambience was a dark restaurant blasting African dance music videos on the TV above the sparsely-provisioned bar, the food took 30 minutes to get out even though I was the only one of the few people left in the place (one party other than me) who hadn't finished eating long ago, an employee's kid was making a racket trying to dive headfirst off the barstool, and I feared the worst.    Then the food came. It made up for everything!  The combo of beef skewers, maple ginger salmon, and (substituted) stewed goat was incredible!  The chef came out and I told him it was the best meal I'd had the entire trip, and he proudly said he owned the place.  Everyone working was good people.    I don't usually go to places twice when traveling, but I went back here the night before I left, much earlier on a Friday night. The music was lower and tasteful (Erika Badu or similar), a football game was on TV but not too loud, the kid was there but hadn't been given the same dose of speed. The food still took a while, but I was expecting that now.   It was similarly empty, though, so please help remedy that so it's still here when I come back!  :)"}
{"text":"I was introduced to Ghanian good from my roommate in law school. I've had a few things from here but the Jollof is on point. I recommend dinning here if you are looking for something unique to eat."}
{"text":"I've only ordered for take out by phone , but the food is so very good.Try the plantain fritters, with bean stew and red snapper ."}
{"text":"Found Golden Stool on Yelp, and we're very glad we tried it out. Service was amazing, but the food was fantastic and reasonably priced. Would have liked a bigger beer selection (maybe some African beer?) but I don't want to give four stars just cause of that."}
{"text":"Don't let the simple decor fool you. The service is friendly, knowledgeable, and prompt. We didn't know anything about African cuisine so the waiter was helpful in explaining things and making recommendations.  I played it safe and had jerk chicken as I am a sucker for that dish. Chicken was spicy enough to leave a tingle but nothing crazy.  It came with flavorful rice, salad and two fried plantain pieces.   Food was excellent and I was full but I wish there was a bit more salad and plantain.  Had coconut shrimp app which was amazing. Sweet deep fried and flavorful.  Entree and bottle of juice came out to 17.50 plus tip. Friend paid for app.  We all felt the prices were reasonable if not on the cheaper side.  Would go again!  Chef came out and asked us how we liked the food. Nice touch.  Next time I will try the jerk steak which is marinated for two days."}
{"text":"Brampton is crying out for unique places, and this one meets the mark and then some.  Golden Stool is a Ghanaian restaurant, but with fusion aspects incorporating local and West Indian influence. From a quick read on Wiki, the golden stool is the \"royal and divine throne of the Ashanti people.\" I'm sincerely trusting that anyone reading this will know that is not referring to the early 2000's R&B singer.  The place is very well decorated and open. There's also a small stage area which hosts music, spoken word, etc...on some nights of the week. Very attentive and friendly service.  I tried the Kyenkyega beef skewers. They were delicious and worth the wait since it was a huge portion and very thick cut. A nice, unique dry-rub taste - though I may ask for them to be a bit spicier next time (all a matter of taste). I also had it with yam fries which were almost definitely cut and prepared by the chef.  I'll be back for sure and will have to try the peanut soup, a dish I've tried elsewhere and loved. Actually, I hope to try about everything here eventually."}
{"text":"Came here for Early dinner with friends. Good service,  spicy food but tasted great.   The d√©cor / theme was also neat. You can bring a group here. Only thing was missing was coffee  which they promised to have for our next visit !"}
{"text":"This is probably one of the best West African restaurants in the GTA. The restaurant has a chill, laidback atmosphere that allows groups and solo diners to  feel at ease. The chef, Kwame is as imaginative as he is skilled. Our group tried three dishes and all were equally delicious. For appetizer, we chose suya which was very well seasoned and tender.  The fried yams and tilapia, beans and plantain and joloff were superb! I wish there were more Golden Stools in the GTA but I doubt other chefs can match this chef! The only issue, which isnt really an issue, is that it takes some time to get your order. Probably because its all made fresh!"}
{"text":"Ghanaian food with great flavor mixed with a hint of carribean influence. New restaurant needs to work out its kinks and it will definitely be a five star lounge. Owner was very welcoming!"}
{"text":"I ordered Waakye using Ghanaian methode. Very appropriate since this is a West African restaurant. Explosion of flavour and the food prep is done daily using quality ingredients. The taste speaks for itself.   The restaurant has a very laid back relaxed atmosphere. Unpretentious, friendly knowledgeable staff. Made me feel as if I'm being welcomed into someone's home for a meal. I would gladly come back here."}
{"text":"I was taken here for a birthday celebration dinner. We were a group of four. Our waiter was very helpful and knew the menu well. He was able to guide us by explaining flavours and offer some comparisons to assist in understanding mostly unfamiliar dishes. We had Waakye $14 with whole snapper and goat meat (+$6). It came with a choice of sides. Although tge largest combo meal tge portion was sufficient to be eaten by one hungry person. The drive was about an hour from Toronto with traffic. We enjoyed the food so much that we each ordered an extra meal to go. Chef Kwam came to our table and  brought a special birthday dessert. For those interested in a bit of History look up the story of the Asante Adinkra and the Golden Stool. Meanwhile enjoy a nice meal."}
{"text":"First time at this business/African cusine and it won't be my last. I came with a group of 10 and was served by a bubbley and friendly waitress Toni (amazing service from start to finish)! The food was just as good, big on flavour, massive portions & worth every penny. Be prepared to leave with leftovers and I will be coming back for sure..."}
{"text":"The food is really good. Presentation is really good. The service is quite pleasant but don't come if you are hungry or if you have a big group. It will be long wait. But the food will not disappoint.   The appearance of the restaurant is not the greatest. You can sit down or eat or takeout.   I do recommend it though."}
