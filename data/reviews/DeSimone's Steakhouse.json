{"text":"The oscar steak was perfectly seasoned and tender and the mashed potatoes very flavourful. The crab cakes were filled with delicious crab. And the sauces the chef used were exquisite. My wife had the Chilean sea bass and it too was delicious and cooked to perfection. We are locals and come here at least once a month. Justin our waiter made our evening even more delightful. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I took my dad here for his birthday because of the Groupon. I tried so hard to like this place. The staff were wonderful = 1 star and the atmosphere was awesome = 1 star. The food.......omg it was so terrible. My dad order the prime rib and he complained that a dog couldn't even chew through that. I order a lobster mac n cheese and there were chunks of lobster but it was so chewy I had to take it out and put it to the side, I didn't even finish it. I don't know if they're teaching kids a cooking workshop back there or what! Never again!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that the only way we found this steakhouse was through a Groupon. It was a 20 minute drive from where my wife and I were staying and inside an older casino and we wanted to try something \"different\" and off the strip for my birthday.  When we arrived, we were ushered into the dining room and it was dark, quiet, romantic and somewhat reminiscent of days gone by. Perfect place to have a nice conversation.  The only negative for the entire evening was that even though there is no smoking in the restaurant, the cigarette smoke still wafted in from the casino. We are from California and are totally unused to having to smell that when we dine out. But when in Nevada...  So, the ambiance was dark, a little smokey, romantic. Justin, our waiter was very polite and attentive in just the right amounts. I'll talk a little more about Justin and the Head Chef in a moment.  My wife ordered the filet mignon, the garlic mashed potatoes, asparagus and the mushrooms. I ordered the lobster bisque soup and the 14 oz rib eye, my favorite cut of beef. I ordered it medium rare.  The lobster bisque came first and was exquisite! The very generous chunks of lobster were succulent and sweet, the bisque creamy and rich. YOU MUST ORDER THIS unless you have dietary restrictions!  I love great customer service and this is where they earn their 5 star rating:   My wife's filet was cooked to perfection, the mashed potatoes were so good and the mushrooms and asparagus were  al dente and sweet with a balsamic glaze.   However, my rib eye was slightly over cooked. I mentioned it to Justin and he was very apologetic and whisked it away without hesitation. In less than 5 minutes he returned with another ribeye. He told me that they already had another one on the fire. The steak he delivered was one of the most wonderful steaks I have had in a decade. This one was cooked perfectly (pan seared before roasting) and was fantastic. Justin continued apologizing for making me wait an extra 5 minutes.   Towards the end of the meal, Robert, the Head Chef, came out to our table to make sure that the meal was to our satisfaction (who does that after having something returned to the kitchen?) When he found out that we were celebrating my birthday, he brought the most exquisite chocolate lava cake to the table on the house. See photo. (I am sorry that this was the only photo I remembered to take!)  Bottom line: Quiet, Romantic, Great Service, Excellently prepared food and great people. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"JUSTIN is the absolute Best waiter we have ever encountered! He always goes above and beyond and remembers everything you order and just how you like it! If perhaps you don't like anything that came out of the kitchen, he'll take it back, no questions asked! Amazing."}
{"text":"Five of us are there on an anniversary last week. The lobster bisque was so fishy we sent it back. Of the 5 steaks ordered only 2 were prepared as ordered. Despite the difficulties the waitress did not even tell the manager and brought us the check. The manager walked by and we flagged him down and he removed the soups from the check and comped one dessert. Sadly I will not go back. I've had much better food in their coffee shop for a fraction of the price!"}
{"text":"Who would have thought that you could find this great steakhouse inside Railroad Pass?  The room was so serene.  There was everything we wanted on the menu.  Bob was the greatest server.  We enjoyed it immensely."}
{"text":"Found this gem on groupon it's not on the strip but it's worth the short drive.  The lobster bisque was probably the best I've ever had and the beef Wellington was wonderful. Great prices including the wine list I would return here in a heartbeat"}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night (12.7.17).  Place was busy but the service was excellent.  Staff was focused on customer satisfaction.  Then the food came.  My wife had the filet and I had the cowboy steak (bone-in ribeye).  Both were delicious.  The sides were perfect, the appetizer was as well. Will definitely go back regularly!"}
{"text":"walking through this casino that smelled of smoke and desperation, i feared my culinary senses would be insulted. however, i was pleasantly surprised. the restaurant was fairly dim, but your eyes adjust enough to see what you are served. our waiter (bob) was great - friendly, quick, polite. you receive your drinks and bread quickly, it takes a bit longer to receive the entree though. however, it was worth the wait! my steak was like eating a little bit of heaven; i'm fairly certain i heard angels singing. or maybe it was just the alcohol coursing through my veins. either way - steaaaakkkk... the mashed potatoes weren't wonderful, but the asparagus made up for this.   i didn't appreciate the smoke smell that drifted in from the casino, nor the disgusting casino bathrooms, but life is not all strippers and burritos, my friends. if you want a delicious steak, as well as an attentive server, try desimone's. if you want to get a lung full of second hand smoke, step into the casino."}
{"text":"What an amazing secret. The service and food is top notch. I wish we have tried it sooner. If I could put 10 stars I would. Everyone is very professional and super nice. The lobster Mac is the best. We also love the atmosphere, it's a classic elegant dining room."}
{"text":"We waited an HOUR for our food. No apology from the staff. Bad! I had the 14oz. ribeye, and it was cooked perfectly; however, it was covered in a sweetish juice/light sauce that I did not like one bit. I wish the menu had mentioned this. However, to be fair, my friend liked the same sauce. My side was a baked potato, which was huge. It came on a tiny side dish that made it hard to eat without destroying the table. It tasted okay.  This was the first time I have ever waited an hour for my food at a restaurant, and I will not return to DeSimone's again because of it."}
{"text":"We chose this for my birthday celebration and let me tell you we were not disappointed. With myself and my husband having been professional cooks we tend to be critical when eating out. DeSimone's gave nothing to be critical of. I am a prime rib lover and it was absolutely delicious with the best baked potato. My husband chose the New York Strip that was a perfect medium rare that was pan seared. The salad was fresh and the bread was hot. My husband also chose the lobster mac n cheese and it was exquisite. It contained lots of chunks of lobster. The wait staff was amazing and Justin was a dear. Will definitely be going back. Chef Robert is amazing."}
{"text":"We went on a Thursday evening, recently. We had a $50 Groupon, and that basically paid for both entrees. Our experience was almost all positive. We kind of enjoy the \"old Vegas\" vibe of casinos like Railroad Pass, and we certainly didn't smell any of the cigarette smoke from the main casino, when we were in the dining room (unlike other reviewers). Positive things include: the prices. About half what the \"premium steakhouses\" in the valley charge. This includes the draft beers, at $3.50 for pints, and they have a good selection. My 14-oz. Ribeye steak was boneless (not mentioned on the menu), so that was a good value. Husband's curry seabass came with potatoes and a vegetable, and was a real bargain. (They were out of the usual bok choy that is served on the side, but substituted our choice of one of their full-size ala carte sides, so we were fine with that!) He loved it. We both agreed that the lobster bisque was not as rich as at some other places, but tasted good and was a good value. We both had creme brulee for dessert, and it was smooth and creamy. Last but not least, our server, Justin, was nice and knew when to come by; and when to let us enjoy our meal. There were only two real failings in our dinner. First, most of the dishes were underdone. We shared the tenderloin satay appetizer, which we were told was cooked medium-rare, was rare. My ribeye, which I ordered \"medium\", was medium-rare. Even the creme brulee was a bit under-done; not having quite the \"crust\" it should have. Second, and I hope the restaurant will address this one ASAP: do NOT bring the bread basket as soon as patrons are seated!!! It was all too clear that the bread baskets were prepared 'way ahead of time, because the bread was stale, stale, stale. And most of it looked-and tasted- split hotdog buns from the grocery store aisles. Blech!! At every other steakhouse we have ever been to--even the Outback chain--the bread is served fresh & hot, after drinks are ordered. I'd give it a 3-1/2 stars, upgraded to 4 stars because they offered the Groupon. If DeSimone's fixes the bread faux pas, and will leave their steaks on the grill a minute longer, we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Always delicious!! Bob is an amazing server and so knowledgeable when it comes to menu and cocktails.. My food always comes out cooked to perfection... I always recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"The food was very good, I had the sea bass and I asked for the mashed potatoes without the wasabi and they obliged without a hitch, my husband had the rib eye steak, also cooked to perfection, just one problem, when the waiter asked \"how would you like your potato\", you would assume it came with the meal, it doesn't, mine did but not his and that was a surprise at the end, other than that it was very delicious. We ordered the BBQ shrimp for an appetizer which were huge, but not outstanding in my opinion, they were basically just coated with BBQ sauce. Overall, I enjoyed our dinner there and will go back again."}
{"text":"FANTASTIC!!!!!! This place is definitely a hidden piece of DELICIOUSNESS. My fiancé and I love trying new places that we discover on Groupon, and this was one of them. The food was superb and priced well under what you'd pay elsewhere. The staff was attentive & very friendly. Shout out to Justin, he was awesome! It's a bit of a drive if you don't live near Henderson, but it's worth the trip. We'll definitely be returning."}
{"text":"This is a hidden jewel!  When my husband suggested this restaurant, I had no idea how amazing it would be. From the intimate setting, to the wonderful steak and mushrooms. All first class!  Can't wait to return"}
{"text":"OK, we went there tonight after reading reviews on Yelp and looking at the pictures. There is no connection between the pictures and what you're getting. We ordered the Beef Wellington and what we got was a steak with a small circle of puff pastry on top.... nothing to do with the real Wellington. If you don't know how to make a real Wellington you should take it out of your menu !!! We also ordered the Chicken and it was ridiculously small portion (3 strips about 3 inches long). I asked to change it to a Rib Eye steak, cooked medium, and what I got was a burnt steak that was way over done. I returned it too and left without eating am entree. waste of time and money. If you post pictures of your dishes at least try to learn how to make them. Hideous place. I've been in a lot of steakhouses around town, this is by far the worst. A joke."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and the service was excellent. The restaurant needs a serious update but overall it was a good experience. Know that the restaurant is located in the Railroad Pass Casino."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem! Delightful dinner, Fantastic service & that's why I keep coming back! I've tried the beef Wellington, prime rib & filet, every dish I've had is perfection along with the awesome staff & waiters Bob & Justin are so kind & efficient!  I will be Back!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem inside of a roadside casino; the French onion soup was sweet and delicious, the brandied mushrooms very good and garlic-y and the filet mignon melted in my mouth! Quiet spot with good service; I loved the butter with the rolls as it also had a garlic taste! Yum! I did not care for the Manhattan cocktail because it was too strong but that's my only complaint! A+++++ meal"}
{"text":"We made reservations for 5 people at 5PM and were met at the door by the Maitre d' who escorted us into our table.  From there we were treated like royalty, with perfect service and incredible food.  One of my pet peeves is a loud, noisy atmosphere when trying to spend time with family.  The ambiance of the restaurant was well conducive to table socialization without loud interference either from an over crowding or loud music.  We were able to just relax and totally enjoy one another's company. My father was treated to a beautiful piece of cake at the end of the meal as we were there to celebrate his 85th birthday.    We have patronized this establishment for almost 25 years and it is always a great experience and worthy of 5 stars.  Tonight however, seemed to stand out more as the service was just great.  Thank you Jemel and staff for such a great dinner!"}
{"text":"Nice place after you get thru the smoky casino. The smoke honestly is the only reason I give it four stars instead of five. Food is fabulous, service is excellent  Actually, Service is top notch and truly elevates the experience! Djamel (\"Jamel\") is attentive, nice and knowledgeable and I observed the same from his counterparts. Enough said, it's been a long day! On to the food...I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Why would I drive east of town to an old casino on the 93/95? Found a Groupon for a steakhouse and thought why not give it a try? Located next to the buffet is a great find. A friendly welcome at the door even though we arrived well before our reservation time, constant attention from every server working tonight! Our server, Bob, was as good as they come. Accommodated to every request we had and showed true pride. Angie was not our server, but came over to say hello to my 16 month old boy in his high chair and was very friendly the entire time we were here. Another server (not ours) delivered bread when he noticed ours was gone. The entire time from start to finish was enjoyable and 5-stars is not enough to express the exceptional service experienced.  Oh, yes, our steak... our appetizer was the BBQ bacon wrapped shrimp. Large shrimp, smoked bacon and an excellent appetizer. Main entree both my wife and I ordered the rib eye. The steak was cooked exactly to our likings with a perfect amount of seasoning. The sides were just as amazing! Asparagus was tender, mac and cheese had lobster and had amazing flavor, mashed potatoes were whipped with great flavor. Dessert included both the crem brûlée and Molton cake.  We will be back even without a Groupon! I highly recommend this restaurant. Well done crew!"}
{"text":"We've been long-time customers of this restaurant: good food, good service, and a convenient location. The one weakness is a terrible wine list, but they only charged a $10 corkage fee. However, tonight I was charged $25 and wasn't informed of the increase until the check arrived.  It is unfortunate that they feel the need to gauge their regular customers! This is not The Strip!!!! Unacceptable!!"}
{"text":"Love coming here, in spite of the road construction..  Bob treats me like I'm a friend at his house. The steaks and the sides are fantastic!"}
{"text":"This was our 2nd time dining here. THE BEST steakhouse we've ever been to. Hands down. we had the filet mignon and it was perfect. We also got the Thursday wine special...purchase 2 entrees and receive a free bottle of wine. Not a bad deal!  Our waiter, Bob, was fantastic. The atmosphere is calming. The entire experience was wonderful! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We went here on Friday night with a Groupon. 5:30, so wasn't very busy yet. I had been looking forward to trying this place after reading a lot of positive reviews. I really liked the room. A little dated but very comfortable and I liked the ambiance. The service was great.....as good as I've had anywhere. Bob and Maria were fantastic. The bread and salad were good. I had the steak Oscar, medium, and was very disappointed. It was almost identical to another review here on Yelp. I was expecting 2 medallions, each about half of  filet, or at least a quarter. I was served 4 small strips of meat cooked closer to well done than medium. As small as they were I guess it was hard not to overcook. The crabcake was a mushy tasteless ball that reminded me of a seafood croquette they used to serve years ago in the school cafeteria. I wish I had tried a steak or the prime rib instead.  I give the service 5 stars, atmosphere 4 stars and the food 2 stars."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to dinner here as the result of a Groupon incentive.   We were not disappointed! We have been there twice now and most recently, this last Friday! We were able to get seated quickly, without reservations. However, we did arrive early and there was a rush as the evening progressed! So, reservations would be recommended.  Our waiter, Bob, was courteous and attentive. Maria, our busser was quick to refill our drinks and bread as needed.   The food was outstanding starting with the appetizer: crab cakes! Dinner was fantastic. Our meal was served hot and fresh! Everything is sold ala carte. So, you can create your meal to your preferences.   Give them a try, and ask for Bob. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"GREAT experience all the way around.  Ask for Bob, he is awesome.  Vegas has a thing for Prime Rib, I'm not a fan.  STEAK is where it is at, and I have lived here for 5 years.  Originally from Chicago, we had amazing steakhouses.  Melt in your mouth steaks with flavor galore.  I certainly haven't been to ALL the steakhouse in Vegas, but I can certainly say I have been disappointed on many occasion.  NO DISAPPOINTMENT at DeSimone's.  The Cowboy Cut Ribeye, on the bone was truly a melt in you mouth steak with flavor galore.  Nice homey atmosphere, seemed very family oriented.  Loved, Loved, Loved the entire experience!  Priced just right too!"}
{"text":"Nice classic steakhouse decor ( dark red colors and big booths with plenty of privacy).  The host was the manager I believe.  Everyone was polite and accommodating.  We split the spinach salad and it had a lot of flavor profiles.  It was baby spinach tossed in an apple cider vinaigrette with red bell peppers, dried cranberries, candied pecans, feta cheese and roasted pears.  Both of us ordered the steak medallion oscar.  There were 3 medallions on top of garlic mashed potatoes and several pieces of asparagus.  There was a small Crabcakes on the plate and it was decent.  I asked for the hollandaise on the side.  The meal was excellent.  The server pre bussed our table properly and kept my water glass full.  I will be back here definitely."}
{"text":"If you stop in for dinner. Go see Justin at the steak house. He is very attentive and great friendly service. So important in my book to have a amazing dinning experience. The food is good not out of this world but always a choice on our list for sure."}
{"text":"11/30/2017 I purchased a Groupon Coupon a couple of months ago ($50 worth of food for $25)  It expired but I was given an extension so I went this evening to check the place out.  I arrived around 4:20pm and noticed a sign saying \"appropriate dress required\"  I was dressed in a tee shirt and jeans as were a couple of other people and I did not feel  out of place.  I was seated immediately and my drink order was taken.  I was one of about 6 people in the restaurant.  It was nicely decorated with maroon walls and what I would call a late 1890's Victorian décor.   I ordered the \"cowboy steak\" ($38) which was advertised as a 22oz. bone in ribeye, and a loaded baked potato($6), a coke and a serving of Au Jus. My order took almost 30 minutes to arrive but it seemed as though it was just a few minutes.  It was cooked exactly as I wanted and the baked potato was excellent as well.  My drink order was refilled twice and I was asked several times if I required anything else.  The servers were pleasant, friendly and made me feel at home.  I enjoyed my meal and I would recommend giving this place a try for a nice relaxing experience."}
{"text":"This was not a restaurant I'd expect to go to, let alone enjoy, being a Vegas native that never has a reason to go out that way.  I was so utterly wrong.  Chef Robert has done an amazing job with DeSimone's, and it is a place i definitely both will recommend and return to.   The Steak Oscar:  Three filet rounds atop mashed potatoes, with asparagus spears and a crab cake.  The rounds were not thick, so I was not expecting them to actually BE medium rare inside--and they were so perfectly medium rare and excellently cut that they nearly melted in your mouth.  The asparagus was perfectly done, and the crab cake had ZERO filler--it was actual crab, a tiny bit of red onion, a tiny bit of spices, but the taste of the crab came through clean and light (none of those chunky breadcrumbs here!!!).  The highlight of this dish, though, were the filet rounds.   Cowboy Steak:  Enormous, bone-in, and infused with rosemary and spices.   This was requested medium rare, and again, was melt-in-the-mouth worthy. Joe Salad:  I don't remember the description, but it's spinach, feta, walnuts or pecans (I can't recall!), a bit of pear, cranberries, and a dressing that has a light, sweet touch in a vinagrette style (I obviously did not read the description, I just know what i ate).  VERY good. Vanilla Creme Brulee:  Not the heavy kind in the ramakin, but light custard, with a delicate brulee top.  Excellent without being heavy or over-filling. The prices are extremely fair, even for mixed drinks.   Service was top notch--Bob and Marife were excellent.  I loved the fact that the dishes were wheeled out (on a marble top server no less), as opposed to carried--makes it much easier to manuever around a restaurant when not worried about crashing into a carrying server. We WILL be back, and I can see this becoming a regular special-event place for me!"}
{"text":"Our family chooses this as our indulgent, top of the line service and delicious meal experience. The range of choices for our diverse group makes this the perfect place. We came on Mother's Day this year and we were not disappointed with the special nor anything else we ordered. I don't eat red meat but LOVE the sea bass in a curry sauce over mashed potatoes with baby bok choy. I have this same dish every time because it's just that delicious. My daughter had their Mother's Day special which she loved, she shared a piece of lobster with me and it was cooked perfectly and so fresh! The steak eaters are always blown away with the quality of their meat and that they cook it perfectly here. Service is stellar, we love Maria, such a sweetheart, always giving abundant attention to our young lady in a wheelchair. It's a pricey meal but the perfect dining experience for a special night out, we always leave full and happy."}
{"text":"Our server RIA was great.  We went for appetizers and she suggested the bacon wrapped shrimp and Sate Tenderloin.  Absolutely knockout great!!  Having a drink and waiting for our appetizers we watched beautiful steaks and seafood go by our table.   This place is definitely worth the drive. Can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"First time at this restaurant but it won't be my last. Ordered the cowboy ribeye it was cooked perfect. Wife had filet mignon again cooked perfect. Also the lobster mac and cheese was awesome with large chunks of lobster. Every thing was great."}
{"text":"Hubby and I found this little gem of a steakhouse while perusing Groupon. The menu looked tempting, so we made the purchase and within the next week made our date night come to fruition.   The casino... let's just call it \"old school\". We HAD to go through it to get to the steakhouse. I questioned our decision right about then, but it was the last time I had any reservations.   We were greeted promptly and sat immediately. The room has high ceilings but a quiet, intimate feel.   Our waiter, Justin, greeted us promptly, and had waters brought quickly. The bread was hot and fresh, while the butter was soft and sweet. My bacon-wrapped shrimp were huge and hubby's lobster bisque was thick and not shy at all on the lobster. I prefer my steak rare (which is why I don't normally eat it. Most places are afraid of a serving a cold, red piece of meat) and it was perfection. I would be hard pressed to remember having a better steak. The cut was truly lovely and it melted in my mouth. The sides were very generous in size, and equally as tasty as my steak. I wish I had saved room for desert. Alas, we will gladly make another trip out to try the sweets.   I can't rave enough about this place. Top-notch service, excellent food, and the icing on the cake, reasonable prices. If you're on the fence about going here, stop it! Get in your car and head to DeSimone's Steakhouse."}
{"text":"So I got this on a Groupon because it said Henderson, but it's pretty far out there inside some Casino called Rail Pass I think. The casino left much to be desired. It was more of a truck stop type place. The restaurant inside was okay. Service was very good. The maitre'd and our waitress was great. The steaks - we ordered Ribeye with bone and one without- were ok. Mash potatoes pretty good but could have used garlic. The Asparagus was really good and mushroom ok. Overall it's an okay experience but not what you might call a great steak. With strip being so close I'd opt for something there in way of steaks. Again for what type of casino this was I expected much worse, happy it was ok, but not coming back."}
{"text":"This place might be in an old casino but don't let that fool you.  I had to try it for the filet mignon. I was NOT disappointed.  The waiter was excellent, the steak was excellent and I thoroughly enjoyed my evening.  GET THE FILET!"}
{"text":"I entered a review of DeSimones about 10 months ago. This review will be as glowing as the last. The spinach salad was wonderful and our server, Angie, even split it for us. My wife had the a special dish with filet, crab cake, asparagus, and potatoes. It was so good she would have it again. I had the Prime Rib, the small cut. But when it came it was huge and cooked perfectly. The baked potato was huge with lots of butter. The only negative was the creamed spinach. The onions needed a little more sautéing and maybe a dash of bacon would have helped the flavor a little. Last time we shared asparagus and will do that during our next visit, because we will go again. Skip the spinach but don't skip DeSimones. We had a Groupon which made the price low, but even without the Groupon the prices are much lower than any comparable restaurant in the Vegas area. Don't hesitate on dining here and if you are lucky enough to be served by Angie you'll have great service."}
{"text":"The worst experience I have had at a restaurant that I can remember.  Would not honor my Groupon as they claimed it was a holiday weekend.  Went on a Friday night. It was memorial day weekend which is Saturday, Sunday and Monday. I mentioned groupon when I made reservations."}
{"text":"We used a Groupon which made this a super value. Without the Groupon the overall quality made this a real bargain. Even if you paid full retail price you will get your money's worth. I would take out-of-town visitors here for a great meal. But, it was not perfect. My prime rib was good but not great. Since they don't sell a lot of prime rib I suspect the roast sits in a warming oven. This is standard at most restaurants except those with high volumes like Lawry's. The bread was not as bad as one reviewer suggested. It was sourdough so it was a little crunchy. The butter was infused with honey, a very unique and surprising taste. I'd ask for plain butter on my next visit. The creamed spinach was good but my wife felt it was a little heavy in garlic. My wife's filet was excellent, not good, excellent. For dessert my wife had the molten chocolate cake which was exceptional. Our server, Bob, did a great job. He could easily be an asset to a larger more prestigious steak house. Ask for Bob. The service was very good overall. Although this steakhouse is in a bargain rate hotel/casino in the middle of nowhere, it is a real find. My only recommendation would be to pass on the prime rib and go for a steak."}
{"text":"This restaurant has been recently renovated and renamed under new owner Joe DeSimone.  Chef Robert, former owner of the defunct Kailyn's Kitchen, is now in the kitchen.  We started off with glasses of the house cabernet while reviewing the menu.  My wife ordered the 8-ounce filet mignon and mashed potatoes while I settled on sea bass over the same potatoes.  The filet was cooked medium rare as requested and tender as you would expect.  My sea bass was a little thin but satisfying while the jury is still out as to whether or not the mashed potatoes came from a box or were just pureed.  I probably would not return unless I had another (Groupon) deal. A rating of 2.5 would be appropriate."}
{"text":"So I always check the reviews of restaurants before we go there until this time... Came here on a Groupon greatful we didn't pay full price. Wait staff was nice ----that's about all good I can say ... The sea bass was tasty ...except it was supposed to have curry sauce poured all over it and it was served on Wasabi mashed potatoes ...why??? Just now I read a few of the reviews and the one NOT..recommended review was actually spot on- with our experience I had the same meal.. It was supposed to be a filet mignon oscar style instead it tasted more like burnt pot roast and it came with a crab ball that look like it was deep fried not quite sure how this is supposed to be what it said it was on the menu. The manager came over teach table asking how it was and when I showed him the steak as response was oh we have a new sous-chef and I am from Pittsburgh and that's how we do our filet mignon.. Well buddy --maybe you should go back to Pittsburgh,  because in Vegas we like our steaks cooked correctly and not crispy unless that's exactly how we order it. I will give props to the wait staff we had a nice waiter and an attentive bus person. And in closing if you want to try your chance with a Groupon at DeSimone Steakhouse wait till the construction is done or you have to drive through the pot hold dirty parking lot and fight for a spot"}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place a better review, because the staff was friendly, but too much was just off.  Went here for my wife and I's anniversary dinner. We debated going to a steakhouse we've been to before but I yelped this place and decided we would give it a try, as we always like finding new places. I decided on here in particular because they have beef Wellington, a dish I've always wanted to try but never have.  For a Saturday the place was dead. We were seated and our order was taken: Beef Wellington ($38), Ribeye, blackened ($26) and a lobster bisque ($9). The prices seemed reasonable for a good steakhouse and it had that dark, romantic atmosphere, so no complaints so far.  The breadbasket came out and it was probably the best thing we had. They had multiple types of rolls and a garlic butter that may have been the best I've ever had. Cannot stress enough how good the butter was with the rolls. Are too many with my bisque.  The bisque was watery and the lobster meat tasted chewy and over cooked. Had an OK flavor and with the delicious rolls I was overall happy.  Then the Beef Wellington came out... I wasn't sure what I was looking at. It was mashed potatoes with gravy, with filet mignon and a biscuit on top. If you don't know what Beef Wellington is, it's supposed to be Filet wrapped in s puff pastry.  I asked the server, who told me it chef had changed the recipe because they would burn the pastry to cook the filet properly and they had a lot of issues with it. To me, the reason I was paying $38 for it was because it's supposed to be delicious and hard to cook right! I took a bite or two, and the filet was good, but it wasn't just what I ordered. I even went to the front and checked the menu, thinking maybe I had miss read it. Nope, the menu said Filet Mignon wrapped in puff pastry.  I told the staff, who were very friendly and agreed with me the menu was inaccurate. My wife's ribeye was pretty good, so I asked for the same. While I was waiting I finished the other half of my wife's ribeye and we took mine home. The next day, we ate it and noticed they forgot to blacken it...  This place is very close to being good, but for their prices and location I can't give them a better review based on our experience. May try this place in the future, but wouldn't recommend for a special occasion."}
{"text":"Very nice dinner here. Good service. Our waiter told me Lance cooked the Fabulous prime rib..perhaps one of top 3 I've ever had... so delicious.  The baked potato was awesome as was the filet mignon. The salads were good and so was the shrimp cocktail. Nice place to eat with Excellent prime rib cooked perfectly to medium. We will be back"}
{"text":"I have to agree with the others who call this restaurant a \"hidden gem\". We happened upon this steakhouse about a year ago based on a friend's recommendation and admittedly we were a little hesitant to try it given its location relative to the Strip. Boy, we couldn't have been more wrong. What a great experience starting from being seated almost right away on a busy Friday night to the extremely pleasant and helpful waitstaff to the quality of the food.    On our first visit, we started with the lobster bisque which was very good. I had the prime rib and had not seen such a large and tasty piece of meat before or since. My wife had the petite filet and was equally happy with her choice. We have been back twice since where I tried the ribeye steak and filet mignon; each was above my expectations. Now we make it a point to stop at the Railroad Pass Casino on all of our drives from Phoenix to Las Vegas without fail."}
{"text":"I would like to start off by saying that the atmosphere at this location is outstanding. We were seated immediately and our waiter, Bob, was absolutely outstanding also. We ordered appetizers which was the coconut shrimp and I must say it was excellent. Our drinks were also excellent however things changed when we got to our main entree. My wife had the prime rib which was like shoe leather. I had the rib eye steak, which was as tough as eating concrete. I could not believe that both of us had such a horrible cuts of meat. Again, the service was great and the appetizers were great but overall our steaks were horrible. We also noticed that the couple next to us was complaining also about the quality of the meat. I would not recommend going here unless you are looking for torture when it comes to steaks. Maybe they do chicken and fish better I don't know."}
{"text":"We decided to go here for our anniversary and couldn't have asked for a better dinner. Our server Ria was the best. Very good service and fabulous meal. We will go back again."}
{"text":"We just tried this gem last night. We live in old Henderson and it is very difficult to find a good steak around us so we were delighted to find this place on Yelp (also they have a current groupon which is always a plus!). Alright so here's my review:  Ambience: old school vegas but still classy on the inside. Dimly lit, romantic/but not overly formal. However, I agree with prior posts.....there is still a stale cigarette smoke smell coming in from the casino. We're smokers so this didn't bother us too much but I could see how this could be a problem for other people. We were also seated right by the casino entrance so I am sure this wouldn't have been as noticeable if you requested a seat further back  Service: No complaints. We were greeted almost immediatelyand led to our booth. A server came over within two minutes for drink orders. Another server stopped by a minute later to make sure someone had already taken our order.   Food: the bread comes warm with some type of honey butter which was a nice surprise. We started with a chef special app - steamed oysters. Oysters were huge, cooked perfectly, and the broth was amazing. This needs to be permanently on their menu. The bread that comes with the Oysters is almost like fried on the outside and warm on the inside. soooo good. The lobster bisque was good but a little on the salty side. I ordered the filet and the cut was perfect and it was cooked just right (medium rare). My Husband ordered the cowboy (bone-in ribeye) he loved his (said it just melted in his mouth like butter). For sides we ordered: mash potatoes. They were extremely buttery and smooth....just the way I like them! The creamed spinach. I loved this side but my husband was not a fan. It has bacon bits in it and there is more cream than spinach but I loved it. We also ordered the lobster mac n cheese (yes we ordered a ton of food!). This was the only side we were both disappointed in. Perhaps it was just overcooked and it's normally good....but for us it was dry and not worth the price. We were too full to order dessert but next time we will definitely order the lava cake.   Price: I love the prices! The steaks, oysters, and service were comparable to other nice steak houses (if not better) such as Mortons but the bill was half the price even without the groupon.   Overall: highly recommended and we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is a terrific place for old school steak! Delicious meat,great sides, fantastic service! We had the Steak Oscar and a rib eye. The sauces are from scratch...bernaise sauce was to die for... the best I have had in years."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a gem as others have mentioned. The decor and atmosphere is old school Las Vegas (and don't let the smokey walk through the casino to get there put you off) and the service was excellent. We loved the mixed bread basket and wish we could buy the marbled rye rolls somewhere but assume they're made in-house. My husband's salad was very good as was the shrimp cocktail (4 pieces).  The filets were perfect as well as my sea bass on wasabi mashed potatoes with bok choy. The baked potato was quite large and delicious.  The creamed spinach was also delicious. Only two items were just ok...the lobster bisque and lobster mac n cheese. My chardonnay was wonderful with a very generous pour. The prices are less than the strip and overall, we wouldn't hesitate to go back."}
{"text":"Will been there 3 times in the past 2 months everybody's very attentive Rob the server it's always very good the the food is excellent and the rest of the staff on the whole Casino they're very nice"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem! Everything, from the service to the food was 5 stars. I highly suggest the ribeye. Some of the best steak I've ever had."}
{"text":"This is the best steakhouse you can get in and around Las Vegas. Do not let the Railroad Pass fool you. It may be like Laughlin but this Steakhouse could be inside the Wynn or Caesars Palace it is amazing!! Not only is the food top-notch but the price is a third of what it would be at any other fine Steakhouse in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. Truly a hidden gem nestled between Boulder City and Henderson in the historic Railroad Pass Hotel/Casino. The filet mignon practically melts in your mouth. It's never crowded. Elegant old Las Vegas vibe. Way better than the highly overrated Circus Circus Steakhouse."}
