{"text":"Finally, good, cheap and super-authentic tacos in Montreal. I've eaten a lot of tacos in both Mexico and other places with top-notch Mexican food (think California), and these are the real deal.

The standard salsa is not very spicy, but I asked the owner and he popped back into the kitchen to whip up something ¡piquante! They are also very friendly, as others have pointed out."}
{"text":"Best tacos ever! The Barbacoa is fabulous and hibiscus lemonade. Super friendly staff!"}
{"text":"I was around the neighbourhood and was craving some Mexican. Whipped out my cell and whoop, this place comes up on the radar of the mixed nut app called Yelp. Sure, let's give it a try since a few reviews looked fake with generous stars and the others, well, challenging me to see for myself and decide if we're on the same page... taste wise. 

The place is a fast food concept, with few stools around 3-4 high tables. Clean and neat place. Ordered the beef and cheese tacos, $12.50 plus tax. There's 4 in a plastic basket and they come with two bottles of a green and hot sauce. My first few bites were without the sauce just to test the naked waters in order to have a fair taste judgment. Meh, nothing here to wow. Noted, penny-pinching amount of cheese. At this point and after being on this app for some time now, these overinflated reviews are a déjà vu. Tried the rest with the sauces and the party got off somewhere more fun now. Ok, add half a star just for them very good sauces. 

Conclusion, an average taste experience and once again, who knows why exactly most gave it 5 stars. Definitely overrated in my opinion. Yours to discover to sing your own song over here."}
{"text":"Not usually one to jump on a gimmick, I was forced to break my usual habits and enter this establishment out of curiosity. There's definitely never been something so punk and awesome in the neighbourhood, as well as authentic and delicious!

Trunp's tacos are authentic Mexican street food in a city that, at least in the past, has been lacking in tasty Mexi-foods.

Their hot sauce, service, and staff are all excellent and warrant this high rating.

Everyone I know in the 'hood is melting over this experience."}
{"text":"Amazing tacos, friendly owner, and great (homemade?) lemonade. Portions are good and the food comes out piping hot, as I like it. Several sauces in varying degrees of pain are offered as well. I'll be a regular :)"}
{"text":"Excellent tacos (très spicy) et super service, je recommande!!! 
Nous avons essayé les tacos el pastor ainsi que les boeuf effiloché, un vrai régal."}
{"text":"Wow! As a foreigner visiting Montreal, I was shocked to find legit Mexican street tacos here, so far from their origins and in such a plain and unremarkable location. Such a subtle hole in the wall would be common in places like San Diego, but here in the North East I just assumed I'd never find it. Yet here I am, writing a 5-star review, and telling all you Canadian-sons-o-bitches to get the fuck down to this place and eat these tacos. These are the real deal. Real Mexican, real street tacos, genuine salsas, and the exact right variety of meats from carne asada to el pastor. Skip the Poutine for just a quick second and try this instead - your stomachs will thank me (ok, not me but their kitchen)."}
{"text":"Aw man you gotta pass by here and say hi to Jesus and try these delicious, totally homemade tacos direct from his hometown of Monterey Mexico! Jesus is so passionate about what he does, and so excited, it's totally contagious. The vibe in here is completely welcoming and warm, everyone felt like a regular when we were here and they've only been open for a couple weeks. 

I'm eating veg these days so I can tell you, the Monterey Vegetarian with marinated mushrooms and crispy melts cheese is excellent, especially when slathered with the homemade avocado hot sauce. At 4 for $10 they are a perfect lunch.

Apparently the smoked meat taco has nothing to do with Montréal smoked meat and everything to do with Sundays back home, so go try that and report back!!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Went here with my girlfriend and we had tacos al pastor and the boeuf effiloché barbacoa. These were super tasty and come in a basket. It comes with hot sauce and green lime sauce. We also had a cheese quesadilla that was amazing! The Jamaica Hibiscus juice is delicious, organic and made fresh on site. I've been to Mexico and this place is super authentic. And Jésus is the nicest, friendly owner you'll ever meet! I would jump over a wall just to eat these tacos. My top taco place in Montreal :)"}
{"text":"These tacos are liiiiiiit! :))
Many different options, great meat & vegie and all with delicious home made sauce! +unlimited avocado sauce :)
It is authentic, home-made & delicious. If you are looking for one of the best tacos in the city, look no further!

Yummy :)"}
