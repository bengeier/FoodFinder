{"text":"We walk by this place all the time, but it never seems to be open for dinner (now I know its only Thurs-Saturday).   I know it is a hopping place for weekend brunch, but wanted to try out their dinner menu.   We ordered the trout & slow cooked short ribs.  Everything tasted delicious and the price was very reasonable for top quality food (at $16 per entree).  The trout was cooked to perfection with a side of horseradish potatoes (not overpowering at all, just a hint of fresh horseradish). The short rib was braised beautifully, falling off the bone, and paired with Israeli couscous.  For desert we had a carrot cake that was dense and wonderfully spiced.    The owner and chef stopped by the table to chat with us, he was friendly and definitely passionate about his cuisine.  His business really relies on neighbourhood support, and I hope he succeeds because our meal was great!  If you are looking for a place for dinner, venture east of Keele, you will be pleasantly surprised and delighted you came."}
{"text":"It's every bit as good as advertised.  We walked in on a Saturday morning, and there was plenty of room to sit down.  Our server was super-polite and accommodating, though the service slowed down a tad when the place started filling in.  Still, the experience was pretty good.  And then there was the food.  Every morsel of it was utterly delicious.  The flavours are bold and surprising; even the home fries were an adventure in taste.  On impulse, I've picked an apple tart tartine off the desert shelf, and it made me want to lick my plate.  If I lived in the neighbourhood, I'd eat here all the time.  Can't wait to go back.  I'm sure this place will get discovered soon, and there'll be a line out the door.  Do yourself a favour and check it out while it's still nice and quiet."}
{"text":"Brunch and lunch items are delicious, too complicated to make at home, and under $11."}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a try to find that they are closed. I checked the website for hours before I went, including the Chet's blog. I get there and there is paper covering the windows and a re-zoning notice in the window. When I got home, I rechecked the website and there was no mention of renovations or that they were closing. Their Facebook page did mention something (almost in passing) about closing on April 21."}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday morning. It was very hot in the restaurant but that might have been because of the beautiful girl sitting across from me. Food was great. I had the goat cheese omelet. I could only eat half but I'm assuming the other half was just as good."}
{"text":"I'm amazed somebody gave this place a bad review!  Every time I have been to The Junction Eatery, it has blown my mind!  The food there is of gourmet quality, the portions are fair, and the prices are great!  The owner is the friendliest person I've met in the area!  Very talented and gracious.  I can't recommend this place enough.  The dude that gave it a poor review must have walked in, pissed off about something else and took it out on The Junction Eatery!"}
{"text":"Had driven by here a few times and after a poor showing from the Farmhouse Tavern was happy to try Junction Eatery.  The menu was simple but each dish looked interesting...\"Fried Yard Bird and sweet horseradish mash\"...lamb shanks... grilled salmon. Hearty, happy food. The prices were all below $20 and the atmosphere was homey.   There was only one server who although very sweet and helpful may have been stretched too thin between tables, but nothing worth getting upset about. They've got a very popular brunch offering on the weekend which was totally reasonably priced...and if the dinner product was any indication...totally delicious.   Lots of local beer on tap."}
{"text":"After perusing the menu at Cool Hand of a Girl next door, we decided to keep walking. Not that it was bad, but not sure why I had wanted to go there so badly. We did NOT regret this decision.   I got the Beef Brisket Hash with Poached Egg and Mushroom Sauce. This was excellent. The hash was crispy and it all sat on top of some greens. The eggs were perfectly cooked and it was all very amazing.   Daniela H got the Challah French Toast, dipped in Corn Flakes, and covered with candied Pecans, served with fruit, preserves and maple syrup. \"Nuff said.   Coffee came in a huge mug and I believe bottomless.   We did have an incident with a bee that kept visiting us, bc the doors were open. I wish the servers, who saw us fidgeting, swatting and moving away, and trying to cover it with a ramekin, could have tried to help us alleviate the situation. Poor bee ended up drowning inadvertently in D's coffee.  Needless to say, they gave us a new one.   The meal came out to $23 for the two of us including tax.   Wouldn't make a huge deal to come back, but definitely will in the area. I would, however, make a point to go yoga in the morning, then come here - so sad that GL next door is closing down."}
{"text":"I've had 3 yummy meals here in 2011- a sandwich, a brunch, and a dinner and they were all very good.  The details of what I had escape me (bad memory) but what I do remember for sure is that my tastebuds were very happy, so I had to write to refute the sole other review.  Oh, I also remember they served my red wine warm, but that's not that unusual in a mid-low-level resto.  it's true it isn't the most professional of places, but I'm 3 for 3 in recent meals there."}
{"text":"This place must be doing really well, because when my family and I tried to eat brunch there, the \"chef\" was chatting with some buddies while we were waiting for our food to be prepared. Two simple requests (change of a sauce in one of the dishes, since I'm allergic to one of the ingredients, and asked for a side of cream cheese) were rejected with disdain by the so called chef. Anyway, you might have better luck with this eatery. Too bad we had a bad experience, since its so close to our place..."}
{"text":"We came for lunch on a Tuesday and ordered the catfish sandwich and southern fried chicken. The food was fresh and flavourful. However, the waitress ruined our whole experience here. From the very moment we walked in, the waitress barely acknowledged our presence. We sat ourselves, had to ask for menus, ask for cutlery, and had to walk up to the counter to order because she never came to our table. Then when we went up to the counter to pay, she didn't say a word to us, no thank you, no smile or anything as she collected our money.  The chef finally came out as we were leaving and engaged in a friendly conversation with us. He seemed like a great person and we would have gladly came back to support him, but not after the terrible service given by the waitress."}
{"text":"I was sooo Happy to eat There. Derrick Markland Is an Amazing Chef! In his cooking you will see his love of food and his creative pallets. There's a huge difference with Restaurants with Chefs to Restaurants with just cooks. This is a prime example of What a Chef can do for the Foodie in you! Anyone looking for a Great meal to awaken your taste buds should treat themselves. Great food, Great Price High Standards!"}
{"text":"The Junction Eatery is a great little neighborhood restaurant, that has become one of my favorite places in the city. I feel like its the city's best kept brunch secret.  There is always smooth R&B playing throughout the restaurant, which really relaxes the atmosphere.  The meals and menu are prepared by the owner/chef. It may take a bit of time to get your order, but it's only because he is putting in the extra time to ensure things are just right."}
{"text":"I have weird working hours and seems like whenever I am free, Junction Eatery is closed so it took me more than 1 year to able to make it here for brunch.  The restaurant is small and can be crowded. The wait for food can be long and the service may be lacking. It might have limited opening hours and maybe even floating hours....  But the food here is excellent. We ordered :  Smoked Brisket Hash & Eggs ($9.25)   Southern Breakfast ($10.95) - Fried catfish and 2 eggs sunny side up  Both entrees were delicious, well prepared and with complexity and contrast in taste and texture. One can tell that the chef took time and effort in preparation. For the price that I am paying, it is definitely a bargain. I could be biased since I love the stronger and bolder \"southern\" flavour!  I can't wait to be back again for brunch or  their \"Supper\" Club Monthly prix offers or  Crème Brûlée & Warm Beignets dessert that sounded exciting!"}
{"text":"Outstanding brunch and exceptionally cheap compared to similar class of food.  Delicious!"}
