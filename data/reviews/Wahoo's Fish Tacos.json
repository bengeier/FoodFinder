{"text":"So this place used to be a steak joint, and as a vegetarian, I never really had a reason to pay it any mind. But the Wahoo's has been here for a little while, and let me tell you, I am quite glad it has! 

Does henderson lack a decent Mexican restaurant? No. But trying to find a decently clean late night bar that's not a PT's that also serves some great vegetarian options at a very competitive price can be an exercise in futility. 

$3 pacificos all the time. I got the \"Outer Reef\" vegetarian burrito, which, for ~$5 was very satisfactory. I'd get it again, but I'd probably ask for less rice and more beans. The view at night is wonderful as well! The addition of outdoor seating and a few couches around a fire really make for a pleasant experience. Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I've become a regular here. The food is always great and every time I visit this location Jessie makes my experience wonderful! He's very engaging and always happy to assist! Try the kale kai salmon salad!! It's the best thing on the menu!!"}
{"text":"Delicious, fresh ingredients, fun atmosphere, reasonably priced.  This restaurant is a win all-around.  

We went there this afternoon for a preschool fundraiser and had a great experience.  I really liked the white cajun beans."}
{"text":"This was my first time at this location and I went there for lunch.  First off, it took over 30 minutes to receive our food and I had to go ask where the food was. The time it took is unacceptable and because of that would probably not go back during lunch hours since I generally only have a 30 minute lunch period. When I got my order, it was incorrect; however, at that point I could not send it back to due time constraints and I needed to eat and leave. The food was decent, but not as good as other locations that I have visited.  I would only return if others want to eat there, but not out of personal choice due to the time it took to get the food."}
{"text":"Had lunch today at Wahoo's with my wife. She had  beef taco with side of black beans. Beans came straight from the can. No flavor at all. I had the reef burrito.  Should have gone to Del Taco   Not up to par. Will not return"}
{"text":"I'm torn because they have such a great bar, but the service is terrible.  How do you not notice customers walking in when your standing right there chatting with friends?  15 minutes before service is why probably why your not earning many tips, just an fyi."}
{"text":"My friends recommend me to go to Wahoos many times and Me and my girlfriend decided to try wahoos for the first time. 
Very friendly and helpful guys working there, they helped us to pick what to order. 
I got fish tacos and my girl got a bowl with shrimp and chicken. The food was great, everything tastes fresh. 
We will definitely come again."}
{"text":"Very fresh food. The tacos, beans, and rice, are all fresh and delicious (most importantly NOT FRIED!!). Comparable to the california locations."}
{"text":"Another wonderful experience at Wahoo's!  Shannon recommended I try something new and I'm glad she did!  Street tacos were great, though blackened fish tacos with citrus slaw are still my favorite!!!!  I will definitely be back for more!!!!"}
{"text":"What an awesome first experience!  The food is fantastic--really fresh and presented beautifully.  The staff was exceptional--especially Michael at the front.  We were blown away at the quality of the food for such reasonable prices!  We live in the neighborhood and will definitely be back.  Yummy!"}
{"text":"So I had a crappy experience at Three Angry Wives and when I left I went to Wahoos, when I got there I was greeted by 2 great Bartenders, Floody and Bree! Very friendly made me feel at home, and just some of the BEST SERVICE I've had in awhile!! Definitely will go back, I think this company has 2 really great assets!"}
{"text":"This place is always consistent.  It's the best fish salad I've had in vegas. I've been to other locations but the staff at this one is super amazing. Love it!"}
{"text":"TACOS? Not really.... first of all the tortilla was cold the shrimp was not good flavor wise and the fish one was ehh I also had a \"carne asada\" not good. The sides I Had white rice and Beans not good. the place is a cool hang out spot nice bar. If I ever come back it would be to have a drink at the bar but I wont even give the food another try. I have to say rubios is WAY better their tacos are actually good."}
{"text":"Went to Wahoo's a few weeks ago and had two delicious chicken taco's. I'm still thinking about them. Yummy! Great place, great atmosphere, great employees, good job Wahoo's! I liked the whole decor theme and how you have the video clips showing on the wall. Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this for a while since I love it so much in Cali.  Yuck!! I won't be going back.  I usaually get the salad with carne asada. Well, the lettuce was wilted, the steak was tough not tender like in Cali.  My daughter got quesedilla with fries and I would say the fries were the best thing but is that what they're known for???  They came to ask how was everything?  I showed them the wilted lettuce...the waitress  said oh...I'll tell the manager...and we waited...nothing happened.  The manager didn't come out to say anything or may be she didn't even mention it.  Either way it was bad food here, won't be going back...so disappointed:("}
{"text":"If you're looking for something on par with Chipotle, this is a good option as the food is fresh and the prices are great.  The classic burrito ($5) is a flour tortilla filled with lettuce, cheese, salsa and the protein of your choice.  I thought the carne asada was nicely flavored.  I've had their burritos served wet with green/red sauce and cheese, which is also a tasty option.  My husband didn't think the shrimp and fish tacos were anything special.  On the night we went, the restaurant was uncomfortably warm, it was actually hotter in the restaurant than outside, and this does not bode well for the summer months!"}
{"text":"Order usually not right.  Food cold.  Hopefully they can work out the kinks."}
{"text":"I give Wahoos a one star due to the sad fact that they actually MICROWAVE some of their dishes. If you are in Las Vegas Boca Park location (franchise) and you order an enchilada for example, be prepared to eat some Styrofoam from the take out box that they put the enchiladas in before microwave heating. My and my wife's enchiladas packed in separate Styrofoam holders for takeout,  both are overheated cheese stuck to the perimeter of the foam holder with clear signs that the holder and enchiladas had been superheated in the microwave oven.   Forget fresh food for some of their dishes. Now the phish? tacos that I get always seem fresher and show no signs of microwave usage. A restaurant is only as good as its food and this is presented poorly. Sad, as I have been eating at the original Wahoo's in Costa Mesa on Placentia St. and never had a bad dish there. I guess Wahoos is no different then the other fast food joints now that they have found success. Farewell to quality."}
{"text":"Went back for the first time since my last experience and the changes were noticeable from the second I sat down. A new friendly bartender was ready to take my order even though the bar had a good amount of people in it. Service was great and the food was quality. Simple, easy, awesome! Thanks Wahoo's, I look forward to the same great experience next time!!

3stars for now.."}
{"text":"I am from Southern California and this is as good as it gets. I can't tell you how excited I am that they ventured into the Nevada market. The menu is amazing and they are great at catering to your dietary needs. I am so glad to have a reasonably priced, delicious restaurant close by!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, I really did. We each got 3 tacos each & the Fish/meat were ice cold on all of them. The tortillas were also cold & probably came straight from the bag to our plates. Really BAD!!! I will not be back!!!!!"}
{"text":"I am a HUGE Wahoo's fan. Great food, low prices, great for a quick lunch. My colleagues and I love lunch outings at Wahoo's!"}
{"text":"Just as good as the Wahoo's in California, plus it has a bar! ;)  The food is excellent and the people are friendly.  What more could you want?  The manager took the time to chat with me about locations and to ask if I have eaten at a Wahoo's before.  This is the kind of service I know at the Wahoo's in Laguna, and I'm glad to see it here.  Welcome to Las Vegas, Wahoo's!!!"}
{"text":"Been to Wahoos a bunch of times and I think it gets better every time.  The last time i went I sat at the bar.  Their Bartender Rebecca was fabulous!!! She was sooooo nice and she was very attentive. She made suggestions for food and drinks.  I had the carnitas tacos and a Blue Moon.  She made the experience with her guest service and her constant conversation.  Even when she was busy, she made time for me and my partner.  5 STARS for Rebecca.  She is an asset to your establishment.  I will definitely be back for the awesome food and great service!!!!"}
{"text":"I am at Wahoo right now.  This place is the best eats for fish burrito and tacos.  Not busy at all.  Great service and staff."}
{"text":"There are only two places I go for fast food... here is one of them. For around $8 bucks you can get a fish taco and enchilada that are really good and complimented by your choice of beans(blk or cajun) and rice(white or brown) and a tiny salad.Get a side of Mr. Lee's hot sauce for a $1 and heat it all up! Tried the wet baja lada tacos and they were a little to wet for my liking. Stick with the fish and it hits the spot at a very decent price."}
{"text":"Five stars because of the hospitality! Our bartender  brian was knowledgeable about the food and recommended fabulous cocktails. Staff is always welcoming and always tends to the guest. Wahoos is 24/7 so day or night stop in for a bite, the food comes out super fast btw."}
{"text":"Food is always good, staff is great, clean restrooms, and fair prices. Haven't had a bad experience!"}
{"text":"What a great little bar! Food was delicious, beers were cold and the bartenders were so much fun! I will be returning for sure! Thanks Bob and Tammy!"}
{"text":"Satisfyingly delicious. Excellent quality, good portions great food. The staff is warm and friendly. Knowledgeable about the food and will replace it if you do not like what you ordered. Great experience every time."}
{"text":"Service was awesome...my bartender Jen was the best !! Didn't eat there yet but I will be back :)"}
{"text":"I felt the tacos were bland.  I had the carne asada tacos and the grilled fish tacos. I tried both the specialty slaw sauce and the reg sauce.  My friend had one of their chicken burritos, which had a little more flavor. The atmosphere however is pretty cool. Not sure I will eat there again."}
{"text":"I am a frequent patron at Wahoos Fish Tacos in Boca park.... I work across the street, and am  in for lunch almost daily I gamble alot and I come in in the evening around happy hour time.... A lot of my coworkers frequent the place as well. So we like to come in in group. We play the jukebox a lot. And Cesar in the kitchen keeps turning it down to where we cannot hear our purchases we PAY GOOD MONEY to hear our favorite music ... We are really getting tired of this. We may have to go find a new location where we can enjoy our music and enjoy the outdoor atmosphere.."}
{"text":"Went into Wahoo s Friday April 26 2013 It was crowded as usual However service is terrible They have gotten rid of all servers in the bar area you have to go to the bar to order everything they have changed the pork sliders (not as good ) I don t know why things needed to be changed (mayb e to save  money on overhead) terrible choice from management"}
{"text":"I have visited Wahoo's a few times since a friend introduced me to their awesomeness. I love the white beans, yum!"}
{"text":"I love the wahoo fries! I come here for the football games, and the have the fries for $3. Too bad its a Cowboy's bar"}
{"text":"My hubby and I wanted to try something new for lunch ....we saw this place and decided to give it a try ... The atmosphere was pretty cool but the food was bland and just uneventful .. I got the laguna grande with a fish taco and three rolled tacos it tasted like it was frozen .. my husband got the carne asada burrito and there was nothing special there either .... really think this place could be cool if they got the food right ...here's hoping"}
{"text":"Their food selection is decent, beer selection is spectacular.  I have to be in the mood for their meals, but the bar atmosphere is what gives them 4 Stars for me."}
{"text":"Best spot, open 24 hours food all day and night. The bar staff are great people, personable and attentive. Even at 6am I can get delicious fish tacos! 

Definitely recommend this place"}
{"text":"This review is mostly about the cashier service... Every time we have come they are rushing us thru our order and not really wanting to answer any questions and have been a little rude. How many different cashiers can you have with the same result!?!?

We absolutely love the food and have eaten here at least 7-8 times and will come back but as long as you don't expect great customer service from the cashiers then you are good to go! The wait staff have been awesome I have to add."}
{"text":"Great interior layout. Especially, in the summertime.  It is like a indoor / outdoor type atmosphere. Very friendly staff for the most part.
I was not at all interested in the food after the 1rst bite.  I could bor even finish my meal. It wasnt burnt or rotten. It was just as if the cook started cooking yesterday and he is working here today. Not even up to par with fast food.  
I am just being honest.  But, some people prefer the atmosphere and don't mind the food I guess. Or maybe I am too picky?"}
{"text":"All I have to say is that as a former OC resident, having a Wahoo's in town is the best news I've gotten  all year, and it is available 24/7, even better.  I have two words Maui Bowl!!!!!"}
{"text":"A hidden jem! Get the cajun fish tacos, so delicious!  The chips were crisp and not stale and the salsa a touch spicy loke I like it.   Pacifico is only $2.95 for a 16oz draft, it doesnt get any be than that!"}
{"text":"I went with my sister and my boyfriend for lunch today. It was our first time there. The staff was friendly and answered the question we had about the menu. My sister ordered a fish taco with rice and beans, while my boyfriend and I both ordered Cajun chicken nacho. They came with lots of cheese and beans, but not too much chicken. Overall they were delicious. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I've been a Wahoo's regular for years. I used to go to the one in West LA at least once a week. About 10 years ago, they opened a location on the strip in the Hawaiian marketplace. Unfortunately, it went bust after only a few months. Luckily, there's a new Wahoo's in town and now I can get my Wahoo's fix. My go-to meal is the Maui bowl - marinated steak with seasoned rice and beans. This particular Wahoo's has gotten it right (tender steak, slightly rare) and gotten it all wrong (beef jerky on rice, anyone?). Your mileage may vary.

There's a special late night menu at the bar, along with a discount if you're in the hospitality industry. Hey, it sure as hell beats Del Taco at 3 am."}
{"text":"Just an overall good place to go for whatever kind of time you're trying to have. It's a much more lively atmosphere than that of most gaming bars in town. The staff there is amazing, Joey, Brian and Chris are all phenomenal bartenders and will always take great care of you. The food is always consistent which means something too."}
{"text":"This place is ok. The food is fine but it bothers me that you can walk outside of it and smell rancid oil they use to fry the fish. Change the oil people! It's not ok to keep cooking with the same oil week after week."}
{"text":"I myself work in a resturant so i understand that mistakes happen, but my experience with wahoos tacos was so disapointing that I will NEVER spend another dime at any of thier establishments. My husband and i got take out at the nearest wahoos on rainbow. We purchaced $30 worth of tacos and condiments. When we got home we discovered that none of the tacos had any dressings. They were nothing more than tortilla, meat, lettus. No pico, no slaw. NOTHING. I would never pay 30$ for meat and lettus. Not to mention the meat tasted terrible that night. No flavor at all. I called immediatly assuming I would just speak to a manager and come get some replacements. Well the employee Vinny explained to me that he couldnt help me and their manager was not there for the night and there was no one else I could talk to. So I asked him to take my name and number and have them get back to me the next day. 2days later I called again at 5pm and another employee again tells me there is no manager on duty. So I gave him my name and phone number and explained the situation he said he would put my info on his managers desk. Its been 3weeks and no one ever got back to me. Mistakes happen but they clearly dont care about good customer service. I was ripped off and they could really care less."}
{"text":"PAY CASH! They up tips!
I caught this at the restaurant and asked to see the manager. The Manager was the one at the register that did it!"}
{"text":"Our first time visiting, we were definitely blown away by the customer service that we received from Jesse, he answered all our questions and made our experience well worth our time. The food was decent but we will certainly be back to give it another shot because of the outstanding service that Jesse provided us with."}
{"text":"I've been eating at Wahoo's for 6 years. I love the two bartenders they are so kind. Brian and Floody make the place feel like Cheers... Always a smile and great service. I don't think I would eat there as much as I do if it weren't for them and the wonderful kitchen staff especially Julie. The food is always great and I'm a picky eater"}
{"text":"I was weary about coming to this place because my co-workers informed me that they were told this place had the best fish tacos. Now, I am a bit picky when it comes to that. I ordered the fish \"taquitos\" and asked the cashier if it was spicy and he said no. I then proceeded with the order and around 6 minutes later a lady comes and hands me what appears to be a beef taquito. I was confuse because from the picture, I thought I had order \"soft shell\" fish tacos. Plus, it did not look like fish it looked like beef because the meat inside was black. I was baffled and the lady then asked me if it was the order I had ordered. I didn't want to make a situation worse and then Tashia, our food delivery attendant that was assisting us asked, \"Would you like me to bring you the correct order and would you want it with the same side orders?\" I was thrown aback because nowadays, no one does that, they first argue with you or make you pay extra for an incorrect order! I was so ecstatic that she asked. I would highly recommend this food establishment."}
{"text":"Now lets just say that I have most of the café Rio recipes and I am very well versed in the way the food is prepared from beginning to end. However, Wahoo's was a real treat, Their food really captures the essence of Mexican seafood without all of the extra steps, its simple yet delicious. The only reason for the 4 stars is The food took a little longer then I expected and there was only one server working."}
{"text":"The power chopped salad with shrimp, cajun beans and brown rice.  Don't forget the Green dressing (on the side).  Perfect, healthy, hearty, spicy, yummy!!  The chicken tortilla soup is very delicious as well.   I've always had good service at the Boca Park location.  It's clean and certainly fast for fresh made food.  I would recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"Went here on a fundraiser night for my sons school. Big mistake! Food took quite a while to come out and was disappointing. The tacos were not at all what I was expecting. My sons did like their food so that's why the 3 stars. Me, I will get my fish tacos elsewhere."}
{"text":"As an Arizona resident I am truly jealous we do not have this place.. The Island/X game vibe tandem up nicely. Branded as a t shirt & flip flop ambiance, I actually saw a few white collars pop in for an assumed lunch break. Food here is delicious and low priced. I've had fish, shrimp, steak, and chicken in a variety of tacos, bowls, and burritos- all equivocally satisfying. Personal favorite has to be the Scream'N Chicken burrito as I prefer spice.  Highly recommended as a self described foodie. Even exploring franchise opportunities in AZ."}
{"text":"Great service from Scott at the front counter. Awesome food. Light atmosphere."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to come after work on a Friday. Shout out to Bob, Tammy and Jen. Best bartenders ever!  It can get busy on Fridays, yet this team is always positive, professional and friendly. Maui onion rings are to die for. Shrimp bowl is fabulous. Shrimp is never over cooked. Seasoning is always perfectly balanced and true to the southwestern/so cal style and the rice is cooked to just the right tenderness and separation. Want friendly, attentive service and good food at a great price. Come to this wahoos!"}
{"text":"My first time here and asked for recommendations. I was told the two taco combo was the way to go. Got two wild caught Salmon tacos and they were amazing. The Cajun beans were good too. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"I just love this restaurant.  I go so much the staff know exactly how I like my burrito.  They will make it special order just how I like it.  The staff is very good and courteous.  I have all my business lunches there.  The green sauce is to die for."}
{"text":"When I saw an ad that Wahoo's opened here, we had to try it immediately, because I fell in love with the salads over the summer during a trip to La Jolla. And I hear they will be opening another location soon in Boca Park.  The atmosphere at this Wahoo's is even better than the one I remember from California, although it was cold the night we dined there (doors were open). Large restaurant -- respectable list of beers, which I loved. And several truly healthy options on the menu, too. I happen to be addicted to the power chopper salad with spicy white beans and fish. We also ordered a Banzai Bowl. Check out the happy hour from 3 to 7. This place also has extensive options for vegetarians. And their beverage options are fantastic. I'm not a soda person so usually do water or beer with my salad at Wahoo's, but here, they have three kinds of iced tea - mango, tropical green, and plain. Sodas and sobe lean beverages. (Definitely buy the large cup so you can get 75 cent refills on your return trip)  They were SUPER accommodating to my special requests (brown rice on the side, dressing on the side)"}
{"text":"Great food and service by owner Shelly and her crew! Clean and oh so tasty. Just like being home in Costa Mesa!!"}
{"text":"I used to love it here when we moved to the area 2 years ago. But recently something has changed. Our last few visits, we haven't been super happy with the service or the food. So tonight I begged my husband to go and told him I'm sure it would be different and they'd be as good as they used to be! But I was way wrong! It was a bad experience from the get go. The staff had less personality than a wet rag, the ice tea dispenser was empty and when we got home with our order (I had ordered the salmon bowl) there was no slaw on my salmon. So it was just rice and salmon. My fault for not checking before we left but still... Also the salmon and rice was like eating a salt lick! I've never had anything like it before! So needles to say my husband got to say I told you so and I was disappointed. We won't be going back."}
{"text":"Most of the time I get great service some of the times I do not ... the bar menu is great and I like the three tacos with a beer .... it's always freezing in there but if you communicate with your bartender usually they help you out ... they can change the order to exactly how you want it which is great because my husband is really picky!"}
{"text":"Doesn't even deserve a star the lady takin our order kept cutting off my girlfriend when she was asking questions she also failed to ask if we have ever been there before I took two bites of my food and it was disgusting plus they have lousy customer service and nobody wore nametags they didn't check up on us during our meal or asked if we enjoyed the food"}
{"text":"Ordered Wahoo's through Grub hub and was highly disappointed with the quality of the order. It is definitely not the same quality as the Wahoo's in Oahu, Hawaii. Not even close. Too bad"}
{"text":"Worst Mexican I have ever had. We had burrittos and they were cold: inside and out. We waited a long time for cold food that has no flavor. We will not be going back.
Don't waste your time or money."}
{"text":"I previously craved this place and was a very very frequent customer.  The service went steadily downhill....and the last time I dined there I was very sick for 2 days.  I even tried to call the manager who did not seem at all interested in hearing about our experience.   Sadly I am not going back."}
{"text":"Wahoo. Yummy. Would love to sit at the bar as the view is amazing.  Apparently they have happy hour too. Wahoo to clean eating."}
{"text":"My husband and I have gotten wahoo to go as a healthier choice than fast food.  We will never do it again.  They obviously use the food that should have been thrown out on to go orders.  Guess you aren't there to complain so you don't matter.  Food is garbage!"}
{"text":"Love the food and coronaritas but I HATE the outside service. Christy is the absolute worst server. She never comes outside to check so you have to go up to the bar and ask repeatedly for service. Even if you ask for a separate tab, it does not always happen so be prepared. Other than that, it is a really fun place that is worth coming to. Sitting outside is also nice but I would highly recommend to that they find a new server or up their staff especially on weekends."}
{"text":"I love these place, cool bar (outside area) and good fish tacos. The employees are very sweet and the place is kept clean. It seems to be the new hang out instead of Kona Grill and a lot better priced. Try the Maui onion rings."}
{"text":"Solid 4.5 since giving a 5 is for above and beyond.

- Absolutely great fish entree options!!!           
                                                                              
- Prices reflect good portions sizes.                                    
                                                                               
- Friday burrito deal...came with Monster drink!!!                                                                     
                                                                              
Cons:

- I ordered no beans, but they promptly fixed after I discovered it from my first bite.  Would have been nice if they comp the meal, but no big deal...I am not one of those...

- Parking can be scarce due to surrounding businesses in the complex.

{"text":"Good tacos, love the brown rice option.  Nice place for a cold beer - the wait staff, Tre was especially welcoming and friendly - greeted us at the door.  For that type of customer service we'll be back!"}
{"text":"It was our first time here, since this location just opened. We loved the carnitas. The Wahoo salad with carnitas and and the carnitas taco were both really good. We went primarily for the fish tacos, and they were just ok. The two biggest issues that we had that warranted only two stars is first, they charge for their salsa! What? You have to tell them what salsas you want when ordering and they charge for them!  Really?! How do you serve Mexican food and CHARGE for salsa!?!? That seemed Crazy to us! The second issue was minor but annoying, we ordered a kids meal and the cup they gave us for the kids meal didn't have a lid to fit it! The adult cups had lids! Needless to say, we had a couple spills...and you have to ask for napkins, ugh!"}
{"text":"Wahoo's has kind employees that are very cool kinda like a relaxed beach eating atmosphere food is on the ball and price is just rite. 
Good job wahoo!!

{"text":"YES! I been going to Wahoos in SO CAL for over 15 years. When I moved to Vegas I really started missing Wahoos. NO MORE! Wahoos is in Vegas as of Oct 2011. The food is just as great as SO CAL. Service is excellent. Go see Nikki in the bar. Very friendly.  But what is better about  the Vegas location is a 24/7 full menu and bar.  That's right...coming in on a red-eye to Vegas? Hop on over to Wahoos at 3:00am for a fix. About 15 min drive from the Airport.  215W @ Rainbow. Just North of  215 @ Sunset. I'm coming back tomorrow...LOL"}
{"text":"I always get the shrimp enchiladas. My wife loves the tofu bowl. Food is served promptly & is always piping hot. Always get the brown rice & Cajun beans. Never disappointed."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat.  The food is very good and the staff members are great.  Over the years I've been eating here I have never had a single negative experience.  The manager, Suly, is super nice and very professional and it's obvious she has influenced her team with her philosophy on customer service.  I highly recommend it for casual, relaxed dining."}
{"text":"The worst service, rhe rude cashier should have been sent to retraining, never will return to such abuse.    Waited for over 45 minutes for food to arrive. When we wanted names od people in charge, Cory claimed she was stupid and  nobody was her boss."}
{"text":"Love this place good food, fair prices, generous portions, great location"}
{"text":"Just tried this place for the first time today. We eat a lot of tacos and theirs we're very good. The food tasted fresh, and the flavors were right where they needed to be to make our meal merely perfect! And the staff was so friendly and attentive to our needs, even though it should be basic in food service. With that said... we DEFINITELY will be back for more! Good job Wahoos!"}
{"text":"First time going to this place and I am extremely pleased I went.  I made a mistake with my order and Rosie went above and beyond to help me.  She really made my girlfriends night and saved me :)  Thank you Rosie!"}
{"text":"I gave this place a thumbs down and it deserves a thumbs down.  I think I would understand better what I was getting if I went back.  We went on a Wednesday night.  The place had some people but not busy.  You order from a line, not waitress service, which is fine.  The girl who took our order was not friendly and even though she could tell it was our first visit, didn't help us in any way (there are lots of ordering options here).  She got two of the 4 orders wrong.  It took over 20 minutes for us to get our food which is ridiculous considering it was nothing more than taking prepared meats and putting them in a tortilla.  They completely lost the order of the guy who ordered in front of me.  The girl who took our order and then left the order station and began running food, all the time chatting on her cellphone.  When we finally got our food, the tortillas were very tough as though they had been sitting out all day.  The fillings (meats) were pretty good.  This place has tons of potential but lacks in leadership and caring about the product they deliver.  It looks like a decent place to sit and drink though.  Nice outdoor seating."}
{"text":"I've eaten here before and it's always been ok, but my last experience was not good. 

The girl taking my order took 5 minutes to figure out how to put the order in. I asked for no onions so the girl said she would go back to the kitchen and give them a heads up in case the ticket was confusing. When I got my order the chefs had not looked at the receipt because the order had onions. 

The girl taking the order also put the sides in wrong - something I missed until I got home. 

Wahoos isn't cheap fast food, it's moderately priced - so I expect them to not mess up the order. They messed up twice. 

Probably won't go back."}
{"text":"The mini tostadas are amazing and my be loves the chicken wings!! The few times we've been there Nikas been our bartender and she's hilarious.  She was very helpful and super attentive even before we knew what we needed.  We'll definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Really strange atmosphere for a place that serves mexican food, lots of surfer and skater type of decorations in there. The food came out very quickly which was nice.

I got the 3 minute burrito with cajun chicken smothered in green sauce. The chicken was very good, it was at least a whole breast of chicken cut up into big squares. The problem was the green sauce. It was some sort of cilantro cream sauce which would have been good if they hadn't of used 5 lbs of cilantro to make it. It was very overpowering and had that odd taste you get when you put way too much cilantro in something. The person I was with loves cilantro and it was even too much for her to handle.

The chips were decent and the guacamole was good. The green sauce just threw me for a loop because I expected a green chili sauce or a tomatillo sauce and then got this weird cilantro packed cream sauce. I think it would have tasted good if they could cut way back on the amount of cilantro they are putting in there."}
{"text":"Great for watching sports. The bar is small, but very welcoming and comfortable. It's awesome to have late night healthy quick service food option open 24/7! There's slots and smoking allowed in the bar where the food will be brought to you. For just sitting in the restaurant, you walk up to the counter to order. Highly recommend brunch. Yummy breakfast items and a carafe of mimosas is $12."}
{"text":"Cheap. Delicious. Cali-Mexican. There Cajun chicken is to die for. This is always a fun spot that a bunch of friends end up at after hanging out at the bars in the area. The staff here seem really cleanly and friendly. They have a discount for all bar, casino and restaurant employees with valid proof from 9pm-8am!!! Love the locals discount portion."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a quick & light lunch. This is the place. The black beans are a little bland, but nonetheless great place overall."}
{"text":"U should call this place Robertos. and that would be an insult to mr. roberto himself. i had the fish tacos of course and wow were they plain. just think of middle school lunch fish in a bland torilla. flavorless. u would think with a name \"wahoo's fish tacos\" their tacos would be good. this is really a bar. the bar is good and it has gaming so go here to drink and gamble not eat."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Best fish tacos that remind me of Cabo.  Friendly staff are a lot of fun.  It has an open air patio with a fire pit.  The place is really clean and a lot of families come in to eat.  If you like Mexican food, this is it!  They also have great bar food and 24 hour breakfast.  It's the place to watch a game and the staff will change the channel on any of their 10 huge flat screens."}
{"text":"It was amazing! I haven't been there in some time, but I have eaten there several times before and loved the food, the setup, and the staff."}
{"text":"Tammy was amazing! Above and beyond the call of duty type service! She talked me into trying new stuff that I really liked!  Thank you very much for your service!"}
{"text":"Everything is always great service, food, and atmosphere. My only complaint is I came back from vacation and my bartender Matt is not longer here. I won't be back as often now that he is gone."}
{"text":"My colleagues and I had a working lunch Thursday, June 3rd at 12:30pm at the Wahoos on Horizon Ridge and the service was terrible.  One colleague got the wrong order. Another colleague waited 40 minutes for her chicken enchilada, while other tables that came in after us were served that dish. The employees were unhelpful. We were told they were waiting 5 minutes for fresh chicken then when asked again they said it would be another 8 minutes. My colleague ended up asking for a refund and left because she never got her food. She was offered no apology and the stafff was apathetic. Needless to say, I would not return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"The place smelled like cleaning solvent when we arrived (not necessarily what you want to smell when you go into a restaurant); however, the place was dirty. Our table had crumbs when we sat down. The seat was not wiped down. My food was served in a dirty dish, food stuck to the bottom of the bowl. The bathroom toilet cover was off and no paper towels. This is the second time I have tried this restaurant. A big disappointment both times. I will not go back."}
{"text":"I love me some Wahoos but this specific one is weak.  Took over old poker bar so no windows in the joint which kinda defies Wahoos principles in general and feels too much like a bunker.  Food is Wahoo's so you know it's good but service struggles if your not a regular.  If it is crowded your screwed.  Staff a minimal crew.  Much better vibe in Sumnerlin and new Henderson one has amazing views of Vegas."}
{"text":"We really love fish tacos, and thought this would be a good place to try.  We were wrong.  The rice was old and crunchy, they didn't have the shrimp that was on the menu, the fish was way overcooked and bland, and the beans were inedible.  Perhaps we got them on the wrong decade.  We are very particular about our food and will never be back to this place.  I cannot understand the better reviews on this place."}
{"text":"Fish tacos were lackluster at best... 
Baja Rolls were eh.."}
{"text":"So I've been a big fan of Wahoo's from the beginning... But they've recently have gone downhill in service. They completely messed up my order and overcharged me.  After asking numerous times for them to switch the channel to the game (in which they agreed to multiple times that they would), they simply kept putting it off, despite us being the only customers in the room on a Saturday afternoon. The channel never got changed despite being there over an hour. This place has fallen big time from when it first opened. I was so excited for it to move closer to me, but now I don't know if we're going to ever go back."}
{"text":"This place reminds me so much of places I would find down in Redondo Beach CA. Its a kitchy cool surfer/beach lifestyle atmosphere along with a great selection of food at reasonable prices. 

What impressed me the most was the huge choice of fillings for their burritos, tacos and such.  Also if you are looking for healthier fare, there are several choices on the menu that will not bust your diet. I have been there twice and both times it has been pleasant, with my food arriving fairly quickly.

 In addition, they have a great selection of Ice Tea to drink and provide huge water cups when you don't want to order a drink."}
{"text":"I have been here several times, and always get the same thing.  The Outer Reef Burrito with carne asada.  In past visits, the burrito always had a good serving of meat.  In my most recent visit a couple days ago I ordered the same thing.  This time I got a tortilla filled with rice and only a few scraps of meat.  I ate it anyway, after scooping out about half the rice so I could taste what little meat there was.  After I was finished, the manager, (female unknown name) came to pick up out plates.  I politely let her know that the burrito didn't have much meat in it so maybe she could mention it to the cook.  I wasn't asking for anything free.  I was even trying to tell her how much I enjoyed the burrito in the past.  But before I could even finish my sentence, she sternly replied that there is nothing she could do about it because I had already eaten the burrito (even though there was still a third of the tortilla filled with a cup of rice on my plate).  She didn't offer an apology or even feign that she cared.  Hopefully this was just a one time screw up and maybe manager was having a bad day.  I will try again in the future, just hope the Carne Asada burrito actually has some carne asada in it."}
{"text":"Love Wahoo's! Price for my meal was cheap, food was yummy, and portions are big! The decor is cool too. Reminds me of the beach. Vegetarian and gluten free options. Must try the green enchiladas."}
{"text":"Best place in Vegas for Mexican and amazing fish tacos! Cheap but healthy and good quality ingredients! Fri night Wahoo's kick!!!"}
{"text":"Pretty good food and fresh. People are super friendly. Decent prices also."}
{"text":"Food is excellent with a lot of good flavors & service is friendly. The bartender, Shannon, was so fun & made some excellent food recommendations. Their new Kale salad is amazing! For the price, you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"I was looking for something on the line of healthy and decided to give it a try.  I was greeted with smiles on the other side of the counter (simple but important). I ordered my meal to go and ordered 2 Cajun tacos with brown rice and black beans-with the green sauce on the side.  After I paid (it was around $8) the lady gave me my reciept and walked away. Doootadooo.... I stood there wondering if I should wait or should I find a seat???  Hm I made my way to a table to wait for my food.  While I waited I was checking out the great beachy decor.  The patio looks so amazing.  I will definitely be back for that.  Sent me right back to the laid back outdoor beach bars in California. Sigh. 

My food was brought to me and I was on my way.  The cashier yelled \"have a great day\" and that made up for leaving me in limbo afew mins ago. When I got back to the office it was on!  The tacos were great.  I couldnt tell if the tacos were spicy of the green sauce I was pouring on it was.  Love spicay!  I did notice that one taco had cheese and one didnt.  Not quite sure why or how that happened but either way they were pretty good.  BTW green sauce is fat free a huge plus. ;)  The rice and beans I had a little of but the tacos pretty much filled me up.

So yes the atmosphere is cute, laid back and fun.  I definitely will be back to get my drink on - ON the patio this time and for sure will be doing the quicky lunch on my lunch break.  Nice guilt free lunch...just what I was looking for.  Success! =)"}
{"text":"We were visiting my Mother-in-Law in Henderson and decided to come here after reading rave reviews.  We were not disappointed.  The flavors in their food are incredible. I had the Paleo Bowl and every bite was scrumptious.  The employees are all very friendly and efficient and the environment is fun  and casual.

My only regret is that we don't have a Wahoo where we live."}
{"text":"Great place to eat, fun atmosphere and the food is yummy! Portions are also pretty big.  The view of the city is spectacular and there is a patio so you can eat outside when the weather is nice!"}
{"text":"Horrible food. mediocre bar tenders.. great place to go if you're 19 and have a fake ID this bar is full of  \"Bros\" and college kids"}
{"text":"Victor has great customer service!! Tacos, salsa, absolut mule... Salmon taco came out to be my favorite! Will definitely come back to try other great options!!"}
{"text":"I first discovered Wahoos in while doing business in SoCal and I fell in love with the amazing food and drinks at a great price.

When I found out they built this location down the street from me, I thought \"Cool! But will it be the same? Especially being so far inland...\"

I can tell you that this place has gone above and beyond anything that the SoCal locations have going.  The food is still great and cheap! $2.50 for a taco?  WTF are you kidding me?!  Pacificos $2?! So stoked!

Great food combined with a great staff led by bartender James \"Big Poppa\" is the recipe for a great overall experience!  I've made this place my home away from home.  I'm here almost 5 times a week, it's like having my own version of Cheers in my backyard... I sit down next to Norm, and Sam Malone already has my beer poured and my food on the way.  Couldn't ask for more.

If you've never been to a Wahoos start with a Cajun Fish taco and go from there, everything is good!

Sunday Brunch is also a great deal.  $6 gets you Carnitas with Eggs and all you can drink mamosas for an hour....  Sunday Funday! Give it a go if you can get up before 11:00am.

Thanks Wahoo's crew for making my neighborhood a better place!"}
{"text":"The food here is 3 stars, but the service is one star. I met a friend for dinner at 5pm on a Friday. The bar was full, but the dining area only had two other people sitting in it and they already had their food. The waitress kept walking from the cash register to the kitchen every 3-4 minutes.  She never once stopped to ask for our drink/food orders. And she never even acknowledged us or said hi. After waiting for 15 minutes, we walked to the cash register to ask her when she would be able to take our order. She told us that their policy was for the customer to order at the cash register, and if we wanted another drink or anything else we would have to get up and walk back to the cash register. My friend and I have eaten here several times, an every time there was waiting staff. We ordered a drink, walked back to our table to look at the menu, and sat down. The waitress again walked right by us to go to the kitchen. Each trip to and from the kitchen put her within inches of our table. We walked up to the cash register to order our meal, but a male employee came from the kitchen to speak with the waitress just as we got there. The waitress gave us the finger (not the bad finger, she gave us the hold on finger). The two employees began to whisper and giggle with each other. I turned toy friend, and with our bff esp abilities we mutually agreed to go wait at Grimaldi's for 30 minutes for an open table. We paid four our drinks and left. I don't think my friend or I will be back at this Wahios ever again."}
{"text":"Talk about shitty service. They would have to get better to be consider bad. Talking to the bartender was like talking to a brick wall, it won't talk back and it doesn't understand. I for sure won't be going back the food was over priced, the service was awful, the atmosphere sucked, and getting a root canal would be more enjoyable. P.S., this really needs a thumbs down button. Save your money and go elsewhere!"}
{"text":"This was my first time there. I was meeting a new group of friends for drinks and enjoying myself even though the a/c was out in the restaurant.  I could deal with that because we had an awesome waitress, Lori. The bar \"Manager\"...an old cranky guy, kept giving me dirty looks because I guess I was blocking the walk way of some servers with where my seat was. He complained to Lori and I gladly moved. I was disturbed by his looks but I let it go but I am very perceptive. About 20 minutes later, all power goes out. We try and pay our tabs with our debit cards since none of us have cash and the machine isn't working. He (mean old bar manager) then says get money out of the ATM there. It of course isn't working. We ask if he would comp our $9 tab and our other friend had $30 cash on a $48 tab. The manager then grabbed the checks crumpled them in his hands and said \"yes fine! Whatever!\" I will never go back to this place. If you don't like your job....find another. Lori was great though. I have no idea about the food...so you are on your own there but service is much more important to me."}
{"text":"I had the Banzai Veggie Bowl with brown rice, chicken and Cajun white beans. 
Every bite  is so delicious, I topped it off with their awesome chips, guacamole dip and hot salsa. 
I'll eat this dish again and try it with fish next time! 
I recommend it with the chicken it was very tasty!"}
{"text":"Awful, Awful, Awful!!! Food was horrible, service was worse. Don't dare ask for milk which is on the menu as they don't know why it's on there because they don't have it. Over cooked meat and a  blue haired waitress with a nasty attitude. Management got involved and offered refund, only problem nobody knew how to issue a credit. This place is a joke!!!!!"}
{"text":"Been completely my for years! Love this place! Good food, service, and it's 24/7. Get the banzai veggies added to your food. Throw some money in the slots."}
{"text":"Had a bad experience but they were very professional and sent me a gift card tryed it again and all was great, good food and great service thank you"}
{"text":"Great food! Love their cajun fish tacos with their citrus slaw along with the cajun beans. Very nice staff as well!"}
{"text":"Went here with my wife recently and I will never return! Let me say that the fish tacos were great! The reason for my 1 star review is because of the bar!
The day we went it was around 110 outside and when I order our food I try to order 2 blended Margaritas and the guy at the restaurant counter said that they weren't on his pos menu but I could go to the bar and order directly. A little annoying but no biggie,here's where it all goes wrong.......
I walk into the bar which is separated from the restaurant by glass as people can smoke at the bar which is ok with me. The problem is when I try to order blended margaritas, the female bartender says to me \"We aren't that kind of bar! We don't use blenders!\"  Well I've been bartending for 20 years and if a restaurant that features fish tacos with a full bar doesn't make blended drinks it means either 1 The bartenders are lazy or 2 the owner is lazy!
It takes maybe an extra 20 seconds to make any blended drink! In the desert in summer time at a beach themed fish place,you sure as hell oughta be able to get a freakin blended drink!
Get it together!"}
{"text":"Tacos are AMAZING!!! Service is 5 star! Very friendly staff. Could eat here every day. Our server Jamie was great."}
{"text":"I work in the service industry and this is the perfect late night spot to pick up some food and drink after work. Open 24/7 with full kitchen menu all night.

The bartender, Rob, is super attentive and makes sure you're taken care of."}
{"text":"We went here for an early dinner on a Thursday. Thought we try it out since it's only minutes from our house. The menu was alright, the prices on the food are reasonable. We ordered the shrimp bowl with brown rice with beans & two shrimp tacos with rice and beans as well. We sat down a table with booth seating, and noticed that no one had cleaned off the table. As for the drinks, we had ice water, ordered Corona and the skinny long island ice tea from a waitress who had walked by. When I was about to drink the long island, I noticed a big chip on the inside of my glass. So I waited until another staff member came by and I told her about the glass, she took it from me and returned with a new clean glass & drink. The food was okay in flavor, it wasn't delicious. I don't think we're going to come back...only because a few minutes after we ate, both our stomachs were acting up...it's a sign that the food was not as fresh as it looks. :(
The good thing about Wahoo's - the staff members are very friendly and the atmosphere reminds me of Hawaii & Cali."}
{"text":"Shannon is awesome, very attentive to her customers and makes the best drinks."}
{"text":"Not my style.  Maybe others find this food appealing, I found it had bland appearance and flavors, and very little for the cost.  

I ordered Teriyaki Steak and Rice, passed on the beans, because the combo wasn't appealing.  Meat tasted like it had flowers on it, not sure if it was Jasmine Rice?  Either way very weird. 

Hubby ordered a smothered burrito, left him hungry.  

Place was clean but pretty empty for a Saturday night, there is a bar maybe with casino?  Not sure. Which is blocked off so you won't be exposed to smoking."}
{"text":"I love Wahoos! I agree with some others folks that this Vegas location does not make as good fish tacos as the California franchise. But I love Wahoos so much I don't even care. I went to a hi-end mexican place recently and ALL I can think of is I want to be in Wahoos. Their food is cheaper and their Lees Chili Sauce is one of the best chili sauce in the world! I can eat anything with that sauce. The servers always remember us and will bring extra when we visit. We always get great service at Wahoos, Vegas or Cali.
So I keep going back for more... I gave it 4 stars because sometimes their rice is a bit dry."}
{"text":"The best fish tacos with a fusion of Brazilian and asian flavors.  A costa mesa original right here in vegas!  Lucky lucky vegas.  Hope to see one in AZ soon."}
{"text":"We love Wahoo's!  Great food and service, and awesome catering, as well!!  Healthy and fast, you can't beat it."}
{"text":"First impressions are great in their first hour of business. Super cool, totally radical atmosphere, dude. 
Very Pacific Beach style motif. Walls adorned with surf and skate gear photos and lamps. Lots of surf gear sponsorship hung around in here.
Ordered a spicy and mild fish taco and both were equally flavorful and delicious. Brown rice was done right and their Cajun beans were not bad at all. Of course everything was kicked up a notch when I squeezed my lime wedge on everything. Everything came as expected and enjoyed my meal in the outdoor seating area.
Look forward to come back in the near future and patronize their full service bar. Thanks Wahoo for the opening day schwag!"}
{"text":"Great carne asada burrito with guac and sour cream. My friend said \"wow, small taco\" but, after eating it said it tasted great. First time there, but will definitely return."}
{"text":"Awesome!! It was our first time here and we loved the atmosphere. Jesse was great, telling us about the menu and helping us find alternatives for diabetics. We had the Wahoo bowl with black beans, salad, and Cajun fish. The food was delicious. Thank you Jesse for making our experience great."}
{"text":"We love Wahoos, this is the only thing we miss when we moved from California. So when I found out there are 2 locations in Vegas I was overjoyed! We ordered our favorite No. 2, the food was late, but the staff came out and apologized with an offer of chips and salsa. I would say this place (Rampart location) tasted just like the other chains in California. Now I have no regrets moving out of Cali."}
{"text":"I played fifty dollars into machine, my girl with me played twenty.  We each had three drinks.  We both ordered food.  When I got the bill we where charged for multiple drinks along with food.  What has happened to this town when you play and eat and do not get taken care of with drinks?  I don't get it.  So I won't go back.  Food was just ok.  Whahoo fries where bad, banzai bowl was good.  Bartender was obviously stoned.  No attention span.  So disappointed paying for drinks, will not go back."}
{"text":"The food is amazing and the staff is very nice! I love going here because I know I'll be taken care of. I love the fish tacos with white rice and black beans. Its so delicious! I would recommend this to all my friends and family! I don't feel like it is to expensive, especially for how much food you get."}
{"text":"This place was very mediocre, I ate here Friday afternoon with my mother and first of all NO ONE greeted us for 7 mins we had to wave some chick down in the back I believe her name was tiara, We placed our or orders and sat down, we asked for chips and salsa but the salsa tasted exactly like the pizza sauce from the lunch-able meals, the salsa was absolutely disgusting! A woman named April who ran the food over was so unpleasant, I asked her for a different salsa then she said \"we only have pico\" with an attitude, hmm last time i checked Pico de gallo is not salsa! But whatever, so the food is suppose to be famous for their fish tacos? Okay the fish was absolutely delicious ; however the slaw on the taco was bland, the rice and beans  were bland. For this place to be famous because of there fish tacos is sad because ive had better at Del Taco and the girls they have working in the front belong in a fast food restaurant as well because they have no idea what customer service is ! I ordered a drink right before I left and the girl April hears me does not respond at all for a good 60 seconds as she is continuing to do her side work and then she finally asked me \"okay what drink did u want\" I will never im my life eat here or recommend this place to anyone ! Not to mention that awful Cigarette smell coming in from the outside deck . Awful, I really hope this place reevaluates their operation! Now I understand why there was barley anyone inside!"}
{"text":"To say I was disappointed would be an understatment. I planned a pub crawl for my husband's birthday,with one our stops being wahoo's. I went to all our stops that morning informing management that we would be coming through and around which time. All places seemed happy and accomidating as best they could. Manger of Wahoo's told me to call over when we were on our way. When I called (9:30pm) the hostess said management went home?!?! Quite confused I asked to speak to who was in charge. A bartender got on the phone. I told her I spoke to a manager earlier and we were on our way 20-25ppl. (not very interested)She said ok and hung up. Upon arriving the area in which I discussed with management that morning was not ready. The restuarant area was closed off? We had a friend in a wheel chair and had no access to the patio(you had to walk through the bar and between the high tops and bar.It was too narrow). So unfortunately we could not sit out there. We had to pull our own tables together. No one came to great us or offered to help. We all stood at the end of the bar together and waited for a bartender. The bar was not that packed and had two on staff at the time. One bartender finally came to help. In stead of staying there and getting through all our orders, she would take an order, leave help some other people and come back. All the while not letting us know she would be back. The other bartender stayed on her side of the bar and just chatted with others down there. Rather than help manage the bar. I must say that we had bartenders in our group as well as most of us live with in a 3-5mi radius of Boca Park. We heard no apology, heck we were barely spoken too. After taking over 45minutes for each of us to get a drink we decided to leave. We moved onto 3 ANGRY WIVES. They were ready for us. They kept an extra bartender and server on hand just to be ready for us. Job well done!! I'm sure they made a pretty penny off of our group. Especially since my husband and our friends like top shelf and lots of shots!!! Too Bad for Wahoo's as we will not be back and will be sure to tell everyone we know!!!!"}
{"text":"We walked in and were happy with the menu and set-up.  The girls at the register were nice and friendly.

We ordered the fish tacos, and they were good, UNTIL the last taco was being eaten and there was a HAIR (that was obviously not ours) in the taco, mixed in with the cabbage!  Disgusting!

We brought it to one of the servers attention and his reply was \"Sorry, let me go let Javier know...\" whom we assumed was a manager of some sort.  We waited another 5-10 minutes before the same server came back and the told us that \"the kitchen\" told him they could make him another or something else.  REALLY?!  We told him we did not want anything else.  He then said \"Oh, okay, well, thanks then, you have a good day...\"

I would AT THE VERY LEAST expect a refund, and we weren't even offered that.  I don't know if \"Javier\" is the manager, or if the manager was ever even notified of the situation.  All I know, is aside from the girls working the register, they do not know how a guest should be treated.  And it's managements fault for not properly training and enforcing appropriate behavior.

I know things happen, but it's how you handle it.  We will NOT be returning, nor will our friends/family.  Shame on you Wahoos."}
{"text":"Great staff and friendly environment but the food was lacking. Fish tacos were old or over cooked, but not bad just not great."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time. Not impressed. Decor is kinda cool, but food is not that great. It's a basic bean and cheese kind of Mexican place. We ordered guac and sour cream as well ( which we paid extra for) and never got it. The kids chair didn't have a working buckle and they gave my kiddo a heavy glass plate. Unfortunately, we won't be going back here."}
{"text":"I'm being kind but my friend likes it, but I just noticed he's downgraded his review to 3 stars himself.  Maybe I went in with my expectations too high.  Bottom line,  the fish was dry (I like rubio's fish tacos better) and it wasn't the friendliest atmosphere.  They have a Fuddrucker's-like system but I didn't know and I didn't get the best deal because the cashier was no help at all.  They have video poker for those into that, and a nice open-air feel with a patio to eat on as well.  Cool, but I'd rather go to Kona or Gordon Biersch in Boca to hang out and be hip..."}
{"text":"I.otdered salmon with white rice and fish was good....

But the riice was so.hard.. taste like its old..

Although I like d ambience.. makes me feel like im in.a beach"}
{"text":"Excellent slaw Fish taco! Yum. Stumbled upon this place after visit to REI. Highly recommend for good, fresh food!"}
{"text":"Wahoooooooooo's!!!!  I love, love, love that they have vegetarian everything---veggie taco's, burritos, enchiladas AND options:  Tofu, bonzai veggies, or mushrooms to base whichever delight you desire.  YAY!!
Also, the bar staff always greets us with smiles, stories, and more than happy to handle all of my questions and special requests.  LOVE it!
One thing I would change; they don't have any super-hot sauce."}
{"text":"Make sure to come hangout on the late shift Chris he's a cool bartender always nice and helpful like to come get some good food and drink"}
{"text":"What a great surprise! Random spot to meet for lunch and had the best experience. From the super friendly and helpful staff at the front to the amazing food, I couldn't be happier. The fish tacos were fresh and overflowing w fish. And because it was taco Tuesday they offered me a free chicken taco that blew me away. I will certainly be back."}
{"text":"This restaurant would get a higher rating if it weren't for one word: cilantro.

If you don't like cilantro, don't go to Wahoo's. While they make a tasty fish taco (and fish burrito), all of their dishes are swimming in the soapy herb. That's not really a problem for me, but my husband HATES cilantro, and it overpowered each bite of his burrito.

The staff was friendly, the prices were reasonable, and the atmosphere was laid back. And I like the fact that you have the option of white rice or brown, and white beans or black. But it's unfortunate that you don't really have the option of \"no cilantro,\" because it is everywhere!"}
{"text":"First impressions are everything...and ours was not favorable. Menu board in the entrance was odd and confusing.  Person who finally helped  us figure it out was a welcome sight.  Food arrived relatively quickly, but was barely warm.  Best item was the black beans.  Floors were sticky, and two out of the three women's bathroom stalls were out of order (not good at 5 pm on a Friday evening).  We are not likely to return anytime soon."}
{"text":"It's just ok, a little pricey for self serve, tacos were tasty, service so,so, may go back may not, it's not memorable"}
{"text":"Just ate here, Vegan options, and daytime bartender Shannon rocked!!!  I'll be back!  They have an ingredient list by front cash register.  Cool surfy atmosphere.  And, the food was inexpensive, Dishes were bigger than I thought."}
{"text":"Went to lunch here and it was quick and easy. Good food and one of the staff came and asked how we were doing and gave us some extra sauce. Towards the end someone came by and picked up our plates. Spent $8 including tip"}
{"text":"Based only on the food:

Not great. Weird tiny tacos. Meats seem like they are precooked and delivered frozen by a distributor, warmed and served. Salsa from a jar: boring. No gual, no sour cream, no pico.

Rice and beans were on offer, but weren't the fluffy nice rice and rich beans that you're willing to break your daily carb limits for. Presentation was enough for me to pass.

Chips were good. Fresh.
The plates, utensils, and napkins were generous."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to going to Wahoos since it has opened. The parking lot is always full and it looks like a hip place. I was really disappointed.

I ordered a chicken tortilla soup which tasted like a can of Campbell's vegetable soup with tortillas added on top. It had large chunks of chicken that did not taste that great. We also ordered chips and salsa. Chips were stale! I ordered 2 taco plate with white rice and white beans. The rice and beans were not bad. I got a fish taco and a carnitas taco. I was expecting great fish tacos from Wahoos but that was not the case. The carnitas tacos was better but I would prefer Rubios, Chipotle, or Cafe Rio. The food at these places is 10 times better. My wife ordered black beans with her tacos she said they were not cooked all the way and were a bit hard.

We definitely will not be going back."}
{"text":"Great food BIG portions. Friendly staff..FISH TACOS !! Black beans and brown rice are delicious"}
{"text":"We have lived in this area gor many years now. This is the first time we have eaten here. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I like this place a lot. It's extremely reasonably priced and all of the ingredients taste healthy and fresh. It's almost a fast food price but with proper restaurant type food. The atmosphere is also enjoyable. I like the interior design of the place very surfer type vibe. I also like the bar there as well. Great price for great food"}
{"text":"Don't bother. Food is bland. Service is eh. I ordered 4 enchiladas, they came on four separate plates which was a little awkward. If you get stuck there, go with the shrimp or Cajun fish."}
{"text":"Have you tried Wahoo's yet?  \"Nope, I use Google.\"
Funny name for a Mexican restaurant that doesn't want to be a Mexican restaurant. The building looks more like an Irish pub to me, and I understand that since they took an existing building to open the restaurant but what I don't understand is the decor. Is all about surfing and skate boarding and biking and all the kinds of clothing that goes with it like vans and Oakley and volkom etc. etc. I felt like I was at the mall food court. The food was decent, and prices are great. I really liked the enchiladas with beans and rice. the service was also very good and friendly. Didn't go to the bar area but they have a full bar service.
Would I come back?  probably yes....... Next time I go surfing."}
{"text":"Being from Southern California and a huge fan of the fish taco I was stoked to find a Wahoos in Sin City.  Dropped in earlier, grabbed a couple tacos and a beer. Service was awesome, the young lady that served me Taylor I think was her name was. She was on point. Great attitude and Epic service. food just as good as home and they even have a full service bar that you can play video poker and do shots if you want.  Only in Vegas.  I'll definitely be returning.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Best of Las Vegas 2017!!! Fantastic food and service. Do you self a favor and stop by."}
{"text":"Update after visit 2!
Much much better!  Service was great.  Food was perfect.

Glad to see the old Wahoo's reputation is back."}
{"text":"I can't speak about the food, only the bar.  We had a blast here! The patrons and staff were friendly and the layout of the place makes for easy conversation.  It can get a little crammed if a crowd shows up, but nothing unbearable."}
{"text":"Heaven forbid you don't smoke and would like to enjoy your food in the bar area and have a beer. For a California chain, the experience is nothing like \"non smoking California\". That being said, this is my second visit to this location and millionth time at a Wahoos. I did go into the bar to get a beer and take it back to my table, but when I got it back into the \"smoke free room\", I noticed after my first taste that the mug was completely cracked at the top. I asked for a bar manager so i didn't have to go back into the smoke and he brought me another beer with an explanation of how the temperature variation from the dishwasher to the freezer can crack a mug. Thanks Mr. Science. (Next beer is on us maybe? PLEEEZE not even an attempt at an offer).   After my food came with my chips and thimble sized salsa, I asked for another salsa so I could finish my chips. (I had tacos too) the girl left, came back and said. \"Oh, salsa is 0.38.\" Really?? 38 cents?? I had such high hopes for this location. Even after I am done eating today I am suppose to order something to bring home to my son. I am honestly going to drive in the complete opposite direction and go to Faustos and get him something. I honestly don't think that this Wahoos will ever get another dime, or 38 cents out of me."}
{"text":"Took the family and sat on the patio. Food was all great, and plentiful,  no complaints.  Staff was friendly and helpful. Good, inexpensive night out. Will be back."}
{"text":"Awesome fish tacos. Not breaded. They have really good black beans plus the option of brown rice. Also they have a bar with an excellent view of Vegas."}
{"text":"I was surprised when I checked out Yelp for a place to eat and saw this Wahoo's Fish Taco.  I'm used to seeing them in San Diego and LA by the beach.  Well, I decided to check it out.  After reading the huge mix of reviews on here, I had a feeling it was going to be a hit of miss.  First off, the residents in the area are not Wahoo's type of surfers and skateboarders customers, but people who are retired.  It was just kinda weird sitting there listening to punk rock with a lot of gray hair around me who have no idea what band is playing.  So aside from that, to the food, it took almost 20 minutes for my burrito! Seriously unacceptable for one item with only two other tables dining.  It came out nice and hot.  As for the spicy fish, I wish I would of got another protein, as it had a \"fishy\" taste to it I didn't like, but the vegetables and the rest of the burrito were good.  There was only 1 cashier / waitress working, so after I finished my beer while waiting for my food, I had to go back to cashier to order another one.  It was Wahoo's, but not really what I would expect from a Wahoo's I have been to in CA.  Wasn't really feeling it, after I eat Wahoo's I want to see the ocean, listen to waves crashing, see people riding bikes around, etc.  3 stars for a overall, OK."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place four stars because usually it's good.  Tonight it wasn't so great. We came in,  the place was empty,  the person at the counter didn't greet us, she just stood there staring at the mat on the counter that displayed some food and messed with it.

 After a few minutes we asked if we could order,  she mumbled something. I asked which was better,  carne asada or carnitas, she said they were both good. I asked which was better,  Jessica was tight lipped, and refused to voice a preference.

I wanted to go to Hussongs. My daughter chose this. They have Dos Eqis Amber, which I love.  Joshua was pleasant when delivering the food,  the bartender was quick with my beer, and happy to give me a chilled glass. The food is good. Once we cleanser ourselves of the negativity we experienced while ordering,  all will be fine."}
{"text":"The bartenders at Wahoos are awesome. However the management stinks. They have gone through several managers and have made a lot of changes. They took out golden tee and added slot machines. They said they want the bar to be more gaming so basically screw the locals who drink a shit load and just want a place to hang out. They are also taking out the caseda seating on the patio. I guess it's time to go to another bar. Too bad because this was a great local place to unwind and enjoy some nice company."}
{"text":"We're here enjoying THE MIST AWSOME AHI SALADS ! This place goes the extra mile with courteous staff and I highly recommend getting off the highway and getting everything on the menu! I'm still eating but I had to write this review to share with the rest of the world ! Go here and come hungry. You will be glad you did !"}
{"text":"Ordered Wahoo Fries and Baja Roll. Yuk. Tasteless food, no flavor at all. And felt like everything was pre-cooked, prepared yesterday and then pulled out for lunch today. Quite horrible. Server was sweet, that was only positive."}
{"text":"Was super impressed with the fish tacos. Same taste and fell as cali. Also the 3 rolled tacos were amazing as well. Service was good, friendly staff and love option of having beer. Didn't like the bar being separated from dinner room. All in all great food, and great healthy choices."}
{"text":"The prices are relatively cheap and affordable, with a decent amount of bang for ur buck. I adore the kids bowls as the portion is just right for an easy snack that'll keep you going for the next couple hours. I've also tried the chicken and carne asada quesadilla (2 separate ones) and both are DELICIOUS! though I like the carne asada one better. They also have option for tofu and being that my gf is vegan and vegetarian makes eating really easy. The tofu bowl is her favorite and is quit delicious. 

Also love the decore makes you feel like your at a taco shop in Cali on the beach somewhere, weird how the place originated from Cali. Haha

I also love the brown rice option. :) Makes me feel a little better about going out to eat all the time... XD In any case, we all left happily ever after! Till next time!"}
{"text":"The food is always good. I have been eating at Wahoos all over for 20 years, but the bartender Breanna is rude. She made me feel very uncomfortable. I got my beer the same time I did my taco. I mentioned I was in a hurry and she didn't seem to care. I will never sit at her bar again. This is why I am giving one star. I will be back for the good and not the service."}
{"text":"I came by Wahoos today with my family for dinner. We were greeted by a friendly and energetic cashier who took the time to answer our questions and help us decide what we would order. Great service, great food!!!"}
{"text":"Shrimp taco was great, great location. Service terrible,  mgr made some terrible comments and they don't understand that the service must match the quality of the food.  Hopefully corporate is looking at these. Atmosphere very casual and they have free refills on all drinks like subway."}
{"text":"This place is one you can avoid and you won't miss anything. The food is edible, but that's it. I have been there a few times now and each time it's the same thing, very basic and very little to no flavor. Today I had the fish Wahoo's Bowl. This only consisted of two pieces of square fish, obviously frozen fish patties made from mush, white rice, and black beans. Zero flavor. On top of that the bar tender kept talking to just one group of people. We asked twice for a menu and never received one, I had to go find one. I gave them three chances, but they struck out, I will never be back."}
{"text":"I had them many moons ago, in Encanitas, on a surf trip. Yummy tacos! It was nice to see them in Vegas. I had a salad and I think I love the tacos more. I think that grilled shrimp platter will be worth trying the next time. The bar looks fun to sit at. I'm not really one to drink at restaurant bars, but I like how it's 'outside' and still inside. You'll have to see it to understand what I mean. Good stuff."}
{"text":"Food was ok, not impressed.... weird to order then have food delivered to table. Is it a fast food joint or a restaurant.  I ordered Carne asada taco (original) it was more like a salad on top of corn tortillas, guacamole was good, salsa was not
 Too many other options to return here"}
{"text":"On a quest for the perfect fish taco I tried Wahoo's tacos.

A really fun atmosphere inside. Really laid back and fun feel to the restaurant! 
The bar area looks really popular and fun! 

The fish tacos are good but nothing special. I anticipated something really over the top from all the hype and reviews. While it was a decent fish taco it wasn't anything to write home about. 
I prefer the fish tacos at Rubios to be honest. Better priced and crispier :) but I think it's just a matter of personal preference. 

Overall a cool place to meet a friend and hang out"}
{"text":"I've never had a bad experience. Most of the poor reviews seem to have to do with the bar. I've only been in the restaurant side. I think the music they play is great. The food is good, and always comes out quickly. It helps that it's right down the street from me. Weekly specials are great!"}
{"text":"Well, I love e the bartender and its unfortunate when you hire young people who don't know the meaning of customer service. But- he was rude and the minute we tried to split out bill--- boy howdy. No one ever taught him how to spit a bill. Sad"}
{"text":"Aweful service by untrained kids    
  
We stopped for a quick meal 45 minutes later still waiting  
And when it finally showed up 2 of the 4 dishes we ordered were wrong .... 
   Used to be a good spot but has gone downhill fast"}
{"text":"I come to this place when I need something cheap and somewhat healthy. LOL. 

It's a win-win situation! 

(Not to mention they have 1.95 pacifica during happy hour at 3pm-7pm) 

I like to order the tacos and I usually get it in the meal which comes with rice (choice of brown or white) and black or brown beans. 

The brown rice is really good and the black beans make a great compliment. 

I love the fish tacos here. The cajun one can get a little dry, so I've stuck to getting the grilled fish tacos. 

I tried the carne asada the other day and I really liked it. Each taco is $2 something."}
{"text":"They have the best fish tacos! They come spicy and mild. They also have Cajun fries that are to die for. This location is open 24/7 too!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome. Jaime took our order and had excellent recommendations. I went with his recommendation and had the Alaskan flounder fish tacos. They came with chips and salsa and a drink. The fish was perfect, melted in my mouth. My wife had the citrus slaw burrito with carne asada and loved it. Stop here!  You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I love Wahoos, they have great chicken tacos!!  Check this place out.  Friendly staff and dining area looks clean."}
{"text":"DAYUM!!!! What can I say?! OMG SO GOOD!!! I'm a SOCAL Mexican food fan... anything other than that isn't Mexican food. Forget TexMex barf! When I moved to Vegas I missed the kind of Mexican food you can find on nearly every corner. Roberto's is no comparison to Wahoo's. my favorite burrito  is a shrimp  burrito. Roberto's makes it with a red sauce  BARF WTF?!?! Wahoo's does it right with a dope white/verde creme sauce. So bomb! The manager/owner also hooked us up with free churro chips and brought water out for our 2 dogs   on the porch. Wahoo's is GOOD AF!!!"}
{"text":"Damn!  I was pretty excited for this place to open in the \"Strip Mall of Death.\"  Being in the area for a number of years, I have seen businesses come an go.  

Took the boy on weekend afternoon. thinking it was not that busy and still had to park behind the mall.  So be it, the lines were not extending out past the door as I had seen in the pervious past couple of days.

I don't know what I was expecting....perhaps, it was something along the lines of a Rubio's but I was wrong.

The menu was tad overwhelming but I settled on a wahoo taco. The boy ordered some sort of steak bowl.  We ordered a Baja Roll (not bad) to start.

I went to the bar to get a beer, stood for about a minute and then returned to my table.

The food arrived and sadly I was not impressed.  Bland would be the word best to describe the taco.  The steak on on boy's bowl tasted microwaved and was also bland.  The best part was the side of beans.

I will say the service was on the up and up.  I must have been visited at least three times while we were eating and asked how the food was.  Sadly, all I could was look up and shrug my shoulders."}
{"text":"First timers, food was great, fish tacos n Baja Ladas. Greeted when we walked in, helped immediately n was asked several times by different workers how our food was. They even came by n removed our plates when empty. A little in the pricy side will visit again but the price will keep us from making it a regular."}
{"text":"I've been eating at Wahoo's since the first one opened up in Costa Mesa, CA. Growing up in Huntington Beach, this is the food of beach people. When I moved away in 1999, I definitely was jonesing for their delish food. Fast forward to living in Henderson and being stoked when Wahoo's opened up here. I was thrilled when the GVR location was to go in but it's been sidelined for some reason. The next closest location is this one at Horizon Ridge and Horizon and I can say every time I've come it's been like a slice of home...the food is awesome and exactly as it is back home and the service is fantastic. I've been a little sad at this gem becoming \"main stream\" and popping up everywhere but at the same time, I now get to eat the food I love. While the \"roots\" of Wahoo's doesn't translate out to the desert, the overall feel is darn close and I'm stoked to now have this great place in adopted home. Kudos to the staff at this location for making sure at every turn my meal and experience was nothing short of perfect."}
{"text":"Stopped in for re-hydration therapy after a recent hike. Got their $2.99 Pacifico beers & sat on the patio in the warm afternoon sun. Decent venue."}
{"text":"Wahoo's is fantastic. I used to frequent the  Costa Mesa and Laguna Beach locations when I lived in Orange County back in the 90s, so when the chain moved here I was elated. The food is just as great as it was then.  The burritos remain my favorites I items. Also the new bajaladas are great. I usually opt for black beans and white rice with extra poco de gallo. $2 Pacificos at happy hour seal the deal. Mmm."}
{"text":"Another chain restaurant that purports to be mexican but is not. The food is also very mediocre."}
{"text":"Fish and shrimp tacos here were out of this world, and the blonde bartender ( I'm forgetting her name at the moment ) was EXCELLENT.. so sweet and pretty and funny! My mom and I enjoy visiting often"}
{"text":"Thought I would try something different and ordered the Son of A Classic Burrito. I am pretty sure it is not supposed to be cold,  but I won't send food back. The results are often worse. This place never ceases to leave me bewildered."}
{"text":"Used to love this place. What happened to the good bartenders?  Sad. Empty now. Only thing left is the view. Not long before it is closed.  It had so much potential."}
{"text":"I'm disappointed.  Wanted to enjoy the patio on a beautiful Sunday.  Patio was dirty.  6 out of 8 tables filled with dirty dishes. Love the location and fact we can eat outside and enjoy. ....but not today:("}
{"text":"Mehhh.. Not bad, not great.

Stopped by for lunch today and ordered a Cajun fish taco and shrimp taco. Came out to be a little over $6.00. The tacos had more tortilla than meat so a bit steep for the price.

Restaurant was spacious and clean. 

The only other time I've had wahoos was in Cali and we enjoyed our meal then. I'll give one more shot. Possibly try something else before completely giving up on it."}
{"text":"I hadn't heard of Wahoo's before we walked in here.  Someone later had mentioned it was a chain.  That's ok... I still wanted to try it.

We didn't know how their restaurant worked as far as sitting and ordering or order before you sit.   Well, you order before you sit down and they bring it out to you.   We decided to split the Outer Reef Burrito and the Nachos with cajun chicken.   The burrito... eh.  It was ok but I wouldn't run back to have another one.  I think I had better tasting burritos from Taco Bell.  Bummer.   The nachos were pretty good.  The cajun chicken on top had a great flavor with their blends of melted cheese.   

The service was good too! The cashier was friendly but didn't understand a few of my questions.  Oh well.  The waitstaff who brought out the food and cleared the plates were great! Very courteous and polite.   

I just wish the food was memorable.    It was fine but I probably won't hurry back to be a 'regular' here."}
{"text":"It's been awhile since I've eaten at a Wahoo's location.  I grew up in San Diego therefore it was one of those places you go to when you where near the beach area.  I love love love their rice... however, this time around I went for the brown rice as I'm trying to \"change\" the way I eat. The brown rice was typically nutty and typically dry.  I think next time I will stick to the regular at least at this establishment. The food here was good. Atmosphere awesome, especially with the littles and most of all it's close to home!  Healthy Mexican food at it's best is the best way I can describe it."}
{"text":"Cashier helped us right away and knew we were kind of lost and gave us a quick explanation of the menu. We knew what we wanted right away two fish taco entree. Comes with rice and beans. Food is good. Atmosphere has a surfer type vibe to it. Very casual."}
{"text":"Quirky mix of Mexican/Brazilian with an island twist on the menu here. From classic burritos to a Kalua Pig bowl. I was happy to see Tofu, veggies, mushrooms and  vegetarian fillings as part of your options when you go to make your meal.

First impression didn't really start off on the right foot though. We walked in and didn't know if we were supposed to order or wait to be seated. Walked around to the cashier working behind the counter and stood there till we were able to catch her attention and ask for help.  That's when another employee came out from the back and walked us back to the entryway and walked us thru the menu. From there all staff was helpful and friendly throughout our visit. 

I ended up picking the taco/burrito combo. My choice fillings were Tofu and Shrimp.  Both had a polynesian marinade.  It's like shoyu with pineapple juice.  It was sweet and went well on the fillings I had.  I didn't really like the shrimp though.  Too rubbery texture for me. Portion wise, it was adequate and prices are reasonable most combos were under $10 .  Combo platter came with beans and/or rice too. The cajun style beans wasn't too spicy .  Also our server offered both red and green sauces for our dishes. The green sauce was what I remember most. Creamy but light, fresh, and just slightly spicy.  Cilantro was prominent ingredient in it. I asked our server what else was used and was informed fat free mayo! Nice! They stick to the theme of healthier and fresh foods.

Atmosphere, well once you get past the narrow entryway where everyone crowds around to read the menu (hence the line out the door) it's bright and airy.  The dining area is beach themed and the vibe is pretty chill and laid back. Seating  in main dining area has booths lining one wall, several tables everywhere else. It's family friendly . The bar is in a separate area which has the partial view of the valley. It's a nice set up. I'll more than likely be back in this part of the restaurant since my neighbor friends are bar flies and like to just hang out for drinks and appys for happy hour or for a light lunch in the main dining area. That's about it."}
{"text":"Not very good at all. 20 minutes wait for couple tasteless tacos and enchiladas. What the waste of time and money."}
{"text":"I miss many things about my former life in Los Angeles. Wahoo's is one of them. Very glad to see that there is a location near my home.

This location is quite good. Clean, for the most part. I don't suggest walking into the bar section if you have asthma or sensitivity to cigarette smoke. It's a bit strong, but the restaurant side makes up for it. They also have beer.

I typically will get fish tacos, but the nice thing about this place is that there is something for everyone, particularly if you have friends who don't eat meat. 

Get the black beans and brown rice if you want to be healthier-ish.

Also, they have a fantastic happy hour!

I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Really good food at an amazing price! I love the wahoo fries. They are smothered in cheese and your choice of meat for a measly 4 bucks! So good. Also the micheladas they make are the best hangover cure I've found yet! Sometimes the place is super packed but that is my only complaint!"}
{"text":"Noting special. Good but I wouldn't say great. I went around lunch time and there was no line and the food came out fairly fast. Servers were nice. I feel like for the size of this place they could use more restrooms. I wanted to wash my hands before eating and there's only 2 private restrooms both occupied so there was a bit of a wait just to use the sink. I ordered the #2 fish taco with the cabbage on top, carne asada enchilada, brown rice, and black beans.  The enchilada has an option of a spicy sauce  on top and they are not joking when they say spicy! It had a good little kick to it. I heard a lot of great things about this place from a few people  and I was finally in the area to check it out. Food was good but I was expecting it to be a little more tasty for all the hype. I wouldn't go out of my way to go back there but If I'm in the area and in the mood I'll probably check it out again."}
{"text":"Flavorful and healthy food served by a nice wait staff. Great lunch fare. No sleeping at your desk a few hours later from the sugar drop."}
{"text":"I'm not going to waste my time and write a five page review about this stupid place!
1- Food was extremely over priced.  $12 for a bowl of black beans and rice!!
2- We found an Ant in our plate.... WTF!!
3- The dinning room was too hot like it felt warmer than out side. No A/C I guess!!
4- The cashier kid (a little punk who wears a baseball hat - for your reference!) was hitting on my wife!! WTF!! 
5- Too loud... you cant even hear anything.


Don't waste your time or your money. There are way better Mexican places in town.

So I'm thrilled this store opened pretty close to home.

Great customer service, great outer reef fish burrito *cajun style* is what I always get, and quick service also!"}

{"text":"My favorite fish tacos and beer spot. A good work friend introduced me to this location. I always get same things, 3 grilled fish tacos with coleslaw, Mr. Lee's sauce (if you like things with heat), and Pacifico with salt on the rim. Best combination for a post workout meal plan. Food is prepapred fresh, and the atmosphere is sports bar like. They do have a take out for folks who are in hurry. The servers are very friendly. The grilled fish tacos with Lee's sauce are amazing. 

This location also has an awesome view of the city. Good for first dates."}
{"text":"I have been eating at Wahoos quite frequently over the past two months and it seems that the quality, service , and presentation just keeps getting better and better!  This continues to be one of my favorite places to eat in California as well as Las Vegas."}
{"text":"One of the only chains i love. Very good fish tacos, brown rice n black beans for cheap. 3 dollar pacifico drafts w a lime. Quick service, good atmosphere. This location has a full bar too. Now they give you a free taco just for downloading their app, and Vegas food n bev and casino employees get 20% off here. Pretty economical and delicious. Get some. The only thing is you have to always ask for limes, but that way they come to you fresh cut.

Also the wahoo/mahi mahi they use is wild caught in USA. Much preferred to cheap overseas alternative used by most restaurants."}
{"text":"I first learned about Wahoos in Southern California, it was pretty much my everyday lunch during my summers spent in Huntington Beach and during the winter months I would go to the one across the street from my job in Valencia. To say the least, I love this place. So I figured I'd share my love for this place with my girlfriend - we'd been saying we were going to visit this one since we moved out here a year ago because she has never been.  Finally we were on our way to Target and hungry, so it was perfect timing.  I've been hyping this place up so much you'd think I had shares in Wahoo stocks or something.

We both got burritos and she also got the tortilla soup. To my disappointment, the soup was bland. Very bland. Like less flavor than Campbell's soup. It was literally chicken broth with an overload of canned veggies and a couple chunks of chicken. Needless to say she didn't finish it. After about 20 minutes of waiting for our burritos, we're discussing about just leaving and getting out money back due to the lengthy wait and lack of patrons. It didn't make sense. 

In the midst of waiting we had the pleasure of seeing the place robbed. Literally. Some guy stole the cash drop from the cashier and ran out of there. Quite the scene, if you ask me. Not that it was the restaurants fault for that, but after seeing that, our appetites were lost. Got a refund and quickly left with our money, just like the guy who robbed the place, but legally.

Maybe next time Wahoos!"}
{"text":"Why is this place not 5 stars?! It's so good! we got one of each fish taco, the 88 and the Citrus, both so delicious! Preferred the 88, my husband liked the citrus. Service was very helpful, the decor is so different, I loved it! I felt like I was in California or on a beach somewhere! And the food was very flavorful.  Even my daughter who never eats ate her meal."}
{"text":"Great location to get you grilled fish tacos and enchiladas; try them with Mr. Lees sauce. They also have drink specials for every day of the week and bartenders are very friendly. I'd also recommend that you try out their chicken wings. They do have a takeout section for folks who want food on the go."}
{"text":"Best fish taco's I've had in a while. Grilled Fish tacos are fresh and with little bit of lime juice and Mr.Lee's special sauce they are like heaven. Tacos are about $2/piece and they compliment $2/beer perfectly. If you want to grab a quick grub that's somewhat healthy than I would highly recommend this place. Also, the bartenders are very friendly."}
{"text":"Large plates!!! Fish tacos were amazing.... i got one of each of the original and the citrus slaw and likes the slaw MUCH better.  the brown rice was a little bland but just add a little salsa and it makes it much better.  the white beans are very yummy! the view is beautiful at night!  drinks are a little $$$ though."}
{"text":"Came here to grab some quick dinner on the way home. Being a first time customer wasn't sure what to expect. I was very impressed full bar and restaurant.  Friendly staff Ben was great and had great recommendations for food. Food tasted great I will deffinetly be back."}
{"text":"First time trying this place in Las Vegas the service was fast friendly and the food was great. I would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"The food was great and the prices are awesome! The girl who took our order and brought the food to our table was very accommodating and checked in regularly to make sure we were ok. This is the type of restaurant where you order at the counter and serve yourselves beverages, so the way she \" waited\" on our table was above and beyond. The place has a fun, clean vibe. I will def go back again, to game and eat~"}
{"text":"Well, something is wrong today. I have eaten at Wahoo's many, many times, both at Las Vegas & California locations. I always get the same thing. They screwed up too many things today. Enough that I am moved to write a bad review. 
- weird person taking orders, acted bored to death, like I was bothering her.
- wasn't given, or even offered my receipt
- got my fish order wrong
- when given my fish back \"corrected,\" it was not made to order, simply sprinkled the spice on. I have had this spicy fish many times, it is prepared blackened & saturated in spice. They didn't redo it.
- salad had no tortilla strips
I would like to tell management but there is no one walking the floor. When it is quiet & mid afternoon, that's when a presence by management should be mmade"}
{"text":"Got take out. Very generous portions. I probably shouldn't have gotten the spicy white beans though, a little too spicy for me haha. Overall great food though! My 3 year old approves which is saying a lot."}
{"text":"Great food, great customer service, can't say enough about this place!!  Found this gem by accident, which turned out to be the best accident ever!!  Open 24/7, has a bar separate from the main dining area with video poker, and the best bartender ever!!  She is super attentive, extremely bubbly personality, and enthusiastic. The atmosphere vibe is very casual, the music is perfect volume; loud enough to hear,  but not so loud that it drowns out conversation. Food was amazing!! Only downside I found was the bar was a bit stuffy with cigar smoke lingering in the air.  For a non-smoker it is very unappetizing, and this was early in the morning with the place empty. I think if we came later with a crowd, the smoke would have prevented me from eating. (We are out-of-towners, used to the smoke free environments). Other than that. I would recommend this place WITHOUT HESITATION!!"}
{"text":"Good atmosphere but ordered the first  two drinks off the drink menu and was told they were out. The Corona Margarita was good and we ordered a few. Our meal came out and was not prepared the way we requested and was served with plastic silverware. Other tables had regular utensils and other employees were using real utensils as well. Was kind of a disappointment. Waitress also didn't know the hours of operation and suggested the wings as the best menu item as opposed to tacos, which seemed odd.  We made the most of the time we were there but I'm not sure that we would return again."}
{"text":"I just love how this place is diet friendly!  Chicken soup: 45 calories.  Grilled fish taco: 170 calories.  Three different kinds of iced tea: 0 calories!  Cheaper than cafe at Life Time Fitness.  Friendly service.  Love."}
{"text":"Very friendly service here and food was good. Had the fish tacos with chips and salsa and a drink for $10.99. Good deal. The decor is very surf sporty. Full bar in the back."}
{"text":"Great for healthy quick food.  When I am hungry and want something in a hurry.. Wahoo is fabulous !!  Love the cajun beans.. SPICEY !"}
{"text":"Great food at a good price. We've been in town for 10 days to climb at Red Rocks and have eaten here almost every day. The one lady, Julie, is so nice, helpful and good to us that I want to take her home.  I'd give her a $100 tip if I won the lottery.  Can't remember the bartender guys name, but he's real friendly and social, too."}
{"text":"Fish tacos used to be really good but last couple of times, not so much. Too fishy and no pop of flavor. Just didn't taste fresh if you know what I mean. Maybe they changed chefs but won't be going back."}
{"text":"Customer service : We were welcomed right upon entering, by multiple employees. It was our first time going and we told the woman helping us that so she was very helpful in making some recommendations to us. 

Food: I ordered the chicken taco combo and you get a choice of white or black beans as well as white or brown rice. I ordered the cajun white beans and they were absolutely delicious! We also ordered a side of chips and guacamole and the guacamole was flavorless. The avocados did not even have a taste to them and I was really disappointed by it. The meat in the taco was the complete opposite and had tons of flavor and was delicious! 

Environment: It is a casual, very laid back place with plenty of seating and very interesting decor. They definitely brought their California beach vibe with them!"}
{"text":"Wow!! Great Wahoo's tacos and the amazing rice that I've loved for a decade and counting! Perfect soul food for me.

This place has an excellent bar that opens up to the patio space, with a fire pit for night time!

Great views of Suncoast. Maybe the best Wahoo's I've ever been too!"}
{"text":"Service was terrific! It was fast and friendly. A gentleman that worked there gave our baby a sticker. The food came out fast! I got the shrimp bowl and it was great!!"}
{"text":"I'm thinking some of the bad reviews may be from evening visits? We typically come in for lunch and the service is always very friendly and attentive.  However, went in for dinner one night and there is a huge difference - evening crew needs some definite customer service training and the food was poor quality as well.

But, the good stuff we love:

Chicken tacos - delicious!  Traditional street taco style, plenty of meat, great sauces (green sauce needs a bit more flavor)
Chicken enchilada - my FAVE!  The red sauce is fabulous!
The salsa (pico de gallo style) is always fresh and chips have always been fresh and crispy
Maui Bowl - very good teriyaki, not oversauced


The not-so-good:

I ordered chicken tortilla soup hoping for a Mexican-style tortilla soup but instead got a bowl of what could have been Progresso chicken noodle with some tortilla strips on top.  No taste, definitely not what I had in mind for \"tortilla soup\" - very disappointing.

The choices of rice and beans is a little weird - plain white or brown rice and either black beans or Cajun beans.  My husband enjoys these options and the portions are generous and always cooked well, but I always opt for ala carte because none of those really appeal to me.

Some of the items are a little pricey - for instance, the Wahoo's Salad is a very bare bones, basic salad for almost $8.  But my ala carte enchilada with chips and salsa for under $5...I could eat that every day."}
{"text":"2nd time here was today, first visit was okay, however today was not. The kid working the register, Brady, was friendly and helpful. Once our order was in we had to wait a long time while most of the employees wandered around. The place was basically empty, and a bag was placed on the counter but they never said it was ours and there was no communication between the employees about it, because they were busy having conversations about other things. Once someone realized an order was sitting there a shorter girl brought it over to us and we asked for extra limes. She went back to get them, put them in a container, but on her way back decided to join in on the conversation going on, which included a guy who I'm guessing was a manager since he was in a blue polo. The cashier came over since we were standing there waiting and asked if we needed anything and we told him we were waiting on the girl to bring the limes, so he walked over and grabbed them and brought them to us. Once we got home we got a great surprise that a single taco was placed under the container with an entire meal, which caused the container to leak black bean sauce all over everything in the bag. Then my wife was gifted a piece of fish in her taco that had bones in it. It's really unfortunate that apparently most of the employees don't care about their jobs, customers, or the business owners investment. I will definitely be writing corporate because this experience is completely opposite of the experiences I had at the Torrance location in California which were always great."}
{"text":"Love this place great bar with quick service:) if you have kids they have a area that they can eat and watch video of skaters. Nice surf and skate board place all you can drink on soda and the shrimp burrito yummy cool place that has that California feel by the beach."}
{"text":"I like to food but is very expensive for lunch it's about 9 bucks of food but when you add on the annoying table service taking your before you but the fork down to that is a bit much
Trying to relax now I have to relaxing lunch instead I am annoyed by the annoying wait staff
One is for having warm food
Two stars food is right

One deducted star expensive
One deducted star annoying wait staff soup bowl 
One deducted star annoying wait staff main dish
While The fork was still in my hand"}
{"text":"Like a place at the beach, wooden benches and paper plates are the style of the day.
Food is ok but the beer...the coldest on the face of the Earth?"}
{"text":"I love wahoos!! There are so many healthy and delicious food items on the menu! The staff is great and the prices are very reasonable! Surfboards, bikes, and skateboards give the restaurant & bar that \"So Cal\" beach vibe! I would highly recommend Wahoos to anyone! Two thumbs up!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I've visited Wahoo's in Southern California but never in Vegas. I took my family here on Easter Sunday around 8pm and had a nice time. There was nobody in the dining area only in the bar which was nice. Our host Sean King provided excellent service and made sure we were taken care of. He didn't try to rush us out or anything. I have always loved the food at Wahoo's but it goes a long way when the service is great! This place is away from the heavy strip crowds and is a nice place to eat healthily food."}
{"text":"This place is foul and decussating. Found a hair on top  of the burrito the minute the girl set it down. Sent it back. Waited and waited for a new one. Only because my kids were hungry. Surprise they brought out the same burrito. Just took off the hair. She said sorry it took so long. There is only two of us working today. Shame on you Wahoo management. Never eat here again ."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. Haven't come back since they changed how they made their Maui bowls, but tonight I thought I would give it try. This was my go to spot in California. This place has 100% disappointed again. Their steak is like stew. Gross. You walk in and your hit with cigarette smoke in the face. There's a non smoking sign but I guess they allow the people at the bar next the booths where people eat smoke. The whole place smelled like a nasty old downtown casino. Not exactly a place I want to eat with my kids especially when the food is disappointing. Always great when you leave a place and you and your kids smell like a cigarette with a non smoking sign on the door. I really hope this place has no affiliation with any of the ones in California. Sad."}
{"text":"UPDATE: Wahoo's just released a specialty cocktail menu and their Absolut Mules are where it's at! Perfectly balanced and not overwhelming with ginger. We also tried the enchiladas with green sauce- zesty and creamy; much better than the red sauce in my opinion. I also tried their classic fish taco and it was fantastic as well, loaded with fish fillet and the slaw compliments the spice of the fish really well.

I'm so happy we gave Wahoo's another shot, they did not disappoint the second time."}
{"text":"Hadn't been here before, despite having locations in both Cali and Texas, when I've lived in both.
Another review, for another location, mentioned how healthy, tasty, and low-cal the shrimp burritos are here, and that is what I came for.

Ordered to go. Loved the beachy atmosphere with the tiki bar area, projected surfing/ocean scenes, and chill music. This is easily a place I could hang out for a while.

Service was friendly. Waited for my order at the bar, where I was asked for my ID even though I was just waiting. Bartendress was super sweet and apologetic about it.

Got the classic shrimp burrito, total was under $7 but it's not a burrito that is a meal on it's own (for my massive appetite). Flavors were good and fresh, simple shrimp in a teriyaki-like sauce with a bit of kick to it. Cabbage slaw, cheese, and very little else kept things fresh and healthy: no rice and beans in here!
Noticed they also had signage up that they'd recently added salmon to the menu- asked what cost would be for a salmon burrito on my next visit, and price was still under $7. Not bad at all!

Very pleasantly surprised by food quality, pricing, interior decor, and service here.

Side note: Gave an extra star for their transparency with nutrition info. Their website has an easily-found PDF file, their store has a printout, containing every dish offered here, with all meat combinations and condiments, with calorie listings and other data for health-conscious diners! Every place should offer this!"}
{"text":"I love wahoos!! The fish tacos are great I wanted to order something new off the menu since the fish tacos were what I've always ordered. I called in an order for the first time. I ordered the Maui bowl (steak, rice, & beans.) my fiancée ordered the chicken Maui bowl. I ordered extra teriyaki sauce in case it needed it. When I went to pick it up, the girl at the register was nice but the guy (teenager) who took my order smarted off to me when I asked for more teriyaki sauce. (Just so you employees of wahoos know, the customers can HEAR what you're saying in the kitchen.) Lol *SMH* anyway, when I checked the food this is what I got... (See pic) the steak was dry, plain, and NOTHING I would even pay for. Once I saw the food I asked for MORE teriyaki because I KNEW it would need it! The rice was hard. Not like uncooked hard, more like it'd been sitting out-kinda hard. I was so hungry I didn't care tho I didn't eat very much of it & my fiancées was the same only he said the chicken tasted better than the steak. I've been to wahoos in the day, the vibe is so different and the service is much better. I wonder if the Maui bowl would've been better too but I know I'm not ordering it again! Still love the fish tacos & ONLY ordering that AND only in the day when day staff is there!"}
{"text":"Started going to Wahoo's this football season when Shannon started tending bar there. 

 Shannon, and I go way back and watching football with her is tradition. Nevertheless, I really like the place. The bar has a nice atmosphere, the crowd is cool, the price is right, great specials, and Shannon puts on the Lions games for us, and I can also watch other games and keep up with my fantasy football points. 

I haven't eaten much other than the wings, but I get them every time. They are awesome and have a really nice flavor to them. 

It goes without saying that Shannon is one of the best, fastest, knowledgeable and personable Bartenders I've ever had the pleasure of frequenting. Whether you know her or not she's a true professional and makes everyone feel welcomed and well taken care of. 

This location is completely across town from where I live, but it's worth the trip."}
{"text":"Yesterday I felt the need to try a new restaurant, and was really feeling fish tacos, so my boyfriend and I ended up here. We walked in and instantly notice the laid-back vibe and half indoor, half outdoor bar, which we thought was pretty cool. The woman who took our order was also very nice and helpful, so we decided to stay. 

The first thing I found very interesting was that, for a place called Wahoo's Fish Tacos and More, Fish tacos were really underplayed and there was definitely a lot of focus on the 'more'. The selection was sparse and not really what I was looking for so I ultimately ended up getting the monthly special: a California Burrito (Carne Asada, Fries, cheese, pico, and lots of avocado/avocado sauce), chips and salsa, and a drink. My boyfriend got the Shredder Sandwich with Fish and we decided to share an order of Baja Rolls, all of which totalled about $28 (not bad!).

We found a table, and did not have to wait long for our food to arrive. My burrito looked great, but ended up being rather unremarkable. My boyfriend felt the same about his sandwich, and the only thing you could really taste in the Baja Rolls was the cream cheese. After adding some hot sauce, things got better. 

All-in-all, the food was alright and the experience was good, not great. We did notice that they had some bar specials ($2.95 Pacificos!) and they seem to have a pretty good happy hour, so we decided we would return someday to try it out."}
{"text":"First off... The food is good.  It's not amazing or anything to rave about, but what you get for the amount you pay is good. 

I think some of the staff needs to be replaced.  We got a kid who didn't have a clue what he was doing.  He kept getting distracted when we were ordering and kept repeating himself over and over.  

As for the atmosphere... It's okay.  The decorations are action sport themed.  Unfortunately the music is way too loud.  I like music as much as anyone, but when I'm in a restaurant, I like to talk with the other people in my party.  I could never bring my parents or grandparents here.  It would be impossible to have a conversation with them.

Overall, I'd say Wahoo's is just OK.  Not great, not terrible.  Maybe turn the music down and get employees who can pay attention and maybe I'll revisit this review down the road."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday night, by a friends recommendation that Rob was the best bar tender in Summerlin. Come to find out, he was right. I came in to meet a friend with a cold unfortunately, and and my friend recommended to try a \"hot tottie\" which is usually an inconvenience to most bar tenders. Rob didn't break a sweat and broke them out like it was no ones business. It was seriously awesome.

Came in a week later to visit the same friend and was pleased to meet Marisela! Seriously the cutest bartender I've seen in this town! Very attentive, very nice, always paying attention to her guests, making sure everyone is okay. I appreciated hearing that from a bartender in this town, it's very uncommon honestly. 

I seriously can't wait to return. I hear there's a guy called \"Fluddy\" that's supposed to be the man here. Can't wait to meet him too. Seriously this is my new spot in Boca Park!"}
{"text":"Great little place! I have been here a few times now. The bartenders are excellent,and very friendly. Their food is the bomb. Great place to go out and have a couple of drinks and unwind. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a weekend visit to the area and Jaime the manager walked us thru the menu. Delicious options, healthy and Jaimes positive and enthusiastic personality set us off in a happy dining experience. He let us sample the delicious queso and overall his service was such a treat. Paleo Noel delicious."}
{"text":"This is the first time I've eaten here and have heard mixed reviews about it. It actually turned out really well. I had two spicy fish tacos (not very spicy at all) and they were delicious. My dad had a fish salad and it was really good too. Citrus slaw!"}
{"text":"To be honest,  I must start out by saying, I have only actually ate here once. However,  that does not stop me from giving them 5 stars,  I would give more if I could!! 
Let me start out by saying... the atmosphere and staff at this place are great! I felt completely welcome from my first step in the door,  and that feeling never died.  Everyone was very friendly and made conversation as if they were old friends!
But truly, that does nothing to compare to the owners!!! I have never met either in person,  however,  I truly feeling that I matter to them! It is so refreshing to come into contact with owners of a business who TRULY care about their customers! A rare find in this busy world we live in today!!
I can't recommend enough to at least giving this place a try!!! You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Never really had any issues here until today. Came in for lunch & decided to try their HIGHLY promoted Surf & Turf Burrito. Decided on steak & shrimp. Arrived & looked great but contained neither steak nor shrimp- only fish. Was returned & remade (correctly) but had a pre-made \"oldness\" taste. Was told made to order but we determined most likely with older tortillas. Moving back to the fish tacos.  We still love those!"}
{"text":"I wavered on two or three stars, finally going with that third star due to the carnitas tacos with the green sauce. Other than that we were not that impressed. The nachos were just stale chips with melted cheese and taste straight from the microwave. The Carne asada that was on the bowl meal was really tough and flavorless. Was anticipating more, bummer cause I really wanted to love this place!! I must add that the staff in this place is great!!"}
{"text":"You can't beat Wahoos!!! Awesome fish tacos, great fresh brewed iced tea---friendly staff----Love it!!"}
{"text":"Although the staff was extremely helpful and attentive, the food just didn't stack up.  Lack of flavor and simply nothing special.  Chicken and fish tasted about the same.  Rice and beans tasted like paper.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"We have been going to this establishment since it opened. The ONLY concern I have is the dirty bathrooms.  Every single time we go I dread using their bathrooms, they are too dark and the toilets are always filthy or stopped up.  I hope they get it together and clean up the restrooms....."}
{"text":"A socal fave! Simple, clean food."}
{"text":"First time at the new location. Food was just as fabulous as the other locations in Vegas. Service was great and we were checked on regularly. The Carnitas tacos are my favorite. Next time looking forward to sit in the bar area to enjoy the beautiful view of the city!"}
{"text":"This place was so yummy and fresh. I got the chicken teriyaki bowl and it was good. I will come back for sure. People working here were friendly and nice so that's a big plus. 
The above was the first time I went there. The second time, however, food was not as good. Food is fresh every time and the people working there are great. Mike the guy that works nights at the bar is super friendly. Victor, the day manager was friendly and made a point to make things right after they made some human mistakes!
Revised: went back and ..that is the reason for taking one star off. still a good place to go...clean..."}
{"text":"Well... it was okay. I definitely had higher expectations for this place, but I'm not exactly sure why. Wahoo's is super cute, very clean and everyone was extremely friendly. I enjoyed the surf/skate motif and found it really visually appealing. I wasn't quite sure what to order, but I ended up with a shrimp soft taco and a Cajun grilled fish enchillada. It totaled just under $7. You basically place your order at the bar and then they give you a number placard and they'll bring it out to you. Self seating. 

The restaurant was pretty empty, but it did seem to take awhile for the food to finally come out. It was good, very spicy and flavorful, but not very filling at all. The taco had a LOT of cabbage on it and was really small and difficult to pick up. I gave up trying and just ate it with a knife and fork. The enchillada was pretty good, but again on the small side.

I guess Wahoo's is fine if you are craving Mexican and seafood in a nice atmosphere, but I just felt a little let down. I think I could have had a more satisfying meal elsewhere for the same amount."}
{"text":"Food is excellent as always.  We eat at wahoos in foothill ranch, ca all the time.  The really bad part of this experience was the service.  It was a 45 min wait from the time we ordered and there was only a couple people in line ahead of us. No one followed up with us after we asked about our food. The kids nachos had hardly any cheese and we had to send them back.....after 45 minute wait! We told the staff about our dissatisfaction and they just shrugged their shoulders. In addition the bar was full of drunks who were dropping f bombs as we sat there with our kids."}
{"text":"Fish tacos were delicious and i loved the coleslaw. The bartender Nica was very friendly and professional. We will definitely be back to see Nica and enjoy something new on the  menu."}
{"text":"The Skinny: supposedly healthy Mexican fusion with very little flavour (2) counter service is efficient but nothing special, where the hell is the salsa bar? (2) value: $6.50 for a huge tasteless plate of white rice and beans with little protein and veg? that's a little pricey (2).

We've been waiting forever for the Wahoos to open at the Boca location. However we spotted the large sign on the 215 stating that there was one just off Rainbow. Ecstatic, my hubby brought us in to taste their fusion healthy take on Mexican classics.

This particular restaurant is outfitted to serve as both a bar and a restaurant. If you are adverse to cigarette smoke, stay away from the booths closest to the bar area. Even though there is a wall separating the two areas, the smell of smoke does waft through the open door to the bar into the eating area. You have been warned!

Ordering is a breeze really. Pick your filling (Chicken, pork, shrimp, beef, fish, mushrooms, tofu, veggies) then decide whether your want it in a taco, enchilada or burrito style. If you don't feel like doing it Mexican style, you can also order in a bowl over rice. Or you can just get a salad, soup or your standard sides (quesadillas, chips and salsa, nachos, etc.) Combination plates come with rice and beans instead of your standard chips.

Well, feeling a little hungrier than usual, I opted for their standard combination plate ($6.50) - two carnitas tacos with white rice and black beans. The hubs tried two different styled fish tacos and tried their white beans instead.

I would like to say that the combination plates aren't that healthy. Even though they might be low in fat, you can't tell me a massive plate of white rice with very little vegetables (what was on top of the tacos) is healthy. Filling, yes. Healthy, not so much. It may be healthier if they offered a salad option instead of beans and rice.

Okay, enough of my rant on nutrition and on to the food.

I have to say for the above mentioned carnitas and fish tacos (grilled in two different styles) were rather lacking in flavour. I actually used the salt shaker on the table. Here's the thing - I never use salt at the table (you can ask my husband). The pico de gallo served on top of the tacos used rather mealy overripe tomatoes which lead to an unpleasant texture. As well, I don't think they really dried off the cabbage/lettuce very well because the tortillas were sopping wet.

The beans were okay but nothing spectacular. I think the white cajun beans had more seasoning and hence, tasted better than the black beans. The rice was standard issue, nothing that exciting.

I was also disappointed to the lack of a salsa bar. As a Mexican fusion place, you gotta at least have some sort of salsa and limes around. Nope. The closest thing was the stack of lemons for your iced tea by the soda fountain. Lame.

Overall, given the lackluster flavours, the soggy textures and the lack of a salsa bar, I feel no overwhelming urge to have a repeat experience. Although relatively inexpensive, the food just isn't that good and holds no value in my books. A 2 starred review."}
{"text":"Gus was very rude, we walked in and were not greeted. When asked what was in the Son of a Classic Burrito he looked at me like I was daft.  I felt like I was an imposition to him  for stepping into this establishment. 
When asked,\"what do you have on tap?\" Gus responded, \"beer.\" And continued watching football. 

Caesar came by once and asked us if everything was alright.  I asked him for a Miller Lite because Gus was watching too much football.  Caesar asked Gus to make us a Miller Lite.......Gus responded by saying, I'll pour them one.....  Can't make one.   Caesar was great.........  Gus is the most awful bartender I've ever witnessed.  You'll be losing a lot of money with this character.......   NEVER will I be coming back.......  Neither will any friend or family that I know.......

I ate here once in San Diego, it was great food and great service.  The service at the Rampart is poor.......  I'm being kind.  I'll not be eating here again."}
{"text":"Love those shrimpeladas. Joey rules and the other bartenders are great too. Authentic Cali-style mex, get some!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere of this restaurant is pretty neat.  Customer service is great.  You order up front and they bring your food to your table.  However, I expected a lot more out of the tacos.  I ordered a chicken taco and a shrimp taco.  Out of the two, the shrimp one was better... but there was nothing absolutely amazing about it."}
{"text":"It's been a long time since I've been to a Wahoos. Cajun fish taco plate is tasty but too much watery salsa on the tacos. I had to use a fork because the tortilla fell apart.  But good healthy food!"}
{"text":"So my friends had been raving about Wahoo's Fish Taco for a long time so when I heard the new location at Boca was now open I got super excited. I haven't had a decent fish taco anywhere in Vegas and was really looking forward to a great weekend treat. It pains me to say that this was perhaps the worst fish taco, or food in general, I have ever had! The fish was as dry as the desert, along with the taco shells, and the entire combo entree, complete with rice and beans, was essentially flavorless. 

The ordering area had a very conveyor belt like feeling, there is no salsa bar so if you are ordering to go, as I was, you will only get hot sauce if you remember to ask. The sauces themselves definitely had heat, but again nothing particularly interesting or memorable in the flavor department. 

On the upside, the restaurant itself has a fun, open feel with lots of big screens to watch sports and a great bar and patio. I suspect if you're interested in a neighborhood cerveza hang, you will be pleased, but as for the food I'd have to say stop at the Baja Fresh across the parking lot for a fairly decent fish taco before heading to Wahoo's to meet your amigos."}
{"text":"Every part of this place is great.  From the service to the food to the beer to the atmosphere.  There are two seating options when you get there: bar or restaurant.  The guys at the cash registers have been friendly each time offering to take our order with a smile on their faces.

We sit in the bar where the bartender is very friendly and I've met three different bartenders.  We've sat at the bar as well as in their lounge area and the waitstaff is very friendly and will joke back and forth with you.

Then add in their food, and its amazing.  Whoever is responsible for coming up with their awesome menu should get a raise!  Fish tacos, carne asada tacos, salso...all of it is amazing so get ready for your taste buds to thank you!"}
{"text":"Love the food, lots of healthy options and love that kids can take in their Halloween candy for a free kid's meal. We usually sit in the restaurant section with our toddler. Cashiers have never been friendly. We have been there probably 10 times now for the food. They don't even greet you. They are always rushing us through even if no one is behind us and if we ask a question they either don't know or have told us, \"look at the menu\". One time I just asked what was in the guac. The cashier didn't know. We love the atmosphere too:)"}
{"text":"my review is biased as i've been eating at wahoo's since the early 90's.
been a fan ever since.
it's tough not to be when you're from a socal beach city.
wahoo's is pretty much a staple for we beach folk.

i've always loved the laid back, island-aloha-vibe of the place.
i love that you can throw stickers on anything...the more, the better.
the vegas locations aren't quite as \"stuck-up\" as the cali locations yet, but i'm sure they'll eventually get there.
=)
it's pretty rad that there's a bar and gaming at the vegas locations.

the food is consistently good, not great.
they've always slightly overcooked my fish.
i think i'd give them a solid 5 stars if they'd just stop overcooking the fish.
i suppose it's not great that they're called wahoo's FISH tacos and the fish is just ok.
they should probably work on that.

the onion rings are the bomb tho!
my fave.

i'm a super happy socal girl now that wahoo's is in vegas!"}
{"text":"Special today:2 tacos and a Pacifico for $9. 
I got the shrimp and carne asada with a side of fries and hubs got 2 carne asada with a side of white rice and Cajun beans. He said mix the rice and beans and it's really good. I thought the shrimp taco was really good. It went well with the slaw mixture they put on the tacos. 
The Pacifico was COLD!!! And it's a good price for a 16 ounce. 
I only gave 4 stars because the regular menu is a bit pricey for tacos. 
Hubs was happy so we will be back for another visit. I think next time I'll try an enchilada. 

2nd visit tonight. Pacifico still COLD!! I had a chicken burrito wet with red sauce. It was really good. Ordered chips and salsa and the salsa was really really good. A bit spicy for me but very flavorful. 
Hubs had a carne asada taco and a shrimp taco. He liked the shrimp taco better. Until next time...."}
{"text":"VERY good!  The food is SO tasty!  It's a wee bit pricey, but YUM!  Think Chipotle or Qdoba and kick it up a notch.  The food quality is HIGH; you get what you pay for, but $30 for lunch for two with no drinks is a little much for a daily driver.  But I will go back.  Delish!  Get the cajun fish bowl.  OMG!"}
{"text":"Talk about reminiscing about the days visiting my college roommate down in southern california (Huntington Beach) kicking it by the pier getting some fish tacos. The only thing that was missing was the sand all over the floor. Darn they need too work on that one. Lol! Wahoo Fish Tacos is affordable tacos, good portion, and like laid back southern california feel too it. If billabong, quicksliver, go on and on surfing. Then not too mention all the skateboard brand names. The posters it totally feels like rad place too hang out with friends whether it be in the restaurant or the bar area. Not that into any of those things but if your fan definitely love the decor and vibe.

The food its your basic mexican food nothing really out there with WoW factor. I ended up getting the The Kahuna Grande. Like mention earlier get great value for the price because all the Combo Platters comes with rice (choose from steam, spanish) and beans (refried, black, and believe one other option). The Kahuna Grande you get choice of one taco or enchilada I went with the enchilada. Also three tequitos for all three get choose your protein. That another list of things too choose from so when it comes too options there are plenty too choose from plus even go healthy. I when with carne asada for enchilada then chicken for tequitos. Overall I liked the whole dish felt like everything was okay. The carne asada had nice flavor too it and combine with the enchilada sauce on top nice combination of flavor. The tequitos just okay. The black bean side was fabulous! I liked that the black beans was cooked perfect and had nice flavor. The steamed rice was just steamed rice nothing special. The guacamole was terrible. Me if there was anything that not fan of it was the guacamole. I feel like not even fresh made and just off with no flavor whatsoever. The salsa was ok. I came with my brother family so got too try the cajun chicken nachos. Just not fan. It was way heavy top loaded and not very good. 

I like the fact that the prices are great for under $10 get lot. Food is ok nothing special but being close too home if ever want quick mexican food other then Robertos. Wahoo Fish Tacos is place that come back too again.."}
{"text":"Great tacos/burritos and friendly attentive service too! We came here for lunch with our staff and enjoyed a great lunch and a good time."}
{"text":"I love the Wahoos in Henderson.  I get the same thing everytime I go there. If I get a grouch at the register or an annoying group sits next to me, which are both rare, the food still makes it all worth it."}
{"text":"We came late at 10 pm and they close at 11. But they were nice,  the food was ok.  My kids got the cheese quesadilla and fries, ehhhh, nothing special. I got the taquitos which were really good and the nachos-thisr were horrilbe, it's chips with shredded cheese and microwaved! I'm not sure how they melted the cheese but the chips got tough and they shouldn't call them nachos at all! Mu hubby got the skinny tacos and the fish tasted like 10pm fish! Soooo we might try again, maybe earlier in the day instead."}
{"text":"great restaurant. we love it. the food is good and the staff super friendly.
it's also clean and  very welcoming !"}
{"text":"Stew, the bartender, always goes above and beyond to make sure our visits are pleasent!"}
{"text":"Bartenders ignore you and since they changed all the staff its really not inviting and we've had at wait almost 20 minutes just to be greeted. Then when the food came out it was wrong and the bartender who was there dayshift was extremely rude about it and actually made offensive comments to one of the other customers about us because we sent it back. The arrogance of the staff at the bar is astounding. Yes money rules all but you don't treat people with disrespect just because you're not playing. You never know who you're talking to."}
{"text":"Great location, lots of individually-cable-boxed TVs, and cheapish beer. The food? Not great, but what I refer to as \"reliable\". (Still doesn't mean it's good.) Best bet are the à la carte enchiladas (menu says 3.49/each but they actually ring up less - don't tell anyone) and if you ask for pico de gallo on top, it's free, and you get a big smother of it on your enchiladas. UPDATE (5/24/2017): The enchiladas no longer ring up less, and they charge you for pico de gallo. The squeaky wheel got the grease - sorry!

Always pass on the carne asada here (it's super minced-up and can be rubbery) but do get the carnitas and/or the spicy fish as proteins. The best in-house hot sauce is Dexter Holland's own Gringo Bandito, which is another plus. They also have the standard Tabasco, Cholula and Tapatío trifecta.

The retractable garage-door in front of the bar is always open - and this place is almost never crowded. My guess is that it sustains itself on video poker revenue? Foodwise, this store probably does 15-20% of the business that the Huntington Beach location does - at best. I hope they stick around!"}
{"text":"Wahoooooo! Got to love me some good fish tacos.

About two years ago I started writing wahoos about opening a las Vegas restaurant and they kept me in the loop contacting me every so often about the plans. So I literally jumped for joy when this location opened. No more driving five hours for me.

Driving up, I felt like a little girl headed to Disneyland, I wares to jump out of my seat. I was a little taken back by the location and the out side look. For starters it's in an unpopulated area and it's also weird looking. You can tell this wahoos used to be a bar. At all of the wahoos I've been to in ca none of them looked as weird or out of place as this wahoos.

The service was fast and friendly but you could tell the workers are still a little not used to the place. Rey are polite and helpful but lack the outgoing personality that I've seen from other workers at other locations. At least it's one step in the right direction. Prices were cheap especially compared to the Pasadena location. Portions are huge, like always. I noticed that the fish was a little more fishy than I remember an lacked a by of spice. Over all it was still pretty darn tasty. Good amount of cabbage and salsa. Personally one line is not enough for two large tacos but then again I'm a line whore :) the black beans we're rich an full of flavor. You can tell they are coked with good spices when I asked they said they are cooked with onions.. I knew it! The white rice was good. Way too much for my appetite but for others in are they like that. There's way more than enough for two people do for others I would suggest ordering the combo and splitting it

Its weird to see inside that it's 24 hours, with an open bar, and slot machines but I'm not in too much shock because I know this is las Vegas an they have to compete with other restaurants and what they offer. It's just something I'm going to have tiger used too but heat the same time of I'm craving fish tacos at one in the morning I know I'm going to get my fix. Now that rocks my socks folks.

This place could use a little improvement but I'm cutting wahoos some slack cause t just opened and it has some different qualities that makebit different from the other ones

Come on out an give wahoos a try, it's a great fast and healthy alternative to the normal lunch places"}
{"text":"Great food and great atmosphere. Service is always quick and very polite. Definitely recommend. Thanks so much Jamie F for being so kind!!"}
{"text":"Went to watch the first football game of the season and I am glad I choose Wahoos! It wasn't super crowded at all which was nice because we easily got the bartenders attention every time we needed it. The outside/inside vibe of the bar is pretty awesome this time of year. I hate to say it, but I really can't comment on their drink selection because I am 25 and still am not well versed in alcohol. I usually stick to what I know which is either a Moscato or a Light Beer with Lime. They have light beer and limes but not the kind with the lime built into it, and they have white wine but not Moscato. I got bartenders choice of white wine and liked it and a blue moon which was good. We had quite a fun laugh when I accidently called light beer \"diet beer\" and thoroughly embarrassed my date. 

Happy hour chips and salsa was $1 a pretty decent appetizer. My partner in crime got the nachos, and they were pretty legit. Not special as far as the ingredient deck but just a good example of well-made bar food. I got one fish taco - I honestly prefer  Rubio's so I wouldn't come here for their fish tacos. It was slightly dry and the fish had the texture of chicken. I also got their cajun fries. They were normal fries, lol, they had a little cajun seasoning but once you dipped you couldn't even taste it. 

So a fun bar with loud TV's and a good atmosphere that isn't super busy even during the game.  The food is A-OK - so three stars. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Being that I'm from where the original location was I'm probably being very critical. Have eaten here several times. Most times is pretty good although I have gotten the fish tacos a little dry. But, that's what hot sauce is for. I'm told they are going to start staying open 24 hours which is cool. Outside bar that can be a cool little hangout at night. I would give more stars but... I'll leave that for the original location."}
{"text":"This place is great, always fresh & prompt. Has a tropical feel & great view of LV. Must be new & the free booze at the bar is great."}
{"text":"Food was fresh & healthy. Staff was prompt & happy. Has a cool SoCal vibe & feels like your at the beach. 4 of us ate & had beers for $48 +tip"}
{"text":"I'm only putting one star so I can write this review.  The fact that you have one unisex restroom for a bar restaurant is disgusting we as women should not have to share a restroom at a bar with men. It says that it's cleaned every 20 minutes bullshit. I should've taken a picture of the pig that went into the restroom before me because he Peed all over the floor and the toilet of course he came  from the bar side. The prices are OK but I will never ever go back there."}
{"text":"Have gone twice now and both times my wife's tacos were cold!!! First time she ordered carne asada and what is supposed to be fresh cooked sure looked per-packaged and as i said before the meat was cold. we sent it back and it was back so fast I don't think they even had time to close the microwave door. The second trip she decided to try the fish tacos and first bite in the fish is cold. how tough is it to send out hot food"}
{"text":"This place is delicious! Reasonably priced and fresh food and ingredients, you can tell with each bite. The beer is pretty cheap (I think they offer $3 dos Equis or Pacifica or something) and the atmosphere is pretty cool, more of a hang out with the guys kind of atmosphere, but my wife and I love this place and their food"}
{"text":"SO happy this opened! I moved here from orange county so going here reminded me of home. Carne Asada Nacos and shrimp tacos are so yummy! Also they are open 24 hours, full bar and slots! The only thing is the location is kinda wired but will probally get better when more things get built over there."}
{"text":"Some of the best fish tacos I've ever had Las Vegas! The price is right, as well. The decor is fun. Definitely reminds me of a California eatery."}
{"text":"This location is vastly superior to the one in Spring Valley.  The food was prepared wonderfully, the portion size was great, and the food was a good value.  Kyrie who was tending the bar was a joy to be around.  She was funny, interacted with the clients, and was everything you look for in a bartender.  We'll probably come back just to see her."}
{"text":"One of my favorite stops when I lived in Denver and now thrilled Wahoo's is in Vegas! The fish taco entrees with rice & beans can't be beat! Love, Love, Love every offering of Wahoo's Fish Tacos! Plus it's such a great overall good vibe!"}
{"text":"Gave this another try last night...... fish tacos were cold. It's not like the fish is thick, but I guess it's frozen. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Came all the way from Mississippi and had the best tacos ever !!!! Very good customer service , took great care of us. I would recommend Wahoo's tacos to anyone who wants the best tacos ever !!! And cheese dip !!!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. After a long week of work, $2 Pacifico's and $2 tacos are a good way to spend an off night...great view of the valley, fire pit outside which is perfect this time of year...this is the type of place that needs to be supported out here if we locals want to have anywhere near home to go to!"}
{"text":"This  joint is fantastic on so many levels.
Quick dining or take out.
Excellent bar atmosphere with Shannon as your bartender
The nachos are fantastic...with carne asada.
Shrimp bowl is excellent...
Great service
Great atmosphere!
A must if YOU are nearby!"}
{"text":"Citrus slaw tacos are the best!!!  The bartender, female on Sunday nights I should remember her name but can't, is the best. Always remembers what I like."}
{"text":"pretty good takeout food at a fair price -- bar and outdoor seating area looked nice"}
{"text":"A little pricey but the food is good. You order at the counter and then they bring the food to your table. We had to wait about ten minutes or so for the food to arrive. The Cajun fries were great and they threw in free ranch with them. The place was clean and a good overall environment. We will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Tasteless guacamole and salsa. Rubios is much better!!"}
{"text":"Got three entr?es for take-out, $30.  The flavor was OK.  Pretty disappointed that the food was about 65% rice, 20% beans and 15% meat."}
{"text":"This was my first time here. I tried the salmon enchiladas with brown rice and Cajun beans.

Salmon is a tricky fish as I have mentioned in previous reviews. I was happy to taste well cooked and tender salmon. The red enchilada sauce was spicy, but not unbearable. 

The Cajun beans were also spicy but tender. They were made with white beans. These beans had the right kind of tenderness to indicate they were not canned beans.

The brown rice was regular wheat rice. This is a great place for some Baja fish."}
{"text":"Lots of good choices on the menu...and then a lot more options for each menu item.  
Brown or White Rice
Black or Pinto Beans
Fish, Chicken, Pork, Steak, Tofu, Veggies

Most items are above average but nothing that makes me want to come back right away.

...oh yeah, and Kona now has competition for 40 - 55 year old males on the prowl, scoping out the young ladies and showing off their rides...did we need another place like that?...Might lower things a star or two for me if I was a lady not looking for a sugar daddy...but sense I'm descent guy it actually acts as a self-esteem booster!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice and sat at bar both times. The first time bartender was an mature lady who was pleasant enough but only talked to me after her regular guests had left and stopped having shots with her. Food is exactly what the menu says. I had the 2 tacos white rice and black beans. You can choose brown rice or spicy beans with no up charge. Although they up charge for avocado slices. 
Second time was yesterday afternoon a man bartender who looks very unkempt not dirty just dishovel might be good word. Sat with 2 friends all order the same thing and again you get what you order. No surprises food is good service was just okay."}
{"text":"This is a bitter sweet restaurant to me.  I always go here when I am feeling health conscious.  The fish is grilled instead of fried, the food is not very oily.  I love that.  On that same note, the food lacks a punch.  I think because it is prepared on the healthier side, the food lacks flavor.  I wish the fish had more spices, I hate having to compensate for it with their homemade hot sauce, it's so spicy!!  I end up mainly tasting the hot sauce instead of my food, I have made this mistake several times!

But I still give it four.  The portions are big, and the food can be prepared clean and healthy, everyone is really nice, the restaurant is fun and high energy.

Random thought:  I secretly wish the veggies could be added to the burrito without teriyaki sauce.  Never been a fan of the teriyaki.  Since we're going healthy here, we might as well go all the way and go no sauce!!"}
{"text":"Awful, overpriced, tasteless. My kid ordered \"nachos\" & got 35 stale tortilla chips with a bit of shredded cheese sprinkled on top & melted. Taquitos were overcooked & tough. Fish bowl had dried out fish on top. Desserts are served in cellophane. How did this place become a chain?"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good, which for some reason surprised me. 

The best part is the wide selection and ways in which you can tweak your meal. To me that makes it an improvement over other similar chains. 

I was impressed by the price for the amount of food. It's rare that I can't finish a $7 lunch. 

The quality of the food was sort of what I would have expected. Certainly wasn't planning on receiving gourmet fare, but I was hoping for slightly higher quality. 

Regardless, for a quick healthy lunch, this is a good option for a great price."}
{"text":"Got citrus slaw fish tacos. One small one inch piece of fish inside. Not the first time. Ordered burritos serious lack of chicken."}
{"text":"May be my new favorite place to come with the hubby! I love the grilled fish tacos with citrus slaw and white rice and cajun beans. The hubby gets the outer reef burrito wet with red sauce. I also enjoy the coconut breeze cocktail and he loves that they have Guinness on tap. Love this place for a quick bite and place to chill!"}
{"text":"Food a huge disappointment nasty! 

The only thing I loved was the decor if only they knew about food as much as they do with decorations I soo wanted to love this place.......bummed!"}
{"text":"Started with the chips and guacamole - excellent! My 9 year old said the pork taco was - heaven! Los of amazing stuff in between and then finished with the churro chips - delicious!!!
Totally friendly service and excellent food!"}
{"text":"Kinda cool place, food wasn't great. I would have thought the fish tacos would have been better since the name of the place is called \"Wahoo FISH TACO\"! Nice place to watch a football game tho."}
{"text":"Had the Kale Kai Salad last night with the spicy fish on top, it was delicious! A bit pricey for a salad ($11+) but its pretty big, I finished the second half for breakfast this morning and it was still good! That cilantro lime dressing brings life to me! I loooved it. The fish could have been a bit more crispy on the outside and flaky on the inside if they pan fried it skin on and then baked it..but the flavor was nice. Might try it with chicken or pork next time instead."}
{"text":"Even though I still don't think his real name is \"Mailman\" the guy tells a good story. My drink was never empty the whole time I was playing. Drink comps seem very fair and the food is amazing! Wahooooo fries are the best!! Citrus slaw taco and a Margarita is my new fav as well. \"Gunner\" was also very friendly definitely my new watering hole :)"}
{"text":"UPDATE 4/20/17 --- Joseph, as always made our night. Our bunny passed Easter weekend and he was there to take off some stress. The guy didn't even know it, but it helped us out a lot to get out and not have to worry about cooking or what to think. He makes enjoying your time effortless. Thanks dude. 


Since living in Huntington Beach, I will forever be addicted to Wahoos. Joseph makes my dreams come true. See him at the bar. What a pleasure, a professional to customer service, and a class act. Being from the industry myself this is highly appreciated. My husband really enjoy our nights here but Joseph made it a little extra special by paying us attention at the bar tables, with his entire bar FULL. I thoroughly enjoyed his service. 

Update! 1/13/17 --- Rosy, thank you for your continuous smile, every time I dine. It can brighten anyone's day. I can attest to that. 


Joseph is, as always, at his finest. It's a great night to be served by him and have Rosy come on over with our food and that smile! Thanks guys."}
{"text":"For the fist time visiting we definitely will return. My boyfriend and I sat at the bar.  Good happy hour specials. We ate Wahoo fries ( everyone should try those ) Maui bowl (steak) and Cajun chicken burrito. The meat was seasoned very well and cooked just right. Ginny the bar tender was fabulous. Overall a wonderful experience and a new spot to go to and love that its family friendly."}
{"text":"This place is Bomb! Check it out! Say cafe rio and Robertos had a baby, but better then you can imagine."}
{"text":"The food here is consistently great! Whether you're looking for a nice fresh salad or some fabulous fish tacos this is your spot. Joe, the swing bartender, is beyond sweet and never forgets a face or what you drink! He is the star of the show at Wahoos!"}
{"text":"Wahoo's is a yeshoo!

After seeing the cute location and reading reviews I checked it out and was very happy to find the food is very good.  The fish tacos are very good, the spicy salsa is awesome.  The white rice is very tasty, unlike major chain competitors with similiar fare and the black beans tasty as well.  

Went again on another trip and tried the Kahuna Grande: selected the spicy fish taco and chicken taquitos w/guac & sour cream - very good, not greasy at all (they do not use lard), tried the white beans I like better - quite saucy with a bit of zip.

Tried the Wahoo's salad with grilled Cajun fish - this is spicily wonderful!  The fish portion was as long as the platter (not bits of meat chopped up), and the cilantro dressing quite tasty!

Try it -very nice atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Awww, an old friend. Wahoos can be found all over California, my old stomping grounds. The food is simple, unpretentious and delicious. When I first walked through the door I felt like I was back in Ventura or Orange County again. The beach, tacos and music...all the important stuff. For a second I forgot I was in Vegas. The fish tacos are amazing! And the star of the show is Mr. lees. You must get the Mr. Lees! The food is just a vessel for Mr. Lee! It's this garlicky, spicy, hoisin saucy I dunno delicious concoction of a sauce that you can put on everything."}
{"text":"My wife and I stop here when we come to LV. The food is always good. The service even better.  One of our friends recommended this to us and I have to say it's worth the stop. The staff is on point, especially the bartender. Granted we weren't drinking but my wife like the view from the bar. She likes looking over the valley. She was cordial and helpful. Kudos."}
{"text":"One of the best fish tacos I've had in a long time every thing was nice and hot the fish tacos were so tasty and crunchy till the very last bite.. Jesse & jaime gave outstanding customer service from when I walked thru that door till I left.. had an amazing experience here at Wahoo tacos diffently going to spread the word to family and friends about this location and I'm coming back for more food!!"}
{"text":"I have been to Wahoos twice, first time it was during lunch ..food and service was OK.  A few weeks ago ( Thursday night) we returned after midnight to go have a drink with friends since we live close by. The place was empty maybe about 5 people scattered around the bar. We came into the bar area just my wife and I to wait for our friends... The bartender at the moment was talking to one of her customers so we sat patiently to wait for her to get to us.. ( by this time she had seen us and turn back to talk to her customer friend and not even acknowledge that we were there, not even the smallest gesture she could ever made to make sure we knew that  she knew that we were waiting)... but still sat patiently and waited .. now I work in the industry and after 3 minutes of waiting and hearing their loud conversation from across the bar I think that will piss off any customer since you don't even have the smallest delicacy to go and say \" Hi , how are you guys doing? Ill be right back \" that would have sufficed instead of ignoring us and keep your ladies night talk which every other customer ( 5 people maybe) are  hearing  you , my wife said lets just get up and go just to prove a point so we did!... I was reading the reviews about this place and I don't ever yelp but maybe they do have a bit of a problem with customer service and i would just like the owners to be aware of it ."}
{"text":"The quality of the food here teeters on the line between low end dine-in and just quick fast food- the \"I'm so hungry, I'll eat anything and it'll taste good anyway\" kind. 
The fish tacos are good. The fish is well seasoned and fresh. The cabbage gives the tacos good flavor. Anything that makes this place stand out? No not really. But if you're hunger and looking for a place to sit down, this place will fill your tummy. I wouldn't have eaten here if it wasn't down the street from my friend's house."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time for lunch. The bartender Nikka was very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"This is my go to place once again.  Thank you to Victor! You fixed my problem, I wish all managers cared as much about their customers as you do.  You addressed my concern and fixed it.  I cant thank you enough, To Wahoo's, Victor saved you this customer.  

I love your food.    Thank you again Victor I really appreciate you."}
{"text":"I love fish tacos but these aren't quite right compared to all the other Wahoo's I've been to. Service was good, food wasn't so great."}
{"text":"It gets a little loud at times but the rice is out of this world!  I used to live in Brazil and the rice here sends me back. Love it, love it, love it!"}
{"text":"I would suggest not going to this place. The service is terrible. We had a coupon from the radio shopping show to try this place out. They would not honor the coupon and ruined the night for everyone involved. It is a mystery why they would take the effort try to drum up business by putting out a coupon and then be so rude about not honoring it. They lost my business forever."}
{"text":"Absolute GARBAGE! This place was a total let down. The food lacked flavor and seemed like it had all been canned or frozen. Nothing seemed fresh. The service was slow and the employees appeared as though they had 10 years left of indentured servitude."}
{"text":"Great food and great service!  Victor and his staff are amazing and make everyone feel comfortable. I highly recommend eating here!"}
{"text":"The food is healthy and tastes very fresh. I usually get an original shrimp taco and an original grilled chicken taco, but anything on the menu tastes good. I come here at least twice a month and have never been disappointed with the quality of food or service. Definitely a must try!"}
{"text":"I've been searching for a good taco place for a while. It's not exactly the kind of tacos I was looking for, but it tastes great! The rice tastes amazing!"}
{"text":"Love this place from my Newport, Costa Mesa days. Always good food. Never disappoints. 
Brings a little bit of the beach here to the valley."}
{"text":"good food at a good price. I enjoy the vibe at this location, seems fun just to hang out a little while and the Pacifico's are nice and cold! could use to be cleaner, last time i was in, smelled like they used a dirty rag to clean, but all in all i enjoy this place."}
{"text":"A couple friends and I were thinking between chipotle and wahoos and we just decided on wahoos because we wanted a fresher taste (aka fish burritos!) 

Upon arrival we saw the menu and were deciding, as we got up to the front we all ended up wanting something new and different. Brianna welcomed us and suggested a really good menu item that we'd never seen before; a shredder sandwich. Two of my friends ended up getting it, one mild and one spicy. And let me say, I'm pretty jealous I didn't get it.( flavorful and it came with churro chips! UGH ) but it's okay, I was all about my burrito! (Get the burritos \"wet\", meaning enchilada style smothered with cheese and your choice or green/red sauce :) 

Also, Brianna was awesome; patient with us and offered pretty good selections. Normally the service is pretty inconsistent, so it was awesome that we got a good one up front. Thanks, Brianna!"}
{"text":"Incredible experience. Everyone was super friendly, helpful and inviting. The food was delicious and the restaurant was very well kept. It felt like being at home. Would definitely recommend to anyone for a great experience!"}
{"text":"Drove by stopped to eat. The bartender named Mailman, thought that was funny was awesome. He was very friendly and recommend the fish tacos which were amazing. I also am a gambler and enjoyed the great views on top of this hill. The service was great. It was also very noticeable how the rest of the people at his bar loved this Mailman. I am a Royal player at PTs and will definitely start coming here more."}
{"text":"Fast food with full service. Bartender Marisela checks on you constantly and has great convo. Plus she's nice on the eyes . Good food, great service, small intimate atmosphere."}
{"text":"Wow! Great place to enjoy fish tacos and a beer. As an old school skater the decor is also a nice touch, from the past to current. Awesome Job!! We will he back for sure!"}
{"text":"I was pretty stoked that a Wahoo's restaurant opened up near me. Some friends really hyped it up. Unfortunately, my order of cajun fish tacos came super late and the fish was very dry and bland. It was not an anomaly because both of my friends' fish dishes were dry as well. Did I expect too much out of this place? Not too excited about coming back and trying their other dishes. I mean, they're called Wahoo's FISH tacos. If they can't do fish right, why bother?

UPDATE: Went back and tried the carne asada beef. It was gray in color and bland. Seriously, not grilled - gray. After the meal, I had a stomach ache. Coincidence? I think not."}
{"text":"I just started coming here for lunch and I LOVE IT. The bartenders are amazing and very enthusiastic. The food is incredible. I am trying something new everyday and I have yet to be disappointed. If you need suggestions on what to get, you can always ask the bartenders. And they will go into very details on what is on the menu. The prices are very reasonable here as well . Since I will be coming here for lunch everyday. I want something that is well priced. And this place is jst that . 


TLDR; great price, great food, great service"}
{"text":"The bartenders are very good. But the food is nothing to rave about. The burritos are a bit bland and not worth the price."}
{"text":"Best veggie tacos ever!  Also love the Cajon white beans! And  the service us fantastic also!"}
{"text":"The fish tacos are okay.   The fish is a little dry, but it's masked by the condiments on top of the fish tacos.  I have to say that overall, it's better than Taco Bell for sure, but I think I'm more fond of the fish tacos from Bone Fish Grill.

The Kahuna Platter definitely is a large helping as far as lunch goes.  It's pretty good for lunch but I have to say that from a fish taco perspective, it doesn't quite hit the spot."}
{"text":"Wahoo just opened today, and I was quite surprised to be the second customer in line for this new establishment on Horizon ridge and Horizon drive

When you walk in, you feel like your cruzing into a place on the North Shore of Oahu, and the entire staff is incredibly friendly, and very professional.   As you always say, you bring out the best attitude on the first day, and the impression will stay with everyone from day one.   Great job Wahoo management team for bring this to the front line on the first day!
 
There is two section to Wahoo, the general restaurant, and the bar which has a great view of the Las vegas strip.  In fact, FOX 5 news crew does use the side of this building as a backdrop for a lot of general news segments.  Yeah, it's that great of a view of Las Vegas valley

The food is good, and has a very interesting twist with the cajun beans, and  Maui sweet onion rings are damn good.   Also,  the tacos are kind of similar to Chef Ellman's Maui Tacos, but still like the other place next door just a little bit a little more for tacos, but it 's atmosphere and employees that will win people over.  

I like the choices here, and the brown rice option is great for my family, but I'm still a white rice eating dude.    Nice restaurant Wahoo, and will be back soon."}
{"text":"We have lost all our Nor Cal Wahoo's so when we can get to one we make an effort. The soup was great the fish taco and cheese enchiladas so so. The rest of the food was spot on. Was not busy at all which is a worry. 

But otherwise a little bit of So Cal in the Vegas desert."}
{"text":"I've never been to a Wahoos before, so I didn't know what to expect. When you walk in, it's definitely has a California/Hawaiian vibe with pictures of people snowboarding, surfing, biking, etc. It's one of those places where you go up to the cashier and order, then wait at a table for your food. We were probably staring at the menu for about 5 minutes before ordering because we were a little confused at first. I kind of thought they'd just have something that said FISH TACOS, but they didn't because you pick what filling you want (chicken breast, carnitas, fish, carne asada, shrimp, tofu mushrooms, Banzai veggies). They have starters, tacos, enchiladas, combo plates, bowls, burritos, salads, sandwiches, sides, desserts, and a pretty nice drink list. In fact, one of the first things I noticed was their daily drink specials. On Wednesdays, women get a complimentary Mimosa with any purchase, so of course I brought that to their attention when we ordered our two combo plates (2 taco plate and burrito plate). 

On the way to our table, we stopped to get a fountain drink and noticed they actually had a pretty decent selection of freshly brewed iced tea (Mango, Tropical Green, and Natural Black). Our food came our pretty fast and the first thing we noticed was that the plates came with a LOT of rice. Now that I think of it, this place IS suppose to have a Mexican/Brazilian/Asian menu and I can see they executed that with the rice, tofu, tacos, enchiladas, etc. I had one grilled fish taco and one Cajun fish taco. Both had a lot of cabbage and salsa, which made them very fat. I really enjoyed the grilled one. The Cajun taco was a little over seasoned for my taste though. I hardly touched my rice because it seemed a little flavorless to me, so I stuck to the black beans. This was the first time I've ever preferred brown rice over white rice because it had more flavor (I tried some of Don's).

Overall, this is a great place for lunch or even some very late munchies since they're open 24 hours! They also have A LOT of drink specials, which is always a plus.

Tips:
-Join their player's club
-You should try their Banana margarita and tell me how it tastes
-Don't just stick to fish tacos because it's in their name. They have lots of other tasty looking menu items
-Happy hour daily 3-7pm: 1/2 off draft beer, house wines, well drinks

{"text":"We loved Wahoos in CA, so thrilled to have one here in Henderson. Good, fresh food that everyone including our picky toddler enjoys. Appreciated my free mimosa on Mother's Day. Dining room is clean, bathrooms are clean, patio is clean. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Great place to grab drink with friends. We could hang out here all night. The bartenders and really nice too. They have cheap food and it pretty good, definitely gonna come here more."}
{"text":"As a So Cal native, I was super excited to see that Wahoos came to Vegas. But we just left pretty disappointed. The service was terrible! We walked in and we were literally the only people in there. Still we waited almost 20 minutes for our food to come out. The food was ok.. One of them was supposed to have teriyaki but it was pretty bland so we asked for more sauce and we were charged for it. The whole experience was pretty lame and I doubt we'll be going back."}
{"text":"Best fish tacos ever!! Must try the citrus slaw version and the customer service is the best"}
{"text":"I had no idea this place was even here! A friend suggested it.
I ordered fish tacos, spicy with slaw. It was really tasty!
No beans or rice. Just a simple 3 taco plate, and some chips on the side. 
Only $10 bucks!- Not bad, right?

The service was really friendly and funny. 
The dining room was busy but definitely not crowded.

I would go back for sure!"}
{"text":"A more California Surfer Dude version of Rubios.  Great options for food, decent pricing.  Portions are quite large, and flavorful.  One concern I had was the black beans in my Banzai Bowl was pretty much a closed scoop where it also brought a lake of bean juice.  Made the bowl really soggy.  Still tasted good and flavorful.  Dining area is also very surfer dude style with stickers everywhere, decor displaying surfing, bmx, snowboarders.  Tables made it feel like you were looking at the used record section at Rasputin's (no two tables had the same design).  Overall a pleasant experience.  Will have to come back and try other options.

Bonus:  checking in gets you a free chips and salsa with the purchase of 2 full entrees and 2 drinks."}
{"text":"Fun... Fast... Fairly Healthy (depending on what you order)

Went to the location in Boca Park in Summerlin.

I'm SoCA transplant so I really like the Wahoo's locations down at or near the beach.  They just seem to have better flair and flavor.

I'll still go to Wahoo's in Vegas... but I long for the Wahoo's of SoCA.

The Summerlin location has a small patio area so when it's nice outside you can get some Vitamin D.  However the patio is like sitting in the parking lot.  They also have a bar area so you can sit and have a beer at the bar while enjoying your fish tacos.

My \"go to\" dishes at Wahoo's is always the fish tacos or the fish plate. IMO... this last Friday I ordered the Fish Plate... Grilled with White Rice and Black Beans.  The fish was dry... the rice was dry and flavorless... the black beans were ok.  

The salsa and guac were fresh and very good.

NET, NET.... I'll frequent Wahoo's because I keep hoping it'll be as good as the ones in SoCA..."}
{"text":"I will never be returning.

The people are what made this establishment great-  it seems like the ownership has lost all of their great staff.

In my first review I could not stress how great The staff were..  After the loss of Ian and Gus., this is now a one star star establishment.

I will never return... the food is mediocre at best."}
{"text":"Pretty good! They are Cali/Baja blend with fresh food. Everything tasted fresh and the service was great - very friendly. I liked the selection they had. The veggie teriyaki was fantastic! I definitely recommend them."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great food, great service & a management team that cares! Matt & Sophie greeted me and were very friendly. They truly wanted to ensure I had everything that I needed, and I did. I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who is looking for a fun and clean place to eat!"}
{"text":"A hidden gem! First time there and I loved it. Food was delicious and staff was awesome. Nice, quiet which was perfect for us since we took our twins."}
{"text":"I actually really like it here. We have gone a couple of times for the Sunday breakfast deals. You can get mimosas for an hour and a really nice carnitas meal with a tortilla and fries for $5.00!!! The service is good not great but, well worth the visit.

Will be back!!!"}
{"text":"First off,I've been going to Wahoos for 25 years,started in Laguna Beach,and Lake Forest,and Laguna Hills,and mostly never had a problem.But Mann,this location on Sunset in Las Vegas is just wrong.1) I always order 1988 style fish tacos,and everytime it's citrus slaw.Like either the owner\ manager doesn't know the difference,and trains the cooks wrong,or the cooks are just lazy.I'm not kidding when I say the 30 or so times I've been there,they've messed up my order probably 25 times.Forgets to put dressing when you order Wahoos salad,doesn't include salsa with your tacos ,and when you say please don't forget pico they charge you for it.2) they never season the black beans,like plain beans are the worst,note to owner \manager,don't be cheap on the seasoning and skimp on the beans.3) always different people there,like every 2_or 3 weeks ,I don't think most of the workers there have ever been or eaten at a Wahoos.And the cooks haven't either.C'mon Mann, learn the difference between citrus slaw and 1988 original style.Put a bay leaf or two in the beans,it's not hard.I really don't know why I go back.I guess I just keep hoping"}
{"text":"Yay! I guess third time is a charm. Haven't had good luck with service here in the past.  This time the food was fantastic and Jami at the bar was friendly and even asked how my day was going.  Just wish the other bartenders were as friendly!"}
{"text":"This place is dirty. Came here with my sister and my friend who are from out of state. Bar looked like it hadn't been wiped down the menus were also dirty. The bartender messed up our bill. We paid half with credit card and half with cash. She over charged the credit card so she could keep the cash, after disputing it with the manager he said he'd charge the right amount on the card and said that it would even it out? HELLO how would that even out? Why is it okay for your employee to steal our cash when we wanted two forms of payment? Why are you still charging us? You should have refunded the card back and fired your employee. Also your bartender was taking shots with other customers couldn't even refill a drink."}
{"text":"This is one of my fav spots! All the staff is friendly and I always get great service.. Prices are really reasonable so I don't quite understand the person who said it was expensive. I also think Tammy is awesome. This is the second place I have been where she worked and have always had a great experience with her! 
The burning roll is awesome!"}
{"text":"Wahoo's is pretty decent.  Their service is top notch but I feel their fish taco's can use a little more kick -- perhaps a little acidity and spice to the fish.

Their mild green sauce is pretty good but I really enjoyed Mista Ree's sauce the best.  It tastes like the main ingredient is Korean hot chili paste.  The cajun and grilled fish is pretty mild, so I would smother the sauce all over the taco's.

The taco platters are huge.  You get a big heaping serving of rice and black beans.  Seriously, you can probably share the meal with a friend.

Their chicken tortilla soup was also very tasty - very homey with a little bit of heat.

Overall, Wahoos serves fresh ingredients and huge portions of food for extremely reasonable prices.  I just think the taco's could use a little more to kick it up a notch."}
{"text":"Need to watch some football, grab a beer and get chips and salsa... Wahoo is your place. Want to enjoy some delicious tacos, beans and rice...not so much. Lemon Drop Martini, how can you not know how to make one... YUCK! Big pieces of tasteless chicken tacos, beef tacos were inedible, again big pieces that were chewy and plain gross. Pork was OK but somewhat tasteless and fish taco just ok! This place has a lot going for it but poor bar-tending, OK service and sub-par food make it it somewhere I will not go back to...Pick Jasons Deli next door or head to Kona grill..and with Gordon B and Cheesecake F in the same complex they better step it up or step out! Don't expect to enjoy a beer here next summer...just my opinion!"}
{"text":"When we went the service was slow and food was forgotten.  We found out later that one of the employee's quit and the manager didn't wouldn't answer the phone so he could be nofited that the establishment was understaffed. The shrimp taco's were the only thing that were tasty.  The fish tacos were bland and dry."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! It's hard to find fresh food in Vegas let alone seafood. I ordered the Paleo Bowl and the Reef carnitas burrito. Food was both delicious and fulfilling!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times. Foods and flavors are good. Today I asked for only banzai bowl with fish and veggies. Had to restart order and got a layer of rice, which I didn't want. In checking my receipt it only said no beans.  The veggies had teriyaki sauce, which I do not like at all. The menu board was new since last time and had no info on teriyaki sauce, so I didn't think about it. Ate the fish and veggies having to pick thru the rice to find it, was hungry. The server/cashier came over and asked how it was. I explained to her I can't stand teriyaki, I told her I'd rather drink battery acid, just to sweet for me. She told me that the banzai vegetables come with teriyaki. As I'd eaten many times before I'm normally fairly specific on my food prep. I'll take the blame on the teriyaki. The server/cashier offered to get something else for me. I said no my fault for not being more specific. Near the bathroom and throughout the restaurant sewer gas odor. I remember that smell from my last visit several months ago."}
{"text":"Food was good, but could have had more seasonings. Quick service, drinks looks amazing (couldn't have any was on lunch), staff was very polite. The cajun fries were delicious along with the spicy ketchup"}
{"text":"I am an old school Vegas guy when it comes to service in this town. This place has only been open for a couple weeks and all I can say is wow! I've witnessed the owner and GM personally go to each customer to see how everything was going. I've seen this on ALL of the four times I have visited. The hardest things to convey to a service staff is to anticipate guests needs and recover from mistakes. They have obviously done a great job of that. Kudos!

I love the Cajun style fish and shrimp tacos. Really fresh on perfectly soft, corn tacos. BTW, their happy hour is pretty freakin awesome to take advantage on their indoor-outdoor patio. Way more of a bargain and laid back atmosphere than Kona Grill --in the same lot. I just hope the Lambo-driving, Affliction/True Religion wearing-Summerlin douche bags- that scare away all the cute girls away, don't ruin my new favorite spot."}
{"text":"Wahoo's Fish Tacos has been bookmarked for who knows how long! My friends and I really were craving some seafood and also tacos so what else better time to get both at the same time?! After so much time of procrastinating I made my way on down and I'm surely glad I did.

On a late Saturday afternoon, I was expecting there to be a bit of a wait and to my surprise it was actually pretty dead. Now... in normal circumstances this isn't a good indication because one could assume that the place doesn't have good food or they don't have good service but there are always exceptions! Wahoo's is one of them. In fact they have just the opposite of both. Great food and great service!

The set up on how you are helped is not the standard but it works for them. You know the walk in and a server seats you whole thing? Yeah.. No here you walk in order at the counter pay at the counter and then they bring your food out to you. I always wonder what is the reasoning of some food places who do this but hey if it works for them it works. 

The menu is extensive and I found myself a bit overwhelmed with what to actually order and not even that but what option to order it in. For example.. If you order the fish burrito like I did you have about 3-4 different styles it can be made. People like me struggle with menus who provide too many options because the inner fat boy wants ALL the options.. The cashier who also was our server helped me out and I decided on ordering my Salmon burrito \"Mr. Lee's SCReaM'n style\" awesome suggestion because I loved every last bite. Only thing that kept them from getting that 5th star was the margaritas weren't good.. Other than that I will be back soon to tackle some more of what they have to offer very soon!"}
{"text":"When I first walked in it seemed like a clean, decent place. The menu doesn't state that brown rice is extra compared to white. Nick was walking around talking on his cellphone the whole time even while serving us our food. The waitresses need to wear longer shorts. They were disgustingly short. I don't want to look at another girls butt cheeks while eating my lunch. The food was okay, would probably only come back for the Kahlua pork. But other than that, I will probably not visit again."}
{"text":"Love me some wahoo's! 
Open 24 hours is awesome and the bar is super chill. 
 
Staff is always helpful and very friendly."}
{"text":"This place is just as freaking delicious as I remember haven't been here in awhile. Service is outstanding and it's squeaky clean! Delicious healthy food!!"}
{"text":"I recently went to this location and ordered the chicken rice bowl. Later that night I started to feel not so good. This was the only thing I had eaten that day so I know food poisoning when it happens. I spoke to a friend of mine who had chicken tacos and he also told he had gotten food poisoning also. I would say stay clear from the chicken !!"}
{"text":"I am giving this two star review based solely on the poor service we received here on Monday July 6th.  We are regulars of Wahoos and I wanted Paul to know that this is the kind of poor service that is being given here when Victor is not around.  From the beginning when we were placing our order, the cashier seemed indifferent and wasn't personable at all like Wahoos employees normally are.  Shortly after, the same girl brought our chips and salsa.  My Dad clearly asked for two pico salsas and some Cholula hot sauce.  The girl came back with one pico salsa and an empty bottle of Cholula.  When I approached her and asked for another bottle that actually had some in it she gave an attitude.  Shortly after, she dropped the empty bottle and it shattered all over the floor.  Another girl that worked there finally brought a second pico salsa after asking again for it.  The food was served by this other girl as well who seemed to have talked to the other girl as she also had a bit of an attitude and the food was served lukewarm.  Really ruined the whole experience so much that my Dad who loves Wahoos said he probably won't go back to this location as this has happened once before to him at the same spot.  My wife and I have experienced the same problems here but it had improved greatly since Victor was brought in to this location to get it squared away.  Every time we eat here and Victor is working, it is nothing but a positive experience.  I wish I could give the girls name who had such an attitude and gave such poor service but of course she wasn't wearing a name tag (imagine that).  I can say that she had blonde hair and wore a low cut t shirt and short shorts and worked on July 6th.  Have to give a big thumbs down to her and her poor attitude and say that I will be hesitant to go back here unless I know Victor is working!  Need to clean house on some of these employees that want to just show up and get their paycheck without any care for the customer experience!!!"}
{"text":"Ben was absolutely a pleasure to work with today.  He was very kind and exactly what makes a visit to Wahoos a positive experience.  Keep up the good work!  Food was good as always"}
{"text":"Our family's favorite place to eat in Henderson! It's very close to home so we were excited when they came to Henderson and for the last couple of years they continue to impress us!! Love the fish tacos totally cool atmosphere and really friendly staff!! Love to take the kids here for a fun fresh family dinner!! Also enjoy the amazing view from the bar with the hubby for a nice night out without the kiddos!!  Price is nice and we all enjoy!!"}
{"text":"If you're coming for lunch you need to be here between 11-1130 or you'll be waiting in line. Every time I've come here I try something different and every time I leave satisfied and happy. Great portions and my bills have all been under $10. The owner is always walking around and chatting it up. Good business practice. 
Food= good
Service= great
Price= awesome
The sauces are really great too!"}
{"text":"Looking for a alternative and unique taste but good to what's all around, this is the place. Customer service is good and all the food options we have tried have been good!"}
{"text":"Good spot for a quick lunch or if you are a true fan.  Came here with some work buddies for a bite.  No complaints and quick service.

I got the Wahoos salad with their fish.  Love it.  Fresh and simple.  

Personal aside, the music here is great.  Chill atmosphere for sure."}
{"text":"So I had been wanting to try this place for awhile. I received a buy one get one free offer so I figured might as well. I really wanted to like this place but I wasn't a fan...neither was my husband. The salsa had like chilli powder or something in it? Not sure. But it was not good. I had the Baja Ladas and my husband had the enchiladas. They seemed very bland. And the beans oh goodness with the chili powder flavor...Based on the reviews though it seems like people really like this place. It may have just been us... I do have to say though I would like to try something else from here one more time just to be certain."}
{"text":"Ridiculously long wait (around 35-40 minutes)  when they were not even that busy. They didn't tell us there would be such a long wait and they served people that came in after us before us. Chicken was cold and food was mediocre at best. My first and last time here."}
{"text":"I'm a regular here with my girlfriend at least a few times per month. I like original fish tacos and she usually orders the skinny tacos which are wrapped in lettuce instead of a corn tortilla. I think they only have 110 calories each or something. The service is always great! When we sit in the dine in side Rosie is usually working. She is so nice and sweet and very patient when we have trouble making up if we want tacos or something different. Sometimes at night Andrew works and he is very nice and helpful and offers great service. We've visited serval times after midnight and the bartender Brian is very friendly and offers great service. He try's to up sale the drinks or Dessert but you expect that from any good server/bartender. They are always quick to refill your drinks or take your plates away once you are done..  I am from the Northwest which has great service and I get the same kind of service when I visit here."}
{"text":"I decided to give this place another chance. Came here two more times (live out of state now) and each time my food was made right  

I got the fish taco and it was made right. Taco was delicious. The next time I came I got the Maui bowl with steak and brown rice and no beans. I think I found my new favorite dish here. The portion size was decent and the bowl was delicious. The meat had like a teriyaki glaze on it. Not what I expected but still delicious."}
{"text":"Just when I was going to review how long I had to wait to get my food, they finally brought it. I had a fish taco and Mr. Lee's Screaming Chicken Burrito. Both were very good. The burrito had a savory sautéed mushroom thing going on, and the fish in the taco was not fried. Frankly it ended up being too much food. The al a carte taco was under four bucks and the burrito was eight something... and it was pretty long. The music selections were terrible, but the food was good. I'd definitely get that taco again."}
{"text":"Love going in to see Tammy and Bob....they never disappoint. They truly care about their customers and it shows!!! The food is an added bonus to the amazing beers they have on tap."}
{"text":"GREAT PLACE FOR TACO'S!!, 
Reasonably priced for fresh, made to order food. Fish taco's a must, than the beef carnitas, great flavor, loaded with fresh cabbage, also great pico de gallo salsa.
also cheese enchilada very favorable.
Employees are very nice, mgr. Steve very customer service oriented.
Overall, a great and economical stop with fresh food, including brown rice and tofu!!
Highly recommend for a quick lunch or dinner!!!"}
{"text":"I used to come here often...both with the kids for food and also with the guys for drinks at the bar.  Tough to beat $2 Pacificos all night long.  

We visited last Friday night for dinner at around 7pm and the restaurant was empty.  I believe there was one other table of diners and about 7-8 rowdy drinkers at the bar.  One of the reasons we stopped coming to the bar was they attract a rough crowd.  Tattoos, smoking pot in the parking lot... Not passing judgment... Just not my scene.  

So tonight we order and sit at our table.  They had one guy working the cashier.  A young guy with black spiky hair.  The same guy was also delivering food to the tables.  Even though the restaurant was empty, he provided such poor service we'll never return to a Vegas Wahoos again.  We'll just wait until we go to Huntington Beach where they do it right.  

When he delivered the first portion of our food, I asked him for the green sauce.  He gave me a look as if I was being a pain, but he returned with the sauce.  When he returned with the rest of our order, my son asked for a knife.  He literally rolled his eyes and went straight to the bathroom.  

Now I know it's annoying when guests asked for things...especially when they don't ask for them at the same time, but our whole table was shocked at his response.  We looked at each other and waited to see whether he was going to come back.  Finally my 12 year old son got up and went behind the kitchen area to get his own knife!!!   Hahaha.  Unbelievable.

When the guy returned from the bathroom, I figured he would deliver the knife.   Nope...he stood in front of the TV and watched sports!!!  Check out the photo!!!  

The founder of Wahoo's was here at the grand opening.  He should reconsider his choice for area developer.  They know nothing about customer service."}
{"text":"This place is OK.  I came here with my wife late one night and it seemed like an average joint.  I've heard Wahoo's talked up so much, I was actually a bit disappointed.

I'll give them the fact that it was getting late in the night, but the girl who was cleaning and taking our orders at the same time seemed a little annoyed that we were here to eat.

The food was OK as well.  I wasn't impressed with the chicken breast tacos (got one grilled and one Cajun).  It is hard to compare to the awesomeness of a Roberto's Chicken Taco.

The rice and beans were OK as well.  Nothing to write home about.

It was rather loud and the fact that it has a bar in the restaurant made for some unneeded distractions when trying to sit down and have a meal.  I wouldn't take my kids here, that's for sure.

If you haven't been here yourself, go ahead and give it a try.  Otherwise, I would suggest going to a Roberto's for some Mexican food."}
{"text":"It was good, a step up from Rubios. It's still a fast food restaurant, and for some reason people expect more. I wasn't disappointed. I recommend the \"Bajaladas\" that's what I ordered. 

Chill out people!"}
{"text":"Wahoo!  They have a location in Vegas!!  I used to be a regular in various locations around SoCal... so when a friend mentioned this place recently opening up... I had to pay this place a visit.  Unfortunately it's location is a bit obscure... you wouldn't really run into it randomly unless you live in the area.  Google it and try it out.

I like the fish tacos and the maui bowl... but mix it up and find your favorites, there's plenty to choose from.  If you can't decide, let the bartender or server order for you :)  

They've got video poker machines at the bar as well as Thirsty Thursdays! (1/2 off draft beers...Sam Adams please.  Always a good choice...)"}
{"text":"I love the food at Wahoos and appreciate that they have a wide variety of options including Paleo, vegan, gluten free, etc. However - this location SUCKS. I came in for a takeout order and literally sat there waiting for over 30 minutes. Then I just got home and my order was wrong and they forgot the chips and guacamole I spent extra money on. What a huge disappointment especially after waiting so long for the food. You guys need to pull it together. This is totally unacceptable."}
{"text":"Wahoos is always tasty! I love that they calorie label their meals and typically they are very healthy and taste good too!!!! The atmosphere is small and quiet which is awesome after a long day at work!"}
{"text":"Perfect atmosphere today. Love when they open the wall and let the air in. Great food. Wahoo bowl with grilled fish, brown rice, fresh jalapeño and black beans."}
{"text":"Discovered Wahoo's in Laguna Beach. Thrilled to see locations back home here in Vegas. No locations nearby where I live on the east side of town, but so worth the drive over to the west side! My favs: Quesadilla with spicy fish, onion rings, and citrus slaw tacos (that citrus slaw is DELISH!) Great bar + fire pit outside too!"}
{"text":"Cheap food and great at late night after wondering about! Best fish tacos in the world!!"}
{"text":"The best fish tacos ever!! They are also crazy cheap. If you have never had their tacos you have never lived! Came here during happy hour. Perfect place for a inexpensive date night and great food!"}
{"text":"Been by a few times since I heard they have vegan tacos. They're great. They have a small but decent craft beer lineup I like, too. Their outdoor patio and music and decor remind me of when I was a kid in OC hanging out at Wahoo's (minus the gaming of course). Cesar is a great manager who always makes sure I'm being taken care of, and Brian the bar tender (manager?) is also very entertaining and attentive. Nice spot to burn a sleepy afternoon."}
{"text":"Food was great....the green sauce is a must!!! I recommend the shrimp burrito."}
{"text":"really enjoy wahoos every time and really like the rewards program! I woul write a 5 star just last few times the place stinks really bad I hope they will be fixing this soon."}
{"text":"Came here for quick bite before work, I see a lot of reviews talk about dry fish... It's not the fish that its dry, it's the cold white disk (tortilla) that they serve it on that makes it taste dry and hard to eat. I would only come back to this location for HH."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh!!!!!

Had the best time.   Great good. Great service!!!  Paleo bowl rocked!!!   Mailman and Stewie both tool fantastic care of us!  

We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I really like the food here but the very first thing that greets you when you walk through the front door is a wafting stench of cigarette smell coming from the bar!!!
I can't stand that smell and it's doubly frustrating because there's a DOOR they can close to keep that smell contained.
If they had a drive thru it would be the way I would use Wahoos. 
4.5 star food but the smell knocks overall rating to 2star review.
I wish mgt would do something to fix this issue."}
{"text":"Run as fast as you can this place sucks I played 60.00at the machine and got 1 drink for it. Then I was told that I did not play that much and actually the\"mailman\" gave me an attitude about it I don't know who they think they are but this is definitely not a local bar to make locals comfortable Heather the bartender is no better always has an attitude I do like to play and they never compensate for it unless they \"know you\" so for 1drink that cost me 60.00 never again  so beware"}
{"text":"Great menu with healthy options. Very helpful and attentive staff members who seem to be happy with their job. Well definitely return."}
{"text":"Was in the area and found this restaurant on yelp . Looked at the menu and everything sounded so good so I said why not . Jamie helped us out and was wonderful . Explained the menu very well and was very patient. Definitely will be coming back here . I recommend the burritos and the street tacos . Check out there happy hour as well .! Very clean and nice environment with a lot of space in a nice shopping plaza."}
{"text":"I wasn't going to write a review, but a Yelp notification told me to, so here we are. I have been a faithful Wahoo's fan ever since I used to frequent their Laguna Beach location as a teenager 20 years ago. It was probably my favorite restaurant at the time. Unfortunately, their Sunset/Rainbow location is very hit and miss. The food is often just average and the service is not great. My wife and kids were there the other night and waited 30 minutes for 2 quesadillas and a Kalua Pig Bowl. The place was empty so I'm not sure what took so long. Kind of disappointing. While I still hit the Laguna Beach location whenever I'm down there, I tend to avoid the one at Rainbow/Sunset."}
{"text":"I will say I have never dined in, i always get it delivered via uber Eats, but I seriously love the food. And I can get it 24/7. Prices are great, and I can live off the tortilla soup,beans and rice. I can tell it's fresh and I value that a lot. A lot of great vegetarian options! Love love love"}
{"text":"Fish tacos are good, but nothing exciting. First few bites of the Maui bowl was ok then the rest of the meat was very tough. Seems it's a place to hang out and have a beer at the bar. The view at night is nice from the bar, but the food is not all that. The place is missing something, it's trying, but it's missing...."}
{"text":"Wahoooooo! It's taco time! Love this place. Sitting outside sunny and sipping n cold drinks while eating tease taco's life doesn't get much better. Oh yes it does if you're eating taco's with me at Wahoo! #DawnofSexX"}
{"text":"Was so excited to see a new eatery open nearby. Have been here twice- both times it took awhile to get to the front of the line to order & both times our food came 30 minutes after ordering. The food was decent- chips & salsa were kind of disappointing. Spicy chicken enchiladas with spicy green sauce were delicious & my husband's burrito could feed 2. Portions were huge! Had to flag down cocktail server to order $2 ice cold beers- love that! I really want this place to do well- get an additional cocktail server & deliver the food a little faster & things would be greatly improved. Wish you could just order bottled beer @ the register! I could see this place doing great if they can work out a few kinks."}
{"text":"Amazing Tacos! I love looking at all the stickers on the walls and the music is always fun and uplifting :)"}
{"text":"This is a Wanna be Mexican restaurant. Horrible food. I don't recommend this place for food. If you want to catch the game and a beer that's a great place just don't eat there."}
{"text":"Wasn't wowed by the food at Wahoo's. After having dined here on different occasions, all that I've had were bland and dry fish entrees and a mundane salad.

FOOD
- Combo Platter - 2 fish tacos and a bowl of Cajun White beans (no rice): The portions are large, and I was glad I didn't order this combo with rice (you get a choice of white or brown rice). The beans were floating around in too much liquid. Also, I just didn't like the taste. I ordered one Cajun taco and one grilled. The tortillas and fish for both tacos were dry, not flavorful. 

- Wahoo's Fish Bowl: I went with the grilled fish option, though there are Cajun and teriyaki choices. The \"bowl\" comes with a choice of rice (white or brown) and a side of shredded lettuce and diced tomatoes. Again, my meal was bland and dry. The popular \"Mr. Lee's\" sauce didn't do much with improving the flavor (not spicy enough for my taste anyway). 

- Wahoo Salad (shrimp): It's an enormous salad, but basic. Topped with cheese, salsa, guacamole, and whatever kind of fillings you want to include. The salad was the best entree I ever ordered at this Wahoo's, but it was still just average. 

SERVICE
If I had to choose one aspect I like about this restaurant, it's the service. Service has always been good at this location.  When one of the cashiers forgot to apply a discount to my order, he gave me a coupon for a free taco for my next visit, which is worth more than the discount. There's also a kind and helpful waitress who's always served myself and dining companions with a smile. Unfortunately, I don't remember her name at the moment. 

OVERALL
Not coming back."}
{"text":"The Kahuna Grande (emphasis on GRANDE) will now be my order whenever I visit a Wahoo's. With the choice of beans, taco, taquitos, and rice, it's perfect for sharing. Speaking of rice, I love how there's a brown rice option. 

Compared to the southwest location, the food is a little better. No dryness and blandness at all. On the other hand, I'm still not a big fan of their grilled fish tacos that might as well be called \"cabbage tacos.\"

Service at the front counter was a turn off. The lady managing the registers seemed distracted, and one staff member was trying to slyly sip on her Starbucks frap in front of us. On the other hand, other staff members we spoke to were helpful and had better attitudes.  

For decent, healthy-ish food on a budget Wahoo's is the way to go, but service does need a bit of improvement."}
{"text":"Was not really into it at all... I was really disappointed. I ordered the shrimp tacos and an order of nachos... The shrimp was bleh! And the nachos even more bleh! Wont be coming here again."}
{"text":"Best fish taco in town. Good service as always. The price is great. Fast service and exceptional staff."}
{"text":"Place is not friendly. We felt like outsiders and they did not comp us hardly anything after playing 300 plus in the machines."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with my last meal at this LV Wahoo... I have been a big fan of Wahoo for several years and frequent the restaurants in LA, Newport and Encinitas... This Wahoo does not maintain the standards set in SoCal... Its standards have been slipping since it opened... Their salsa is not fresh (looks like it came out of a jar)... The fish is dry... They skimp on rice and beans... Their tofu is mushy and has no flavor or texture... They charge $2 for two corn tortillas (in CA you get three for 99c)... I think they are more concerned with the bar... Selling alcohol to folks who bang away on the poker machines... Its not the cool California taco shack I love... Hate to say it but I won't be going back"}
{"text":"My husband and I are regulars on Friday nights after work.  He always gets the wings and I usually try something different each time.  I've had just about everything on the Bar Bites menu now and the only thing that disappointed were the taquitos. My favorites are the pork carnitas tostados. Joey the bartender is fantastic. Always takes care of us to the point of starting our drinks the moment we walk in. Super great service and fun atmosphere. Wouldn't go anywhere else for our late night drink and snack."}
{"text":"ALASKAN FLOUNDER TACOS IS WHERE IT'S AT! 

Wahoo's has always had good quality food. Maybe a bit on the blander side depending on your taste, but their combination of flavors is usually something to get excited about. 

I recently discovered their Alaskan Flounder Tacos, and WOW! These might be some of the greatest fish tacos I've ever had! Crispy, seasoned, Alaskan flounder layered with crunchy, citrusy, vineragy slaw, and a bit of cheese to finish it off. I usually ask them to go easy on the slaw because they can be heavy-handed, but if you like that, then go for it! 

I've been venturing to Wahoo's at least once a week for these tacos, because they're only a limited time offering! I'd suggest you visit too so you don't miss out!"}
{"text":"This is a great spot to have a casual meal.  The place is big and almost has a sports bar feel.  The food is good but I think a little expensive for what you get. They have Cajun beans and black beans only.  The Cajun beans really taste Cajun so if you don't like that taste then don't get the beans.  The onion rings are five star"}
{"text":"I drove by many times thinking they only had fish tacos...I was wrong!  Delish Mr Lee Burrito!!!!  Great flavor by itself! The owner cane to our table to greet us and check on the meal.  I was simply amazed with the flavor of the foods!"}
{"text":"Devyn recommended the monthly special for the Fast Break Burrito that comes with chips, salsa, and a drink. I went with her recommendation and ordered mine with the blacken chicken. It had their amazing green sauce inside. I absolutely loved the food. Everything was so fresh and came out super fast! Devyn was very efficient and had excellent customer service. I can't wait to bring my family here and try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"I had a Cajun fish taco, white rice, and Cajun beans. This was the most bland fish taco I have ever had. Stick to Rubio's."}
{"text":"Came her with a friend who really likes this place. I was hesitant as I saw on 3.5 star review on Yelp* and I like only 4 star. I must admit though, I am a fan! I think it's a SOLID 3.5, but I'll give the extra .5 point because I enjoyed my taco alot.
I wasn't super crazy about the maui onion rings. I LOVED that they offered them, but they were too greasy for me. I know, I know, it's OR (as I call them), of course they are greasy. NO, not always! Anyway, got the grilled fish taco with the Basi? teriyaki veggies. Very very good. Wish I got 2 taco's and no OR. My friend got the platter with rice and beans and that looked fabu. I will definitely try that next time. I liked that they use green leaf lettuce instead of ice berg for my taco. The veggies were tasty, I enjoyed very much. It's a cool atmosphere place. Lots of surf stuff and eclectic decorations. It's a combo, fast foodish but casual dining place. You order your food at the counter and they bring it to you when it's done. I'd love to go to the one on the beach in CA for the real deal experience. Overall, good food, good price and good service. No complaints here!"}
{"text":"I am right in the middle about this place.  I really liked the atmosphere, even though it was really hot because of the position of the sun about 5pm.  The bartenders are friendly and great with their service.  But my husband and I didn't really like the food.  Their chicken quesidilla was good (hard to mess up) and the bean burritos were good (another hard thing to mess up).  But the carne asada was some of the worst meat I've ever had!  The meat was tough and had no flavor.  The grilled fish tacos were OK....not spectacular like I expected from a place that is known for their fish tacos.
Happy hour is from 3-7 and they have specials on beer and appetizers.  It's definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"So.... I was very excited to eat at this place, I have only heard great things in other markets.  On a Saturday, the family and I were looking for a place to get some good food and watch some college football.  We walk in, and you order from the counter, not what I expected but I proceed. I order the fish taco plate, that's why I am here.  My husband orders the '3 Minute Burrito', and my kids order nachos, a steak taco and a fish taco.  $45 later, we get our number and take a seat.  We wait, and wait and wait for 28 minutes!!!  I get up to look for a manager or someone to assist me to get my food.  The runner speaks no English, neither does the kitchen staff.  Food finally arrives at the table.  It is only the 3 minute burrito, taking only 31 minutes. Then they bring the kids' plates.  The sides were wrong, the nachos looked like something I make in the microwave at home.  Not thrilled with the flavor profile of the fish taco, I have had better tacos at Rubios... (way better..) and for the service, price and cleanliness of the restaurant, I will not be going back.  People and businesses make mistakes all the time, but the lack of management, lack of knowledge of communication and the sheer expense with little to no ROI leaves me cold.  I don't mind spending the money if I am getting what I pay for.  Not the case here.  I hope this is not the rule with this place, but I will never know, I am not going back."}
{"text":"I've been regularly coming to this Wahoos for the last year to grab drinks, tacos, and have some fun. Still out of all the places to go on this side of town, Wahoos is still my spot. Thanks to the great rotation of bartenders of Fluddy, Marisela and Isaac, it's always a good time with them. 

One thing that is super important to me about this place is that it's a smoke free bar. I've always hated leaving other places smelling like smoke. The crowd here is always fun, no rowdy college kids, nothing but fun people. 

Naturally this is a go to spot for me because I'll never turn down tacos. But the best sports games are always on, all the bartenders I always deal with are awesome. Always fun, attentive, and super friendly. Thank you Fluddy, Marisela and Isaac for continuing to make this place so much fun. I'll be a customer for life as long as these three are here!"}
{"text":"we stumbled on this place one night after church, YUM, the slaw fish tacos are soooo good and the citrus sauce on them is so fresh and tasty.  The price is just right too, you can have many!
My mom ordered the cheese enchilada, not so good, the sauce left much to be desired, I tasted it, not a fan at all.
The guy that took our order was super friendly and it was nice to see he was enthused about the food too.  The place was empty so we were skeptical going in, now it will be a favorite place.  I just hope it's consistent! I wouldve given higher rating except that enchilada kinda not so good."}
{"text":"Great food, but i checked in for my free chips and salsa,  but got hosed cause they ran out....damn!"}
{"text":"This place is the bee's knees all cause of Brian the bartender.  It takes a lot for me to give a rat's a** about a bar but Brian has it all figured out.   He knows which machine to send me to when I'm needing a little help and also what food I'm craving when I'm too illiterate to decipher the menu when all I can think about is poker.   Carne asada burrito ftw!"}
{"text":"I keep going back, hoping that the staff will eventually start to feel at home and begin to provide some level of service. Sadly, it has not been the case, which is the inspiration behind this downgraded rating. 

To be sure, the food is still good, the atmosphere is still great and the crowd is still eclectic - but the service is actually getting worse.

This place is far too small to have to wait forever to be refilled or simply even recognized, especially if you are sitting right there in front of the bartenders. Sometimes it actually feels as though they are purposefully trying to avoid eye contact. 

Hey management - this is Vegas, we got hundreds of bartenders looking for work, it shouldn't be hard to find ONE."}
{"text":"This is a fun chain that sprung up in Summerlin, in the outdoor shopping mall area known as \"Boca Park.\" It takes you to a beachside in Baja or California to sit in this eccentrically, beachy decorated casual dining spot. The restaurant is spacious and clean, and the servers are efficient and not unkind. The food is fine. It's not going to blow you away, but it's diverse, satisfying, and served in a fun environment. And if you like watching sports on TV while you eat, or alcoholic beverages, you are in the right place!"}
{"text":"Best time to go is at 3pm. Quite, good food! Try the Cajun beans and brown rice......and salmon bowl....mmm"}
{"text":"The food is really good and is reasonably priced. I've come to this location a couple of times and the staff has always been nice and very friendly. I had a couple of instances where there was a delay in getting my phone order food on time. However, one of the representatives there named Matt took care of these concerns in a very professional manner; I'll definitely continue coming here in the future."}
{"text":"Very quality food. Fast and good service. Always on top of things and making sure you feel welcomed and satisfied!"}
{"text":"Good and fresh food! Service is usually good. I received the wrong item and made girl mad  
Felt like I bothered her. They did make the correction. 
Always good food here. Good prices"}
{"text":"Plenty of seating available, service was good, food was decent, but portion to cost was a little on the high end. I got a Spicy Chicken California Burrito w/ a Drink, combo, for $11 and I just thought it was a little underwhelming."}
{"text":"We were looking for someplace to eat while on our way for a day of site seeing whole visiting Las Vegas.  Hubs wanted something quick and easy. We found this place and figured why not. We ordered our food, and sat down to wait. Wait we did...after everyone was served (not more than 20 people at lunchtime) and 40 mins later, still no food. I asked a server to check on our order. A few minutes later we were given an extra side of chips, guac and salsa, along with free taco tickets and scratchers of some kind and told that our order was being put on a rush because they had no idea what happened to our order.  Ok thank you for stepping up and giving us the coupons, etc, we appreciated that. Probably will never go back here again. Ended up giving the coupons away since we live no where near this location."}
{"text":"Stopped in after a nice MTB ride at Bootleg Canyon and couldn't have been happier with my choice. I hit Wahoos in SoCal, many different locations, but this was one of the best burritos I have ever had. If you are looking for something healthy and delicious I strongly recommend stop in here and have the banzai  burrito with spicy chicken, white rice, and black beans."}
{"text":"Delicious, fresh, economical and enjoyable atmosphere. We really enjoyed the Bonzai burrito , the flavor was really amazing. We also used our Yelp check in and got a premium IPA beer. Service with a smile and no one rushed us out!"}
{"text":"Excellent food! I work close by so Wahoo's Fish Taco in Boca Park become my almost  everyday healthy lunch destination. Nice environment and friendly staff. Definitely recommending!"}
{"text":"We sat down and waited for someone to help us but the waitress just ignored us. Didn't say a word, just walked by and ignored us for 20 minutes. Not sure if the lady was having a bad day or naturaly a bitch."}
{"text":"I love the nachos. I ordered them with cajun shrimp and it was awesome! I've also had the California Burrito which was pretty good. My husband ordered the fish tacos and they have a really good sized piece of fish on them. I just wish we lived closer!"}
{"text":"I've heard many great things about Wahoo's Fish Tacos but I wasn't really impressed. It's an average place. The main reason I gave it only three stars is because of the staff. The young guy at the counter didn't know much about the food. I don't blame him. He might have been new and haven't had proper training. It's set up like a normal sit down restaurant but you order and pay for your food up front. But the people didn't check on us after bring us our food."}
{"text":"** update:  Received a message from management and I was really happy to see that they were committed to getting it right."}
{"text":"A nice slice of coastal goodness that reminds me of my hometown San Diego...except it's in a parking lot in Boca Park!

The food is tasty, but the menu is a little overwhelming.  The first time I went, I was like, \"Where are just fish tacos?\"  Apparently, you pick your vehicle (taco, burrito, etc.), then you choose your innards (fish, chicken, tofu (!), mushrooms (!), etc), then you choose your rice (brown rice option (!)) and beans.  The fish tacos were a little dry and I would have liked more sauce.  I also got some sort of tofu bowl that I don't remember the name of, and it was goooood.  I prefer the Cajun white beans to the black beans (great flavor), but the rice lacks something (read: flavor).

They have a full bar and a nice happy hour special each day.  They have this nifty margarita where they stick a mini Corona in it.  It's fun and very college-Spring-Break inspired.

But I think my favorite part of the restaurant is the open patio.  The window/wall opens up from the bar area to a nice little patio with comfortable seating.  My only wish was that it didn't over look a black asphalt parking lot, but I'll take some al fresco drinking and eating any day, and I'll just imagine that the black asphalt is ocean water while I eat my fish taco and drink my beer/margarita concoction."}
{"text":"All I can say is do not go in anytime before closing.  This review is based on customer service only.  My wife and I came in an hour before closing and we were treated very rudely by the bar manager.  The staff was more interested in wrapping up for the night than taking care of customers.  I will not patronize this business again."}
{"text":"I've ordered food to go one time and it was pretty good but it took quite a while. We also ate in the restaurant and ordered the churro chips which was a much smaller portion than what we got before. The main reason it isn't 5 stars is because it's over priced to me. $3.50 for one taco is a bit much to me. Good food though."}
{"text":"The fish tacos are always on point. The service is always good. Surfer/Skater vibe with all the the posters on the wall. If you're looking for fresh, quality, and tasty SoCal inspired grub... swing by here and you'll be happy you did. :)"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  Always fresh, always friendly, and always delicious.  I usually get the burrito and it has never disappointed me.

The service is friendly and fast.  The atmosphere is relaxed and puts you at ease.

The food speaks wonders for Wahoo's and the people make it great.

The beer prices are reasonable and it is always cold!

Come on by for your taco or burrito today!"}
{"text":"Oh how I have missed Wahoo's!  This location did a great job curbing my Wahoo's craving.

The outer reef burrito was fantastic as always.  The guac was a littlw lacking especially when you pay more but it was still delicious.  I wish I was closer to a Wahoo's but maybe that is what makes it taste so good.

One burrito is extremely filling but sooooo good.  I have never had a bad experience at a Wahoo's and look forward to the next visit."}
{"text":"I love the fish tacos! They are great low carb style with citrus slaw. Insude atmosphere is very laid back. I love the outdoor fire pit in the bar area, it's super chill."}
{"text":"Management absolutely needs some serious training! I had a long hair in my rice/cheese. You could tell that whatever it was that the hair was imbedded in what I was about to eat. The young lady who said she was the manager took my plate and told me it looked like my hair! Not once an apology-- only an attitude! Wouldn't it make sense if the hair was just on the plate?... It appeared as though the hair was cooked into the clump! 
Please store owners require some education or educate your staff on customer service. She brought me another plate and still didn't apologize. She just told me how there were no females in the kitchen, so, how the hair got in there was uncertain. 
I did decline. I just couldn't trust what was done to the food... Sad too, because there are hungry people in our communities.
Again, the hair was clumped into rice/cheese.... Oh well! I was really looking forward to the carnitas! 
I will not return!"}
{"text":"Never had anything but fantastic food, good service, and extremely cold draft beers here!

Why do people think it's ok to give a 1 star rating because the place was too busy, or an employee's butt was too hot?

I haven't tried to sit at the games in the bar though."}
{"text":"Was not impressed with the food.  I ordered 2 grilled fish tacos.  The taco shell was cold.  Quantity of fish was small.  A lot of cabbage filler.  I was disappointed because I had heard good things.  Probably will not go back."}
{"text":"We have even there several times. I love the outer reef burrito and the taquitos! The service has been hit or miss. It's either fabulous or horrible. But it's a good spot to have a beer and a little food for sure."}
{"text":"My wife finally talked me into going here. Fish tacos...how cliche I said. And I was right. Good but nothing to make me say, I need to come back here. I had the fish (duh) although they do have chicken,beef, etc., and it was good but again, nothing super awesome. They have some decent beans too, I always lean towards the black beans.
Honestly, I'd come back, it's not expensive and you know what you'll get anyway and sometimes that's all you need."}
{"text":"If you hate flavor...  Give wahoo's a try. I'm not sure how so many permutations of burrito ingredients can taste equally as bland, canned,  and salt-laden."}
{"text":"I have been waiting to get back to Wahoos for 15 years.  Having lived in Southern California, Wahoos was a staple in my diet.   I was in Vegas for business and saw they had a location.   

Visiting this location took me back as the decor was very similar to the So Cal stores with one exception (bar and gaming area).  There was no doubt on what ideas getting.   THE KALUA PIG BOWL!!!!   It is teriyaki carnitas with black beans / rice / and pico.   It is was as good as I remember it.   I would definitely recommend Wahoos."}
{"text":"Wahoos Fish Taco is a staple for me when I go out west.  Tried another location  during a recent trip to Vegas and had the same great result.   Food was excellent and service was really good.  Of course I had to get the Pig Bowl and it lived up to the quality I have come to expect.  Tried their chips and salsa for the first time.  The salsa was good. The manager / owner came over and asked us how our meal was which was a nice touch.   

Overall a good visit and this location lives up to expectations.  

Would repeat."}
{"text":"I come here for the citrus slaw burritos you can choose from chicken beef or shrimp, I like all three the food is good and you get big portions for your money. The cheese nachos is a meal of it's own. Great service too."}
{"text":"NO thanks. Horribhle crowd in this place, the rough crowd runs the bar in this place, not the bartenders! Keep your head down in your food if you want to avoid a bar fight with a middle aged meth head!"}
{"text":"We wanted to like this place, but the food was dull and the service was... The atmosphere lends itself to a beach hole-in-the-wall, but the reality is a smokey hole far from any beach freshness - food or air. We ordered the vegetarian nachos, outer reef burrito, wet classic burrito, quesadillas, and chicken taquitos all to-go. It took a over a half-hour to get our food, mostly because they kept giving us an incomplete order insisting it was complete. The food had very little flavor. The nachos and outer reef burrito reminded me of something you would throw together with what is left in your refrigerator - very uninspiring and dry. Speaking of dry, the wet burrito was hardly wet. The quesadillas were akin to cafeteria food. The chicken taquitos had more whole bay leaves in them than chicken. The chips were crisp but flavorless, and the \"salsa\" was equally so with a touch of heat. Obviously, won't be going back."}
{"text":"Honestly beyond pissed about this place. Ordered one thing and something completely different. I guess people that work grave must be boozing with the regulars cuz being in this town and working in the restaurant industry is and insult. Not like you're banging busy at 3am. Even when you tell and order and repeat it and get an ok I understand your order and still get screwed on what you're paying for. Honestly worst service ever puts all wahoos down in y book no matter where it is or what state."}
{"text":"Service was super friendly! Tried the taco sampler plate: chicken, pork, fish.
Chicken & pork were tender & moist. Friend ate the fish one & said it was quite good. Definitely give this place a try!"}
{"text":"I love the vibe of this place in Boca Park! The atmosphere with the music playing and low key dress apparel makes this place comfy like being home. 
The food is delicious, and I always stick with the shrimp tacos that are the bomb!"}
{"text":"Great place to get some tacos, my absolute favorites are skinny tacos with shrimp SO GOOD! I also like their variety of beer. They have amazing customer service. Also they allow customers to bring their dogs on the patio."}
{"text":"Will never go back. And I love Wahoos food! Went in at 11:30am on July 26th. We sat in the lobby and waited for to-go food (2 burritos). There were literally 4 people in the restaurant. The cashier was very nice and kept apologizing for it taking so long. But 45 minutes later- still no food. That's how long for take out?.. Awful. Will never go back. I go to the wahoos in Boca Park all the time and they are great! This location needs serious help."}
{"text":"Great Service and Great Atmosphere!

Looking forward to going back! AND they have a sports book!
The atmosphere is great, relaxing, and very clean. The service was excellent as well! The shrimp cajun tacos were to die for. Being from Southern California, this place takes me back home to Huntington Beach! So happy they opened up in Vegas!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love wahoos with out a doubt, but this location was horrible tonight. I don't recommend ordering at the bar at all! You would think the manger of all people could get an order right but didn't. He didn't even write our order down which says a lot, bc it's 50/50 if it's going to come out correct. Which at the time I placed the order I assume he was just the bartender but then finding out he himself was the manger he should of known first hand the waitress or waiter is suppose and should always write the order down. Got our order wrong the first time it was brought out then.. Sent it back.. Then had the nerve to pull the waitress aside a table over from me and tell her what I ordered, Wasnt was what I ordered casually.. Like it didn't matter.. How rude and unprofessional. 1st off I did order it the right way but probably bc he didn't write anything down it came out wrong, along with my husband order as well. Anyways we ended up leaving and pissed off... Not a happy customer and will never go back as long as he's behind the bar! #pissed!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I come here more for the atmosphere than the food, although the food is very good...but Wahoo's reminds me of a Pacific Beach taco shack, complete with the surf and skate decor. And of course I can't resist the piped in music-  80's and 90's new wave and punk: The Smiths, English Beat, Peter Murphy, and the Pixies, to name a few. Love it! Try the shrimp tacos, black beans, and seasoned rice..."}
{"text":"Delicious and low calorie!  I had the skinny tacos at only 107 calories each. I had 3. One grilled fish, 1 Cajun chicken and one steak. The fish and chicken were my favorites."}
{"text":"** Thank you for the review however I could have called the authorities and had them there faster; so those comments do not carry any merit. Your employees did nothing to prevent the matter of discriminating remarks and your bartender enjoyed the racist jokes as he did nothing to stop it. I can appreciate you will back your staff; however when they are wrong they are wrong. Bottom line is we have shared our disappointing experience with those we work with. **  training and education should be a focal point to avoid unprofessionalism among your staff."}
{"text":"Not bad.  I had shrimp quesadillas.  They were very cheese and a little greasy (as quesadillas are sometimes).  Not bad though.  Salsa was a little watery and not a lot of flavor.  Nice atmosphere.  I would come back for a beer and maybe to try something different."}
{"text":"Super stoked to try this place - but 

When you walk in this place, it's got a really good vibe, skate gear and logos splattered from wall to wall and has a real open floor plan. The problem is that you aren't sure whether to sit down or find somewhere to place an order. If you walk to the right, you'll find the bar, and this is actually where you place your order - it's quite odd. The menu is pretty clear, and hangs on the wall. Kacie was definitely rude. I asked her what was in draft. She huffed and said \"blah blah blah Sam Adams\" I asked which Sam Adams and she replied with \"Uh...the regular one.\" Service fail, Kacie.

The food was fantastic. I got the fish tacos and the husband got the shrimp tacos, we traded plates after eating one of each so we could share. Holy Moses! They were fantastic! I liked the fish better, but I had the shrimp second, so maybe that's why the tortilla was falling apart so much. It ended up being a big mess in my hand (that's what she said?). The Maui beer battered onion rings were an 'oh wow' situation. Absolutely delicious and came with ketchup and ranch. 

We'll absolutely be back for more. They're open until 2am, so a perfect spot for a late-night nosh. 

...hopefully Kacie won't be there."}
{"text":"It's great, but the hours are wrong they're only open till 10 or at least the kitchen only stays open till 10."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints when it comes to quick fresh food. I never feel like a disgusting slob full of grease leaving Wahoo's. They have a dish for everyone including vegetarians. The Decor is really cool with the walls being covered in Action Sports memorabilia.  There's also tv's everywhere for the sports fanatics."}
{"text":"This place was pretty good. My only issue is that there were more beans and rice than there was tacos and I'm not a huge fan of beans even though the beans were pretty tasty. The tacos themselves were really delicious. The workers were nice and the food came out quick. The environment is a chill one. I'll definitely be coming here to try some other stuff!"}
{"text":"I've been to this place a few times now and will continue to keep going! The portion sizes are huge and the prices are great! It has a restaurant area, a bar area, and an outdoor patio that offers a great view!! Went there for 4th of July and could pretty much see any fireworks display that was going on. The service is fast and friendly. Only reason I'm giving four stars is because a couple times, the fish didn't seem fresh."}
{"text":"The food is yummy, the  drinks are delicious and the slots are loose,  but the real reason to come here is Joey!  He's hands down the best bartender in the city--never an empty cup and always a smile.   I'll drive from the other side of town just to see him any day!!!"}
{"text":"I haven't been to Wahoo's Fish Tacos in ages, and they put one near my house like a year ago.  Finally went to try it out.  Decent food like I remember, but it's overpriced for what it is.  Nearly $3 for 1 taco.  There's better deals in this town, gonna have to pass next time."}
{"text":"First time at this location. Service and employees were great, friendly and attentive.  The bartender, Shannon, was totally awesome. Her attitude was amazing and made it a great experience. Had a good time except for trying to watch the football game, haf to endure watching a couple at the bar make out,  wasn't the greatest thing. Was involved in a drawing, but didn't win and got some free chocolates because I was a lady ;-)  Would definitely come back here. Btw, had taco combo, shrimp and grilled fish with rice and beans. Very good!  B.F. had a wet burrito with half red sauce and half cilantro sauce. Tasty. Had tea and two margaritas and price was around $36.00. Not bad :-)"}
{"text":"I come here for lunch at least a few times a month.  I get nothing but great service from the staff, even when I do take out.  The prices are good and the food is great.  There is never a complaint.  Sit in the bar area for great conversation and a genuine fun time, whether you're alone or with friends.  You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"My husband & I went to try Wahoo's as we were excited for a new restaurant to open! He ordered from sh tacos, I had some sort of smothered chicken burrito, & we got a quesadilla for our daughter. The quesadilla was the best tasting food item we ordered. The food was bland & my chicken tasted like canned chicken, just not very good. Oh well."}
{"text":"I first went to Wahoo for the tacos. Never did get the tacos. I've back six or seven times and stuck with the Paleo bowl. Darn good food reasonably priced. This place takes me back to California or where I grew up. Take a good friend, I'll be back maybe next week."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times and the burritos are awesome! The last visit I decided to try something different and got their taco salad (it's called something else on the menu that I cannot remember.)

The taco salad was meh. I ordered with tofu as I am a vegetarian weening his way back to meat. Next time I will stick with what's good to me and that's the burritos, only this time with chicken.

Great place to grab a bite and don't let the name fool you, they do more than just fish. And it makes for a great spot to catch sports. Came here for World Cup Soccer last year and will be back for the women's World Cup this year."}
{"text":"My husband and I absolutely love this place! We frequent it a couple times a week almost.. The food is always consistently delicious, the management and staff are very friendly.. especially Luulis! ( WE LOVE LUULIS! sp? ) The vibe is very kick back.. great atmosphere and great, healthy food! And you can't go wrong with the $2 beers on tap.. yummy!  A gem in Boca Park indeed! Try the $6 'brunch' on Saturdays and Sundays with all you can drink mimosas!"}
{"text":"I would give it a negative star if were possible... taco Tuesday supposedly the taco is free with a drink unless it's over $3.49 if so u pay the difference but we were never told the salad sucked my order was wrong and it took forever ...oh and the wine was horrible....just drive by I know I feel like I wasted my money ...learn from my experience"}
{"text":"I love this place but haven't been back in a while due to the fact that the boyfriend and i ate there so much i got a little burnt out, lol..  Not necessarily a bad thing! I'm vegetarian and they have a burrito chock-full of veggies AND tofu! Color me happy! Green sauce is awesome on top,  and food is always fresh and hot. Staff is always friendly. I ate once at the Summerlin location and all was great there, too. I definitely recommend this place for vegan/vegetarians."}
{"text":"So, normally I'm a big fan of Wahoo's. I usually lobby my girlfriend into going at least a couple times a month. I really enjoy their wet (with Green Sauce) outer reef burrito, accompanied by wahoos Mr. Lee's sauce. It's pretty enjoyable. I've given them three stars because I don't know what's happened as of late, but I feel like I'm always getting skimped when coming here. You pay up front before you've received any food, and everything cost extra. .75 for this, an extra 1.50 for that, blah blah blah. Turns out by the time you get 2 burritos, about 13 chips with salsa, plus the salsas are not something that's included,and a drink each it comes out to the best part of $40. 
Don't get me wrong I've paid it before and I'll probably pay it again, but every time I go, the fish in the burrito is smaller, what used to be refilled chips with salsa is now $3 or $4 bucks every time you want 13 more chips. The serving staff has become awkward, always on their phones, not paying attention to what's happening inside, there's a bar tender, older guy with a goatee, and other than the fact he's seen us 50 times he asks to see our ID every time, he's the only really nice personable guy there. 
I guess why it sucks is Wahoo's has always been somewhere I've been excited to go, but who wants to go to a place where they already know they're going to get screwed (not in the good way) before they even eat their meal? I'm worried of it sliding further downhill and I hope things go back to the way they were before."}
{"text":"After eating here for the first time I realized I would have been better off going to Wendy's instead.  My food was terrible.  And, how the fu@k do you run out of forks when nobody is in your establishment?  Won't ever be eating here again.  Save yourself the disappointment and go to any of the other nearby restaurants. F this place.  F them right in the ear."}
{"text":"It felt late after a long flight and we needed something to eat. Wahoo's was recommended so that's where the four of us went. At first it was overwhelming so many options with lots of different combinations. 

The tacos were really pretty tasty. Fish tacos with the slaw was really good. Fish was moist and meaty, able to stand up to the toppings, but at the same time, it was light and refreshing. 

The Cajun beans were spicy, but not great, soft and mushy. The rice was also kinda soft and lacking architecture to hold the beans and the combo meal together.

The prices are good and the servings were super large. The place was cute, but a little messy at the end of the day (understandable). It also seems like the kind of place that could get super busy and hectic."}
{"text":"Great laid-back venue for singles as well as families. Great food at reasonable prices. The staff are attentive and friendly. Stop in the Bar for a great drink with Big Papa and the rest of the great barkeeps !"}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday afternoon. Place wasn't busy and we say at the bar. We were on one side alone. There were people on the three other sides. Those people got Brea's full attention. We had to flag her down and ask for what we needed. She never checked on us, I had to yell for her across the bar. Now I get it, you have your regulars. However, since we didn't feel welcome we won't become one of them. We also saw her unload the dishwasher. There was a piece of orange peel in with the clean dishes. Weird. I watched her reload and restart the dishwasher. She didn't remove the orange peel. If you like the food, just avoid the bar. Maybe go when Brea isn't working. Oh and stretch pants should be a dont period, but while you're working....ugh."}
{"text":"Gunner is such a great person and bartender! Definitely a place to go when you want great service!"}
{"text":"Yelp Challenge! Started 8/20/2011 (32 of 365). I have a lot of catching up to do!

I'm sorry fellow Yelpers, but I was hugely disappointed.  After reading everyones reviews I was excited when I finally had the chance to try this place.  I was so hungry but not even that gave me a reason to rave about the taste and quality of the food.

I ordered the combination plate with a grilled fish taco, and a carne asada enchilada.  My plate came with black beans and white rice (even though I specifically asked for brown).  Everything on my plate was bland except for the mild green salsa which I'll have to say was the only good part of my meal.  I had to dip everything into this salsa to get a good taste out of anything on my plate.  The grilled fish taco had no taste at a;;!  The fish was a thick piece, and because it was o thick, it's bland taste took over the entire taco.  It was dry, and disappointing.  The carne asada enchilada I had was mediocre because the meat inside was chewy and in addition, difficult to chew down and swallow!  I was questioning how old the beef is or if they cooked it too long.  I like my beef to be tender!

I was really upset that my experience turned out the way that it did.  I guess I'm used to the authenticity of some other mexican food joints.  But even the american infused ones such as Rubios taste way better than the food here.

I do give it a couple stars for the bar they hav in there w/ video poker and TVs to watch your favorite sports.  They also have daily drink specials which is pretty cool too."}
{"text":"Let's start the new year off with some healthy eating!

I have been waiting a long time for Wahoos Fish Taco to come to Las Vegas!  And it's finally here!  And it's a big step up from that place with the bell in the logo!

Fresh, fast, and wholesome..Wahoos is a place every personal trainer can love!  The X-treme athletes and surfers dig it as well.  Pretty evident by all the cool skate, surf, and snowboarding stuff used to decorate the place.  It's a nice change of pace and a good place to hang out and grub with your friends after a long day of play.

Wahoos is a nice mix of Mexican-American with an Asian flair (founders are some righteous Asian surfer dudes) with a great amount of good complex carbs and protein.  Everything is fresh and full of flavor with lots of items having low amounts of fat.  You got starters, tacos, enchiladas, burritos, bowls, and salads and sandwiches to soothe a hungry appetite.  The kids get their own menu too.

My fav starters are the Maui Onion Rings (which coincidentally are fried and fatty yum) and the nachos with chicken.  The choice of fillings for your entrees are phenomenal:

-Chicken - Grilled or Cajun
-Carnitas 
-Fish - Grilled or Cajun
-Carne Asada
-Shrimp
-Tofu
-Mushrooms
-Vegetarian
-Banzai Veggies - bell peppers, onions, zucchini, broccoli, mushrooms, and cabbage all sauteed with their house teriyaki sauce

My go to is usually one of their combo plates, combo #4 to be exact \"The Kahuna\".  It has your choice of one taco, one burrito or enchilada.  Each combo comes with white or brown rice (for a little more), and black or cajun beans.  My #1 filling is their grilled fish, it goes excellent on their tacos!  I like the fish or chicken on my burrito, and I often add some Banzai Veggies to it.  It's a full meal!

Wahoos is good on the wallet too, items on the menu go from the $5-8 range.  Gettin' full on a tiny budget, that's what it's all about!  Service is fast and friendly too.  This Wahoos is also fully equipped with a bar!  Wanna hang out with your friends and get some primo drinks and eats?  Do it all here in one place!  Sure beats some of the local dives around town here.  

You'll be glad to know too that Wahoos will be opening another location here in the Summerlin area of town real soon...right in Boca Park!  All I need now is some sand beneath my feet, a pair of bright floral surf shorts, my Blu Blocker sunglasses, some SPF on my nose, and a shave ice in my hand.  I could deal without the 110 degree heat though!  Totally gnarly, dude!!"}
{"text":"Just about as good as the rest.

Whenever we used to drive to Cali for vacation, we almost always stopped at Wahoo's for some fish tacos!  Was just part of the trip.  Now...wow, we have multiple locations here in Las Vegas!  Who knew fish could swim to the desert?

All the same food available at other Wahoo's can be had here.  They are turning into quite the chain!  Please guys don't get too much bigger because I would like the quality and down-home feel to stay the same.  Don't overdo corporate!

Biggest difference here?  The ambiance.  In Cali I'm used to seeing surfers, skaters, and bums all partaking in the ritual that is a fish taco.  Now here in Vegas?  Businessmen, casino workers, and soccer moms!  What is going on?  Where is the sand?  Well we do have sand.  Where is the sun?  Well we do have sun.  Where is the smell of salt water and sun tan lotion?  It truly makes a difference.  My fish taco experience always follows with the smell of the beach and an ice cold Corona.  I do it like Vin Diesel & Paul Walker do!  It just feels off here in Las Vegas!

Luckily the food is still A-OK.  Lots of healthy and nutritious eats with decent prices.  Although I did notice the prices at this location seem a tad higher than some of it's Cali counterparts.  No matter, at least now I don't have to drive to another state for my fish taco fix!

I usually go to Wahoo's and order the same thing every time.  The combo with a fish burrito, fish taco, rice & black beans.  I love that teriyaki sauce they have so I always get a side of it for my burrito and my rice.  Asian I guess, can't get away from the soy sauce!  I love the crunch the cabbage provides on the fish taco, and I have a hard time replicating it at home.  Must be the fish I'm guessing, my damn cheap @$$ tilapia fillets aren't cutting it.  I enjoy the simple dressing on the burrito:  fish, pico de gallo, and their 'white sauce' (which I'm hoping is a sour cream concoction).  I kick that sucker up with teriyaki sauce and Tapatio....muy delicioso!  The side of rice & black beans fill my belly up to full.  Not a bad combo for around $8.  

I've had their chicken and beef before on the tacos and burritos (and it's alright), but I constantly come back to the beloved fish taco.  Seems to be my favorite staple at Wahoo's.  Yeah...hello...Wahoo's FISH TACO!  So the damn fish better be good.

This Wahoo's has a nice large bar area attached to the restaurant, and I can see that it is bustling most nights.  Probably have some happy hour specials I need to inquire about.  But the place is mainly a grab-and-go or stay for a quick meal type of place.  There's noise everywhere, so don't come here for no intimate date!

As long as the crowds come and the food stay consistent, this Wahoo's should be just fine.  But guys, stop creeping up on the prices, eh?  That's like a great white shark ruining your wave.  Or Tara Reid, surviving the onslaught that is 'Sharknado'."}
{"text":"Wahoos would be a good spot for cheap drinks and socializing but do not come for the food.  It is very dissapointing.  

The chips, salsa and guac were A-OK.  Everything else - MEH.

The prices are reasonable, especially for alcohol.  On this particular day, wine was 1/2 off so you could get a glass for $2.50.  Pacificos were $1-$2.  

I ordered the Baja-ladas (essentially a spin on enchiladas).  When I think of enchiladas, I salivate in anticipation for something piping hot with molten cheese and flavorful sauce.  I got a cold chicken wrap topped with luke warm sauce, filled with raw spinach.  Big boo.  Literally, the inside was cold, and raw.  Not good.  The rice and beans lacked pizazz as well.  All in all, a dissapointment.  

Hubby got fish tacos.  They were OK at best.  Certainly nothing to name a restaurant after.  

The service was very nice and friendly; alas, we won't return."}
{"text":"I like the Southern California atmosphere.  The staff was friendly and \"waited\" on us despite the \"order, and take a number\" style establishment.  All in all it was a good experience, but I wanted the tacos to taste better.  I'm going to give this place another try so I can hopefully bump the rating to four stars.

5/28/13-  I gave this place another try and I am so glad I did.  I had one of the better tasting chicken burritos I have ever had.  I had to bump up the rating from three stars to five because it was so delicious.  The staff was friendly again.  I really hope this business does well enough for a few more locations in the valley."}
{"text":"Good food and quick. Very kid friendly.  The bar has an incredible view of Vegas and an outside patio."}
{"text":"Fish tacos are very good. Sandwiches are fresh and tasty. Will order form them again it's open 24/7 and prices are right. Healthier than most late night options around"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick lunch on a rainy day. Service was friendly and food was at a fair price. The restaurant was spacious, clean, and big on the snowboard and skater themes. We had the carne asada tacos and kalua pig bowl. Food was fresh and tasty. I wouldn't mind going back."}
{"text":"I eat lunch here so often, it's embarrassing. The kale Kai salad with blackened fish is my go to favorite, but the bowls and burritos are tasty too. For the price, quality is crazy good. Lunch orders are always fast and don't be afraid to try the many hot sauces on the table. Thank me later."}
{"text":"The food is delicious! The outer reef burrito is my favorite. The only reason I took a star away is because I believe some items are overpriced. For one slaw taco its $3 and some change. It's the size of a street taco so it's pretty small. Also, for a basket of fries its over $3. Again, you don't get much for the price."}
{"text":"I really like the fact that Wahoo's will wrap any of their tacos in lettuce (low carb style) but I just can't get over how filthy their bathrooms were here. I mean, disgusting, public bus station levels of dirty (see my photo). I kept hearing my Gradmama's voice in my head saying \"if the bathrooms are dirty, imagine how dirty the kitchen is,\" something she would always say. Even after I alerted three employees to the dire situation in the toilets (no paper, no hand soap -- GROSS), nobody cared to do anything about it. Because of this, I am not sure I will return because if people aren't washing their hands...well, you know what can happen! Luckily I had my emergency bottle of hand sanitizer in my handbag.

Back to the food: the chips and guacamole were really bad. Don't waste your money paying for either. The shrimp and fish tacos were tasty. Nothing great but a good alternative to steak or chicken. The low carb tacos were served in big lettuce leaves that looked and felt like you were eating a \"real\" taco shell but they were topped with so much cabbage and lettuce \"filler\" that you only got a little spoonful of protein. I left here hungry and disgusted with the lack of cleanliness."}
{"text":"2 enchiladas with the green sauce! Soo good. Quick and cheap. and very filling.

The ambience is really bar like. You can watch sports and eat really good tacos."}
{"text":"I've eaten at wahoo's in Huntington Beach and it was great, was excited to try it out here in Henderson. I was thinking we lucked out when we got there since no one was in line and no one was in the seating area. figured we'd be in and out.....wrong. we sat at our table for over 30 minutes, watched as a few groups came and went with take out and only two groups stayed to eat in. Both groups after us were served before us and when we asked where our food was the waiter said we were next then we saw him and the other waitress shuffling about the tickets at the register. When they finally brought us one plate the girl said there was a mix up from the rush and I asked her how she could tell us it was a rush when there was literally only two other tables being served....she didn't have an answer. If the servers can't handle what was about 5 groups and an empty restaurant, maybe they need to be retrained. it's one thing to lose an order and or to have make a mistake, however flat out lying to your patrons about how busy it was when the place was empty is pretty pathetic. very disappointed in the two servers. The man who was in all black didn't smile and looked like he hated life and the girl with the yellow shirt was just a lair. Good food when it finally came out, but balanced with the servers this place is below par."}
{"text":"Great service!!! Kim did an excellent job of providing five star service!! Highly recommend!! Good food"}
{"text":"Meh. The fish taquitos weren't very tasty and the rice and beans were OK. The food wasn't very tasty but the restaurant was very clean and the staff was superb."}
{"text":"HEAVEN!! A walk up type restaurant with a full bar, fantastic. The plate of food I received, fantastic. The drink I ordered in happy hour, fantastic. The price, fantastic. Love this place.

Note, their Cajun spicy fish is super spicy. LOVE IT!!"}
{"text":"I'm Someone who has always enjoyed rubios tacos or Baja Fresh but this wahoos tacos blows them out of the park!! Their food is delicious made fresh to the point where the bag was smelling up my car! I was racing to get home to eat! The service at the counter was extremely friendly and helpful. The gentleman was a middle aged Hispanic man he ran up to the counter and greeted me right when i walked in also helped me decide what I'd like to order for someone as picky as me. But like I said the food was spectacular!! Will be recommending and coming back"}
{"text":"Food was delicious and the wait was short! The service was great too. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Never been to a wahoos before, the lady who took our order was very helpful and told us what she likes and recommends. I got the salmon plate and my friend got a burrito. Food was delicious and they give you a lot for what you pay."}
{"text":"I couldn't agree more with some of the reviews I've seen on here. This is not the Wahoo's you grew up with in Cali. The fish is very dry and the green sauce stuff they serve is like some gross watery sour cream and herb combo. 

I've been here a few times for drinks and there is a particular bartender that's horrible. (Sorry, I don't remember her name!) When watching a fight in a mostly empty bar she came on shift and turned down the volume on the television and then changed the channel to some reality show. I asked for it back on and was ignored.  

I've also been here on at least two other nights where her service was lacking because she was too busy chatting up a customer to serve us or even bring us the bill to get paid. I finally had to tell her we were walking out without paying to get her to do her job.

Avoid this location unless you want a mediocre fish taco with crappy service."}
{"text":"Ok so I cant believe how good this is, 1 burrito and 2 tacos later. And desert is coming. OMG so good"}
{"text":"Just moved around the corner and after a full day of unpacking, decided to check this gem out. Disclaimer: I love tacos. So tacos and beer??? My kind of bar, for suuuureeee. 

It was late, so we only could sit at the bar. The bartender was very nice and friendly. My boyfriend ordered the quesadillas and everything was phenomenol! It came with guacamole and sour cream on the side with their salsa. (Their salsa is so good btw, I put ty on my rice). I got the paleo bowl per the suggestion of the bartender. I chose shrimp and salmon and it came with veggies, and I asked for a side of rice. It was so so so good, and filling! Lots of flavor. 

We also ordered 2 Micheladas, and I love me a good michelada. Definitely going to be a new go to, going for that dukedom bahaha."}
{"text":"Tacos with a view weather permitting. I like going here in the fall and winter. I sit outside on the patio and enjoy the strip view. The foods not bad it's a little bland I think but overall decent. I've only ever eaten on the patio so the service is what it is. I can't complain. Over all this is a good spot to sit back chill and munch on some street style tacos."}
{"text":"Ordered to go, watched five groups order after me and all served. One group ate and left before I got my order. The kid working at the food order desk is rude and condescending. Wouldn't acknowledge me until I got back in line to inquire. Food finally came out before I made it back through the line... like warm. Never eating here again... garbage. Go to Roberto's, it's faster, more food, cheaper, and the people that work there are actually pleasant."}
{"text":"Great food,good staff never had any problems here. Love the theme, with all surfer boards etc. Real laid back! 5++++"}
{"text":"A friend recommended this place to me and my guy pal so we decided to stop in one random afternoon.  Coming in, the place reminded me of a ski lodge.  There were booths set up everywhere and longboards, snowboards, stickers, and posters of all kinds of extreme sports tacked down.  The menu gives you a lot of options. You can have chicken, fish or tofu burritos, tacos, or all kinds of plates.  Jonathon at the register was extremely friendly and recommended the enchiladas. You basically order once you come in, they give you a number and then you sit and watch the awesome projector showing extreme sports clips of guys eating it and doing gnarly tricks. Apart from the restaurant is the bar, which is in a separate room that you can see through the huge glass window from the restaurant. What I love the most about this place is it is opened 24/7 with food and drinks.  Oh yeah!  

As for the food, my enchilada was tasty and my shrimp tacos was ehh. My guy pal got the bonsai plate with Cajan fish that was oh so very good.  I was pretty jealous.  Otherwise, this is another great place to grab a late night dinner or another place to sober after a night of partying."}
{"text":"We went here for lunch because we had seen a few good reviews, but I don't think it was as good as many people said it was.  

The food was ok, but nothing special. We go to Mexico and Hawaii fairly often and always get fish tacos, so our bar for tasty tacos is high. The tacos here were average. We also had the steak teriyaki and it was lackluster as well. The teriyaki sauce was runny and bland. 

On top of all that, the soda machine was out. Of course we didn't know that until we got our drinks and took a swig of water and soda syrup. Yuck! We told an employee walking by and they told us that they knew about it and were trying to fix it. About 20 minutes later, we hadn't seen anyone about the soda, even though we saw them bring in soda in cans they had bought for people to have, but i didn't see any of those passed out either. We couldn't ask them to give us one because we couldn't get anyone to come over to us. Everyone seemed to be running around crazy like. I would have hoped to get sodas since we paid for them, but we never did nor did we get a refund on them. Quite disappointing. 

When we were getting ready to leave, and quite thirsty, a little boy, maybe 10 and obviously the owner's kid, came by with a sweet treat for my daughter and gave us coupons to come back. He was nice and cute and redeemed the place a little, but we were so thirsty and annoyed at the service that we were over it."}
{"text":"Despite the funky smell and super tacky decor, we decided to give this place a try. I was looking for a good soft corn tortilla taco. I ordered the carne asada taco with the citrus slaw and cajun. My husband ordered the nachos with chicken. My dinner was really good. I loved the slaw and the meat was flavorful. I would eat it again. My husbands nachos were gross. Super hard chips and rubbery chicken! You could tell it was frozen then heated. It was not fresh at all. They didn't put the jalapeños on the nachos either. I would not recommend the nachos at all. The service was good except the cashier didn't know anything about the food because \"he doesn't eat red meat.\" I felt like I was in a 7th grade boys locker room with all the skate board memorabilia and the stickers all over the tables an walls. So all in all, my taco was good but I don't think I would rave about the place."}
{"text":"I've read numerous reviews this Nevada Wahoos is not what you'd get in California. I don't know about that. I've never had Wahoos in California before, but all I can say is that place is sub-par. 

The ambiance is basically totally generic. There are lots of snowboarding and skate stickers pasted all over the place. I'm not sure what that means. Do snowboarders and skaters know what really good Mexican food is? Is that supposed to sway me or be cool? I've frequented really dumpy skater restaurants/bars before, but they were much worse, but in a good way (which gets points in my book because they're actually good). I've frequented really dumpy Mexican restaurants before and they were ALL good.

I usually give a place two chances (unless I love it) before I dump on it, but this place is pretty mediocre. 

You basically order at a fast food window, sit down at a table, then a guy brings the food out to you. Which he did. The first time my friend ordered a burrito and told them no cheese (like four times - he hates cheese because he's an idiot in my opinion - but he hates cheese). I ordered basically the same thing with cheese with sour cream. They never game me my sour cream and gave my friend cheese on his burrito. When i bit into my burrito, like 4 ounces of mystery liquid came out of it. Gross. 

The second time I came to this place a friend of mine bit into a chicken taco and was about to throw up. I'm not sure it was the food though. It's pretty bad, but not enough to throw up. He's probably just a drama queen. 

My second time I ordered a burrito without any vegetables and it was just okay. Nothing I'd come back for.

In my opinion, if you're really lazy and want to eat something good there are like a hundred other places down the street. However, the bar looked decent and probably had some NCAA basketball games going. That's about it."}
{"text":"I am only giving two stars bc I feel so bad leaving one - since the bartender was great! The guacamole is clearly frozen- it's basically brown- AND we even requested a new one after the first looked inedible...the second was no better. The chips are blah..tortilla soup is pathetic and the shrimp burrito I ordered had 5 shrimp in it. All in all....very nice bartender but feel sorry for him that he has to serve a this shitty food. Honestly everything was gross and horrible quality. Def go if you want to watch sports and just drink but don't waste a penny on the food! It sucks!"}
{"text":"Did the takee outee routine with the cheese enchilada and  bowl of brown rice, black beans, and grilled chicken and an appetizer size of chicken quesidellia.  Was just the right amount for 2 of us.  Worried that the grilled chicken on the bowl would dry out on the 15 minute trip home, but not the case.  Yummy for sure!  Had the fish bowl on another trip and it was a little dry, but as someone else said-the black beans were terrific.  Definitely will return."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time about a week ago and this place is just okay. 

I'm pretty sure they have some really good dishes despite my poor food choice.

I ordered a teriyaki bowl with chicken and it just tasted really bad. I had asked for no rice so instead I got a very messy black bean soupy salad. The whole combo was just odd to say the least. 

I think I would have preferred the beans on the side and I'm surprised that they did not pay attention to this small, but important detail. My whole dish became soggy and was not appetizing at all.

I think next time I'll order some tacos and not subtract anything and hopefully that'll be a better option. I will say that I did try their chips and salsa and those are pretty darn tasty.

Overall this place is alright and I can't wait to try some other items and hopefully I can give this joint a better review next time around."}
{"text":"The only reason I came here to gamble was to see Gus. I'll never be back. I'm sure they saw a spike in revenue right when he started and I'm sure they're going to see the exact opposite now. Very few times have I seen worse decisions by a gaming establishment."}
{"text":"Food taste horrible, tables are dirty, messed up the order and forgot to bring the correct order... Now I know why this location is empty with no customers eating here. Pretty disgusting."}
{"text":"Wahoos is my favorite bar in Vegas. With the chill environment and great food its the best bang for your buck in town. The burning roll is great and Pacifico is on tap. Definitely reccomend it"}
{"text":"This place is ok. I've been here a ton of times, and it's always empty when I go. The menu seems to get larger by just adding a new sign somewhere in the front. It's hard to order when you're standing at the register, but half the menu is behind you. 

The food is ok. I've had several different things. Most recent being the wahoo fries and some sliders. The sliders were super dry, but the fries were pretty delicious."}
{"text":"Really, really kinda diggin' this place!  Great, great location in Boca Park which I seem to drive by 5 times/day and closer to 15 on the weekends.  It sits in the same shopping area as Target, Starbucks, Justice (yes, I have two daughters), Total Wine, Tilly's and many other great places.  

The family dined here and though kids are not allowed on the patio (which looks waaaay cool and comfortable given the right temperature and no summer winds), the inside is very cool, SoCal and beachy!  I love it!  There are TVs scattered throughout for my sports loving husband so that's always a bonus too. 

We had the chicken tacos and Wahoo salad.  The Wahoo salad was great - not amazing, but I'd definitely have it again.  Hubby had the chicken tacos which he said were really good.  No real complaints -- the menu is pretty diverse, you can order a cheeseburger if that's what your tummy desires! My daughter had the kids quesadilla which she devoured, but quesadillas aren't exactly a trick to make. We also had the chips n salsa which also was fine, not the best, but it was fresh and not bottled which is always nice. 

One thing - thus the less one star . . . . this is Vegas and the place is not air conditioned!!  Ceiling fans abound, but cmon, its 100 degrees outside.  Hubby was sweating as he ate his tacos!!  Maybe it makes for more beer drinking, I'm not sure, but A/C would've earned the 5th star Wahoo!"}
{"text":"This place is surprisingly great. It is not a good location for a business but the food is good an inexpensive. I had the fish tacos, enchilada and brown rice and spicy beans. They all were good.  The fish taco was excellent. This is a good fast meal option."}
{"text":"In the Summerlin area, Bocca Park is a convenient and great location to shop and dine out. It is always nice to have a new restaurant locate here. This was our first time eating at a Wahoos. We were expecting it to be just your typical fast food type of restaurant but was pleasantly surprised to find out that it is a step up from that.  It has a nice bright lay out with lots of seating. The decor is Southern California beach theme. It has a bar in the middle with an open wall to outside seating. It has a real \"vacation\" type feel to the place.
You do order at the counter  but your food is brought out to you at your table. My wife and I had the Cajun Fish Tacos and our daughter had the Cajun Shrimp Taco. The menu only offers the corn tortellia which none of us really like. But if you ask for flour tortilla when you order they do have it. They say the wahoo fish is caught out of the ocean and delivered fresh to the store daily. Our serving size was plenty big enough and all three agreed the tacos were very good. Being able to feed a family of 3 for under $20 in this town is pretty good!
The only draw back is they have some excellent outdoor seating but it is considered part of the bar area and anyone under 21 is not allowed to sit out there. It is hard to find a place to take families these days that is a fun place that offers a good economical meal. This place is certainly a great place for families. Too bad they limit the best seating area to adults only."}
{"text":"Love the food. Love the location. 
Dining area and washrooms - filthy. 
Staff- ho hum. 
Floors were so sticky, my shoes still stick to the ground. 
Sad."}
{"text":"Woooohoooo for Wahoos! I don't even know where I want to start yall! 

This place has such good vibes! 

Let's begin with the staff. This group of people and the management were all PHENOMENAL. Everyone was so incredibly friendly. Each employee went out of their way to smile, make us feel welcome, and ask how we were doing. It wasn't just us. I watched as each table was checked on, greeted, and asked how their meal was. 
It seemed like every single person working was happy to be there. It made for a super pleasant experience. 

THIS IS ABSOLUTELY A NEW FAVORITE for my family. Not only were they so kind and attentive to us, but they were super sweet to my 4 year old. I love how family friendly this spot is. 

Okay, okay! Now the  food! Everything was delicious! For you fellow yelpers out there- with a check in you get free chips and Salsa. (Which were bomb!) 
I ordered shrimp tacos with black beans and rice. I got the citrus slaw on it. YOU GUYS, IT WAS SO YUM. I devoured my tacos like I had been starved for 3 weeks. My husband got the chicken quesadilla and he was just as  pleased.  The quac that came with his dish was off the chain. Next time I go I'll be ordering a side of it for sure.  Anyways, Everything was super duper delicious. Portions are great and the price is right on point! They told us on Thursday's kids eat free and on Tuesdays you get a free taco with the purchase of a drink! Who dosnt like a deal on fresh good food? 2 more reasons to go back! 

The vibes of this place is so fun. We had such a pleasant experience we made a promise to make it a point to set regular lunch dates here. I can't wait to go back because I saw someone order a bowl or salad of some sort that looked absolutely divine. 

Again- the smiling faces of every staff member made this probably one of my most favorite lunch experiences in a long time. We will be back on a standing basis now. 
Thanks for such a great time!"}
{"text":"Great food!!  Awesome staff!  Super fun environment!!!!  Nikki rocks!!!  My husband and I love the burritos!!!  So good!  The gaming bar is always lively and fun.  It is a great place to hang with friends, have some beers, and watch some football.  Their outdoor patio is gonna be a nice spot to relax in the fall and spring months, when the weather is nice.  I would recommend Wahoo's Tacos highly.  Food is delicious, staff is laid back and friendly, restaurant is clean and comfortable.  Love this place!"}
{"text":"Today was our first visit to Wahoo's.  The chicken tacos had 2 pieces of horrible chicken and tons of cilantro.  I would tell anyone that is thinking of eating there to go to the other taco place a few stores up.  Much better food."}
{"text":"If you've ever had real fish tacos on the beach in San Diego, you'll know that what is served here is a sad imposter... I have a hard time reviewing this place because I eat here semi-regularly but the food isn't actually very good... So why do I keep coming here??? Well they are one of the few places to get a healthier meal late at night... 
I usually get the Cajun fish tacos which I will describe as adequately edible.  
This place isn't horrible, but if you're looking for food at a decent hour there's likely a better option open; if it is midnight and fried fast food isn't on the diet, feel free to hang ten at Wahoos"}
{"text":"Great healthy food choices with a friendly staff and outdoor seating!  We had tacos & the slim banzai bowl."}
{"text":"Is it a bar? Is it a restaurant? 
Open until 2AM? Wahoo's was the only place for me late last night. 
The place was empty, but there were a couple of people ordering to go like I was. The restaurant is huge for how empty it is, with a nice view of the strip. It's nothing fancy and I would put it on the level of other chain restaurants like Applebees. 
The Wahoo Bowl, was just rice a side of black beans and a filet of fish. I expected something a little different and was disappointed by it. Would not order again. 
Fish burrito. We ordered the cajun style which we warned was spicy, but it was not at all. 
Look at pictures before you order!"}
{"text":"Marcella was very helpful with the promo for Hop Valley IPA.  Love that it's free!  Enjoyed the meal!"}
{"text":"Excellent service!  Jen & Bobby & Tammy are the best bartenders ever!!  Went to the old Outside Inn.. Now Sporting Life. Horrible!!!! They should have hired these guys back!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Food was very basic,not much flavor & overpriced.The fish tacos were bland & didn't have much flavor,the rice was hard & also no flavor,the Cajun beans tasted like they came from a can.28$ for my buddy & I was way too much for what we had"}
{"text":"Always down for fish tacos!! Their fish tacos are not the best in the world but they are good, I enjoyed their combo with rice and beans. For a fast food type of restaurant it wasn't bad. I thought the menu was a little confusing, but the lady at the front explained it to me.  Cool deco, you get a California beachy feeling when your in the restaurant. Plus I got a free fish taco coupon expiring in a year, so will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Was a little disappointed by the quality of the food here. It was recommended by a friend who has been to other locations.  I just felt like the quality was mediocre and would be able to cook it myself. I ordered the carne asada tacos. The tortillas were pretty dry and the rice seemed like it was just a place holder to make the plate look fuller."}
{"text":"So happy to be a regular customer to Wahoo's again. Loved them in Orange County and I love them even more here in Las Vegas. Food is always fresh. I love that the fish is grilled and you get large pieces of fish instead of that fried beer batter crap like rubios. If you want to add some amazing flavor ASK FOR MR. LEE'S SAUCE!!!!

Every time we go in we are treated like family, Virginia and Candy are amazing behind the bar! Great beers on tap, Full bar....Gaming...cant ask for more!

Favorite Items: Fish tacos & Wahoo Fries"}
{"text":"Pretty good fish tacos. Try to cajun style. I like that they have vegetarian, brown rice and black bean options too. 

The only negative about them is that they can be very slow completing the order. I suggest that you call in if you are in a hurry."}
{"text":"I love how this place is open 24/7! I placed an order to go, and picked it up fresh 20 mins later. I added things to my shrimp burrito, which made it even more delicious and the guy who took my order was super nice. Fast, delicious, and great prices. Not bad at all!"}
{"text":"Sat at a mostly empty bar took the bartender Nikole about 10-15 minutes to even acknowledge me and had a rude attitude and large use of continuous profanity. 

Food was good I ordered from the restaurant with decent prices but ate my food and went elsewhere due to that bartender"}
{"text":"I LOVE fish tacos but have skipped Wahoo due to mixed reviews. But since Niyen I. likes it, I decided to give it a try. Stopped by here for lunch with a couple of co-workers and was saddened to have to skip on beer margaritas (they have those!). 
I had the fish, shrimp, and steak with kimchi tacos; chips and salsa; cajun fries; and churro chips. I normally don't care too much for chips and salsa but their salsa was pretty good. Chunky with a good spice level.
The cajun fries could have been fried for a few extra minutes. I like my fries crispy, though their's wasn't soggy but it wasn't as crispy as I'd like my fries to be.
Churro chips are a unique spin on churros. I love churro's and wish they actually had the real deal. What they have is tortilla chips fried and sprinkled with brown sugar and cinnamon. 
Now the tacos I loved! Surprisingly my favorite was the kimchi steak taco. I tend to skip anything steak unless I'm at a steak house. The steak was cooked tender and I did not have any chewy pieces (I hate that), and the kimchi made it ever so flavorful. The fish and shrimp tacos had slaw on top and were delicious as well. 
Service is fast and friendly and prices are super reasonable. Tacos are about $3 a piece. 
Next time around I'll come on my day off so I can try the margaritas!"}
{"text":"Enjoying this delicious meal, service good Viviana help us ordering. Will be back for mimosa weekend"}
{"text":"If you're from coastal California you probably already know about Wahoos. But this is Vegas. Its about the only bar in town I've found with the front doors open and the laid back beach vibe you're used to. Its nice to be able to go to a Wahoos that you can actually park at and not have to stand behind some tanned up skinny jeans mofo straight from MTV's newest \"The Real OC\" show then have to battle for a table no bigger than a skateboard deck. $2 miller lights on the weekends and 24 hour Wahoos food. Plus plenty of TVs to watch sports on. The staff is extremely friendly and inviting as well."}
{"text":"We received a gift card and thought we would give it another try. We came at 11:30am on a Saturday and were the only ones in the restaurant the entire time. I ordered the \"Screamin' Burrito\" and there was nothing that screamed at me. I ordered some extra \"Mr Lee's\" sauce on the side (I suspect it's just jarred Harissa) and that helped. Hubby got the \"Wahoo's Bowl\". He said everything was very dry and bland and the only thing that \"saved\" the dish was the \"Spicy Cajun White Beans\" which he really liked. Overall, the ingredients are fresh. The atmosphere is comfortable. The service is friendly."}
{"text":"I used to frequent the Wahoos on Oahu so when I saw they opened one here I had to try. It's pretty much the same...some differences though like healthy options, a full bar and gambling haha. But the customer service is awesome here! In the time it took me to eat my two tacos I was asked multiple times by different staff members if I needed anything and the manager touched all the tables! Nice. Love great service. And they have wi-fi."}
{"text":"Jaime was awesome! His service was top notch today when we visited. Wahoos is also our go to! The service the food are always on point. I always get a number 2  spicy chicken taco and enchilada (red sauce) white beans white rice."}
{"text":"For what it is, Wahoo's offers solid food at very fair prices.
Nothing we had - from the fish tacos to the beans - blew us out of the water, but the ingredients are fresh, well prepared and the staff just couldn't be friendlier. Plus, they have a great bar with quick, knowledgeable bartenders (a rarity for the Summerlin area). 
The vibe is very California-esque, the sheer variety of taco variations is sure to please most, and the quality of the food is just right for the price. Forget spending $20 at Taco Hell or any of the other abysmal chains, if you're craving unique, fresh tacos it's hard to go wrong at Wahoo's."}
{"text":"I always love going to Wahoo's in california so I'm really glad there's one here now. I love that they are veggie friendly and have really awesome tofu menu items! I especially love the tofu banzai wet burrito with green sauce. Yum."}
{"text":"Update: I'm pleased to say the bar door is closed as the default. It really smells much better and I sat purposely close to the door just to see how good or bad it was."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good. Had the carnitas tacos. I forgot to say no cilantro, so I didn't like it too much. But the parts that didn't have cilantro was really good."}
{"text":"A solid option for a quick meal with the possibility of a healthy meal. The number of choices here set this slightly above similar restaurants for me.

Inside the restaurant and outside on the patio there is plenty of seating. They even have a separate bar with a full drink menu and gaming. The vibe in the restaurant is designed to feel like a beachside hangout. 

The menu offers a nice selection of tacos, burritos, enchiladas, salads, and bowls. There were plates with the option for one or two enchiladas. Sides offered a choice of a couple of types of rice and a couple of bean types. Each meal is available with a protein and there are about half a dozen meat and non-meat options. 

My enchilada meal was good, I liked both the red and green sauce. The rice and beans were okay. My husband enjoyed his burrito too. We also ordered chips and salsa that were good. I'd say none of the food was the best I've ever had, but it was inexpensive and a fast option."}
{"text":"Wahoo's Fish Taco is my default place to eat when we can't decide on anything better. So, in my family, I eat Wahoo's A LOT! As a matter of fact, I should get tested for too much exposure to Mecury at this point. Do I ever crave Wahoo's? Never. But I never mind eating it anytime of the day. 

The only addictive item at Wahoo's for me is Mr. Lee's sauce. I put that on everything. It costs $1 as a side, which is STEEEP considering the cheap menu. A little known secret is that you should ask them to put that in your burritos, taquitos, enchiladas etc for FREE!"}
{"text":"Had a shrimp taco and a mushroom taco, both very good. Food came out reasonably fast and the price was fair. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"This place won't be getting second business, went in and ordered a shrimp burrito which was great, but also ordered a fish taco to try. The fish taco tasted off and asked for it to be sent back to get another kind or a refund. The worker said he'd talk to the chef about it. Waited for a bit and nothing happened. Saw the guy cleaning table on the other side. Didn't get a new taco or my money back: I don't like to make scenes so just came to the result that won't be going back"}
{"text":"I'm revising my review as I came back here and had an entirely different experience. Food is consistent and great as usual and the wait time was minimal. Shannon is a great bartender and was very welcoming and makes the best micheladas!"}
{"text":"First time here... I love places like this, we ordered Taquitos as an appetizer, then husband had the grilled fish bowl, I had the pork bowl..   Quick, friendly service, Taquitos unremarkable, can get those anywhere... Husband liked the grilled fish, cooked well, beans and rice seasoned well, large portions, I took half of mine home for dinner that night.  Very good, coming back to try fish tacos.  thumbs up"}
{"text":"Love this place! Jesse provided us with outstanding service. I just moved to this area, and I'm looking forward to coming back often."}
{"text":"I moved to Vegas from California, so I was pretty familiar with Wahoo's already.
I can say that a Wahoo's with a bar/gaming area is even better!

As far as the food, it's always really on point. I almost always get a salad every time. They are super fresh, full packed, and their dressings are not only delicious, but healthy as well. I love their new Kai Kale salad. They've done a great job adding the kale and masking the bitterness of it by chopping the kale into smaller pieces and mixing it in with other greens. It's such a simple idea, but no one is doing this. If you love salad, do yourself a favor and order one of theirs. Their tofu is also really really good. I don't know if it's marinated overnight or what, but it's super flavorful. 

As far as the bar service, it can be super hit or miss. We've had some amazing bartenders here, and then some that are not so good. Michael (I think that's his name...he has a New York accent) is an amazing bartender. He's helpful with his suggestions, super super friendly, always smiling, and very attentive. The rest of the bartenders here could take a couple notes from this guy.

Unfortunately, since this place is always packed with industry regulars you might end up getting ignored for awhile because of bartender favoritism."}
{"text":"been to wahoos many times and loved it, the bartender candi was very awesome, polite and helpful always on top of her game, kitchen staff was fast with my food order and always polite and professional"}
{"text":"Not at all impressed. Food is mediocre at best. No salsa bar. Ordered carne asada tacos, tortilla soup & Maui onion rings.
All MEH. Tacos were not fresh tasting, meat was bland, onion rings were greasy and tortilla soup was ok.
Being a fan of Cafe Rio and Baja Fresh, this place pales in comparison. Such a shame that it occupies such a great space in this mall."}
{"text":"Super awesome Fish Tacos, best ive had in Vegas.  Cajun style, so good.  Great happy hour, the chips n salsa and Guac are awesome.  Super cheap for the awesome food you get."}
{"text":"I've been curious about Wahoo's since I saw it appear in Boca Park. I'm probably behind the times here, it's probably been open for YEARS, but I've never made my way here. 

Typically I head to Rubio's if I want fish tacos, but I happened to be in the area and Wahoo's was close. Because I'm comparing the fish tacos to many, many fish tacos I have eaten in my day the rating is low. 

The inside of the restaurant is a little out-there for me - the artwork on the tables, the over-done surfer theme, etc. I get it, but it's kind of too in your face.

Service was OK. I got my food to-go so I can't comment on much besides the woman who took my order. I asked for recommendations and she couldn't really help me out, so I just said, give me fish tacos. But then I had to go through - do I want them Cajun style? Do I want a combo? Do I want cole slaw/regular dressings on them? The good thing here is - the variety.

I ended up with a 2-taco combo with brown rice and black beans. The rice was disappointing mostly because I expect rice to have a bit more flavor at joints like this, especially with the \"taco\" theme (think: spice, not: bland). Beans were well-cooked and flavorful. 

Tacos - I got one of each: one regular fish, one Cajun flavored. Believe me, get the Cajun flavored all the way. The regular fish taco was a huge let down compared to the Cajun. I also got the slaw topping, which was OK, save for the bits of CILANTRO I had to pick out of my tacos. *shakes in disgust* All in all the flavors are there, but these fish tacos were a bit on the small side IMO.

Overall I've had better fish tacos elsewhere and I will most likely be heading to Rubio's the next time I have a craving."}
{"text":"Best fish tacos!!! These tacos... I can't praise them enough! I like the citrus slaw, spicy grilled and some Me. Lee's sauce! Go to the bar and see Shannon, she is so much fun! Great service and personality.  I love the surf/skate/snow decor in the place. And again...the food is just. Amazing."}
{"text":"Had the steak tacos - just ok nothing great.  I would go to Rubio's always compared to Wahoo's."}
{"text":"Pretty great tacos, and extremely nice staff who goes above and beyond to make your visit enjoyable.
As a plus, it's a sit down style restaurant (order, they bring you your food) where the food comes out very quickly. If you're in a hurry, I'd still recommend it!
I'll definitely be back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Very Good.....and consistent.  Service is great.  The young lady who has taken our order the last 2 times is very pleasant.  The food is great.  Fast service.  My husband loves the wahoo bowl w the Cajun beans and brown rice.  He eats the entire meal...which is odd for him.  I love everything I have tried including the amazing guacamole.  One of our faves!"}
{"text":"Revamped the menu & waaaayyy better! Had the fried baja rolls & dont know if the green sauce or the rolls tasted better.... Bomb!!! Then me an wifey split the machaca burrito (of course wet fools! ) red sauce!!! Substituted pork for carne... Freakin awesome... Changed staff of as late with a crew from hooters (yay!) Jen & tammy are the best female tenders in town! Would hire them at my joint anyday! Be back again.... Used to dislike this place but am a regular now!"}
{"text":"I couldn't wait to try their fish tacos here! When I got to the counter I was disappointed because they don't do fried fish tacos. I was bummed but I decided to try the Cajun fish taco, with a beef taco just in case I didn't like the fish. The fish taco was delicious especially when it's served with the Wahoo's Green sauce. The green sauce is a sour cream base with I think Cilantro? I could be wrong but it is so good! The beef taco was tasty. You also get a choice of either white rice or brown rice with your combo. I liked the white rice because they put some type of fresh salsa on the top. It reminds me of what my mom puts on top of white rice tomatoes, onions a little fish sauce. Don't worry this topping doesn't have fish sauce in it. My combo was $6.50. It also comes with black beans or Cajun white beans but I passed on that. 
I also had the Chicken Tortilla Soup for $3.89 it was big bowl for that price. It was light , not salty and soothing after a crazy day at the airport. 

The decor reminded me of the surfer/skater kids I used to go to school with in junior high. I think the way Wahoo chose to decorate their space is much more tasteful than Chronic Tacos. There is no graffiti here just random stickers. It was also cool how the bar is glass enclosed in the middle of the restaurant. I can't wait till the one in Boca Park opens!"}
{"text":"Great, quick service, great food! I used to go to the ones in SoCal, and this is exactly the same. Love it!"}
{"text":"The tacos here are on point. My coworkers and I come here for lunch sometimes, and they always have fast service.  Almost everything I have had here was delicious, with exception of the chicken bowl; It's just kind of.. lacking flavor.  But everything else is delicious and I would recommend to anyone who likes food."}
{"text":"First time in a long time I recieved a very great experience ordering my food. Brianna H., was very friendly, i was actually recommended something and offered drinks and a side.. Usually I don't get a happy cashier or any sort of recommendations. Definitely try the Shredder Sandwich!!"}
{"text":"This joint never Disappoints!!  The reef burrito, wet. With their red sauce is delicious!! Their staff always treat us with respect, and always answer our questions regarding the menu!! We always eat here in Vegas and their California locations!!"}
{"text":"I like this place - cheap and tasty tacos, decent service, fun atmosphere. I usually order at the bar - the best bartenders in my opinion are Ginny and Gene. They are always friendly and deliver great service. I usually order a vegetarian taco and a grilled fish taco. My last visit I ordered a vegetarian taco and a cheese enchilada (see pics). The cheese enchilada was just meh but it had awesome Wahoos green sauce which is good. The vegetarian taco (not the one w the grilled veggies, I don't like that one) comes with black beans and rice inside, plus I always order green sauce and guac on the side. Good stuff."}
{"text":"Finally they opened this place up in Henderson on Horizon & 95 and this place is awesome.  

No matter what your taste, meat eater, vegetarian, they have something for you.  The food is awesome, the drinks are plentiful and the staff is very friendly.

We used to stop at this place on Rainbow & 215 and it is great that they finally have one on this side of town.  If you have never been, you need to go.  The food is great, the prices are right and they also have gaming and a bar for the drinkers and players.  This place is a must to try at least twice...."}
{"text":"My mom goes do dialysis next door to this place three times a week. I have only ordered food once but what I got wasn't even close to what I ordered. I do go in to grab a soda every now and then. Almost 3 bucks seems a bit high but whatever. I wish they would let me at least grab a free refill or something but the rule is \"once you go outside you have to pay for more drink\". Rules are rules I guess. The girl at the counter could have been nicer about it."}
{"text":"A-M-A-Z-I-N-G chicken bowl w black beans & brown rice. So healthy and flavorful.  Great  value."}
{"text":"This place is bomb! I come here all the time for the outer reef burrito. The staff are always friendly, especially Michael who has an energy that is contagious. Although this isn't a normal sit down, have a waiter type of place you get asked how your food is and how you're doing multiple times by different people. Great service and great food."}
{"text":"This new location was filthy when I went. The fish tasted odd like it had turned.  I will not be back."}
{"text":"Solid fish tacos and great service. The lady (sorry I didn't catch your name!) who took our order was very helpful and informative as it was our first time here. & Thank you Caesar for being attentive and taking good care of our table. 

Came in on Tuesday during lunch for their free taco with any drink purchase - it's a great all-Tuesday deal! I ordered two of the 1988 tacos with fish and a soda. (Had to opt out of the free beer for checking in because of work :'(, but don't forget about it!)

The tacos have a good heft to them, being about $3.50 per taco, it was worth the price. They also provide a good variety of hot sauces at the table and even soy sauce - if that's your thing. The balance of flavor was great. There was crunch, citrus, and spice. Most importantly, there was enough fish to stand up to the toppings. The fish was also in large pieces and did not break apart while you ate.

Overall, great place for tacos with a casual, beachy atmosphere. Would come again to try other things on their menu."}
{"text":"If you want the WORST EXPERIENCE bar in Las Vegas you gotta try Wahoo's Boca Park. Went in with my wife for a beer and taco and the waitress passed by 5 times and hung out on the other side of the bar. Even served the man beside us and just completely ignore . Finally asked if we were getting served and she just walked away to the other side. We decided to leave after 10 minutes of this and asked her name...answer CAN'T YOU READ, step into the bar to get her name as she was hiding it and got told to get the hell out of her bar.Yelling and screaming get the hell out of my bar! 
Called her boss, on vacation for 2 weeks and contacted head office in Cali. At first they emailed right back, then it was we have to see video, then it was main guy was away. Finally local manager contacted me and we meet. Now this guy comes up with some story we were cursing at her, and some older lady agreed( think it was a friend of the bar tender??)so she was justified. Maybe I should have but sorry still a gentlemen.
I'm 64 yrs old and my wife was with me , why would I embarrass myself in a 2 bit surf bar such a way. Conclusion I stopped the emails as they hoped it would just go away. 
The owners acted the same as the staff, JUST IGNORE THE ISSUE IT WILL GO AWAY!
I own 2 business and my staff would have been let go instantly for this service, oh yea but I forgot she was friends with the owner and had a gaming clientele.
You just gotta go there and have the short fat one with the twin peaks serve you, sorry ignore you. If you love to be abused, lied and threatened  this is the place for you.
Conclusion the business is a reflection of its leadership WORST BAR IN MY 64 YEARS  MANAGEMENT AND OWNERSHIP. AND YOU CAN GO FOR ABUSE TOO !"}
{"text":"The customer service here isn't the greatest, but my SO and I have recently discovered that their fish tacos are actually pretttty darn good.

Every taco has a nice, meaty cut of fish. No skimpy filet here! We order it Cajun, as I'm sure the regular grilled fish tastes bland or rather ordinary. The Cajun fish tacos are best with citrus slaw and is worth the few extra cents. Although the fish is inconsistent (sometimes perfectly flaky, other times, dry), I really do enjoy the flavors: the fish is spicy and flavorful, the slaw is crunchy and tangy, and the tortilla it is so delicately wrapped in is slightly sweet.

I honestly don't feel comfortable sitting here or staying too long. It doesn't look very neat. The walls are a cool shade of blue and covered in posters and signs. Coming inside, there's a bar to the right, which I assume is for sports fans who like to chomp on burritos while watching a game. 

Overall, I'd endure having to talk to someone with little to no genuine interest in customer satisfaction just to have a few perfect bites of fish-y goodness... To go, of course."}
{"text":"Fantastic food for a reasonable price.  Great service.  Taco Tuesday, get a free taco when you buy a drink.  Check out happy hour deals"}
{"text":"Wahoo's is your typical american-Mexican place, which I usually do not have a problem with as long as the flavors are there.  Unfortunately, thats not the case here. The atmosphere is hip and pretty laid back, however, the food is pretty mediocre. Wahoos has nothing on cafe rio! They do have a bar are which is usually pretty fun with an outside patio so its not like most Mexican restaurants. I would recommend the place for happy hour drinks but not necessarily for the food!"}
{"text":"I practically lived here during my lunch breaks from work. The Bonzai burrito is the best burrito I have ever had. We need a Wahoos to come to the East Side."}
{"text":"This place is exceptional! Their fish and shrimp tacos are absolutely amazing! Bartenders Joey, Shannon and Cheryl are the best!"}
{"text":"I've never yelped before and decided with the latest experience I had at Wahoos I had too!!  My good friends LOVE this place and RAVE about everything about Wahoos (they are from Cali).  My friend and I went in the other night to feed our kids and have a cocktail close to home.  Since we had our kids we decided to do them a favor and sit on the patio so we wouldn't disturb the customers inside (keep in mind it was 100 degrees outside too).  The kids had to go to the bathroom once or twice, refill there drinks, they got our order wrong, etc.  All of these required us to go back inside.  We got a very bad attitude from the young hostess and dirty looks, she even TOLD one of my kids to keep the door closed.  Its not our fault when you open your door its stays open.  She could have easily came and closed it or asked in a different way. Seriously the attitude was horrible and then the food came and it was just as bad..  I will say this though, the cheese nachos were good :).  Anyway, I will never return back to this restaurant and don't appreciate the treatment we got, if you have kids and want good food don't waste your time or money going to Wahoos on Horizon!"}
{"text":"Maybe they are just working out the kinks. The food really was kind of pedestrian. They screwed up part of the order and brought a burrito an not a bowl. Took almost 15 minutes to get the bowl. The food was kind of bland and the chips were marginal."}
{"text":"Things I love:

Tacos
Taco Salads
Grilled fish
Carne asada
Delicious Mexi food in general

Places that have all of the above for a very affordable price:

Wahoo's

Nuff said? No. Believe me, there's more to say. I just moved to this side of town and am SO EXCITED that there's a Wahoo's near me.  Their Chicken Tortilla soup is SO legit.

I stopped in last night about 30 minutes before they closed and was so sad that they had closed a little early because it was so dead (first week of school I guess).  BUT THEN, the owner (or maybe manager?) saw how sad my face was and he opened back up for us!! WHAT?!??! Awesome customer service.  

Oh - and they have a fully stocked bar too.  I don't usually drink when I'm getting casual Mexi, but I think I may have to change that - they have about every kind of liquor you can imagine (and every flavor of Vodka you can think of).  

Like Arnold says, \"I'll be back!\""}
{"text":"All Wahoo's I had been are always great....the food, the service. Keep up the excellent work!!"}
{"text":"No detailed review needed. There is no reason to go anywhere else. Always fantastic food, paying machines, but most importantly, the service is unparalleled. Whether Shannon, Cheryl, Amanda, Joey, Chris or anyone else on the team, never once felt like they're not taking care of me, packed or not. Keep it up guys (and gals)!!!"}
{"text":"By far the best for fast, fresh and healthy foods. Salads are super filling and have tons of creative ingredients which is rare-also they're super reasonable... tonight I decided to be extra chubby and try the taco sampler-which prompted this review. 
Chicken, fish and carnitas-all bomb! My fav was the carnitas. The chicken was nice and not dry as I'd expected. The fish was good as well which I don't like fish usually. 
I'd say you can feel good eating here and also feeding your family here."}
{"text":"I wasn't entirely excited to go to Wahoo's, but I was in the mood for fish tacos. I've only been to Wahoo's one time prior and it was a decent experience.

FYI, chips and salsa are NOT complimentary nor do they come with your meal. Our cashier asked us, \"Do you want chips and salsa?\" after we ordered our meal, so we said yes. She didn't tell us we were purchasing it or how much it would cost. We didn't know she was adding it to our bill based on how it was presented to us.

I went with the Citrus Slaw Tacos with fish (these are only available a la carte) and Ruben got a Cajun Fish bowl with brown rice and black beans. The tacos were just okay. The fish did not have enough seasoning, so almost zero flavor and the slaw was a joke. There was literally one shred of carrot on one taco and the other taco had just one shred of purple cabbage. Basically, it did not satisfy my fish taco craving and made me really sad. The rice bowl wasn't any better in terms of seasoning or flavor. Even with the addition of hot sauce.

We also ordered Cajun Fries, but for some reason, when I said \"Cajun Fries,\" the cashier thought I said \"Loaded Nachos\" (this isn't even on the menu, but I guess it's offered at other Wahoo's locations and perhaps the bar area?) and charged me for it. We didn't realize what happened until the food was brought to us, so I had to go to the cashier to re-order and correct my transaction. The fries were all right with non-existent Cajun seasoning. Maybe the cashier forgot to tell the kitchen that it was Cajun instead of regular fries."}
{"text":"This place had a cool atmosphere and the staff was friendly but the food was disappointing. We had a taco, an enchilada, and a wet burrito and all were not good. The onion rings tasted frozen and the ingredients in our meals tasted like they were old and cheap. Probably a fun place to have some drinks but not so good for dinner"}
{"text":"Stopped in today for a quick lunch. Having been in the service  Industry some years back, this would have to go down as the worst service ever. I asked for choices of wine and was given one. I noticed later on a bar placard that there were other options. I asked the bartender for a glass of water when I ordered the glass of wine.   Upon the 3rd request, she set the water glass down so hard that water flew out.  I could understand somewhat if the place was busy, but, what I observed was her being busy chatting.

We come here every couple of months but will have to rethink as there are way too many restaurants in town to go somewhere where the service is so poor and bartender is rude."}
{"text":"We moved to Vegas a year ago from Orange County and are so glad Wahoo's is \"in the area\" (well, somewhat) to remind us of home when we get nostalgic, having lived off your tacos, rolls, bowls, salsa and amazing customer service for 20+ years in the OC. We are fans for life! I only have one request: PLEASE CONSIDER ADDING A LOCATION CLOSER TO LAKE LAS VEGAS! We are dying over here for good restaurants. We'd eat a heck of a lot more Wahoos if there was one closer to us. I know lots of my neighbor peeps who would frequent regularly and who think Horizon is too far of a drive...(hint: The new Cadence shopping center going in where flagship Smith's is being built would be ideal!!). Please consider real estate over by the Lake Las Vegas, Henderson area!!"}
{"text":"Dropped in for a late night snack and drink after 11:30. Not many places were open around the area save for Hooters. We wanted to eat something that may come on buns but we weren't necessarily looking to be served by a pair of buns stuck in front of our faces every now and then. Wahoo's Fish Tacos was open. Somehow the name looked familiar after coming back from a recent Pensacola baseball game. It's a fish and their mascot!

The place was quiet and only the bar was open. Since we wanted beer and food without inhaling smoke we didn't go to PT's. If you want your year's worth of smoke in your lungs, PT's (I think their name stands for Pulmonary Terriblus?) is your place.

Ordered the 3 tacos and draft beer for $10. They let you choose from a few choices of fish tacos. Beef (what'd you expect in a fish taco?) shrimp, fish, and something else. But those were the 3 I ordered. It came pretty freshly made with lettuce tomato and some green sauce I suspect is another variation of 1000 Island (what else is in diner/pub sauce, really???). It was okay. Ingredients were fresh but it wasn't tasty or anything. But I can tell you it was not greasy though. I'll have to come back some other time and see what the rest of the menu is like. Daytime might be better when the full time cooks are flaming up I assume.

Place was quiet and we had a good place to talk and drink for a while."}
{"text":"I would give them 0 stars, for tricking me into thinking they were going to taste like my California favorite-- 
Ok I went once and it was DISGUSTING- they have this green sauce, I dont know WTF that was but EW-- fish was OVERLY salty and the rice was hard--

my  husband begged me to go with him, he did not go to round #1, I thought well maybe since it is lunch hour it will be busier and fresher??

STILL EWW-- SAVE YOUR MONEY, go in CA and dream of Wahoos, cause this WILL NOT fulfill that craving at all.. in fact it made it WORSE!! 
I disliked so much that I wrote Wahoos, and I got a gift certificate in the mail, for the one in VEGAS hahahaha I WILL NEVER use that certificate, ever!!!

Ill stick with Rubios I guess-"}
{"text":"We stopped in after hanging out with some friends in the area. The bar staff was great. Gene was a very happy go lucky guy and made us rookies feel like long time bar flies after a few minutes. Drinks were made very good and service was great. Food was just ok but better than your average bar food like pizza and wings. If I'm in the area again I would stop back by and grab a few cold ones. Thanks y'all."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today and had a good experience.  I give it three stars for the food quality, flavor, and the details (stocked soda station etc.). The decor was good; however, it would have been better if more time was spent investing in quality food.  I got the shrimp bowl and added pico de gallo, white rice, black beans, and lettuce.  I had the cilantro dressing with it.  There was a fair amount of shrimp which was nice.The thing was, it was the cheap tiny little baby shrimps. I was really disappointed with that since it was the basis of my meal.  The prices were relatively reasonable, but baby shrimp with rice and beans is definitely not worth the eight bucks i paid.  The pico was okay, it didn't have too much flavor.  The soda station was not fully stocked at all which was strange because it was not busy at all.  I liked the bar lay out with the open garage like doors.  Go ahead and give this place a try if you really want, but chiptole or baja fresh are MUCH better tasting and you get way more bang for your buck!!!"}
{"text":"I am picky, and when I try a restaurant for the first time I want a bite of this and a bite of that and with the sauces on the side so I can taste each part separate and together. Add to this our family of more than 2 adults, that all have different food preferences. So getting the items separated makes it easier for everyone to try a bite of something different - this was our first time ever, eating at Wahoo's and they Rock. They put everything in separate containers as requested and EVEN labeled each item (above and beyond) and the delivery was 10 min early on a Saturday - 5 stars - but gave 4 because some of the food didn't taste as we expected, it was yummy but each of us like different things and different parts, so overall the food WAS really good, from what we ordered we recommend: chicken Outer Reef Burrito - chicken SCReaM'N Burrito - steak Street Tacos - you're on your own when it comes to the sauces, because again we differ on choices. heads up if you do not like cilantro, don't get the green sauce - which is quite tasty if you DO like cilantro - but cilantro is love it or hate it, and this applies to the green sauce here, as some loved it, and some didn't? ..."}
{"text":"Nice place to chic chat with friends having a cold beer or a glass of wine. The fish taco's are good. Made with Ono (wahoo). Had the Maui onions Very taste. I will return."}
{"text":"I am a restaurant owner and I know from experience that guests usually use Yelp for negative comments or really positive reviews,,,, my family and I came in and had a wonderful experience. The person who greeted us (Jesse) was friendly and helped us throughout the whole ordering process. Our whole family received our food in a short period of time and we all thoroughly enjoyed every bite and was more than enough to fill is up. Thank you for the great service and great food...we will be back for more!!!"}
{"text":"I don't think this location can handle a lunch crowd. It took 25 mins (on my 1 hr lunch) to get my food. Service is very slow."}
{"text":"I was so glad to know that wahoos had come to town. As a former OC resident I don't have to make a trip to California to get my fix. 

I walked into the separate bar area and had a beer. The staff was friendly and quick to service your needs. I ordered some food and ended up meeting a friend there. We had a great time catching the end of the Thursday night football game on their nice new tvs. 

We would definitely be back for the service, cheap and tasty food, and food atmosphere"}
{"text":"Fell in love with the shrimp tacos on my last visit but wasn't feeling taco-y this go 'round. Decided to try a salad WITH the shrimp. This may have been the best decision I have made in a long time. I couldn't eat it fast enough and I wanted more!!!! If you like the shrimp try it in the salad. Healthier and just as tasty!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I got shrimp and fish tacos. They were bland, nothing special. I don't understand what the hype is about."}
{"text":"DUDE!!

This place is awesome. I came here because my friend had a job interview at the plaza next door so as I was killing time I saw they had a 2.95 beer special. To my surprise it was Leinenkugel Lemon Shandy. Totally took me by surprise having this already, considering it's still early Spring. When you're a kick ass bar like Wahoo's, it's no wonder you've got cool beers on tap.

Shannon, this girl knows her stuff. She totally blew us away by showing us the menu. She WOW'd me with all the cool, delicious items on the menu. I only came in for a beet, like I said I was here killing time as I was waiting for my friend's interview. Shannon, well she literally won me on the tacos. She wouldn't let me leave until I tried one, and I am so glad she did!  BEST TACOS EVER. Not even joking. I ordered the spicy chicken taco, and my god. It was heaven all over my taste buds. 


The best part, tomorrow is Taco Tuesday so I'm going back for sure! Buy any drink & get a free taco!


Totally nice meeting a killer Bartender like Shannon, it just happens to be that she works at the coolest bar ever."}
{"text":"Service sucks! Bar area is a smoke filled room with worse service then the food area...what a let down. Great location for something good. Just NOT THIS. Ugh...hoping for a good place to open in this area soon. FINISHING my review 8-29-2013 I went back cause a friend said his buddy runs the place. MISTAKE AGAIN. I WILL NOT RETURN. POOR POOR BAR SERVICE & \"dining area\" haha more like a middle school lunch room. They really need to get rid of the front area where YOU STAND and wait to order.They should put tables in and hire actual wait staff!"}
{"text":"Great staff, very attentive. Meal was average appetizer was a little better. Will give it another try in the future."}
{"text":"It's odd to not be able to find a place to eat that's open past 10 p.m. in Las Vegas, but my boyfriend & I were struggling on a Wednesday night. Everything still open on Rainbow was either fast food or AYCE, which is how we stumbled upon Wahoo's Fish Tacos because it's open 24/7.
 
It's hidden in a corner off the main road that people usually do not drive by. There wasn't anyone else there eating, but there were a few people in the bar area, which was in a separate section. I liked how the decor gave off a surfer/skater vibe.

My boyfriend ordered a \"Paleo Bowl\" & I ordered a \"Loaded Quesadilla.\" The salmon is good. It was very filling & not a bad price!

If there are other restaurants open, then I would go to that, but if it's late night, I might just come back!"}
{"text":"I didn't care for this place. Frankly I think it's overrated and a little pricey for what you get. The service was meh. I liked that they have outdoor seating which is great for people with a dog but overall I think this place isn't great. The food was somewhat tasty but I've had better for less."}
{"text":"We saw this place being built and were excited to see it. We don't have many restaurant choices out here in Hendertucky.

We went there after a week of them opening which was probably too soon. 

The girl taking the order was very pleasant and she made sure the order was correct. Her trainer was right behind her keeping an eye on her for accuracy. 

I had the fish tacos which were good. They kids enjoyed their quesadillas too.

My GF, her meal came out wrong twice. The owner came out and entertained the kids by giving them stickers to stick someplace on the wall. We were waiting for him to say something about the meal being made wrong but he never did. It was pretty busy and everyone was still trying to figure out their jobs with it just opening. Maybe the info didn't get to him, who knows.

We will be back after its been open a while and hopefully have a better experience."}
{"text":"I am from the Southern California area. I used to eat at Wahoo's ALL the time when I was there. I grew up next to the original location in Costa Mesa.

I was really excited to see one open right down the street from where I live - Rainbow/215.

The format is different here in Vegas. It's 24hrs and it's a gaming bar as well. I work in the industry, so I stop there about 11:30 pm (after work) for a beer and the famous fish tacos :)

They are going to have to step up their game if I'm going to keep coming, because the service is lousy and getting worse. They are distracted with no sense of urgency and no focus on serving ... Simply put, I am one of the easiest people on earth to serve, and consistently one of the MOST generous patrons where ever I go. 

No one in this town at that level seems to give a shit about serving anyone but their friends ... I'm way more generous than they are ...

{"text":"Really good clean food. Brown rice available.  White Cajun beans or black beans. Fish, Chicken, Pork, Vegetarian.  Tacos, bowls,wraps. Separate dining area for groups or families.  Nice bar area and outdoor dining. Friendly staff. Slot club available too. Flat screen t.vs too."}
{"text":"My boyfriend is from Huntington Beach, CA and he was raving about Wahoo's for a while.  We finally decided to try it and i was surprised at how BAD it was.  I will admit, i am a bit of a snob when it comes to food (not price-wise, but taste-wise), but this was really really disappointing.  We ordered two combo platters -- one fish tacos and one burrito platter to go.  Upon arriving home we discovered that there was no burrito and they gave us two taco platters instead....oh well....$1.50 price difference wasnt worth the drive back.  Tacos were tasteless, fish was dry and not seasoned, even salsa was bland.  White rice was OK, but then you have to really try to mess that up.  I dont think that i will be eating here again.  Tacos Mexico on Trop. blows this place out of the water and they use fish sticks!!!!!"}
{"text":"Fresh, clean seafood and Mexican dishes in a fun, Southern California surf/skate decor. The thing to stress about Wahoo's over other taco and burrito places is that the plates have plump, good quality vegetables and meats, and are *not* just yellowing iceberg lettuce on a splat of greasy ground beef."}
{"text":"Grilled fish taco was awesome!  Taquitos were solid but Baja rolls were just ok. My wife and I sat at the bar and felt like we were outsiders and service was rushed on us to get us in and out. Female bartender should be a prison guard but the big guy was friendly enough behind the bar. We'll probably go back but sit on patio facing the door."}
{"text":"Picked up take out and the food was really good.
We waited by the fire pit on the deck while we waited for the food."}
{"text":"So gross. Ordered the carne asada tacos and the meat tastes just like rubber. It was sooooo gross."}
{"text":"Our second time at this place,  once again the food was consistent and freshly made. The staff is always very pleasant and polite.  

The atmosphere was very comfortable and open.  They have a  couple of tvs that is on the sports channel, which is sitting above an island bar in the restaurant.

the part i love most about this place is the decor...reminds me of home (hawaii) and so everytime i come, that is how i feel when i am in there.  Its very open and laid back...that atmosphere works for me..then the food is light and yummy...i will defineitly be back."}
{"text":"I was skeptical about this place but was pleasantly surprised.

I ordered a combo plate with one fish taco and one shrimp.
They don't fry the seafood, it's freshly grilled and really tasty.

I got the Cajun beans and white rice. Both were perfect. I liked how the beans had a slight spiciness.

I'd recommend this place and come back to have a beer with my food."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised by this place! Ordered takeout fish tacos with rice and beans, solid meal all around"}
{"text":"Went with a friend to have a few drinks and Tacos for Cinco De Mayo. Sat at the bar and waited for the bartender to ask our drink order, etc. He looked at us several times but never said a word to us. He just continued helping other people. They weren't crazy busy...in fact there were several seats open. He didn't even look over to tell us he would be with us shortly...nothing. We sat for 15 minutes and still nothing. We finally got up and left. As we were walking out he just looked at us. We weren't rude nor did we do anything that would justify such horrible service? We took our business elsewhere. 
So frustrating. I've never been ignored at a restaurant with out a reason in my life. Even the busiest of places at least tell you they are busy and will be with you as soon as they can. 
Wahoos will not be getting anymore of my money. Ever. 
Big time fail."}
{"text":"Has really started circling the drain over the last year. Poor service at both Las Vegas locations lately. They both don't listen when you order and have less than little care about providing a good product. My burrito was not what I ordered and my wife's quesadilla had no cheese, weird would be nice since that is the main ingredient. Have given up on this local franchise. Too bad love the menu. Will had to be a Cali location thing only I guess.

After this post the manager made contact and attempted to make our visit right."}
{"text":"Not a bad place for a SoCal wanna be fish joint . had the signature fish tacos, give it 3 stars for that but, the wait staff have issues in communication asked for no beans no rice got a bowl full of beans. Asked for a kids quesadilla, got a appetizer one instead . Watched an employee drop a ramekin on the floor in the kitchen ,then pick it up ,fill it and take it to a table?! After a quick talk with the manager who backed his employees instead of the guest.  I had to drop the star lots of other joints lime or better than this one in town i recomend going to one of them instead of this one!"}
{"text":"Great place to come for a quick bite! The service was fast and very attentive. I sat at the bar portion of the restaurant because me and the hubby wanted to grab a drink. During happy hour the bar has good drink prices and we took at vantage of that...including $4 wells. I also liked the multiple TVs they had to watch the game. 

I ordered a salad and was given the option to chose my protein. I was glad to see that tofu was one of them. My hubby ordered three tacos and they also had the option to choose three different proteins for each. 

The food was good and my salad portion was hearty. The salad I ordered came with corn, black beans, mixed greens, tortilla chips and tofu. Everything was flavored well and there wants any need to additional dressing. 

 Effie coming here I would recommend looking for specials and coupons. I got one on the mail for a free entree. I know they advertise in a couple of places so it shouldn't be too hard to find a deal."}
{"text":"The food was alright, I guess.  Nothing too great about it but not horrible either. My wife had the Fish Tacos and she's a huge fish tacos fan.  She said they weren't really that great.  I had a Chicken Bowl and was pretty disappointed to get chicken, beans, and rice.  That's it.  Apparently you have to pay extra if you want anything else.  There was no salsa, sour cream, lettuce, veggies, nothing.  I really don't like when restaurants make you pay for all that extra stuff.  Especially when you're a fast-ish food Mexican restaurant.  At least, I think it's a Mexican restaurant.  It's hard to tell with \"cajun\" beans and Mr. Lee's sauce.  Doesn't make much sense. 
 
Pretty sure I don't need to go back and pay $7.99 for a \"bowl\" with only three things inside it.  But on the plus side they have happy hour from 3-7 for half priced beers.  Wish they had mor local stuff on tap though."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite place to come on my day off. If I'm a little strapped I can always still get something great and if I am blessed to splurge I can get something awesome haha rice and beans here are the best and out due any other type here in vegas, wahoos is a must try"}
{"text":"5 STARS for their great food, great service and professionalism of each employee and the beach blonde, board short wearin', slipper floppin' owner who was very attentive to his consumers, but..
Being that I am a part-time beach bum, I love Wahoos.. In Cali.  Their healthier portions go hand in hand with fresh air, salty beach water and sand between your toes.  But to have a Wahoos in Vegas!?  In the freakin' 125 degree desert where the lifestyle is chicken wings and beer at 3 o'clock in the morn just doesn't fly.  The venue surrounds its customers with surf boards, wake boards, skate boards and snow boards.. And then I walk out and i'm still in the epicenter of bone dry desert heat.  Wahoos is just playin' tricks on me.  Also, the building is just way.. too.. big.. with a back bar included.  Vegas already has Hooter's, Friday's and every dive bar known to mankind within a miles radius to take care of our alcoholism.  My suggestion?  If you are going to serve healthy and fresh, take away the bar.  Also, shrink the place down just a tad and make it more convenient like a Subways or Chipotle and smack your piece of Real Estate next some gym or inside a food court.  I don't know.. Just my 2 cents."}
{"text":"1st of all, I consider this a hidden gem around boca park. Its not your typical taco shop but more of a up scale type. I tried the Kelua pork bowl with brown rice and man! Its bomb!!! I expected it to literally be in a bowl but it was served in a big plate with some veggies and beans. I can't wait to try other dishes but so far, it is very very tasty. 
2nd of all, alot of parking stalls so it is not a problem. One thing to keep in mind is the lunch rush hour, we arrive around 12pm and a line greeted us. It did not take long though a good 10 min wait, but the great part of it. A big menu is facing your direction so you would not notice the time while reading other dishes. 
Lastly, I love the decorations focused more in a Hawaiian theme well it gives right. Wahoo Fish Taco, you will find many brands around the area. From a signed surf board to snowboard."}
{"text":"When I was a college student at UC Irvine, my wife (then girlfriendat the time) and I loved to go to any of the 3 Wahoos locations we lived near. I always went with the Kahuna grande - a fish taco, three tasty taquitos (chicken, pork, beef or fish, my fav). Fast forward about 15 years and about 500 miles and the legit surfer grub we used to nosh on has found its way to the desert! I was so stoked when the Westside Rainbow location opened up, but to be completely honest, that location felt like any other Vegas bar and grill. The new Horizon Ridge location, however, delivers all the origibal tastes, vibe and ambience of good ol' Irvine and Newport Beach digs. For a second I felt like I was a twenty year-old in college again until my old man belly knocked my salsa over...haha its a little far for me, but I was told the GV location opens in 6 months! SWEET!"}
{"text":"I had the Teriyaki Kim chi tacos which were amazing. I loved their rice and beans. They have a lot of specials for families with kids and happy hour things going on all the time. I'm just sad they didn't have coke products. They did however have a bar so they do serve alcoholic beverages as well as a cooler upfront by the cashier to grab a beer. It was also weird how you place your order, pay, sit down, they bring it out to you and you leave the trash and everything in the table. It's confusing. So just a heads up leave it. Don't sit there looking around like I did for a trash can. I feel like they should just add trash cans so you don't feel like you have to leave a tip with your plate & trash."}
{"text":"Great beach vibe, wonderful ambiance, good tunes, plenty of TVs, great tacos, oh and did I mention $1.95 sixteen ounce Pacifico's.  This is my go-to spot when you are craving a beer and some great food.  Kick back, relax, and enjoy yourself."}
{"text":"I love Wahoos. I am originally from Orange County so I grew up eating these every time I was near the ocean. So last year when I saw this was open, I was ecstatic to see one here in Las Vegas! I've come a few times and I enjoy the tastes of the fish tacos and the banzai bowl. For people that complain that the fish doesnt taste fresh or it seems like it was frozen, shut up. We live in Las Vegas not Seattle, so take what you can get with fish. I recommend Wahoos to anyone that likes Fish tacos or vegitarian meals."}
{"text":"Oh a regular at another Wahoos? Who'd ever guess that of me? Well needless to say, if there is a Wahoo's near me, I will sniff it out and eat there. This is the second of three Wahoos found in Clark County, all just slightly not as good as the originals in California but respectfully do take care of my fish taco cravings. 

This location I actually prefer over the one off of Rainbow. Its a little brighter and the food is presented much nicer than the other one. One thing I can get on them about is that there are way too many people at the bar at 11 am. I mean really? Starting early much? Also the people at the front should pay a little more attention to the people willing to order instead of worrying about talking to the customers who are drinking."}
{"text":"We tried it once about a year ago.. went back thinking we might of just had a bad first experience but,, same disappointment and a reminder why we hadn't gone back in over a year Mushy, watery salads .. the ingredients do not go well together , not a fan of Wahoos.."}
{"text":"Love this spot! It has a great vibe, great food and cheap beer! And their patio is puppy friendly but fyi it's not kid friendly. Parents think by jumping the patio railing allows their children but it doesn't and you'll be asked to move inside on the opposite side from gaming. They also have a fire pit that's perfect for the cooler nights"}
{"text":"I love this place. I actually didn't realize we had one in Vegas until I drove by it one day. I had only been to one in Denver.

I am a big fan of their bonsai veggies and their tofu. I always get the tacos. I have tried the Spicy Chi, the Citrus Slaw, and the 1984. I can eat like 5 tacos at a time they are so good! I also like to get them in a plate, with Cajun beans and rice. Yum!

The décor is fun. My 3 year old gets stickers everytime we go, and is allowed to put them anywhere she wants on the walls. She loves this. There a separate bar as well. 

It's a little expensive, but oh so good. You also get a free plate if you download their app."}
{"text":"I was really excited to see that Wahoo's was finally coming to Henderson.  Besides PT's, it is the only cool bar and restaurant close enough without going all the way into Vegas.  We walk though the doors and overhear and Taking Back Sunday playing on the radio.  That made me super excited.  The decor is cool with a skate/surf socal vibe.  The line was out the door which I expected from a newly opened business.  We decided to sit  in the bar area to avoid the line, but no one was paying attention and we didn't get any type of recognition for about 15 minutes.  Not even a glass of water or a, \"We'll be right with you\".  Finally, a server noticed us and took our orders.  We got our food and it was delicious, but the wait was pretty disheartening.  With more time, though, I think they'll work out the kinks."}
{"text":"This place has cheap beer with not so flavorful food. It's supposed to be a Baja California inspired fish taco place but I feel like the flavors fall short and everything tastes monotoned.   However it's a good place to hang out with a group for beers and sports because it's not crowded or packed. 

I usually go for the wahoo salad because they give you a really good portion of fish. I always get the roasted pepper dressing because I think it's the best."}
{"text":"Came here for some dinner and drinks. Sat down at a machine and ordered a shot, the bartender asked if I was playing and I said yes. Put some money in and he brought me a shot. I guess my mistake I assumed it was comped like it would be at almost any bar in town if you are gambling. He didn't bring me a check or ask if I want to open a tab. So I order another one, same thing... No check, he didn't ask for money, didnt ask me to leave a card to open a tab. Again, assume its comped because I'm gambling. I keep playing, and ordered a couple more drinks. Next thing I know, he brings me a check for $50. I then politely ask him why every single one of my drinks are on my check and he rudely says \"well that's what you ordered!\" I'm sorry but any other bar you go to, if you're gambling at least ONE of those drinks are comped. I got charged for every single one of my drinks while he made me think they were comped. I don't have a problem paying but when you ask if I'm playing then don't bring me a check I feel like those are not being charged to me as that's how it is at almost any bar here. I love the summerlin location of this bar/restaurant so I'm very disappointed since this is right down the street from me. Guess ill be driving across town where the customer service is MUCH better. Please do not go here!!!!!! Unless you want to get ripped off."}
{"text":"Pretty impressed. Cheap lunch but great food! The fish is fresh and tasty. The beans and rice that come with your meal are really good. I've never had to wait to get a seat and always leave satisfied. Give it a shot! You'll be pleasantly surprised!"}
{"text":"Visited at 9:30 on a Sunday night... just before close. Kim was informative and courteous- she made us feel like we were some of their favorite regulars. The vibe is cool, friendly and laid-back"}
{"text":"All the bartenders make my day! Courteous and attentive! The bar maybe crazy busy but they always bust their tails waiting on people and recognize your face and know regulars names and drinks. And the food is bomb! Tacos and beer... can't go wrong! After a hard night at work it is great to come in on Friday morning and see smiling faces! It's like an old cheers bar! Wins some cash on four card Keno too! Seeing Amanda behind the bar when I walk in is awesome! Her charismatic smile and cheery attitude towards me, my friends, and other patrons is so nice. It's never a rush or worry or a bother, everything just falls into place with her and chills. I love it! Easy to talk to and great listener. Every one there has their own special quirk that makes Wahoos what it is."}
{"text":"I've never heard of Wahoo's Tacos before up until I recently visited my boyfriend's house deep in Henderson. Sadly, I haven't tried them out until I went to Huntington Beach, LA but I am extremely glad that I did! Ever since that day on the beach, I've gone to Wahoo's Tacos at least 2-3 times a week because it is just amazing! I'm a foodie so whenever I try/like something, I get addicted very quick! 

I would highly recommend to stop by! $2 Original Tacos are my absolute favorite! Nothing too fancy or too simple, but it's entirely worth it. They come with lime, pico de gallo and an extra tortilla. Makes everything worth while including the (unfortunately) long wait times! If you're looking for a splash of that Cali lifestyle, Wahoo's will give it to you ;)"}
{"text":"Usually love wahoos.. Always have had a great experience here. But today I came in around lunch hoping to enjoy some margaritas and food with my husband and was very coldly greeted by a bartender who was sitting at the bar (we thought she was a patron at first) who clearly did not want to be there. No smile, no eye contact, no greeting. She tossed some menus on to the bar for me to get up from the booth..  and get myself. When my husband got up and asked if they had a drink menu she said coldly and as short as possible, \"no.\" So he then asked kindly, \"do you have any specialty drinks?\" To which again she said \"no.\" No other options, no other words, no alternatives and not even a menu for beers? I have been to wahoos many times and had specialty margaritas.. and a quick google search shows the vast amount of drinks available. We have never walked out of a restaurant before but we felt so uncomfortable and unhappy we had to leave so we could have a nice enjoyable meal at the OTHER Wahoos location. This Is not a review on the entire restaurant and not the food but rather my experience today with one bartender."}
{"text":"Wahoos was my spot in highschool so much so that I kinda went on burn out. Not only was there one close to my house, there was one near one of my favorite surf spots. I haven't eaten one in years and figured I should check it out. 

I got a grilled fish bowl which comes with a choice of beans and rice and a bit of pico garnish. Fish was a bit dry, they could have taken it off the grill sooner, beans and rice were standard and fine. The BF got a fish burrito and said it was alright.

Ask for some limes and sauces to dress it to your liking. They have sauces they don't really mention on the menu nor ask you if you want like their green sauce, white sauce, teriyaki or the Mr. Lees which is a spicy tomato paste sauce.

I feel like it was somehow better when in HS, but they've been in California for a long time. 

Apparently this is a good spot to watch sports, and there is a patio to enjoy on nice days. Full bar and drink specials are available too.

It's a A-OK spot, specially if you are looking for a inexpensive, somewhat healthier food option."}
{"text":"i've always thought that it would be great for a wahoo's to open up in vegas.  they finally did!

if your in the mood for some fish tacos, this is a nice spot.  they don't have the fried kind (which i prefer), but the fish they do have is a good as its a mild fish taste and meaty.  the other kinds of meats, like the beef and chicken, are good - but nothing out of the ordinary.  in my opinion, they could use a little bit more kick.  this is a good option if your eating healthy as you could substitute for brown rice.  brown rice and fish = a meal to not feel guilty about.

the portions are really large and the prices are decent.  i love their white rice..its seasoned nicely. not a big fan of the white beans though.  i'll like to stick with the normal black.

its brand new and clean so the ambience is great.  theres also a bar with happy hour and i think they even have some slots (only in vegas!).  its kind of hard to find since its not on the main road.  keep on the look out for it near rainbow and sunset."}
{"text":"Tammy at Wahoos on Rainbow/ Sunset is  an AMAZING person and bartender and should be treated as so!  So you walk into a busy bar where they are short staffed! The bartender is running her butt off and working her hardest to make sure everyone has a full drink and is happy! In those situations it's hard to stop and chit chat with everyone due to high demand! Then you get some grumpy impatient people who don't understand that the world doesn't stop just because they have made their presence known! Give credit where credit is due!  If you think you're a person whose never had an off day and ALWAYS made EVERYONE happy at work stop kidding yourself! I bet in this case you must be a miserable person since you would try to drag someone's name through the mud! Take a good look at yourself before yelping and try maybe yelping yourself! None of us walk on water and I'm pretty sure you don't either!"}
{"text":"In the mood for fish tacos I've always wondered about this place and decided to take a gamble. The decor here reminds me of a skate shop with a surfer vibe with stickers everywhere. The menu is pretty simple to choose from and lists the proteins you can choose from. Not just fish the have chicken and steak. Me and my mom both decided on the 2 taco plate with rice and beans. I got one fish and one chicken both Cajun with Cajun beans and white rice. Mom had two fish tacos white rice and black beans.  The place was dead and I should've taken the hint. The food is just whatever. The fish was pretty bland and the chicken nothing Cajun about it. The white rice they served was old and crunchy. Beans had a good spice to them but the only thing that saved this dish was the slaw on top the tacos. It had a citrus dressing to it and was refreshing. It was supposed to be on the side instead of the black beans on my moms plate but I guess the cashier didn't pay attention. The view from the bar area would be nice at night because you can see almost the entire valley including the strip but that would be all I came back here for if I ever didn't decide to have a drink here but it probably won't happen. You can get better fish tacos at del taco."}
{"text":"Service is great! They do have daily specials. Lunch time is a very busy but slows down around 1pm"}
{"text":"Prices are reasonable with decent portions.  Not incredibly sure when exactly happy hour is, but I swear every time I'm there there is some sort of special going on.  Went there on a Sunday at 6pm and had $3 big boy Blue Moons!  Sweet!

I prefer the bar area to the dining room, but it can get full in their pretty quickly.  There's also an outdoor dining area attached tot he bar area that I would think would be awesome for parties.

I'm a fan of the food too - ingredient lists are readily available w/ carlorie count on my items as well.  Super easy to stay on target with your diet (you can also induldge as well - win win for everyone!)"}
{"text":"What the hell?

Wahoo's famous fish taco is really a dry, flavorless lump of crusty fishfunk.  I would have gotten more satisfaction staying home and eating nasty mincemeat fish sticks!

If you want a real fish taco, go to Rubio's!

Edit:  The manager of this location, Victor, sent me a private message asking me to return and give this location another shot.  I have added a star because I appreciate managers who are communicative.  MAYBE, just maybe, I'd give this place another shot if I happened to be in the area (which is far from home).  However, my review stands as written for the time being."}
{"text":"Came in lat night and was very impressed. Most flavorful steak in the maui bowl. Grilled shrimp and fish tacos may be the best in the city. And where else can one pay $2 for pacifico? Cannot wait for round 2!"}
{"text":"Mailman and Stu treat everyone right.  We love this place.  Great food and even better service."}
{"text":"I am not big on eating tacos, but the tacos here are so good. My husband and I came in today and ordered the paleo bowl with shrimp, 2 fish tacos, 1 beef taco, and the taquitos. It was all delicious and filling. The paleo bowl is so good with lots of veggies and a good and generous portion of shrimp. I ended up eating half of it and letting hubby eat the rest because I got full.
The taquitos were nice and crispy, not oily like other places have. There was a really nice man, I wish I got his name. :/ He was very acommodating with lowering the volume of the music outside so hubby and I can talk to each other. He checked on us a couple times and made sure that everything was to our liking. He even brought some delicoous cinnamon chip dessert-like thing. It was a kind gesture and made my experience quite the positive one. :)"}
{"text":"Pretty decent food. The ordering process is a little daunting tho, lots of things to look at & chose from & imo, instead of ordering at the counter & then sitting, it would be better to sit & order from a waiter/waitress so there's time to really look over the menu without feeling rushed or like you're holding up the line. The guy we ordered from also wasn't particularly patient or great about answering some q's we had about some of the menu items. 
I ordered the fish tacos, 1 of them with the cabbage slaw, the other regular. Hubby & son got carne asada burritos & our other son got the carnitas bowl. 
My tacos were really good, lots of fish on each one. I def preferred the cabbage slaw topped one. We got a few of their sauces to try & I really loved the green sauce & some sort of spicy red sauce that they bill as being super spicy. It wasn't that spicy, but had lots of great flavor. The rice was bland so it was nice to have some sauces to mix in. 
The burritos were ok, nothing special but the carne asada had good flavor. The carnitas was done with some sort of sweet marinade which my son was not thrilled with. 
Overall, our meal was good & now that we've been once, hopefully it'll be a more streamlined ordering process next time!"}
{"text":"First time here and it was. A good experience. I love the atmosphere. The place is decorated in a southern California Surf/Skate theme. I ordered the cajun fish tacos with citrus slaw and it was very good. The fish was a little on the dry side but not too bad. The flavor was good and the citrus slaw was perfect with the fish. While not the best fish tacos I have had. They are very good and I will be back here."}
{"text":"Went once to try it. Not bad, not great. Will have to try again to see if there's reason to update my rating."}
{"text":"Great service and a great atmosphere! Once i walked in i immediately got greeted by jaime! He kindly took our orders and always made sure we were comfortable or needed anything else, the food tasted great and i could not have asked for more. i defiantly recommend coming here if you're close by!"}
{"text":"I really don't have too much to say about this place but this.. Their fish tacos are grilled but still awesome! But what's even better is their shrimp tacos. I'll probably try a shrimp burrito in the near future. I really don't care for the beans and rice here for I'm more into retried beans from a Robertos. I like that it's 24 hours and a bar right inside so it's a win win if you want to kick it get messed up and chill after with a meal."}
{"text":"Beware. Husband and I went here for lunch and that night we were both incredibly sick. This was the only thing we had eaten that day and we both got sick with the exact same symptoms which leads me to believe we got sick from this location."}
{"text":"Ugh
The stench of fish when I walked in..
I thought they said fish doesn't stink.
I wanted to love it... Just couldn't."}
{"text":"Place is still awesome and Chris is the best bartender I have had the privilege of being served by. My drink is always ready as I walk in and not left empty till I decide to end my time there.
They do have a breakfast Menu. Please ask for it. Chris is good to offer it up. My mistake for not asking when I first tried food here. The food is incredible the staff is outstanding."}
{"text":"AMAZING fresh fish tacos, HUGE burritos, beautiful bar, awesome beer selection & GREAT service-I'm stoked to get a Wahoos in my own backyard-the ambiance & fresh food makes me feel like I'm back home in So Cal! Great job!"}
{"text":"They definitely have a protein to make everyone pleased: steak, chicken, fish, pork, tofu, and they also have Bonzai Veggies, grilled vegetables, if you're not in the need for protein. Plus, they have two bean options and white or brown rice. Variety is no problem here. They have a full bar and several TVs to keep you entertained. And, service is friendly. It is overall a pleasant experience, and I will say my husband is a big fan. Despite all of this, I have yet to find a dish that I find irresistibly delicious. I have tried the enchiladas and a salad, and they were both good. But, I am still looking for that one thing that I want to order over and over again. We will most likely be back, so I will let you know if I find my personal Wahoo's holy grail. Either way, I think it is worth a try because your tastebuds may find just what they like."}
{"text":"I've been to Wahoos off Rainbow and Sunset many of times and have played games and I got my bill from Bob the manager and it was for $75 and nothing was comped.  Also they charge $8.00 a beer on draft whether you gamble or not.  I asked to talk to the owner but Bob said I wasn't allowed to talk to Paul the owner.  Bob is a horrible manager and I don't recommend going there because the service is horrible."}
{"text":"I went to wahoos on 8/13/15 and the service was good up until Bob the manager took over with another female bartender.  All they did is hang out with one another and anytime we needed something we had to get their attention.  The drafts beers are expensive and the service was horrible.  I asked to speak to an owner of the establishment and the manager told me I couldn't.  I don't recommend this place and will never return."}
{"text":"Jaime the managers and staff is really nice everything's really nice and clean the services fast atmosphere is great food is great we came all the way from Centennial to eat here"}
{"text":"Their food is alright, but it is walking distance from home and they have good drink specials...and their staff is always really nice."}
{"text":"I did not know there was one in Vegas! I've been to a Wahoo's in Colorado! Last time I tried the shrimp tacos! Yummy!! Today I was in the mood for fish tacos. I ordered the two Cajun fish taco plate. I think I would have enjoyed it more if I had more limes! That's why I took off a star:( Rice and beans were not bad! Nothing to complain about there! Also reasonable prices! You can't beat that!! Staff were friendly! They weren't overwhelming or rushing me to place my order. 

Hope to be back soon to bring more people! :)"}
{"text":"Try the Kahuna Grande! :D Went to this place again for the second time. I found out they have $2 Pacifico's all the time- thats an awesome deal. If you're part of the service industry crowd you get %30 off your bill, that's pretty cool too. The service is friendly. This time I went late night on a Wed, I found food was served till Midnight and the place closed at 1am. I think thats a pretty good deal considering the place is in Boca park where most restaurants are closed.  They have plenty of seating- outside too! 

I think the seafood is absolutely delicious, they have their own recipe of green sauce, and I think my only complaint is that the tortillas are pretty crappy (falling apart, soggy etc). They should definitely invest in a better vender for tortillas ;b Oh and the enchiladas were so tasty! I had a green/cheese shrimp enchilada. AMAZING."}
{"text":"I would give Wahoo's a 4.5 on service alone! My husband and I came in to try the vegan sampler (3 tacos:banzai, tofu, and mushroom) and the staff was very welcoming and informative...we ended up ordering a lot more! ... our bartender was also very attentive and made me a spicy margarita upon request. The tacos were delicious. The banzai taco was my favorite option, but I also ordered an extra taco just to try the vegan citrus slaw with tofu.  Definitely will order that again! I love that this location is is 24 hours with a full bar and menu. It's nice to know that there is another option other than PT's after work... no late happy hour with drink specials though."}
{"text":"I love this place for lunch.  The food is good, the people are great and the machine are very friendly. At least you can play with 20.00 in."}
{"text":"so I went in and I spent $700 and I got down to my last 20 bucks around 1:30 AM and the bartender told me I had 10 minutes till they close even though they close at 2 AM. I've never felt more uncomfortable and unwanted after to tipping $50 and only having to serve me three glasses of wine. Also the fish tacos didn't have the sauce that they normally have on them. All around it was a terrible experience and I will never be going back. The bartenders name is Tony she was the worst. Basically a terrible experience"}
{"text":"Wahoo's in a nutshell is Healthy CaliMex. When I want to eat a more Healthier Meal Wahoo's is one of choices. I like to order the Wahoo's Salad with Grilled Fish. I will admit that sometimes the Fish had been Overcooked in the past, but seems to have been improving lately. I've also tried the Power Chopper Salad as well, but I like the Wahoo's Salad because of the Guacamole. 

Their New Citrus Slaw Taco is really delicious. But the Original Taco is still good. Again I choose the Grilled Fish. I tried the Cajun but it just wasn't a flavor I was fond of.

The Outer Reef Burrito is quite good. I've had it with the Grilled Chicken and Guacamole and Sour Cream.

The Baja-Ladas weren't too bad, I wasn't expecting them to be on the Colder side. I guess it's because of the Fresh Spinach. Maybe of it was Hot Sautéed Spinach I probably would have liked it more.

My friend gets the Tofu with his meals and I liked the Tofu very much.

Besides this location I've also eaten at the Boca Park and one near Sea World in San Diego. What was great about that location was the SD weather and eating Outdoors. It's too bad this location has no Outdoor Dining areas, but Vegas has Very Few days of the year that has nice weather, it's either Too Hot, Too Cold or Too Windy. But what I like about this location is that it's Very Close to my Work, And we get a Company Discount!

The Atmosphere is very SoCal. I Love the Skateboarding Decor, brings back memories of when I used to Skateboard and Boogieboard as a kid and spent my Summers and Spring Breaks visiting relatives in San Diego back in the 80s. They have Stickers and Posters everywhere depicting famous Skateboarding, Surfing, and Snowboarding Brands. The back walk will project Videos of Skateboarding, Surfing, etc.

There is a Bar area located inside its own area from the main Dining room.

The Dining Room and Restrooms are always clean and tidy. The Staff is Friendly and Attentive.

I've always had a great experience here and I hope to continue this streak for my future visits."}
{"text":"So I decided to give it a try since I live down the street. I've had friends who told me the first is dry. I first got the cajun and it was so tough so then I got grilled fish and once again extremely overcooked and dry. I ended up getting tofu and veggies and literally there was 6 pieces of cubed tofu and it lacked flavor. The only reason I'm giving two stars is the service and the white beans were good. 

Oh if you go after 9 pm and say your in the industry is 30% off. 

PROS: white beans and service
CONS: Everything but the beans"}
{"text":"This place will be our new hang out. The fish tacos are super good. Prices ate very reasonable on the food. Great job Wahoo's"}
{"text":"I'm pretty upset with my experience here. 

The first thing I did when I walked in was check out the the menu up front. 

I checked all the options and saw the Fast Break burrito for $5.95 and compared to the rest of the items, it seemed favorable. 

When I went to the register my girlfriend and I ordered the Fast Break burrito. When I was ready to pay it came out higher than I expected. I asked Irany why it was higher than advertised and she argued that's how much it was. My girl friend had to go to the menu up front just to point it out. Irany and her coworker just laughed it off and said that's an old price, her manager would take it down. That got me upset. 

When I got my food, the Fast Break Cajun Chicken burrito, It was OKAY. Although the chicken had a lot of flavor, the rest of the burrito was quite bland. It was only rice and little sauce. 

I will not be returning."}
{"text":"I just went here for the first time. I can't eat very much in one sitting and I'm always nervous about going out. But, the server was really nice, made a recommendation, and gave me a free taco. The fish taco was amazing, the guacamole was really good, and their shrimp was flavorful and soft! I really enjoyed it! And when I was done he gave me a couple of coupons to come back, and some boxes to bring my food home. Very nice people."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat in the city in a quick bite, Jaime the manager is awesome! And the service is always excellent."}
{"text":"Friendly staff. Full bar is partitioned off from regular dining area. Foods not bad, but easily forgettable. Fair prices, good portions, and quick turn around."}
{"text":"Wahoo! is right! This place is cheap, delicious, has great customer service, and has a fun atmosphere... What more could a little Yelper need?

This place has two main attractions, dining room and the bar.

The dining room is set up in a seat yourself fashion. You first order, then you pick a place to sit, then they deliver your food to you by name.

I ordered a Wahoo (ono fished) grilled burrito wet. Both of the enchilada sauces are delightful. I asked to sample each and they let me get both (half and half). My food came out quickly and it was fresh.

The house salsa was lack luster. Nice veggie taste, but nothing special or memorable.  Mr. Lee's sauce was the business: sweet and spicy and thick. (I swear there is teriyaki in there). Get it! You'll thank me later. 

The bar has great beer specials. They have a variety (Mexican and American) on tap and they are around $2.11 a piece and half that during happy hour.

If you're a single gal, this is a great place to go surfing for dudes.

I'm pretty WAHOO for Wahoo's!"}
{"text":"I'm very happy with my most recent visit! I had a coupon for a free Chicken Shredder Sandwich & it stated \"Dine-In Only\", but Stacie, that was working the cashier station, had no issues letting me take my free sandwich to go... Whoo-hoo! The place is friendly & clean & bar area looks fun & well-stocked... When I ended up eating my sandwich, it was very tasty! Fresh veggies (including avocado, yum!) well-cooked & seasoned chicken & great bread... I couldn't have asked for a better experience!!!"}
{"text":"Loved the food, but I could tell they just opened.  (The bar was a tad bit dirty, but promptly cleaned when brought to the bartender's attention) I enjoyed the salad, grilled chicken, fish and fresh cabbage.  The drink menu was bland, but there were plenty of  options as far as drinks went..  The food was extremely fast, so if you like to take your time-order bit ,by bit!  However, you do not get the \"fast-food\" feeling.  I look forward to more meals at my local Wahoo's."}
{"text":"Another amazing night at wahoos. Best bartender we've had since 2012. Wish we had a wahoos and Joey in the northwest."}
{"text":"This location is pretty close to my job. It's a very common choice for power lunches and spontaneous happy hours. When the place first opened up, the food was awesome (pretty common) but now.... meh. I mean it's not bad but as my dad would say - It's nothing to write home about.

I love their secret bar menu (it's not really that secret - you just have to ask for it) I used to order the burning roll each and every time I stopped by but nowadays - it's not as tasty as it used to be. I heard great things about their tortilla soup but when I finally ordered it --- it was just a bowl of veggies, a little broth with 3 pieces of tortilla chips and like - maybe 3 pieces of chicken??? Meh.

No matter what time of day I'm here, I always order at the bar. The speed of service is pretty darn good. I almost never have to wait more than 5 - minutes for my food - which is AWESOME if you're trying to get a good lunch hour in.

Happy hour on fridays is always packed. The bar area isn't very big so when it's crowded it's - C R O W D E D.

So my final words are this, if you looking for something healthy and fast and you're in the area, then try it out. The food isn't life-changing but it's decent."}
{"text":"I have been twice since it opened, the first time we went they made a couple mistakes on our order, but they were quickly rectified and it was understandable since everyone there is new. The food has been excellent with good pricing. It's clean with a fun atmosphere. If you simply compare to Baja Fresh and their pricing it's easy to see how much more you get for your money at Wahoos."}
{"text":"Totally reminiscent with vibes of a Cali surf spot. The food has different fusions that will envelope you like you in Cali flavors- fresh, flavorful, and diverse but definitely not overbearing. The service leaves a bit to be desired, but it IS a franchise, so it's to be expected- you can't recreate SoCal hospitality but it's a nice dose of home."}
{"text":"I come in here all the time for the amazing service I receive from Joey! Best bartender ever! Their fish tacos are my absolute favorite in town."}
{"text":"Christine is out of her rocker and she obviously does not come to Wahoos often!  \"Mailman\" and \"Heather\" make this LOCAL bar the place to come and hang out!!! You want to get screwed on drinks go to Buffalo Wild Wings across the street!  Heather and Mailman are a great team!!  Lara and the rest are just as fun!  Christine, stay out of our local hang out if you don't like it!!  Love Wahoos!!!"}
{"text":"I love me some Wahoo's Fish Tacos. I am so happy this place is in Summerlin. I love going and sitting on there patio. They have great deals on Pacifico Beer ( $ 2.00). How can you beat that? 

I normally get the fish taco plate with rice and beans and it is awesome. Last time I was there the cashier recommended the Outer Reef Burrito with fish. It was HUGE and so good. I ate the entire thing and did not regret it =) 

The only downfall is that it is very hot inside the actual restaurant. I don't think they have a/c. This stinks if there is no room on the patio and you are forced to sit inside."}
{"text":"Came here today with my co worker to have lunch. Ordered it \"to go\" over the phone so we wouldnt have to waste majority of our lunch break waiting for the food to be cooked. The food was delicious. We ordered the Chicken & Cheese enchiladas with green sauce. I cannot say enough about the green sauce, it is so good! This is our 2nd time here and we love it. Wish they would have lunch specials and coke products instead of pepsi. Other than that, this place rocks!"}
{"text":"After eating for years at the Wahoos in California this is my first time eating at one in Vegas. Did not have the Wahoos feel at all; it was just a storefront and a large open space.

As for the service... main host stand/counter not manned. No one to seat me for a few minutes. Huge restaurant no-no.

As for the food... I ordered black beans and got spicy cajun beans. Rice was undercooked (hard) and cold. Chicken was cold.

Won't be back."}
{"text":"I haven't had Wahoos fish tacos in many years. It's a little different than how I remembered it but still pretty good. Friendly staff ! This location had a sports bar  thing going on, none of the ones I had been to before had that. Neato."}
{"text":"The mushroom enchilada with green sauce is amazing! I also had a grilled fish taco with black beans and rice. The food came out quickly and was fresh and tasty. I love the laid back atmosphere of this place. The portion was plentiful and the free drink refills were a plus. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"There's no better place for a great lunch hour! Shannon brings the sun to shine! 

The food is amazing. The staff is incredible and the patrons are the best in town.

Recommend them for all occasions.

Love Viviana, Jen, Bob, Chris, and of course my SHANNON!!! 

DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME ANYWHERE ELSE!! 

must try their street tacos and fusion sauce ;)"}
{"text":"It's a late dinner for us, not really heading to any place in particular, came across Wahoo's and  decided to try it.  When we walked in, the place was deserted, thought there must be something going on, but it certainly wasn't here.

At first it was a little confusing, trying to figure out the menu, but my husband and I finally ordred and went and sat down. You can choose your own meat, style of taco and sides.  There is a kids menu and there is a bar located around the back of the dinning area, that we discovered after hitting the head.  (found out that's where all the people are).   I was busy reading all of the graffiti and stickers plastered all over the place.  

I got the Kahuna Grande, that's a taco, and three taquito's, black beans and seasoned rice.  (you can choose differently if you don't want what I got).  The food was fresh, the rice was seasoned very well.  I got guacamole and sour cream on the side, and that made the taquito's."}
{"text":"Food is good.  I especially like the Baja Rolls (Baja Ladas) this time they were served with the green sauce.  True love.  We mentioned to the staff that their site and ordering on line indicated they were closed at 3 PM.  However, it was 6 and they were open.  Because of the Final Four games, we were afraid they were going to be overcrowded, so when they weren't I suggested that it may be that their app indicated they were closed.  
I do love the fish - Wahoo - grilled.  Choice of beans - black and Choice of Rice Brown.  Always order the green sauce on the side!"}
{"text":"Probably THE best taco restaurant in town. All of the food tastes so fresh and they have a variety of food options. I never have a terrible visit. The employees are diverse but super sweet and helpful. It's got a beachy taco shop feel. I love it. They have the best hot sauce."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful experience. My fiancé and I decided to try something new so we stopped here. As soon as we walked in we were immediately greeted by the cashier. We took a look at the menu, and when the employees saw that we were new they took the time to explain the menu to us. We then ordered and waited for our food. We met Matt, who I assume is a manager or owner, who kindly greeted us and asked my fiancé what happened to his arm (he got in a motorcycle accident.) Matt then brought over chips and salsa to \"celebrate surviving a motorcycle accident!\" It was so sweet. 

Soon after we got our food and it was delicious. I got the salmon bowl and my fiancé got fish tacos. He also ordered a beer, but we had to remind the cashier to grab it. Matt then actually offered to get him another one on the house!

The entire experience was wonderful, the food was good and the atmosphere was fun. I highly recommend trying them out!"}
{"text":"Wahoo's is a fast casual chain serving bowls, burritos, tacos, and enchiladas melding Mexican, Brazilian, and Asian flavors. I'll usually get their fish their tacos which they're known for, and they usually don't disappoint. I've had no complaints with service with any of my visits.

The view separates this location from others as you can see both the summit of Black Mountain and you can can also have an unobstructed view of the entire Valley if you choose to sit at the bar or out on the patio weather permitting. The dining area is spacious with plenty of tables and some booths against the wall.

When you order, you have the choice of protein for your dish which includes: chicken, carnitas, carne asada, fish, shrimp, and tofu. The food is OK to me and on par with most taquerias and teriyaki bowl places with their fish tacos being worth return trips for. Everything else is a notch pricier to other establishments but not significantly elevated in flavor. On this particular visit, I had the carne asada Outer Reef Burrito- cheese, lettuce, rice, beans, green sauce with a side of salsa. The steak was flavorful, but I could have done without the lettuce.

If I'm in the vicinity, I'd come back for some fish tacos or maybe to chill out in the bar or out on the patio with cerveza in hand."}
{"text":"My husband and I come to Wahoo's any time we are in the area, and are always happy!

My favorite, that I usually always get, are the a la carte fish tacos. With just the right seasoning (and spicy being an option) the fish is tender and light alongside of their citrus slaw. I am NOT an onions fan, so I am so happy that Wahoo's doesn't add them into their slaw! We also love the cajun fries as a side to share when we decide to order different entrees. Their beer and drink selection is a nice bonus, with the possibility of seating on the patio when weather permits. 

The service is always prompt and friendly no matter if we are dining in or getting food to go! If only they were closer to our house in the Southeast side of town, then we could really be regulars!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here with my car club for 3 years. I really like the food, and atmosphere here. But tonight I came with a dozen friends. Twenty minutes in, all my friends had gotten their orders, so I asked a waitress to look into my order. Twenty minutes later, my friends were all finished with their food and ready to leave. I went to inquire again, and they told me my food was just finished. I said my party was leaving already. They asked me to take it to go. I declined, and asked for a refund. It took another 10 minutes to give me my refund.

The last time we were here, we came a bit close to closing time. We asked if it was ok to sit and eat. They assured us it was ok. But soon as we sat down, they started putting the chairs up, and sweeping around us. Basically made it really obvious they were waiting on us.

I really like the food here. But the customer service really needs work."}
{"text":"The food is OK, but the service staff here is the best in town.  Great counter people and even better bartenders.  If you are playing slots, not only are your drinks free, but so is your meal.  What a deal"}
{"text":"2nd time shrimp Tacos, black beans and rice, wow those were so good. Beyond good. I will get some pics of the bar etc."}
{"text":"Loved the decor of the place.  Loved the bar being off to the side and closed off so adults can have their privacy.  The front staff was very nice.  Liked the selection of some of the drink choices.  I had the shrimp bowl with white rice.  It was good, the shrimp was tasty.  It was a little bland for me.  It would be nice a salsa bar, but the wait staff brought me some mild salsa.  My boss ordered a fish taco/enchilado combo which they messed up the order and brought him two tacos.  He didn't return it and just ate it.  The chips were fresh and the salsa was good.  I will try it again and see how I like it.  I did like what I had and love the fact that someone finally took this spot and I hope they can get things figured out.  We need better choices to dine in the 89002/89015 area."}
{"text":"We are from Huntington Beach and just moved to Henderson. So nice to see an old local favorite of ours here in Vegas. We stopped in for a late dinner and were so happy it tastes like it's made in HB! Love having a piece of CA here in town."}
{"text":"They have the best fish tacos and burrito bowls around. Wahoos offers good prices and amazing quality in the food. I've never had a bad meal. The service has always been rest, my family and I have eaten here very often. They even take orders for pickup over the phone!"}
{"text":"Food was OK not bad at all but i was not impressed because they didn't have too many choices for fish i only saw one kind of fish. Even though the name says fish taco they had more of other stuff , carne asada, chicken and pork. And the fish that they did have didn't taste so good it was kind of dry for me. They had a decent carne asada burrito though. This is not a place i would get hooked on to and have a craving for but its a good place to try."}
{"text":"I live across the street and I come here to see Cheryl because she is one of the best bartenders in Las Vegas!! Because she always takes care of me and I love the food!!"}
{"text":"Been a long time since I've come in here and I couldn't complain. I'm such a big fan of HOT food. I like to know it came straight to me when it was ready and not kept warm under a heat lamp. Food came straight out. Didn't wait long (not busy tho) and it tasted great. Thanks for good service and tasty food. I'll return for sure :-)"}
{"text":"I do enjoy the food here but if I call four different times for a pick up order three out of the four times the food order is incorrect. It's the most inconsistent place I've ever order from. While I was nursing my daughter who had a dairy allergy and I expressed to them please no dairy on my food. What do I get?Cheese all over it. This occurred more then once. The fact that they didn't take the allergy seriously was shocking. Again I do really like the food but it's frustrating you aren't getting what you ordered. I pay for chips and guacamole. I don't receive chips or guacamole. I order 4 chicken tacos, 4 fish tacos... Bout 2 chicken tacos have \"spicey\" (spelled incorrectly, besides the point, lol) and 3 fish tacos have \"spicey\" written on them. So we have to open all them up and separate them all ourselves. I'm missing sauce on tacos that I requested fish tacos original. My orders are never hard I promise. There is seriously more situations to count. I know having my husband open up all the orders while in the restaurant would help a ton but let's be honest that's a pain and shouldn't be needed. Plus he usually never knows what I order, lol. If limes and pick come w fish tacos... Can I please get that next time?! Not just sometimes. I love that it's close just wish they could get my simple orders correct and keep consistency w the food. :-("}
{"text":"i love this place. I always end up at the bar getting a CoronaRita."}
{"text":"Really love wahoos. They never let me down. Everything's good. I like the prices the customer service is great and it's a cool spot"}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise. I was just driving by and stopped in for my first time for a fish taco.   I did not realize they had more than fish tacos.  I had a delicious fish enchilada and fish taco with black beans and white rice.  Since it was Tuesday,  they gave me a taco with my drink.  Wow! Nice touch.  The server Jesse was terrific.   He took his time with me and explained the menu.

The meal was fresh and good.  They topped the tacos off with a rockin flavored cabbage.

As I mentioned before, they offer other proteins like carnitas, chicken, Carne Asada and (of course) fish.  They also offer them all in a taco, burrito and in a combination plate.

I'll be back.."}
{"text":"Wow! If you are in the area, stop for some Ono grinds here! My Kale kai salad was delicious topped with fish! Great Hawaiian vibe, laid back! My son enjoyed his Kalua pork bowl! DH enjoyed his tacos! Fresh ingredients here! Plus the margaritas topped off our meal !  Wish this place was near my home!"}
{"text":"Worst food. We went for the first time and ordered appetizers, burrito, and an enchilada. The chips were stale, the salsa was like ketchup, and they messed up the order. I don't think it's a kitchen, they just heat the food, nothing was fresh. Will never go back,"}
{"text":"Bartender was very stand-off, and kinda rude. Let us know right off the bat if we didn't play $. $1.00 every hand  we wouldn't have drinks.  We came in to gamble  so she turned us off immediately.  Not coming back."}
{"text":"Food is okay. I've ordered from here twice now. The first time the fish taco was okay, the second time it was burnt hard. Both times I thought the sauce seemed to be mostly mayo and not very zingy or flavorful. Both times I was unhappy with the amount of food I got for my money. Just a tiny bit too blah, a tiny bit too expensive. Bummer."}
{"text":"Food is simple, but reasonably priced and solid. Wahoo bowl is my personal favorite, though large portions of hot sauce are recommended. Service is always friendly, and the bar is generally well attended with much better service than you would expect from an out of state chain. Definately a good happy hour option if you work/live in the area. 

$2 Pacificos!"}
{"text":"St. Patrick's Day was the first day of business for Vegas' 2nd Wahoo's.  This chain that originated in Orange County, CA, is familiar to all the SoCal transplants like me, but I've never had Wahoo's until tonight.  If you think all they have is fish, you'd be wrong (like me!).  The choice of fillings in addition to fish are chicken, carnitas, carne asada, shrimp, tofu, mushrooms (in a Polynesian marinade and sauteed), vegetarian, and Banzai veggies (a veggie mix sauteed in teriyaki sauce).  I'm happy to say that the food is fresh, abundant, and I'm glad that a location opened up in my 'hood.  I had the shrimp taco combination: 2 overflowing tacos, brown rice, and black beans.  I couldn't say no to the Maui Onion Rings so I had those, too, but maybe not the best combination with tacos.  Regardless, I am full!  The place is brand new, the service is great, and the ambiance is laid-back, just as if the beach were right outside the door."}
{"text":"This was the third time my fiance and I have been here and we are never going back. Service has never been good. We have always gone to the bar. They are super friendly but when it ucomes to giving you service they are way under par. Food is decent and very good priced but after this last time where I had to send back my meal because it was too cold and took forever to even get them to ask us what we wanted to eat, I cannot give them another chance. Also had to constantly flag the bartender down for a new beer. But the final straw was the fact that we gambled about $70 between the 2 of us we only got 2 beers comped. As someone in the service industry and works as a cocktail server and has bartended, I know what the proper comp system is. Had no compensation for having to wait at least 15 min for my new meal as well.. We've had problems the last 2 times as well but tried to give them a chance since they are new (and very close to home) but not after this time. So sad:("}
{"text":"Love the food here! I always get amazing service and I have never been disappointed by my meal! I wish there was a closer wahoos to where we live!!! I also LOVE the atmosphere! Please don't change!!"}
{"text":"Always amazing food and the service is even better. If you come in, ask for Joey.... best bartender EVER. Great personality and makes a great drink. Fish tacos are delicious. You just can't miss with this place!"}
{"text":"Best place in Vegas. Simply a must. Chris and Brian the bartenders are friendly and personable. They will not let you down.... unlike the guy sitting next to me (I think his name was Troy) who tipped our bartender 7 dollars on what I can only guess was a large tab."}
{"text":"We love coming here and the service is great, Joey in particular. HOWEVER, there is quite a bit of wasted space on the restaurant side. We would love to come here more often with friends if they would convert that space to maybe an area with games/activities. Maybe darts, a pool table, we feel like we're in the way playing golden tee and would love a few other options in the hardly used space of the restaurant area behind the bar."}
{"text":"I take back my old review. I have been here a lot in the last few months its become a regular place for me. I love the food they are very accommodating to me needing to change things and the staff at the bar is more friendly then the people in the restaurant. Will be going back again."}
{"text":"If you want a solid meal for cheap, this is probably the place for you. Not too expensive, the meals are decent, and the service is quick. I've only had an issue here once, and it was corrected immediately by the manager.

The black beans are cooked to perfection every time, and I love the Polynesian shrimp tacos. If you are more of a no-tortilla person, you can also go with the bowls which provide you more bang for your buck (in my opinion). The carnitas tacos are pretty good too, but eat them promptly, or they turn soggy.

The service is that of a quick service Restaraunt. It's nothing to write home about, but the employees are nice enough. If you ask for something, and they aren't busy, they are pretty on top of it. I've only noticed a drop in service if the place is packed."}
{"text":"This is an amazing place.  The food is absolutely wonderful and tasty.  Each bit was a new delight.  I cant wait to come back and visit again. The staff was amazing and very helpful. I would recommend this place to anyone wanting to have their taste buds amazed."}
{"text":"In reference to Andrew L's review, Matt (the terrible bar tender he spoke of) is not longer employed there!  Thank goodness!  I'm sorry Andrew that he was the one who had served you.  I promise you, all the other bar tenders are amazing.  They're all very genuinely friendly!

My boyfriend and I have been going to Wahoo's for a few months.  I love the fact that it's literally across the street from us and we can walk there and back.  The bartenders that work at nights are very sweet.  (We've only been there during the day time to order food, so we haven't met the morning shift bartenders, but I wouldn't be surprised if they were just as nice.)  They do take drink AND food orders.  They actually always offer a food menu or ask if you're hungry.  AND they check up on you to make sure the Food is up to par after the food has arrived.

Most of their food is healthy and all their foods have tons of spice.  One of my favorite dishes is the Wet Burrito. I always get that with cajun/blackened chicken and I ask for them to do half red and half green sauce on top--it makes it look pretty too ;)  Their Fish Taco is a must have.  They're healthy so they won't have the McDonald's or KFC grease taste, which I know can be delicious if you like the unhealthy flavors... I can't hate cuz I crave those too time to time!  They can seem to be a bit dry, but they have the sauces to drizzle of the tacos.  The Wahoo's Fries, which is obviously not so healthy, are a must have too.  I wish other places would make their nacho's the way Wahoo's make their fries; it's totally loaded!  You can always ask for their green cilantro sauce with any of your dishes... yummmm!  

That reminds me, one time, one of the bartenders put the green cilantro sauce along the walls of the cup and poured in the drink so every sip of bloody mary had a hint of cilantro.  It was DELICIOUS!  That's another must have if you like bloody mary and cilantro!

Anyways, you gotta go and experience Wahoo's.  I'm going to be very sad when we move away from the area :(

For those who want to see what they have to offer for food, here's a link to their menu:

{"text":"I am kind of on the fence about Wahoo's.  The service was friendly, the atmosphere is chill, and the food was delicious....

But, I wasn't entirely happy with all of the options.  I am not a food snob - I will be the first to admit that I love Rubio's.  Are they the best fish tacos in the world? No, probably not.  But they are decently priced, quick and pretty darn delicious.  Enough about Rubios, I know this is a review about Wahoo's Fish Tacos.

The set up of the restaurant is kind of strange.  As soon as you walk in the door, there is a wall with the menu on it.  The register is to the left and the restaurant is to the right.  Maybe this is obvious to everyone else, but I've never been to Wahoo's before, and I saw servers walking around checking on tables, so I wasn't totally sure if we were supposed to order at the counter or sit down and wait for someone to assist us.  So, we walked up to the counter, where we waited. And waited. And waited, because the people in front of us were also new and had NO idea what they wanted (not their fault, but I assume that's what the menu at the door is for, so you can decide BEFORE trying to order).  Eventually another cashier came to help us, and we were on our way.

We both had the combo platter #2 (choice betweent 2 tacos or 2 enchiladas, with rice and beans).  I had the 2 taco combo, with 1 fish taco (cajun style) and 1 carne asada taco, brown rice (great option!) and black beans.  My Mom had the 2 enchilada platter (cheese enchiladas) with brown rice and black beans.  Now, I understand that this is supposed to be a healthier alternative, but I REALLY like baja style fish tacos, and was disappointed that this wasn't even an option.

The fish taco was pretty decent, even if it wasn't baja style.  The carne asada wasn't my favorite.  The meat was tender, but a bit dry, and the taco was WAY overfilled with ingredients (the least of them meat), which made it very difficult to eat.  The beans and rice were really the highlight of the meal.  I love brown rice, and the beans mixed together perfectly with it.

The enchiladas on my Mom's plate were seriously some of the cheesiest and best I'd ever tasted.  I mean, they were stuffed with and covered with tons of cheese.  I was surprised.

We didn't go in the bar area, but I would definitely like to come back and check it out sometime.  They had drink menus on the tables, and it looked like they have a decent selection of beers and some interesting signature cocktails.

Overall, we had an OK experience at Wahoo's.  I like that the food is served on real plates with real silverware, and that there are servers checking on you.  I will probably visit again to try some of their other items.  But I will stick to the REAL taco shops for my carne asada."}
{"text":"It was our first time trying this chain and the food was really good and it was served hot, fresh and fast. The pricing was reasonable for the portion size. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE SERVICE. I ordered takeout which was supposed to be ready in \"15 minutes\". It was ready in 15 but no one even looked at it or realized that people were waiting. We sat there for another ten minutes before I decided to ask someone. The guy attempts to tell me it isn't ready (after 30 min) and when I point to the to go boxes he realizes that it has been ready. He comes back with the food which wasn't even done well and forgets to put in the chips and salsa which I paid for. After telling him he forgot the chips, he comes back with a bag with about ten chips and one thing of salsa (when I paid EXTRA) for more salsa. All in all in was probably the worst takeout experience I've had. Bad service. Food was cold. No extra salsa that I paid for (which is ridiculous you have to pay for extra salsa). If you want Mexican food, you're better off with taco bell. Sad."}
{"text":"Won't be bringing my business back to this Wahoo's and I LOVE Wahoo's. I'll gladly drive to Boca Park.

This is the closest of the three valley locations to me, but I'll make the trek to avoid this location.

My food at this location has generally always been subpar compared to other Wahoo's, but this time my incorrect order PLUS the rudest bartender I have ever met in my life did the deed of hammering the final nail into the casket. 

To be clear: I, as a Las Vegan, know and understand the gamers always have priority seating at machines at the bar and always keep that in mind when choosing to sit at the bar.

We walk in. We sit at the bar.

Now, my date and I asked the bar tender to break a $20 for us. We both took $10 of this and began to gamble. We ordered drinks, we ordered food. A couple regular parties walk in. There are 4 empty seats with machines available, but we get the looks. We are sitting at their precious normal machines.

This bartender had the NERVE to tell my boyfriend and me that she will move us if she has to because the machines are \"reserved for active players.\" Am I not actively gambling? I have pushed this button non-stop since I have sat down. So while my man and I secretly discussed our shock under our breath, she noticed. She came over AGAIN and like a stern mother scolding her children she took a tone with us and repeated herself, all while I STILL count FOUR empty machines in the bar. We are the only people with food, drinks, AND actively gaming. Clearly, our 25 cent Keno wasn't going to win her the high tips she would get when the professional bar gamblers hit their flushes and royals.

I am so livid that were blatantly treated like lower class for a higher paying regular gambler. I am not looking for free drinks while sitting at the bar, I am looking for a little gaming fun and to pass the time.

I'll eat and Twin Peaks before returning here."}
{"text":"As a gal originally from Southern California I was in the mood for some Wahoo's. Thank God some have been sprouting up in Las Vegas! When I first started coming ro this Wahoo's my car or the girl of my girlfriend was one of only a few in the lot. Now the lot is ALWAYS packed. The service is super speedy and they remeber our orders now. They have an awesome happy hour. I wish it wasn't so far out in the boonies."}
{"text":"As a California native saying I was excited to find not just one but at least THREE Wahoo's in Las Vegas is an understatement. My girlfriend and I would frequent the location near the 215 and Rainbow off Sunset quite often on our lunch breaks. The staff was great and knew us by name, but it never really felt like a Wahoo's like back home. There were no windows :(

By luck we found this Wahoo's while on a work errand one day. WHAT. A. TREAT. We happened to sit down at the outside bar at just the right time of day and just the right time of the year. The breeze blowing on our backs kept us cool as the sun beat down from the sky. The tasty ice cold draft Pacifico ran down my throat and at the exact time we silently soaked in the glory, turned to look at each other and realized we had found it. It felt JUST like we were sitting on the Southern California Coast. It feels JUST like home. There is a open patio with couches and a fire pit next to the indoor/outdoor bar, and the corner location is perfect boasting floor to ceiling windowed walls. It's nice and open.

I've always been a huge fan of the Baja-ladas. Flour tortillas filled with chicken, tomatoes, spinach, and cream cheese. Pair that with a frosty draft beer and you are set.

This Wahoo's has a \"house special\" green sauce. They mix some spicy chili powder goodness into the already great green sauce. BOMB DOT COM.

The location of this Wahoo's is to-die-for. It's located right smack dab in the middle of Boca Park surrounded by great shops and minutes from Red Rock Casino.

I can't deny that I am SUPER stoked to be moving into my new apartment right around the corner from here very soon!!"}
{"text":"Love it here!!! Very close to the one in Laguna! I love the burrito smothered in green sauce with rice and beans!!! So tasty!!!"}
{"text":"Actually more like 2.5 stars ....
We arrived on a Saturday early evening.
Being somewhat unfamiliar with their menu we stopped at the large menu board posted in the entrance way. The cashier noticed us right away and came over to explain the menu .  

Her attitude was a bit overbearing and although she was extremely confident in her knowledge of the menu , it just came off as an \" in your face\" performance not a sincere desire to help guests.

After she spent 5 minutes telling us what she liked. We finally got to order. I had the fish taco combo  which is 2 fish tacos , rice , beans and some chips and salsa.

She asked us what we wanted to drink , she mentioned a bunch of beers and we expressed our desire to get a beer on tap. She informed us that we would have to go to the bar area to order that.

So we finished the food order and went into the bar area to order our drinks . There was a large patio area out side so we chose to sit out there ( the bar was full of smoke and although it is a surfer, ocean themed place it was a typical sports bar on the inside ) very smokey and lots of people yelling at tv screens ....

The food arrived and the appearance and presentation of the food was very good , colorful plate with the food neatly placed and full of bright salsa colors.

I had ordered the Cajun version of the fish taco. It appeared to be lightly battered with a spicy Cajun rub, serves along with some lettuce and salsa on a soft corn tortilla .

It was served with brown rice and black beans , again... Seemed fresh but the flavor was just ok

Biting into it  , the taste was ok, and everything seemed fresh. I kept finding myself adding salt or pepper for flavor....I finally ended up putting more salsa on it.

Honestly for a place with the name \" Fish Tacos\" In it's name you would think that the fish taco would be epic .. But honestly it was just ok.... I was raised in southern Texas and have travelled to California , Mexico , the Caribbean , Hawaii and all over Asia ...I've had tons of different versions of the \" fish taco\" and wahoos is just , well.. It's just ok.

Locally you can get a better fish taco at zabas , or even the American style restaurant Claim Jumper.

{"text":"I was excited to see a Wahoo's open in Vegas as I have been to a couple in California.  After ordering and finding a seat, I examined the receipt and noticed that I was overcharged.  I brought the error to the attention of the cashier who seemed a bit confused.  She brought over a bartender who was friendly and said he would take care of it.  Soon after, the food arrived and it was just ok.  After eating, I waited and waited, but nobody came over.  In fact, while delivering food to another table, she seemed to avoid looking in my direction.  I eventually had to go back over to her and ask if someone was going to take care of refunding my money.  She said she would find someone.  Finally, some other guy came out of the back and took care of it.  

In the end, I did get my money back, but I am annoyed that I had to ask again for my refund.  It is an uncomfortable situation and someone should have taken care of it the first time."}
{"text":"Oh, what this place could have been!  Think of this place as the Vegas version of the little corner joint on Wilshire Blvd.  This place SO reminds me of calypso music:  the kind you listen to on an ultimate Sunday afternoon, lounging around with a glass of pina colada in your hand, getting slowly and happily drunk.  So ultimately my disappointment with the food will certainly get a chance to redeem itself the next time I go back.

Located in another \"oh, what it could have been\" place, Boca Park, you find yourself in a bright, surfing USA type setting with lots of bright color accents on white base.  The place has active but laid-back energy that fits the setting as well.  Upon walking in, there is an order counter in front, tables to the left and behind the counter, and a large bar to the right.  There are TVs everywhere including all around the large square bar, a perfect place to watch the games and drink to your delight.  You literally feel like you're at some divey surfer bar, sans the grime and sand.  

The staff is pleasant and acceptably prompt, and orders are efficiently filled although I wouldn't say it's lightening fast.  We tried carne asada, pescado, and carnitas tacos, and all were acceptable without being outstanding.  It looks delicious, but is somewhat underwhelming and that 3-star food results in the loss of a big star from the 5-star setting.  However it is certainly more than adequate for Saturday and Sunday afternoons watching football, avoiding the typical dark, cave-like settings most bars seem to think everybody wants.  So it almost is the perfect sports bar - now only if they had better food and some calypso music!


Table-for-1 Factor:  I could see myself sitting at the bar for hours by myself..."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick bite and a beer before heading to the airport. Love this location, staff is amazing (Virginia behind the bar rocks!), beer is always cold and I love trying something new off the menu. Tried the Kahlua Pig Bowl tonight... Shredded pork sautéed in Teriyaki sauce. Delicious."}
{"text":"Wahoo is a kid-friendly lunch or dinner outing. I was surprised by the open seating. The kids each enjoyed a fish taco (corn tortilla, soft taco) which was accompanied with with rice and black beans. You can choose your protein choice (e.g. chicken, shrimp, tofu) ; my children opted for fried fish (grilled fish is also available). Each plate costed under $4.  We checked in with Yelp! and claimed the offer of FREE chips and red salsa.

The service was helpful and the staff was cheerful. The tables and seating areas were clean. TV's aired sports which was just the happy medium (relieved to have no news or no Cartoon Network). 

The bathrooms are gender neutral which makes it easier when I am helping my children. The slide locks on the doors are placed up about 5' which can make it a little tricky. My recommendation is to stay with your children to ensure their safety and security."}
{"text":"Descent good for the $$, laid back atmosphere pleasant staff. However, I asked the female bartender to recommend a beer and she doesn't drink, there fore no help. Hmmm.  OMG, it's a bar and you can NOT SMOKE! I don't smoke, but this is a bar."}
{"text":"Ok, I have been a fake blonde on and off for about 20 years.  Maybe it is a self-fulfilling prophecy but I surprise myself how ditzy I can be sometimes.  I have LIKED the Facebook page for Wahoo's as it provoked great memories of my days hitting up Wahoo's in Costa Mesa after a day at the beach or even for a date.  The fish tacos were always the best.  So, I had posted when they were coming to Summerlin.....They replied in 2012 sometime.....Turns out I guess they had bought an existing establishment about 6 months ago off of Sunset and Rainbow.  They will be opening a new location over in the Boca Park area in March....YAY!

Anyway, went in for lunch today....I could not really figure out the menu but just asked the manager \"where are your fish tacos...?\".  Not sure if it was on the menu as I desired but he made it happen quickly.  Two fish tacos; one cajun and one mild, brown rice and black beans.  Then, a cookie and fountain drink for good measure.  I had my camera so I felt like Junior Food Reporter.  The great thing about being a volunteer Yelper, you really notice everything around you.  The bathroom was clean and the staff were friendly and the food came fast....in fact must faster than Baja Fresh.  I do not mention that to slam Baja Fresh but just a comparison.

The tacos were just as I remembered them 15+ years ago.  The brown rice was seasoned nicely and black beans are black beans.  The soda fountain had a nice variety of soda.

I can hardly wait for the Boca Park location to open and I suspect it will not have the gaming license.  I have nothing against gambling but I purposely frequent establishments that are gambling free.  This location had the bar/gambling isolated nicely but I probably will not go back unless I really feel compelled.  Thus the 4-stars versus 5-stars.  Hey, I am the reviewer so I can say what I want.  hahahahah  Hope you enjoy the extra pics."}
{"text":"Amazing customer service! Our cashier was so helpful and friendly and loved his job, so refreshing! The food was great, the facilities are clean and the food wait time was almost none! Coming back again..."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch with a vendor so my portion of the meal was free! I had two tacos, one beef one pork with the citrus slaw. That stuff is pretty good.

Overall, a meal typical of a chain/semi fast food place. This location was clean, and the staff friendly. I enjoyed the food, but I do prefer pinto beans over black beans. Yeah, I'm weird.

Located just off the 95, south of Horizon on Horizon Ridge, same complex as Naga Thai."}
{"text":"First timer!! Im gonna say after all the hype i thought it was gonna be alot better.... The fish tacos were so dry.... They need to put alot more dressing on and less cabbage!! I would go back but deff gonna try something new....."}

{"text":"This is my first time eatting at the Wahoo's in Henderson,  Nevada. So far I'm liking this place. I just checked to find out that it's less than 6 miles from The house. This place is very roomy. It also jas a patio and bar area.

{"text":"I was excited to hear a Wahoo 's had opened. In Las Vegas!  I ordered a combo plate with chicken enchilada, fish taco, brown rice and black beans.  The enchilada would have been good, had it been hot, but the cheese was barely melted. The taco was nothing but a big lump of fish.  It was not seasoned and bland.  I would have liked it to have been cut in small pieces with seasoning.  Best part was the black beans.. I will possibly try it one more time, but will skip Wahoo's if it is not better."}
{"text":"I went in last night to have a drink and enjoy my Friday evening after work. Everything was great! The doors were open and the breeze was blowing in. The atmosphere was exciting and everyone was having great conversation, talking about the sports games, cheering on, and having a blast! The bartenders were friendly and made sure that everyone had drinks and food. Everyone was being greeted and my expectations were exceeded. The night was perfect! 
And then a couple came in that was clearly upset about something and probably drunk before they walked in. They immediately tried to turn a great night into a race war.  Meanwhile, everybody was minding their own business and having a great time.  They tried very hard to make something big out of a conversation that had nothing to do with them.  They left after they unsuccessfully tried to race bait and pin customers against each other, but everyone ignored them and carried on with their night. The drunk guy came back about an hour later and tried to fight the bartender. The bartender just tried to get him out and protect the bar and customers. I've been in there many times and never saw this happen before.  This was an isolated incident that had a premeditated motive. Thanks to the bartender that stood up to protect the girl bartender and customers and to get him out so he didn't try to fight anyone else! The atmosphere there is great and I will continue to come back!"}
{"text":"The only reason I give this place one star is because the bartender was a kind, hard-working woman. My fiancé and I showed up for the first time at 11:30 pm but saw that the bar was open and people were eating so we decided to try it. I ordered chicken tortilla soup and my fiancé ordered the pork carnitas burrito. The burrito came out so fast it seemed like a frozen microwave burrito and my pathetic excuse for chicken tortilla soup was hot and that's about the only good thing I can say about it. My soup had cabbage, carrots, whole bay leaves, one piece of chicken and some tortilla strips thrown on top. Worst chicken tortilla soup I've ever had and what a let down. No black beans, corn, avocado, cilantro OR cheese ??? I don't know if we'll ever go back but hopefully they're popular fish tacos taste delicious because our menu items were terrible. The kitchen should serve quality food at all hours and just because I come at night shouldn't mean I should expect poor quality, especially in this city."}

{"text":"Small portions for the price. 2 tacos for $9.00. The hostess didn't even greet us and then proceeded to greet people behind us. Over priced and bad service"}
{"text":"For what's in the area this is my favorite taco place and depending on what I'm in the mood for it is also my favorite burrito place. I recommend the 2 citrus slaw tacos combo. Any of the protein options are great. I will usually also get a beer when I come here and it's always been very cold and refreshing."}
{"text":"I have one word for you JOEY! He is the reason to stop by for a visit as he is an Amazing bartender with a very fun personality! This is a fun joint to stop by for a drink and some good grub. I have been missing out all of this time as I have heard of it through friends however been remise at making a visit.

I had the carne asada breakfast, which came with eggs, hashed browns and tortilla. The carne asada was tender and tasty. It was a generous portion of meat which left me stuffed to the brim, mmmmmm just how I like it!

Drinks and food are reasonable and pretty good.  I had a delicious drink that was custom made by Joey. He is the kind of bartender that you can throw some ideas at and he can create a masterpiece. That night I was craving something with vodka, pineapple, cherry, and orange juice. He kicked it up a notch and created this island treat of a drink so refreshing it made me wet.

I will be back for sure to enjoy a good time with friends, drinks and food."}
{"text":"I got a carne asada bowl and my fiancé ordered the chicken burrito. Not really impressed by this place since it's very mediocre .... wasn't good and it wasn't terrible. However, you might as well go to Chipotle for a better bang for your buck, the food is MUCH better over there!"}
{"text":"I aate here once before and found it so-so, but was in the area and thought I'd give it a 2nd try. This time I ordered a  Bonzai Burrito w/chicken and brown rice & black beans to go. Waited for about 10 minutes for it to be made.When I got to my destination several miles away I bit into the burrito and it was a carnitas, basic burrito without rice or beans. I called to complain & let the manager know. He apologized and offered to have me come back again and he'll comp the food, but that didn't make up for how disappointed and unsatisfied I was. I think the staff needs to work harder at making sure the order is right before it gets in the customer's hands. In addition, since I was really hungry and didn't have any time to go get something else, I ate the burrito and it wasn't very good. Not sure I'll ever go back."}
{"text":"Wahoo's is in a few words: a God send. The Calimex/Baja inspired menu has strong variety and some of the best prices in town considering the quality of the food. This isn't typical bar food. My personal favorite dish there to get are the Wahoo Fries (with black beans). You'll thank me later... They are life changing. Other recommendations include the Burning Rolls and Carne Asada Tacos. The best thing is that everything looks and tastes fresh.... While being extremely easy on your wallet.

The bar is pretty standard fare, though I've gone to Wahoos during twilight hours only, so I am ignorant to happy hour specials they run for their food and drinks, which I am sure are numerous. If you ever visit Wahoos late night, make sure you get Brian as your bartender, great, great guy. 

The ambiance of Wahoos is pretty upbeat, you get a California beach vibe from the decor and lighting, and it isn't so drab like other variety bars. Overall, given the bang for your buck, I must give Wahoos my highest recommendation. 5 stars."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place. The service was actually very good & friendly. I did not enter the bar section, but decided to stay in the restaurant area. The staff working there did not keep bothering me every 10 seconds, like most places, and that deserves an A+. The food was superb & well priced. Also, it was nice to eat out as a family (of 3) for under $30 and know that it's on the healthier side. 
For the second time now, this place has been a good night out. I like the vibe and the promptness of the kitchen. You'll definitely see me again!"}
{"text":"I was in the Lamp Store in Boca when I spotted this place. I'm not very observant and apparently it has been here a while without me noticing.

I jump in for lunch and take a seat at the bar. I am immediately i.d.'ed which seemed a little strange as I have not, sadly, been asked for my i.d. for about 21 years AND I had ordered just an iced-tea. 

It is a strange choice of location, situated on a corner with open doors and each side and wind blowing through. Nice but your view is the Target parking lot and party City. 

I order some tacos, choice of six fillings, they arrived quickly and were tasty and well priced. TVs everywhere and a few interior tables. I like it and I will go back."}
{"text":"Great food great service in store and at the corporate level what more could you ask for!"}
{"text":"Went for a free meal after getting their app downloaded.
I sat in the bar & was excited about getting a free meal (as I mentioned to the bartender) and he said the app offer is for California only. Huh? 
But he said he'd give it to me. Yay! The offer is a taco or enchilada with beans 'n rice. I had the fish enchilada & it was very good. The hot sauce I added to it was a nice complement. 

The bar was smoky the few times I've been here before, and I almost lucked out this time as it was smoke free when I arrived. Alas, this was not to be for long, sadly. I have their player's club card and they have Ultimate X at the bar, 5 cent minimum, so that is a plus. The view is outstanding too, as it overlooks the Strip. 
I've had a few meals here and have liked everything, especially the spicy bowl which you can get with any protein. I had it with shrimp and it's tasty. It's fresh, quality food."}
{"text":"Love the decor, very beachy and fun. I tried 2 different tacos (carnitas and fish)
and they were good but not great. I've only been once to this Boca Park location and will return to try some other menu items. 
I didn't spend time at the bar, but it looked nice and they have great drink specials, such as $2 Pacifico."}
{"text":"Kevin, Molly and Ashley what more could you ask for?? Oh wait great food they have that too..:)"}
{"text":"Amazing place! Great service and food! On our first visit they gave great suggestions and we had a great experience! If your passing through Las Vegas we highly recommend taking the time to try the on in Henderson! It's a spot we we definitely come back to! Talk about excellent service:)"}
{"text":"Reminds me of California. The food was good, staff was friendly and I enjoyed the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Eating at Wahoo's definitely reminds me of college days in San Diego :)

I grew up in SoCal, and embarrassingly had never eaten at Wahoo's....I mean, it's a chain fish taco place, how could it be any better than El Pescador or The Best Fish Tacos in Ensada? Well, okay, it's not.... BUT it's darn good for a grilled fresh fish taco and considering I'm in the middle of the desert, that's pretty awesome!  

I have a hard time deciding between the original style vs. the citrus slaw bc both are equally yummy in my opinion: the citrus slaw is fresh and compliments the fish well, but the green sauce is soooo good!  I always just end up ordering one of each! Problem solved!

The decor here is casual surfer/skater hangout, and they're always playing chill rock/alt that reminds me of carefree high school days in the sun. The bar always has at least 2-3 people there (even in the early weekday afternoon!), and I can only imagine it being more popular after work lets out. 

I live so close to Boca Park, I'll be back often!! Kowabunga dude!

PS- free wifi!"}
{"text":"Overrated food served by friendly staff in a spacious and not too crowded location.

Read that fish tacos was the main attraction, which comes in grilled or Cajun format.  It is healthier, as there are a lot of veggies, but it is dry and relatively bland in taste.

The enchilada (also ordered with Cajun fish) is better, mostly attributed to the homemade spicy verde sauce.

The Wahoo's Salad looks great and the portion is large. Sadly, looking good is not the same as tasting good.

Anyway, glad I came and gave it a try but I have no urge to return for an encore.

Parking: 5/5. Plenty of spaces.

Food:  2/5.  Costco's frozen section probably has better tacos.

Price:  3/5.  $2.55 for a soft taco or enchilada is not bad, but better spent at a local taco stand.

Service:  4/5.  Friendly, especially towards the ladies. 

Food is the main reason for going to restaurants, so Wahoo's may scored high in other attributes, but it was not good enough to earn a repeat visit or recommendation.  Sorry."}
{"text":"I tend to visit this location a bit more than the boca park due to it being next to where a good chunk of my friends live. It's not a bad bar at all. I've watched tons of sporting events and had a good time. It's also good because the bar is a bit more seperated from the restaurant. One major factor that the Boca Park location has over this is the patio. It absolutely changes the dynamic and I wish this location had one like that. That aside,  I still love wahoos with its cheap food, cheap drinks. (Mostly) fun bartenders who have no problem joining in on the fun most of the time"}
{"text":"Wahoo is more than the name of this place, it's the sound you make when you're here. 
I discovered wahoos in Cali and was so stoked that there was one so close to my job. It's not exactly hiding, but it's just in a location that very easy to not notice, at least for me, but now I always see it
What I love about wahoos is the atmosphere. When I come for lunch it's a nice quiet restaurant, when I come for happy hour it's a raucous bar that happens to serve really good food. They have tons of drink specials from $2 pacificos, $6 patron and tons of nfl specials. The bartenders are always cool and good conversation even when it gets super busy
The food is well above average, as everything is build your own so you can get fish or shrimp on anything.im always there for a reef burrito and I throw fish on it. 

TL;DR
a very good environment reminiscent of SoCal with good Mexican food and cheap alcohol"}
{"text":"The food was good for quick service we both had salmon bowls.. one with white rice and one with brown.. but the corona Rita can use some work.. the margarita portion of it was was quite possibly the worst margarita my friend and I have ever had in our lives .."}
{"text":"It's been awhile Yelp. I haven't written a review for ages, but I was so compelled to write a review following my recent visit to the newly opened Wahoo's in town. 

Now, I've been to the original Wahoos franchise in San Diego for the first time last year and had an excellent experience. The food was excellent and the service was top notch. Before I dive into the service aspect about this particular Vegas location, I'll touch on the food a bit. Simply put, nowhere near the same. The quality of the food is average at best and the prices are a bit higher. The first time I went I was excited, a bit disappointing, but I was willing to go there again if I happened to be in the area. And so this particular night, I was.

First and foremost, I'd like to consider myself a pretty patient and tolerable person. If a server takes awhile to refill drinks and/or doesn't seem to be \"trying\" to cater to my very modest needs, I almost always shrug it off. But this particular night I was left beyond speechless. 

Me and a group of 5 or 6 walked into Wahoos looking to simply grab a bite to eat after a long night of drinking. The place was relatively empty, there was maybe one or two other people there. Right upon entering, a friend of mine immediately greeted the bartender with \"How are ya tonight sir?\". The bartender responded with \"Don't call me sir\" without a smile. We shrugged it off, sat down, an ordered promptly. Since most of us were only looking to eat, we asked if we could put in our food orders. He literally rejected our request and sternly stated that he would only take drink orders, and aggressively and rudely tried to convince each and every one of us to drink. 

After finally accepting our food orders, it took 10 minutes to get water. Another 5 to receive drinks. Most of our friends never even got theirs. When we asked about them, he spoke to us in a dumbfounded, i can do no wrong manner. 

The wait for our food to arrive was average, and I was understanding because it was past 3AM and they probably only had one cook. But I reasoned that it was slow, and most of us had simply ordered taco plates. But then the food started trickling out of the kitchen one by one, each dish coming out 5 minutes apart. Not only did he forget who had what., but every single order was painfully incorrect. Every. Single. Order. We had simple, unmodified orders. Watching your friends eat one by one is extremely unacceptable. I've been in the foodservice industry, it's an industry standard to send food out together. One of my friends, the last to have not received his food, inquired about the status of his order. The bartender asked what he had ordered, smiled and said it was coming soon. We then watched him walk over and punch in my friends order, 45 minutes after he had initially ordered it, 

After that we all had enough and a few of my friends walked out the door. I have NEVER in my life have walked out on a tab, but when we started complaining he at least agreed to comp our bill, even though I told him I had no problem paying , because I knew I was never coming back. But while we were trying to figure out why everything went so wrong, he simply shrugged.

I usually love to write reviews because I love spreading the word about great businesses and good eats, but this was the first time I came here, compelled to keep other people away from this place.

Matt, I'm sorry \"sir\" but you fucked up big time."}
{"text":"Doing an edit on my original review since I hear the server I had a complaint with was finally fired in the last couple of months so now I'm alright with calling her out by name.  Had two messed up customer service experiences late 2012 with their bartender, Candi.  I've seen at least a couple other regulars complain about her on here and I fully agree with their remarks about her having issues with drinking on the job, blowing off customers to flirt with one guy and just having a bad attitude in general.  In addition to that, last time I saw her in Nov she made some completely off-the-wall accusations about me which things like security footage and looking at our phone/ text history would've easily disproved.  I was a regular of hers for a year, from before Wahoo's, and she completely turned on me when I tried to talk to her about the drinking and ignoring customers problem!

After our last encounter, I brought this issue to management's attention and never received a response, an acknowledgement that my letter had been received (couldn't seem to find a manager in person at this store), NOTHING.  I've attempted contact with managers, owners, the corporate office and filed with the BBB.  These people have completely ignored me!  Not exactly customer-friendly service, is it??  I don't know if they were cutting her a break for being hot or if she was sleeping with someone in charge but it's completely unprofessional and unacceptable that they didn't take my, or others, complaints about her seriously.  I hear the reason she got fired didn't even have anything to do with her issues on the job!  I also heard from a buddy of mine in the service industry that they transferred her to the Boca Park location a couple of times, at least once because of her inability to do her job well while working the Sunset Sunday night shift unsupervised.  Really don't understand how she kept her job so long while other employees got fired for stupid, far less serious things.

Bottom line, if you have a complaint these people will NOT hear you out or do anything about it.  They just don't care about the customers so, in my opinion, they shouldn't have any.  If you've ever had an issue with Candi or any other servers please have enough respect for yourself to just walk away and take your business elsewhere.  These people don't deserve your money."}
{"text":"I have a major bone to pick with the management of these stores.  Had a couple of really bad customer service experiences with their server, Candi, attempted to file a complaint about it and nothing was ever done.  I have spent a ridiculous amount of time just trying to get someone to acknowledge the issue and tell me they would look into it and they couldn't even give me that.  I was a regular for several months, spent my last birthday at this location, have NEVER had an issue worth filing a complaint about in my life and they just ignore me??  GREAT customer service!  You can check out my review on the Sunset store for more details about what went down.  Just sharing here because I know the management has gone back and forth between both of these locations.  I also heard that Candi was transferred to Boca Park once or twice because of issues she was having at the Sunset location.

{"text":"Wanted something quick and affordable after work and decided to try wahoo's fish tacos love the slaw they place on top of the fish tacos and the black beans and wild rice with a  touch of their hotsauce was very nice."}
{"text":"Ordered this through the Postmates app. I ordered vegetarian enchiladas and chicken slaw tacos. I loved the enchiladas, very fresh and cheesy without being overly greasy. I also ordered a side or guac and there was plenty and it tasted great mixed in with the citrus slaw. My husband loved his tacos felt they were the perfect size. I love that they have two options for veg heads- mushrooms and tofu especially if you're not really into tofu"}
{"text":"First time trying Wahoos n mmmmmmmm ! Got the street taco sampler , along with chips n salsa. Also had to try the hottest sauce they offer \" Mr. Lees\"  . I was just going to use it as an additional sauce for my chips but it compliments the 3 tacos as well. Clean place and friendly servers. Just wish it was warmer out so I could of sat outside."}
{"text":"I wasn't too excited about trying Wahoo's, but we got together with friends last night and compromised on Wahoo's. 

You order at the register and then they deliver the food to your table. The menu is extensive, verging on too many options. It was a little confusing and ended up taking us a little bit to figure out what we all wanted. I decided on the basic two taco combination plate. I ordered the grilled fish taco with spicy salsa, tofu taco, white rice (they served me brown by mistake) and white beans. My fella got a chicken burrito combination and also a side fish taco. My friends ordered as well and we all got a cookie for dessert and found a booth. 

The food took a bit of time to come out and unfortunately our meals came out quite a bit of time before  our friends. Once we all had our meals, we dug in. The food was a little bland, even though I asked for spicy on everything. The brown rice was dry and the beans wet. The flavors weren't too exciting either. The fish was a little dry and the tofu, although nice was bland. The food was plentiful but I only ate a few bites of the sides since they were lackluster. 

Everyone else seemed to feel the same way about the food. The cookie was ok, nothing special. I don't think I'll make Wahoo's a regular on our food rotation."}
{"text":"Just ok.  I had two taco entree and it seemed bland. Rice was tasteless but the black beans were tasty Lunchtime had 5 tAbles occupied. Cool theme. Music army a decent level so we could talk Food was delivered to table no one every came by to check if things were fine  there are a bunch of hot sauces in a 6 pack on the table. Mine were mostly empty or filthy - I grabbed an adjacent tables 6 pack. 
Underwhelming, probably would not return"}
{"text":"Great Food friendly staff. Sat in bar area with three friends. Served quickly,we each had the taco and beer special. Good selection of draft beer which is a plus. Had a great time will go back. Tacos were really good."}
{"text":"More than happy, friggin stuffed. Gunner is incredible..... Food was great, now to finish my ........"}
{"text":"I randomly popped in here yesterday to catch some football and a bite, as someone who doesn't get out much I could tell as I was walking in that I made a good choice. There was a good amount of fellow football fans who had the same plan. 

You can definitely tell this place has a lot of good regulars, but if you're a newbie you aren't ignored. As someone that isn't a drinker, I get left hanging at other places after they hear my water order...NOT THE CASE AT ALL HERE. Marisela was eager to grab my water and even dropped off a menu, in the midst of her full bar of customers. 

Shortly after, my food order goes in (I'm a taco fiend so naturally that was what ordered) on a busy day like this it was out surprisingly fast, and was exactly what I hoped for. I was continuously checked on and was asked if there was anything I needed, I seriously couldn't count on both hands how many times I was checked...I love that! Even a low spending visitor is treated like something special. 

I'll definitely have to return to the place some time in the future, Sunday mornings Marisela seems to be the favorite, but I heard many GREAT things about another employee who was simply called \"Floody\". Every assumed regular I met seems to love them both. Even though I'm not much of a drinker, the employees, service and tacos are more than enough for me to return!"}
{"text":"We had seen this place for a while but never had stopped in.  Finally made the stop and well worth the wait.   Ordered 2 burritos one the citrus slaw the other the bonzai both were huge when we got them home.   Had them served wet with green sauce I for sure recommend doing that instead of dry it just locks in so much flavor!  

The bonzai burrito had spicy chicken and for one of the first meals in a long time I didn't feel like it was lacking heat.   It was perfectly seasoned and cooked.

The citrus slaw was ordered with shrimp and each bite was super tasty.  Not to overpowering on citrus.

The only negative we found was it was a task to cut through the burritos because they were so large.  Not a bad problem to have!"}
