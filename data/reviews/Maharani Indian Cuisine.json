{"text":"Food was very bland and watery. Trying to cut costs?  Owner and head waiter rude to customers.. Is this the way to run a business ?  Avoid !"}
{"text":"The food is extremely hit or miss, but I'm updating now after many, many meals to say that I'm not sure food safety is up to par. My partner and I have consistently experienced major gastro distress for a few days after eating here, even when there was zero spice. Delivery, dine-in, buffet, it's across-the-board questionable.  The flavor is so-so or downright bad more often than good (85% bad), and sometimes the chicken is rock hard. That combined with the--erm--potential consequences of major throne time have led us to give this place a serious break.  (previous review) This is a review of the Saturday Indian lunch buffet. There was a decent selection, although mostly chicken, but the food was just okay. It honestly lacked flavor and could have been hotter (temperature), which was a real disappointment. My partner and I love Indian food and when we seek it out we're looking for a major flavor kick, but this just felt \"okay but bland.\"   Waiters brought a small basket of naan to the table, and we had to ask for extra, which didn't come before the end of our meal. The naan was also flavorless, kind of like low grade white bread without any zip. I wondered if they make it on site or if it was delivered frozen (the naan from Costco is better).  It was also hard to get water refills, which were swift at the start but then slowed to no-refill-for-you. Parched!   Maybe dinner or made to order meals are better, but we're going to keep trying other places before we would head here again."}
{"text":"I travel to CLT fairly regular on business. Went here with some co-workers and was disapponted. Waitstaff was not helpful with the menu. The food was mediocre at best. Had the paneer appetizer and it tasted like they were trying to make a McNugget with cheese. Sauces were tasty but now I wonder if they came from a can. If you really want great Indian food... Go to Copper. If you want McIndian go for it."}
{"text":"Great surprise!  Yelped for an Indian restaurant in Charlotte and fell on this nice and Clean restaurant. Lucky enough got to order a Thali dish that was succulent. It had all the mosaic of taste you expect from an Indian restaurant. Had a mango lassi... perfect and finished with a gulab jamun... Simply heavenly amazing."}
{"text":"Food is simple and good here, Me and my Wife went for the first time today for lunch from office and liked the food.  No extra spices added, Food is all good as per the spice levels of an American Indian Standard. Great service and see people enjoying their visits, We do feel like going here again.   Altogether this was better than the other Indian food places tasted earlier near Charlotte downtown area.  Next time for Dinner soon.!"}
{"text":"It was my first visit to this place. We were a group of friends and we went here because my friend was leaving for Italy and it was his wish to eat the tikka masala from here. So we thought, no harm in trying this new place. Food was absolutely okay. I felt it's expensive according to the quality and taste. Anyways, I would never give a restaurant one star just for average food. It is because of their behavior.   Our waiter, a young guy, he was good and friendly but too much intrusive. But that's fine as well. We were a group of 6 people and having fun, cracking jokes etc. I think that is why we all go out. We were a bit slow in eating as the concentration was on having fun rather than food. There was this old guy who is a waiter here who was passing by our table and giving us cold looks every time. Finally he came to our table and told us, \"guys can you hurry up, we also have to go home as we are tired\". He could have told this to us in a better way. He could have been little polite. I work for a similar industry and no body in hospitality industry tell their customers to hurry up. It spoilt the mood of our whole group, we paid the bill and left quickly. Never going back here. We also overheard both the waiters fighting over the same incidence in the next room as they were too loud and the old guy was using terrible language."}
{"text":"Very bad service, rude staff, no customer delight. We ordered 2 entrees with spice level as American hot for chicken dish and Indian hot for veg. And they made both the entrees burning hot. We hardly could eat anything and left everything like that. And when we told the waiter that it is unbearable hot his response was rude.  Will never recommend to anybody."}
{"text":"I loved the food! It got super busy when I went in, but they handled everyone perfectly.  I will be back. It was clean and the AC was on. Food kept coming out because it was being devoured!"}
{"text":"This was a great meal but with rushed service.  We had dinner on a weekday. My mother ordered the murg vindaloo \"Indian hot\" and loved the level of spiciness.  I order the kadhai paneer medium. Now, my heart sinks when the waiter at an Indian restaurant asks how hot I want it.  (My standard answer is \"however the chef thinks it should be\", but waiters never accept that answer.)  Where I live a customer is never asked, but it seems to be a standard question in smaller cities.  My dish turned out to be perfectly seasoned.  My only issue was how quickly we were rushed out.  The waiter was asking us about dessert before my mother had finished her entrée.  We ordered dessert and it arrived--before my mother had finished her entrée.  The check came lickety-split.  I'm not sure what the hurry was as we were there at an early hour."}
{"text":"I don't know how the other reviewers had anything but the best of Indian food experiences.  The service was wonderful, decor modern and the food was the best Indian I've had since I left Philly in 2003.  I ordered dinner: Paneer Makhani (requested spicy, but could have handled much more), lamb samosas, and garlic naan.  It was absolutely delicious.  Perhaps it's just the lunch buffet that isn't up to snuff?  I found my experience (and food!) to be the BEST in Charlotte - and I've tried every single one of them.  I strongly recommend.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Got takeout from this place last night with my BF.  So, my review only covers the food, not the ambiance:  First, let me say that this place is quick when picking it up.  Well, quicker than the place I order from in Atlanta.  That place is snail-like.  But we drove over there, BF went in to pick up the food, and was back in two minutes.  NIce.  Food was very good too!  We ordered samosas for an app, chicken curry, chana masala, and an order of naan (total: ~$32).  All was good.  They included a couple of different sauces than the ones I've seen served with Indian food before.  One was a flourescent green color, the other was a brown, sweet sauce.  Wasn't really sure what these went with.  I'd like to try out actually going to the restaurant, but, I'm fearful that I will leave the restaurant smelling like curry when I leave, as this is the smell that wafted in as the BF came back to the car.  So be advised."}
{"text":"Visiting Charlotte for the weekend and participated in the Tour de Food event which featured this restaurant. The restaurant was clean, quaint with nice ambience. The food was very good and since it was lunch time, they featured a buffet which allowed us to sample many of their items. The curry chicken and tandoori chicken were excellent and the other items were very good as well. If you're in the mood for good Indian cuisine, this place is definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"They do a good job here. We ordered delivery for a team lunch meeting and they were kind enough to take an early order and deliver promptly at 11am. The food was good and hit the spot for most folks. Chicken tikka masala and kadhai paneer was loved by all !"}
{"text":"The food tastes good but is extremely bland and so lacks the Indian experience.   The servers were not a friendly and approachable. However the service was quick."}
{"text":"There are not much options for buffet on Sunday. The reason we have been told is that their is a football match going on so we didn't prepare much :(  Food taste was not that great for the money we are paying. Tried to explore this restaurant but came out very disappointed..  Please please please guys avoid this restaurant if you are looking for good Indian food. There are no more than 13 dishes in a Sunday grand buffet for the price of $13 they are charging. And coming to the taste it is horrible."}
{"text":"Have been twice for the lunch buffet.  If you are new to Indian cuisine, this may be the way to go.  Costs roughly $10 if my memory serves me correctly.  All dishes are labeled, so have no fear.  Samosas were great - flavorful but not too heavy.  Naan was OK - I've had much better.  Their version was a little too thin and crispy for my liking, but hey, it's really only there to balance out the spiciness of the other dishes anyway.  The Butter Chicken is by far my favorite dish.  Ever since having this dish at Maharani, I've tried tracking down the butter chicken sauce at local grocers, with only moderate success.  Good stuff.  Service is OK, but you have to expect just OK service when you're eating from the buffett.  There are better Indian restaurants in town, BUT, this place makes for a decent business lunch if you want something outside of the norm."}
{"text":"Consistently disappointing. My fiance and I have ordered from here several times and have never had a good experience. The food is very bland and very overpriced. We are both big Indian food fans, and we have  tried both vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes from Maharani. The only thing I would ever order again is the naan, which is ok."}
{"text":"It has been a long time since I have felt the need to \"Yelp\".  Eating here night before last has brought me back to Yelp....and not in a good way.  The best thing about our meal was my Diet Coke.  The wait staff had to be reminded several times of what we ordered.  The food was not to my liking at all.  Honestly and truly ...as I was eating I was reminded of the scene in National Lampoon's European Vacation when Clark and crew at the French restaurant near the Eiffel Tower.  The food tasted like it had been frozen and warmed up.  I have honestly had better RTE meals from Patel Brothers grocery store.  You know the type...the ones that come in the box for like 3 bucks....  Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Very poor quality of food and when I asked for a refund, I was refused.  The food was not as described. It was poorly made and poor ingredients were used. Let alone very poor value for portion size.  As someone who grew up eating Indian food, I would strongly suggest people avoid this establishment."}
{"text":"i went here for lunch because of the great reviews i saw on yelp. i had the buffet since it was one of my first times having authentic indian food. the food was very flavorful, but my tastebuds didn't like it. i would still recommend it to others who like indian food. the service was good."}
{"text":"I've yet to try Woodlands, so Maharani is currently my go-to Indian in Charlotte (mostly because it's right around the corner).  I've only ever had their lunch buffet, and I've been pleased both with the price (LOVE) and number of vegetarian options.  Fully half the buffet is veg, which is more than I can say of other Indian buffets.  The curries were decent but less spicy than I would like.  With that said, I have to echo others in raving about their samosas, which were the spiciest thing on the buffet and were truly revelatory.  I would go back to Maharani simply for the samosas, hands-down.  The people that own it seem nice."}
{"text":"I've only tried 2 Indian restaurants in Charlotte but this is my new favorite! The takeout order chicken Tikka masala, was AMAZING. The right spicy, enough sauce, the naan was well done and the entire meal was hot. The guy who waited on me was very polite at best 9pm and told me it would be 20min, I think it was out in 10."}
{"text":"Great food. If you like to be a little adventurous and enjoy different food, try this place. For the connoisseurs:  many people of Indian ancestry eating here, which is a good sign! Nice service also."}
{"text":"Won't be back. I will preface my review by saying that I am a stickler for adequate customer service. That said, I have patronized this business at least 5 times with consistent experiences. The food is decent Indian food at a convenient location. The customer service however has been lacking each and every time. The straw that broke the camel's back for me was my entrance to the establishment today. As I approached the door, there was a server standing there who clearly saw me coming in. Instead of opening the door or at the very least, remaining to greet me, he turned and walked away. Once I entered there was no warm welcome (which I should not have expected given previous visits) but instead, I was rushed through to determine if I would stay for the buffet or if I was there to pick up takeout. I won't belabor the point, I will just reiterate that this was my last time spending money in a restaurant that does not appreciate my business. Their customer service is seriously lacking and the food is good at best but certainly nothing special."}
{"text":"We went on a Saturday for the lunch buffet. Food was good. Nice veg and non veg options. Wish they had better dessert options. What's more the staff were very friendly even to a non regular like me and my family. They were accommodated nicely to our requests when we went with our two small kids. Bill was 11$ each. Definitely will return. Must go place for Indian restaurant."}
{"text":"Food was just about okay. Paneer makhni was way too creamy that you could only taste the cream and not the curry!"}
{"text":"The lunch buffet wasn't that great and didn't have a lot of options. However my dinner experience was good, especially the malai kofta, butter chicken and briyani. 5 stars for that"}
{"text":"Food is always good here. Staff always seems more annoyed we're there than anything else. Ask a question... Annoyed having to answer. Not doing the lunch buffet... Annoyed to bring you a menu. I've been in the high-end restaurant biz for 2 decades. Hostess happily thanked us and smiled. Only smile I saw from any of the staff. 3rd time there. Would rather drive all the way out to Woodland for Indian food."}
{"text":"The food was great, the staff friendly, the atmosphere was a little lacking.   I ask for extra hot and wasn't very hot.   I would suggest this place to people wanting Indian on a budget or to people looking for a local sports bar."}
{"text":"it was ok, the actual food was pretty good. the naan was nice, the seasoning on both of our dishes was very savory, however be warned medium is very very mild, that was our fault not there's.  My problem laid with the service and staff, the ambiance and the loud music.  The staff was grumpy the music was loud bollywood which i think was only on for the staff and yah, i just dont know.  I think as a takeout it would be ok.   it is probably actually a 2.5 but more of a two reaching for a three than a three sliding.    food itself was probably a 3.5"}
{"text":"I like Indian food, Maharani just a-ok (yea solid three stars). I went there for a double date on Monday Night. The appetizer was samosa (meh..), Malai Kabab (ooh yuuuum...) and lentil soup (they ground the lentil, quite a different tasting) . I got chicken and vegetable, to be honest my least favorite of the table (oh sure the grass is greener  on the other side) but my side of Garlic Naan is a winner. The chicken Marsala was my favorite dish on the table.   Aside from the food, the waiters can't wait to fill your water (seriously, take a sip and it will get fill in the next 120 seconds). On the other hand, it could be just another Monday Night.   Also, if you want to build your appetite before dinner/lunch, cross the street and turn left for a great stroll to the Freedom Park by the time you get back, you ready for some serious food."}
{"text":"This place is awesome I've been quite a few times since moving here, and I'm a huge fan of Indian food. This is definitely my favorite and I've tried a bunch of Indian restaurants in FL. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Top notch Indian without driving to Mississauga or India town. Fish Pakora is the perfect match to your choice of 19 beers on tap. Do not worry about heat they will dial it up or down. Friendly staff and ownership.  Quality control is always on the mark I have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Over the years, the quality of the food and the service had declined. They used to have great food, but maybe over the years the chef changed- and the quality has come down. It is a cross between an English bar and Indian restaurant.  If you are concerned about ambience, you may not like it. I honestly believe they need to decide what type of restaurant they want to be - an authentic Indian restaurant or an English bar- having both under one roof is not a bright idea."}
{"text":"So bad! I lived in the UK for 10 years and trust me the standard of Indian food there is second to none - but Charlotte eeek! the standard is appalling. I ordered a Vindaloo which would normally be too hot for me as my heat level is a Madras but the one from here had no spice I mean none at all - it was closer to an Irish stew than Vindaloo!!!"}
{"text":"I've been to Maharani many times and each time I've wondered, as have my dining companions, why do I come here?  The staff are cold and unwelcoming and they make you feel very uncomfortable, as though your presence was an inconvenience.  As time has gone by, their lunchtime buffet has become more about the cheaper vegetable dishes and the same uninspired tired chicken dishes.  After our last visit yesterday we decided that that would be our last. We prefer to eat where we are made to feel welcome."}
{"text":"Terrific food here. I asked for hot(spicey) chicken curry and it was terrific and very spicy. The service is fantastic, my server watching my table constantly, ready to refill or get anything you need.  A first class experience!"}
{"text":"I am giving this place a four star review because of their hours, their menu, the fact that it is a family owned restaurant, and the fact that everything I have had has been good.   If you go, though, be aware that you need to communicate well. The waiters don't slow down or enunciate enough for my stupid American ears. So listen carefully and be sure to be thorough in what you want. I mumble, they mumble, and then you may get Lamb when you wanted Chicken, like my husband got. Still tasty and we didn't really care that the meat was different since we like to try new things. The wait staff doesn't fawn all over you, but they are perfectly fine and I haven't had trouble flagging a waiter down.  They are open when other Indian restaurants are closed. I would love to try more Indian in the area, but this place seems the most convenient for us. The menu is very substantial and much clearer than other Indian menus, so you get to intelligently experiment.   I have had the Murg Tikka Masala (what you get if you don't know what to order because you know it'll be great), the Murg Vindaloo (spicy but has more flavor variety and some potato), the Murg Lajwab (a mango ginger dish). Murg means Chicken, ya'll. All were great and I had enough to bring home leftovers. An entree is about 11-15 dollars. We always get the Garlic Naan, and it's only a couple bucks.   Usually when I order something spiced \"hot\" the restaurant assumes I don't know what I want and they serve it much milder than I want (....this happens at every wings place I ever go to). Maharani will serve it HOT. So hot, that I may need to order it medium-hot next time. I just ordered a side of Raita (yogurt-cucumber condiment) to stop the burn.  They have a buffet 12-3 on Sundays that I intend to check out since I can't make their weekday lunch buffet. Nothing like an Indian buffet. Yum!"}
{"text":"The lunch buffet is really great, everything is fresh and full of interesting flavor - nothing is spicy hot, though. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"Had dinner here last Wednesday: Food - overall good - most items were tasty Service - decent Value for money - poor -- quantity of food insufficient (particularly for the kebabs) for the prices charged"}
{"text":"Maharani is a pretty solid 3-stars in my book.  Considering Woodlands Indian is my most favorite restaurant in the world, Maharani had a lot to live up to...  Came here for the lunch buffet on a Friday, this place was packed!  Normally, I'd be put off by the masses, but this just meant the buffet items were frequently replenished with fresh ones.   $9 for all you can eat Indian food is a great deal.  There were 4 vegetarian dishes (yay!!!) and 2-3 chicken dishes. There was also jasmine rice, naan, sauces, salad, and rice pudding.  The food was good, but not great. It was tasty, but nothing amazing. It just didn't seem to be prepared with love and tedious care like I'm accustomed to at Woodlands. The naan was good, but not fluffy and not melt in your mouth like I prefer.   The service was mixed. The hostess and one other staff were a little cold and off-putting.  But I had another staff who was so sweet and kind and accommodating (brought my friend and I an extra pitcher of water because we were wicked thirsty).  FYI - There's a BOGO coupon in the Charlotte Citipass book, but it doesn't apply to the lunch buffet."}
{"text":"After visiting a number of restaurants for the buffet, I have had some great ones...and some good ones.  Marahani's buffet was a good one.  A quick stop for lunch on the way to the theater provided enough nourishment to keep me from filling up on popcorn!  It was good...the butter chicken, the aloo tikki were very good. I was slightly disappointed with the watery tamarind sauce.  I love the sauce when it has a thicker consistency.  The service was sub-typical for buffet.  Not once did the wait staff ask if all was OK...or if we needed anything else.  OK...I am spoiled by better service....but you have to expect it when you are out at a restaurant.  It makes you feel like you are having lunch or dinner where you are really appreciated."}
{"text":"Sooooo ... my husband and I ordered take out from there and I ordered the Mutter Paneer. However, when it got to the house it was Palak Paneer. I asked my husband why I got the wrong thing and he told me that he asked about it when he picked it up and said \"we ordered the mutter paneer\" and the person who was working said \"oh it;s the same thing\" ........... what? If the people who work there don't understand what the difference is between their food that is terrible. As was the Palak Paneer. I didn't bother calling them because if it wasn't a priority then it wouldn't be after we picked it up."}
{"text":"We grabbed food to go. We ordered 3 dishes and naan. Our total was over $50. The portions were not large, and the flavors were really lacking. The overwhelming flavor for all three dishes was simply salt. The rice that accompanies each entree order was mostly hard. Overall, the meal was a disappointment. We will not be back."}
{"text":"Excellent Indian food, and one of the best in town for takeout.  They recently renovated their interior and it is a good place to dine in.  Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"I have been here multiple times and the chicken tikka masala never disappoints. Also had the butter chicken tonite and it was equally as good. The chicken kabob appetizer was also on point. The garlic naan is great too. The service is fast and pleasant. It's my go to Indian restaurant for sure."}
{"text":"Let me preface this review with the fact that I did not actually eat the food at this restaurant. I am giving them two stars solely based on the fact that their menu looked pretty good and this is one of the only fairly priced Indian places in Charlotte.  The main reason I am giving them a low rating is that we came to the restaurant on a slow Thursday night. When we walked to the other room where a bunch of tables are, we saw 5-6 open tables. Our host proceeded to seat us at a small two person table right within the arch of the entry way. When we asked if we could sit in one of the open tables, we were declined. Normally I would grin and bear it, but the attitude of the host/waiter left a bad taste in my mouth. To be honest, I may be sticking with Situl for my Indian needs from now on."}
{"text":"Out of the Indian restaurants I've tried in Charlotte (Situl, Passage to India and this) Maharani is my favorite. We came for dinner and enjoyed everything we ordered thoroughly. The atmosphere is definitely the nicest out of those three restaurants, the staff is very friendly and attentive. All dishes tasted perfectly fresh and had plenty of meat, fresh vegetables etc. None of that creamed mush with three chunks of meat.   Maharani is slightly more expensive than Situl and Passage to India, but not by much. Veggie dishes start at 12, meat dishes at 15. My favorite so far there is the vegetable Jalfrezi, apparently a house specialty."}
{"text":"We have been ordering take out for years from Maharani. They food is good and they always have it ready with the order correct. We go for convenience but also for quality food."}
{"text":"Great Indian restaurant!  It's like stepping across a few continents and tasting authentic Indian cuisine.  The \"naan\" flat bread is piping hot when it comes to your table.  The garlic naan is my favorite.  And the curries are always wonderful.    If you haven't tried Indian food, take your time getting used to the menu.   Generally the main dishes are chicken, lamb or vegetables, in a different kind of curry sauce.  If you go on a date you can order two or three plates and share.  The items toward the top of each list are simpler and less spicy.  The further down the menu you go, the more interesting and spicy the dishes get.  I recommend starting with \"medium\" and seeing if that's too hot or if you'd actually like spicier.   If you ask for \"between mild and medium\" they can do that too.  I like to pick one meat dish and one vegetable dish, usually something with potatoes.  Dinner comes with basmati rice (long grain rice with a little saffron).  Super friendly service although not American style waitering.  There is generally a head waiter who is also the host.  They will seat you and take your order.  After that, other waiters will serve you in turn, one getting drinks and another serving food.  It can be a bit slow at times, so don't go if you're in a rush.  Give yourself at least an hour or two.  Even if you decide curry's not for you, it's an amazing experience of completely different flavors. When in doubt, order a chicken dish."}
{"text":"This place gave me horrible food poisoning. I ordered the butter chicken with garlic naan. The chicken was lukewarm and after awhile it was obvious that pieces of the chicken were old. I threw the rest away and about an hour after eating vomiting and diarrhea started."}
{"text":"Notwithstanding the location in the middle of a strip mall, I was thoroughly impressed with my meals from Maharani. I found the food rich and very flavorable. (Note, 4 out of 5 hot is pretty F'n hot.)"}
{"text":"Pretty solid lunch buffet. Clean, well priced & decent food. It does the job if you have a craving. It's not overly oily like most places! Atmosphere is pretty casual."}
{"text":"Pretty good indian food.  I've never gotten anything I didn't like here.  It's a little overpriced for what you get."}
{"text":"I ordered the Butter Chicken take out. It was not good at all. The sauce was too decadent but somehow manage to lack flavor? The chicken itself was the real issue though. It was almost ALL dark meat. It was really nasty. I am used to my butter chicken or tikka masala to be all white meat chicken. I will not order order ever again."}
{"text":"Good Indian food! Nice lunch buffet and decent customer service. I get the buffet to go and can eat at least two meals from the portion. They don't weigh the take away box which is nice."}
{"text":"Excellent meal and service - off the hook.  Yes Roberta we made it to Charlotte for dinner.  Plan to head back for the lunch buffet.   If your adventurous dinner and like spice head over there.  I don't do a lot of Indian food - I need to take Brad there to get his seal of approval."}
{"text":"I decided to have a nice meal with my boyfriend and while the food was decent enough with mediocre service, the unpleasant surprise came at the end when they refused to honor a wfae member card which entitles the recipient to a BOGO deal (or 2  for 1). The server came out and told us he can only give us 10% off, I told him the card says 50% off and showed it to him on the phone. After mumbling something, he disappeared and came back offering 12% off. I told him I wanted to see the manager or owner. He said he was outside. He then proceeded to tell me that he only offer 12%. I told him he needs to honor the rules of the program and I intend on calling them to find out why they do not.  After leaving and dissapearing for another 10 mins, he finally came back and gave us the full discount. The owner never came out with explanation or apology.   As someone working in customer service field, I'm appalled by their treatment of patrons and will never step a foot in their establishment and intend of telling others the same thing.   To the owner and staff of Maharani- if you participate in a promotional program, read the rules and abide by them. If you can't do bother signing up for it."}
{"text":"Good indian food. They do not compromise on quantity as well as quality!"}
{"text":"Had the Sunday lunch buffet recently and I guess I'm just not used the style of service.  The food was pretty good though  I don't know the names of the dishes, but suffice to say, everything was coated in a spices and moderately spicy.  Perfect for the American palate, I guess.  The butter chicken was top notch, the curries decent, and the basmati rice was a little dry, but tasty nonetheless.  The buffet food could have been a little hotter.  The service was quite creepy and brings the rating from 4 to 3 stars.  I had several servers passing by my table repeatedly with the hands folded and scanning the room with their eyes.  When I asked for a water refill, they seemed quite aloof.  Is this normal?  They did, however, refresh the basket of naan quite frequently.  Who can diss hot bread?  For a hearty $11 lunch buffet, I might return if invited by a friend.  As a novice of Indian food, I'm intrigued by what I ate and yet something tells me that there's more to be desired."}
{"text":"I've had curry and vindaloo but I've never really had Indian food beyond that and I never been to an Indian restaurant. All I have to say is I'm going nvm because now I have to eat one of everything on their menu. It was delightful. The ambiance Id perfect and the experience is one that feels authentic. I'm definitely coming back this restaurant for more Indian food."}
{"text":"Good food, they have a lot of options and some traditional street food on their menu as well. Wish the dishes listed as spicy were a bit more spicy, and I think it is overall slightly overpriced."}
{"text":"This review is based on both the lunch buffet and dinner menu. The butter chicken was still watery and lacked flavor. The naan reminded me of cheap pita bread you can buy at a grocery store. Overall the ingredients in most of the dishes seemed low quality. The portions are way too small for the price you pay."}
{"text":"When me and my boyfriend came in, we noticed that the interior design was nicely decorated. As we were being sat, we noticed the table was literally five inches away from the table next to us. Not enough room for me and my boyfriend to leave if we have to go to the bathroom. We could not hear ourselves talk because of the conversation going on 5 inches from us. next, The buffet food selection was only eight to nine different things. The food was okay but lacked the spices and taste. The reason its not a one star is because of the excellent service we had gotten. The food was warm and nothing was heating it. We would not go back!"}
{"text":"I love Indian but was hesitant after transitioning to pescatarian..they actually had a lot of options for me to choose from though. The service was great but a bit overwhelming as 4 different people would approach us every 10-15 mins. I ordered the fish masala and was satisfied but the fish could've used a bit more seasoning..I would revisit just probably order something different"}
{"text":"Six of us ate their brunch yesterday and each one of us got stomach upset. Very less options, and most of the items were tasteless. Wine was in the menu but no one were refilling the bottle. One star is for their service which although was average, but superceded the low quality food. Will never visit again."}
{"text":"One of the jhur indian food in the  area.  Eat buffet there dry and test less food. Tandoori chicken looks like boiled chicken. I don't think so was from tandoor. Manager continuously looking at us unless we finished. Mango Lassi was just pulp and sugar mixed. They have to learn how to make mango lassi."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here for dinner on Monday night. Very nice and hospitable staff. All food was wonderful. We started out with chaat papri and mushroom pakora, then Bhindi Masala and Goat Curry for entrees. All were well made and very tasty. The staff were very attentive and even gave us extra sauces to accompany our leftovers. We look forward to going to their brunch this Sunday as we heard it will be a great spread!"}
{"text":"First time here and was quite impressed. They've remodeled recently and the place looks great. Saag paneer was good as was meat samosa. Highlight of meal was young lamb spiced barbecue kana masala. Best Indian dish in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"To me this is the best Indian restaurant in Charlotte! The food here tastes great! It's very clean! And they are always ready to serve a drink or clean your plate or bring the naan! Very friendly employees!"}
{"text":"Although hubby and I eat Indian food everyday at home...we were craving North Indian fare which I rarely get around to making at home. We went on a Saturday night...it wasn't packed so we got seated right away. Most of their patronage are non Indians which often means that the food is good but not spicy. Hubby and I are huge fans of spicy food as I've mentioned in previous reviews. Hubby got the Chicken tandoori and I got the chicken vindaloo (which is supposed to be spicy) and is a Goan speciality...something I am very familiar with :o) When the waiter came by hubby and I asked him if he could make these dishes spicy. He looked at us and asked \"Indian spicy\" and we both grinned away and said absolutely. And they delivered! The flavors were great and it satisfied our spiceometer. The only thing is would say is the vindaloo could have been a bit more sour. The tandoori chicken was moist and yum. But the highlight had to be the garlic naan. They didn't go cheap on the garlic and the naan was soft and delish!! Service was polite and fast. and then thew in some extra butter chicken sauce even though we didn't order any. Sooooo goooood.  We will be going back when we get cravings for Indian AND spicy food!"}
{"text":"Maharani is an OK Indian restaurant as far as I am concerned.  Not sure if its the Chef or the spices they use or the way they cook.  It doesn't feel special to me. Have only taken to-go orders couple times and not very happy or impressed with the food.  The first time was a super blunder, as in - we ordered chicken biryani I guess (it was long time ago) and I saw corn in it.  I mean, corn in a biryani come one that so anti - Indian way of making biryani.  It obviously altered the taste of the supposedly heavenly aromatic biryani. Another time we ordered some butter chicken and Naans, it was ok.  Something was missing in the spice rack but I am not able to find out what it exactly missed. The restaurant looked spacious enough and ambience was nice and clean.  Decent parking space, it is located in a strip mall."}
{"text":"It's okay. Nothing to write home about. I thought their portions were good, but their food wasn't spicy enough (even after asking for spicy) and it wasn't much better than the heated Trader Joe's Indian meals."}
{"text":"Delicious indian food! We always order the butter chicken and mutter paneer with garlic naan to go. The portions are huge!"}
{"text":"Ordered take out from here tonight. I haven't eaten much Indian food to be honest, but it was delicious! I had the chicken tikka masala and my boyfriend had the chicken curry. Both were a little spicy, I'd say the curry was more so because the tikka masala was creamy. But it was just the right amount of heat for the both of us. The chicken was tender and not over cooked. We also ordered some garlic naan. Nothing too special about it but a nice addition to the meal! I liked to dip my naan in the tikka masala sauce. I think the portions were a bit small for what we paid for, but we will definitely order from here again. It will be hard to branch out and try other menu items because I loved the tikka masala so much!"}
{"text":"Really rude and non Indian people.....I have never had such a bad experience with any restaurant let alone Indian.....god bless them. I would be interested in seeing how long they can stay in business with this attitude."}
{"text":"I have been a long-time customer of the lunch buffet (take out). And after today, no longer.   The food has been deteriorating in quality lately. The vegetable dishes are now made with lesser quality ingredients, and with  less care in preparation. The dishes are bland with little flavor.   Very disappointing. Used to be a good reasonably priced lunch. No longer"}
{"text":"Maharani always satisfies my Indian food craving, but it doesn't really shine.  It's a pretty basic restaurant in a strip mall on Kings.  They serve a buffet at lunch that has 6 - 8 options on it - they're all good, if a little bland.  Don't get me wrong, I enjoy the food while I'm eating it, it just doesn't blow me away.  It's as if Maharani is being a little stingy with the flavor...  I also occasionally grab take-out from here.  I like to order the Palak Paneer (creamed spinach with chunks of paneer cheese) and the chicken or shrimp tikka masala.  The naan is always hot - but again, just a little lacking in flavor.  The take-out portions are quite large - we always have leftovers if we order 2 entrees and an appetizer (for two people).    Overall, Charlotte doesn't have a huge variety of Indian restaurants - this serves the purpose.     I would like to see a bit more flavor, but I will continue to eat here."}
{"text":"I ate here recently during lunch and had the lunch buffet.  They had a decent selection, about 8 hot items, as well as some relishes and rice pudding.  There is also plenty of naan available.  I eat here at least a couple times a month.  The dinner menu is awesome too, I haven't tried anything I didn't like and we even took new comers there for a joint summit between mine and my boyfriend's families and every one was pleased.  I would also say the attire is not dressy, casual is fine."}
{"text":"We had been here once before and had found the food rather bland so did not have very high expectations. However, was pleasantly surprised. We came in for the Sunday buffet. They had a nice variety of dishes and everything was good. The chicken tikka and tandoori chicken really stood out. Good stuff. Looking forward to come back and try the a la carte. Also, did i mention...unlimited mango lassi with the lunch buffet. :) :)"}
{"text":"Yesterday I brought my boyfriend for the first time. I've been 4 times. Twice for the buffet. And twice for dinner. I LOVE this place and their food! So we went to peacock on university cause it was close awhile back and we were the only people in there. The manager cooked and brought us the food, it was burnt and disgusting. My boyfriend was so disgusted by the food he never wanted Indian again until I got him to agree for a buffet, I knew if I ever wanted Indian food dates again I needed to bring him over here for redemption. He loved all the food, especially the butter chicken and spicy rice. He's also big on water refills and can down maybe 6-7 cups and they were on top of keeping our drinks refilled. I can't wait to come back. Thank you for consistent amazing service."}
{"text":"I've been 4 times. The service is always top notch, the staff is very attentive and not intrusive. The food is always fresh and great tasting. I don't remember what I ordered the time that I didn't go for lunch buffet but it had more food than what the buffet even offered. Flavors are good and spices are customizable to your liking.  The parking lot gets pretty full and it's hard to drive through it, and it's close to uptown. Those things have nothing to do with the dining experience but I just wanted to mention for those that may have wanted to know."}
{"text":"Heard from a source I trusted that this was the best Indian food in Charlotte so we checked it out. I'd still recommend Woodlands as my top choice. I went with the standard chana masala with medium spice. Sadly, it didn't have the flavor I was hoping for. I know it's a pretty simple order, but it tasted really plain. The wife ordered the vegetable jalfrezi and it was a better choice, plus it had veggies whereas the chana masala is just chickpeas. The carnivores seemed to enjoy their meals, so all in all it was a good meal. Just not my favorite.  Fun little game....I challenge you to try to get your water glass more than half empty before they refill it. It's not going to happen."}
{"text":"The worst Indian food I have ever had in my life. I never thought it would be possible to call an Indian dish bland, but it is possible with dishes like these."}
{"text":"I came back here with a coworker for the buffet lunch and went back twice and walked/waddled out of the restaurant. HUGE improvement from my first review. So glad!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Tandoori Lamb chops and they tasted horrible they were hard to cut, bland, and very little it was literally equal to one lamb chop all the meat combined I had to show them that there was barely any meat on them to get it fixed. I will NEVER come back."}
{"text":"I've eaten dinner here a couple times.  For the most part, the food is good, and they have been consistent.  One item I like about their menu is the \"Indo-Chinese\" section.  I think this is something unique that reflects the regional differences that often get glossed over in Indian cuisine.  The food is flavorful, and service is fast.  My two complaints: 1) something always seems to get miscommunicated to the kitchen regarding the spiciness of the dish.  Not too hot--_too mild_!  This has been verified when I look at my cheque--they list the spiciness requested next to the dish.  2)  While quick to refill water, if you order any other beverage, it gets forgotten.  My soda/tea glass is empty, and I eventually have to ask the waiter for a refill.  In terms of service, this is a big issue for me, personally.  Bottom line:  good food, pretty good service.  I hope to one day be in Charlotte to try the lunch buffet other reviewers have raved about.  One last item, this place is in a _tiny_ shopping area with a _tiny_ parking lot, so be forewarned."}
{"text":"So far in Charlotte this has been the best Indian I have found! Compared to all the Indian food ever I would say it's #3. I'm usually pretty picky as far as Indian food comes."}
{"text":"I've been here tons of times and NEVER had a bad meal or bad service. In fact, I find the servers to be overly attentive at times. I always order vegetable samosas, garlic nan, and chicken tika masala. The food is always above average and consistent. I've yet to find better Indian in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I'm still trying to learn my way around Indian Cuisine, and so far I'm still on the fence.  Today we went with a friend who was a fan of their lunch buffet.  I thought it was a great way to try out more foods.  Still, nothing rocked my world.  While I couldn't tell you the names of all the foods (if I really LOVED something it might be different), I know I did like the peas dish, which I believe from looking at their menu is the mutter paneer?  I also see the dish is $12.95?  For peas and cheese?  At least I know that I CAN eat a variety of Indian food if I go to another restaurant.  As for the service, while it was very quick, it got to be a little bit uncomfortable as the waiter was hovering in the dining area right by our table, ready to grab our plates as soon as we cleared them.  Not a bad experience overall as it it's fun to try new foods, but nothing a crave to go back for."}
{"text":"I love me some Indian food and so far this is the best I've found in Charlotte. Great portions, easy atmosphere, very attentive staff. So yummy! They have a dish called Shahi Korma with lamb in an almond sauce...AMAZING."}
{"text":"My favorite Indian restaurant in Charlotte. Take-out is prepared quickly and is still piping hot by the time you get home. Always add the naan."}
{"text":"I really want to love this restaurant but I really don't. I have tried it at the lunch buffet and I recently ordered rice, samosas, and naan, to accompany Indian food I was cooking at home. Sadly, both experiences were less than stellar. Bland doesn't begin to describe the food. Absolutely no taste. When I want to eat Indian food, I want to eat Indian food - not tasteless, spiceless, food. Did my Irish name cause my order to be overly Americanized?? :-)   Even my little children were totally unimpressed. I am pretty sure we will not be giving this restaurant a third try."}
{"text":"Went for the lunch buffet yesterday with some friends... We were the only ones at the restaurant when we went in (12.05 pm for a buffet that opened at noon) . The interiors were clean and looked well maintained and we thought that it was going to be a fine experience.. that was till we got to the buffet.. we noticed that some of the dishes were half empty and the naan dish was nearly empty.. still, we proceeded to eat, with caution, before realizing that the food was indeed old. The rice was hard and plastic, the naan was hard as a rock, chicken was hot outside but cold on the inside, channa masala tasted stale and old.. when we made the owner/manager ( Mr. Singh) aware of this, he said it was because the water they use to keep the food warm at the buffet was too hot.. he did bring us fresh rice to try but we didn't risk it.. we just chose to leave the place instead and find another place to get some food.. at the checkout, the manager said he was taking $1 off each of our buffets, but we were just happy to be getting as far away from that place as possible. Finally, the guy had the gall to ask if we were Telugu or Tamil in a very insulting manner as though that's the only reason why we didn't like the food.. after serving old, stale and potentially unhealthy food, cheek is the last thing we expected from that place/manager.. please stay away!!!"}
{"text":"After I wrote this, my fiance got sick from the food.   So, I looked up their health code violations, and they don't store their food at proper temps.  Ew. :("}
{"text":"Was very disappointed with level of quality and service. Ordered to go and gave clear instructions to have two separate meals. Each with naan and rice and utensils for work. Arrived to find one bag. One rice and one naan. I pointed this out and they fixed it but they forgot the naan. Looked at $35!!!! Bill and saw they double charged for the naan too. The vindaloo chicken was not spicy enough and very oily. The employees spoke very little English and that was a huge barrier. They also seemed arrogant and rude. I am thinking that most of these reviews are fake or people do not know what good Indian is. This was the worst Indian I've had in Charlotte. At twice the price. I now know why this place is always empty.  I have also tried the lunch buffet and while the price was better. The spice was horrible. All bland, boring curries and an always empty naan bin. Had to ask to get naan.  This place is PERFECT if you have money to throw away and want mediocre Indian."}
{"text":"I took myself out on a date to celebrate the end of the semester teaching at ITT at Maharani last night. Before I switched teams to be a fan of Woodlands, Maharani was my favorite Indian restaurant in Charlotte.   I enjoyed Maharani last night again. I had the Vegetarian Thali, which kind of gives you the experience of eating buffet even when the buffet isn't open. The whole meal was a little pricey ($25 with tip), but it was more than I could eat. I had leftovers today!  The service was friendly and fast, and the food was delicious (if not quite as fabulous as Woodlands). I prefer to go to Maharani when there's a buffet, so I wish it had been the afternoon. It's great for lunch!"}
{"text":"My first trying Indian food.. It was very different... The staff was extremely friendly.... Didn't quite understand what they were saying... Service was fast... Clean restaurant.... I will return for another dish"}
{"text":"Americanized. Very disappointed. It says a lot when your patrons are non Indian. Asked for my food to be made Indian spicy and it came out mild and tasteless. Told them it has no spice and they brought hot sauce."}
{"text":"Having lived for 3 years in the Silicon Valley, home to some of the best Indian/Pakistani food I've ever had, finding a good local restaurant is always a high priority.  Tonight we tried Maharani.  When I crave Indian food, it's not about the ambiance or the service.  It's all about curries, rice, naan and spices.  While Maharani is a decent restaurant, its food is nothing special.  I ordered my usual round of chicken tikka masala, mutter paneer and veggie samosas.  The samosas were crispy but the filling was very pasty and far too pureed.  I could barely finish my serving of mutter paneer; it was extremely earthy tasting and the paneer quite bland.  That said, the chicken tikka masala was pretty enjoyable and had a wonderfully rich tomato curry sauce.  Would I eat here again if I'm in the area?  Only if Meskerem isn't open.  Time to find a better Indian place, I'm afraid."}
{"text":"very avg lik most other indian restaurant !! though its decent compared to the price (9 bucks buffet )!!"}
{"text":"This place was good for Charlotte. They did spicy and naan very well. I would come back after I have tried other clt restaurants!"}
{"text":"We tried a lunch buffet for the first time in Charlotte, NC. To my disappointment, they don't have goat dish and chicken tikka masala. Otherwise it is an average Indian buffet. We paid $10.95 per person for Saturday lunch buffet. They have plenty of seating areas and the service is nice. They filled water and took away your plates pretty quickly."}
{"text":"Currently, Maharani has only 3 stars on YELP. I am here to change that.  5 stars.  Shrimp Tandoori, the most tender Shrimp Tikka Masala and great vegetarian samosas; the best that I've had in Charlotte, NC.  Inexpensive, fresh, clean, rotating buffet for lunch that my husband was very impressed with.  Friendly staff, well dressed, very attentive, and very reasonably priced. In a really pretty area of Charlotte too. I don't think you can beat Maharani for quality indian food.  If you like spicy food, their medium spice still tastes like a mild to no spice. I'd ask them to make it hot next time, instead of medium, that way you get some sort of burn."}
{"text":"If you are of Indian or Pakistan background this place is not for you!! We drove from Mooresville to try the food this afternoon. It was a huge disappointment. The buffet was tasteless and not at all worth the 12.95. To begin with, the butter chicken was no where close to what it should taste. Boneless chicken means good quality of cubed chicken and not chicken thighs less the bones. The tandoori chicken was burnt and the chicken curry was just terrible. The vegetables fanfare was another waste. Twice I asked for mango lassi which is supposed to be offered free with the buffet but till the end it did not show up. I am sorry but the food was an insult to Indian/Pakistani cuisine. Not worth a visit."}
{"text":"Great service. Good food. The atmosphere was good and they were playing old Hindi music which is the best type of Indian restaurant music. I had a small order but the person who was waiting on me still gave me the best attention he possibly could. That is always a sign of great service."}
{"text":"Very good!!  I'm a big fan of real Indian food and this was right on target.  I have no doubt we will be returning on a regular basis.  I'm glad we found this place!!"}
{"text":"Just got back from having their lunch buffet, it was extremely good with a large selection of choices.  I would definitely eat their again.  Also had very good Service."}
{"text":"Pathetic Indian buffet I have ever had in town. Hardly any choice in the menu and what was available was also of poor quality ... Regrets"}
{"text":"I've been to this place a couple of times.I recommend the mixed maharani tandoori entree that consists of shrimp, lamb, chicken, and salmon served with a salad and rice. All of the meat has a specific taste/texture and the naan bread is delicious. The service is very attentive and accomodating."}
{"text":"I came to Maharani with 4 friends.  The food still tasted like Indian food, but the flavour of the 4 dishes was one dimensional.  I expected more variety of flavour from the spices.  I can attest that the medium hotness was not that hot.  The waiter confirmed that the medium hotness at Maharani was similar to the medium hotness at St Louis Wings and Ribs.  Consequently, if you like it hot, you should select \"hot\" hotness.  The interior of the restaurant is partitioned into 2 sections: a bar section with TV, bar tables, etc, and a dining room section.  There were customers in both sections during our visit.  In all, this Indian restaurant caters towards a non-Indian clienteles, as I observed that many patrons were Canadians.  You may actually prefer here, because the beer is cheap, and the food has a punch but won't give you a run to the bathroom."}
{"text":"This business knows nothing about customer service!  I ordered tiki masala and the owner wanted to charge me 15.95 however the price listed on the website was 2.00 cheaper.  When I brought it to his attention he did not handle it in a professional manner!  Copper is waaaaay better anyway!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere of Maharani is nice. Quiet, with modern decor and Indian artwork.  The service is good; the staff always keeping an eye on our water levels.  The food was disappointing; not just my dish, but my three friends' as well. We got an array of vegetarian, chicken and lamb dishes and everyone left with a very \"meh\" opinion. The spices weren't as distinct as most Indian places, the quality of the vegetables and meat were subpar, and the authenticity of the flavors fell short. I ate the small amount of Gobhi Manchurian I scooped onto my plate and then just chose to not finish it because it was so terrible (and for $12 I usually don't do that).  I'd adventure elsewhere to Indian if I were you."}
{"text":"Though I'm a Copper enthusiast when it comes to getting my Indian fix in Charlotte, I'd heard that Maharani was a cheaper but tasty option, so we ordered from there a few nights ago.   Copper is definitely still my place, but Maharani was fine enough. First of all, the food came very quickly, which is rare. Usually indian food, good indian good, takes at least 30-45 minutes. We got our order in like 30, which was great 'cause we were starving.   The Tikka Masala was spicy and pretty good, but it wasn't as thick and saucy as i like. The salad was just so-so. The Naan were all amazing. Definitely the highlight."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Very clean restaurant. Very friendly staff. What more could you ask for! The mint chutney is genuine, no some green liquid. I had the butter chicken extra hot. The spice level was perfect! Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"I have ordered takeout/delivery from this place for a while but have never been inside until I scheduled my dinner group here recently.   The place in a small shopping center on Kings Drive. The decor is modern Indian. The lone lady working that night was dressed in Indian attire.   The menu is broad with Indian and indochinese options.   We started out with a few appetizers to share. The cauliflower was amazing with a tangy sauce.  For an entree, I ordered my usual for takeout the Murg Vindaloo - Spicy. It was still as good as takeout but a little flat on the spice level. I don't think they give Americans credit for appreciating spicy food.   Other than that, service was good. The bench seating is a bit uncomfortable and may need replacement.   Note: they give a discount to anyone paying cash. For me, I didn't have the full cash amount to cover my dinner but gave them what I had for a discount and put the rest on a card. This is a great policy that I wish more places would do."}
{"text":"One of the biscuit Indian restaurants. We were traveling from from the airport and this was the closest Indian restaurant. We have ordered chilly chicken for appetizer and the chicken was under cooked and had a lot of soya sauce in it. That was a disaster , because my friend asked the waiter and he said it was the best chicken appetizer. Then we have ordered the murgh biryani, garlic naan and kadhai murgh. The naans were fine, the chicken in the curry and biryani were very big and were undercooked. The biryani tasted more like a pulav which is not acceptable to a hyderabadi like me. The kadhai chicken had some tomatoes which were undercooked. They turned off the music and the lights while we were still having our dinner at 10:45 pm, which is not at all a good customer service. Finally this is a place to avoid if you are looking for good food."}
{"text":"I guess when you grow up eating authentic Indian food, the bar gets set pretty high.  Maharani was not at all what I'd hoped for.  The food was bland, under-seasoned and the woman working the door seemed not to care much that we bothered walking in.    The decor is old and drab, the entire place having a rather sad mood.  Someone needs to wake up, update, and start cooking with passion.  Life is too short.  Go elsewhere until that happens."}
{"text":"A funky bar with cheap beers with top notch Indian food in our neighborhood. They have Organic Mill Street Beer for $4 for a pint. Their chicken pakora and samosa are must-try. How many bars in Toronto serve Indian food other than burgers and wings? Definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Great food and prices! Make sure you try their Mango lassi and their lamb mango!"}
{"text":"This place really deserves a higher rating. The atmosphere is nice with white table cloths, authentic artwork, authentic music, a lovely hostess in authentic dress, and wonderful food.   Having lived in India we are constantly on the look out for authentic Indian food. We went with the Goat Biryani and we're not disappointed. Next time we're going to go for the buffet as it certainly caught our attention! We can't wait to come again!"}
{"text":"I was looking for some comfort food after my trip to the hospital today and found this great little Indian restaurant. Not very busy at all but the food was very good. I had butter chicken and chicken 65. It was northern Indian in tradition and definitely different than what I'm used to. The Naan was outstanding.  Being from Columbia South Carolina I am used to eating at Persis restaurant. This place is just as good but definitely different in style. The service was out of this world awesome. Very pleased with the experience."}
{"text":"ate there recently for dinner, it was wonderful. i ordered the goat curry and was excited to try goat for the first time right after i found out it is the most consumed meat on earth outside of the US BUT the table of 12 Indian gentleman behind us had ordered it all....which led me to believe these guys know what they are doing. instead i tried the lamb and it was perfect. i really liked the candor of our waiter \"andrew\", which was not his name but he called himself that with a grinning smirk; i told him i had ordered kingfisher lagers before and would love to try another beer since they had a few indian beers, he told me to stay with the kingfisher. also, once he told me the goat curry wasn't available i ordered tandoori lamb, he assured me it was good but encouraged me to try the curried lamb since i originally ordered goat curry. my ladyfriend ordered a veggie dish and loved it, we got some bread as well, she ordered some REASONABLY (which is becoming more rare these days) priced wine. all in all the food was very good and the service was near perfect, i like when a waiter can read what you are looking for, makes reco's on that judgment and nails them. i will be going back to maharani frequently for both the food and smiling faces that provide you perfect service."}
{"text":"Very few items on lunch buffet. On menu was aloo tikki, salad, plain rice, butter chicken, naan, chicken tandoori, chicken curry, palak paneer (paneer was hard to find), kheer (was good), finni that's it. None of the items were cooked properly. Very very disappointed. Price: $10.25 plate"}
{"text":"Food is good but I drove a long way to eat and they closed during hours they show open on yelp and google!"}
{"text":"The reviews seemed to be hit-or-miss, but I decided to take a leap and try it out. I hadn't tried any Indian restaurants in the Charlotte area, so I went ahead and ordered several take out dishes to try. It might be important to note I'd had a huge curry craving for months. Maharani, while it definitely hit the spot, was lacking in a few areas.  I called in the order and then went to pick it up. It was very straightforward and simple. They had the food ready exactly when they said they would. The servers and cashier were very friendly and courteous.  I tried the plain naan, chicken tikka masala, lamb vindaloo, and mutter paneer. I even found some papadum and mint sauce wrapped up in my bag, which was nice. For some reason, having the papadum feels nice and familiar. The naan was alright, but not as fluffy as I had hoped. It was crispier in a lot of places, and I think it just needs to be a bit thicker. The chicken in the tikka masal was very good and very moist (yes, I know a lot of people hate that word. It's a good word to use in this case!). The vindaloo was decent, except that the chunks of meat and potato were enormous. I was taught to eat Indian food by a Sri Lankan, which means I eat with my hands. I'm not used to having to pick up a giant wedge of potato and figuring out how to eat it cleanly. The mutter paneer was also alright, but the paneer was kind of tough and not soft like I'm used to.   Like I said, it hit the spot, but I wouldn't order the vindaloo again, and I'm iffy on the paneer. Maybe it needs to be more fresh? I don't know how paneer works. The biggest issue was the salt level in the food. There was WAY. TOO. MUCH. SALT. If you are one of those people who loves to add salt, then this is all for you. I will give it another try, but only if they might agree to ease up on the salt... a lot."}
{"text":"Best Indian food I have had in Charlotte, although an odd location/ambiance.  The clay pots meals, cooked to 600 degrees and immediately served, are fresh, flavorful, and delicious.  Good prices as well.  Drink list could use some work.  The garlic naan is very good.  They give you a salad to start but that part is a bit of a joke."}
{"text":"Terrible service! We were overcharged thanks to the waiters inability to split a bill - each couple on a separate tab - a normal thing to do in a restaurant - NOT HERE! They tally up the whole table and divide by the number of credit cards given and charge each one the same amount regardless of what each couple ordered. Do not make the mistake of going with friends and expecting the restaurant to be able to give separate tickets seems you have to sit across the room from each other and pretend not to know each other in order for that to be possible. Food was not what it used to be. Will remove this restaurant from our list of places to go."}
{"text":"My 10-year-old loves Maharani! We've tried a few other Indian restaurants in Charlotte and keep coming back to Maharani because the quality of the food is so consistent. The butter chicken, samosas and vegetable pakora are our favorites. The takeout portions are large and they almost always arrive piping hot."}
{"text":"Flavor of the tikki masala was really good, cooked medium spicy. Standard naan wasn't that good, pretty burnt. Had order delivered, arrived quickly but the bag did not contain a plastic fork or napkins (that's not helpful and that deducted a \"star\")."}
{"text":"I tried Maharani with my family years ago, and decided to go back with my husband. We both love Indian food, but we usually visit the places closer to us in South Charlotte. I lived in India for a year and have visited many cities in North and South India. Indian food in the states is never as good as it is in India, but the food Maharani was a disappointment. The service was five star, very very good. The ambiance was great also. Perfect for a nice date. The samosas we got were really yummy, but Kahdai Murg and Aloo Matar were not very flavorful which is sad to say about Indian dishes. We ordered the medium hot.   This would be an ok place for a nice date and an introduction to Indian food, but we will stick to our usual places."}
{"text":"Solid Indian fare. I was high from all the butter fat I consumed at dinner for, oh, three hours. These guys use a LOT of ghee in their preparations.  Samosas - really, really good. Extremely flavorful. Even the dough is spiced.  Bajii/Pakora - good, a little bland.   Naan - also stellar. Perfectly prepared, garlic and plain alike.  Thali - overpriced. This is a smaller thali than I'm used to, as it includes only three dishes, no lemon pickle, no daal. Rice is pretty bland (where's ma cardamom!). Vegetable Masala was the stand out here, although if I ate an entire entree of it, I think my heart would explode (WHOA butter). $18.  Mushroom Mutter - solid, nothing exciting. $12. Despite the flavors in this dish being subtle to the point of bland, it was neon orange. Hmm.  There's a short Indo-Chinese menu here that I'd like to sample from - maybe next time.  Would I come back for the much-more-reasonably priced lunch buffet? Possibly. Will I continue to drive way out to Woodlands when I'm craving Indian? Most definitely."}
{"text":"We went to this place for a Sunday Buffet and we liked the food. They have a limited but decent variety of main dishes for vegetarians and non vegetarians. I wish they had more variety in appetizers and deserts.  I did not try this but their menu says that they have lunch boxes which appear to be very costly effective option for lunch."}
{"text":"I did take out from here a few nights ago. Ok, so I called in the order, veggie samosa, chicken tikka masala and plain naan.  I went with the medium high heat for the chicken because I couldn't get an answer from the guy on the phone as to what \"Indian heat\" was. Anyways, I found the flavors right on from what I remembered about my last Indian food experience. It's been a while. Nice heat with the chicken and a nice amount of food too. A little pricey but overall a good experience. Next time I'm going for the \"Indian heat\" option!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure why this place doesn't have better reviews- it's a very good option for Indian food as far as Charlotte goes. Went last night for dinner and the butter chicken was fantastic. Lamb biryani was just okay. The lamb was tender and there was a good amount of it, I just didn't like the flavor as much as the butter chicken. The samosas were also pretty good! The place was clean, quiet and the staff was very friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Went here for a lunch buffet on Tuesday. Menu only have 2 chicken dishes and both were just average. Typically Indian restaurants have more non-veg dishes. Disappointed with the quality of the food. It did not taste authentic. Also the Naan (some of them) were not cooked all the way, inside of the bread was not cooked. Will attach pictures. Weekends might be better, but I'm not going to try this place again."}
{"text":"This is easily the best deal for great Indian food in Charlotte. The food is maybe one notch below Copper (upscale Indian location in town) but the price is about three notches lower. They do an especially great job with the classic dishes, and they'll adjust the heat level to your liking, making it a safe place to take guests with little or no experience with Indian food. Staff is friendly and very attentive. This has become my go-to place in Charlotte for Indian food and I'm there more often than I'm comfortable admitting."}
{"text":"Maharani is one of our best Indian food places for me and my wife. It's not too pricey but classy enough to bring my in-laws when they visit, and I  always anxious to impress. The food is delicious, the wait service attentive. The butter chicken is the best in Charlotte. The only regret is they don't have mango lassi on their menu."}
{"text":"I ordered take out from here on recommendation from a friend. The food was delicious! I'm used to good Indian food from living in San Jose and San Francisco and this is straight up the same quality I would get there. I'm glad I found my new Indian place!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant. Been going for years. Recently returned after a hiatus. Dinner was great. Vegetable Tikka Masala, with nan. Service is friendly, very attentive & respectful. The owner/ manager stopped at our table twice to ensure that everything was going well. Reminds me of days gone by where you would eat at a \"family owned\" restaurant. I loved the fact that several people came in after we did (which was 8:15pm on a Thursday), keeping the atmosphere lively. Having said that, one of the things that I love about this restaurant is that you actually can hear yourself have a conversation. It is a good medium size, yet NOT thumping with loud music and 20+ tables that you need to talk over, which exists in many Charlotte restaurants as the city has grown. The cuisine was fantastic too ! I like the spices- I  would call it a more refined palette, with enough variations on curry to satisfy everyone. If you have any questions on the menu, I would suggest asking the waiter to go into more detail on sauces, spices, etc. Enjoy !"}
{"text":"The food was good but weird hospitality. We arrived on a Saturday at 10.35-10.40ish and place closes at 11. The waiters treated us in a cold manner on our arrival and didn't answer our question straight forward on whether they were still open. Reluctantly he took us to a place to sit. The food was good- We were the last ones to eat- as soon as the people before us left they stopped the music. Overall they can train the staff to be better hosts."}
{"text":"This review is based only on three take out orders, as I have not dined in the restaurant or checked out their buffet.  I am a pretty simple Indian eater, Naan and Chicken Tikka Masala.  Their Garlic Naan is amazing. Always piping hot with just the right amount of garlic.  I even love the subtle burnt end sometimes. As for the chicken, it is good, but the spice level has varied ever time, and they have never asked how I would like it.  I have never been disappointed with the chicken, white chucks of tender white chicken served with rice.   I hope to dine in soon, but not sure about hitting the buffet. Not sure I'll be venturous enough to try some of the items. We'll see though, as I love to give things a try."}
{"text":"I love going here for the lunch buffet, very good selection & not bad for $10. I ordered take out at dinner once & it was almost $20, kind of pricey. However, it was enough food for 2 meals. I usually come here every other week."}
{"text":"This establishment was friendly, clean and easy to find.  When you are visiting from out of town, that is really all you can ask for!   I liked their menu selection and their prices were fair.    I also found it interesting that they had some Chinese food options.    I would recommend this place to anyone who wants a nice, relaxed atmosphere to enjoy dinner at."}
{"text":"Great place. Good service. Food is good, for Indian taste buds especially."}
{"text":"I eat Indian weekly and from all over NC and SC. I find Maharani to be the best in Charlotte. Their  buffet quality is outstanding. I have eaten here for years.  I have not been to Saffron, but the one in Greenville SC is my overall favorite."}
{"text":"Weekday lunch and what a bunch, of options that is. I am quite fond of indian food and eat it quite often, but don't ask me to name any dishes.   The spinach thing was good, the potato cake thing was good, and the spicy pepper chicken was also good. Rice pudding and a jelly like mango dessert to top it all off.   My water was always filled and when you have lunch with great peers and aesthetically pleasing decor, you have another beautiful day."}
{"text":"The service here is great. We went on a Sunday and were the only people there for a while, but even as more guests arrived to the restaurant, they were still very attentive. I have to agree with other reviewers that the curry is VERY mild. We asked for them to be a bit spicier than they might normally make them, and they were still very mild. Good, but mild. However, the veggie samosas are mind-blowing! Spicy and smooth and not greasy at all - highly recommended. The kheer was also really yummy. Spicier (cardamom and nutmeg spicy, not hot spicy...) than I've had in the past, but good. Go for the garlic naan as well, delish! The only negative that I can think of is you don't get all of the free \"extras\" (a pekora to start you out or some kheer and chai at the end) you get at some other places, but I haven't heard of anywhere in Charlotte that does, so I guess it's an even playing field. Good wine selection, good food, good service."}
{"text":"I've eaten here perhaps ten times.  I have never been disappointed.  I typically get the house specialty, vegetable Jalfrezi.  The naan and rice are always good, staff are friendly and attentive.  The atmosphere is pleasant, with soft Indian music playing."}
{"text":"I had the lunch buffet there yesterday. I stuck to vegetarian options and especially enjoyed the palak paneer. So many restaurants load their palak with heavy cream, which I think dilutes the spinach flavor. This one did not and I went back for a large, second helping.  Service was odd. We walked in and they couldn't seem to decide where we should fit. The server seemed a little...grumpy?"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night, late. Friendly staff, and tasty Indian. If you don't like this place you are an uncultured swine. Also great date spot!"}
{"text":"Awful.... We ordered two different vegetable dishes which were actually exactly the same. The vegetable biriyani had no vegetables except potatoes, and the garlic naan was made with granulated garlic. Portions are tiny, except the rice dish. Stay away!!"}
