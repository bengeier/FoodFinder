{"text":"I've been to this pub mostly for beer and had a burger or two as well.  Have not tried their wings yet, however the amount of grammatical mistakes and ambiguous sentence fragments littering the place stupefied me and made me unable to explore this place better.  What the hell is \"flavor\"? That's not a comprehensible word to me who speaks Canadian English and John A Macdonald would have boycotted this bar because of it.  Another example: are the wings half-a-dollar on Wings night or are they just half-priced? The signage said 1/2-$ and me and my friends argued about the differing meaning of this ambiguous phrasing.  I might go again, but am much likelier to do so if they clean up the grammatical and ambiguous statements in their signage."}
{"text":"My fave wings joint in Toronto. Great variety of wing flavours -- personally love the Roadside Lemonade and baked Indian flavoured wings (forgot the name) at a cheap price!"}
{"text":"Some of the best wings Ive ever had. That said i cant say i fully enjoyed my experience. The waitresses service was far from great, with constant reminders needed to keep our order on track. I don't think I have ever had to ask my server so many questions about the status of my order. Other than that though it was an overall pleasant dining experience. Nice pub atmosphere, and a solid menu. The wings are the true shining star of this joint though. Piping hot, and sauces that truly looked homemade (as opposed to the standard light red \"franks red hot\") with awesome taste to boot. If i could give this place a 3.75 i would. The wings alone will have me craving a return, but unfortunately thats all that has me wanting to go back. OH, and the  10 dollar pitchers of Canadian on half price wing night"}
{"text":"Wings are their thing! Sorry but copy writing is not my profession... I should be a professional eater cos I would be rich by now :P My buddy suggested we stop by one Sunday evening which was perfect since it's half price wings all day and the boys were hungry (apparently also applies to Tuesday and Thursday evenings).  It's an English style pub with limited seating so I would venture to say neighbourhood size establishment.  We ordered 10 lbs between 4 of us and we lost track of how many we ate.  They have a big wings menu and we wanted to try an assortment so we selected their dragon wings, honey garlic, spicy mexican and smoked bbq (local award winners are marked with a crown next to the item on the menu).  We were all unanimous with the quality of wings served here.  Perfectly done and crispy but not too much breading and very good size plus tasty.  Sauces were excellent and the fries were the best we've had at a sports bar or pub in recent memory.  The only downside is as stated the limited space and their beer selection (I'm not a big alcohol drinker so it mattered more to my friends).  Compared to Duffs, St. Louis, Wild Wings, Hoops and other bars or pubs we've all frequented over the years, this place takes the crown for wings and if it were not for the fact that eating so many wings would make me look like the buddha, I would be coming every week and KFC would be considered healthy food by comparison.  Once a month would be ok but factoring in all the good eateries I've reviewed, once a month at all those places would put me in line for heart bypass surgery.  I think it's fine to go once in a while but always go with a group and eat in moderation.  Next time we'll enforce a 2 lb per person limit :P  Summary, 5 Stars for wings & fries but 3.5 stars for decor and beer selection."}
{"text":"This is an average pub with great specials. There are so many throughout the week I forgot most of them - but we got $4 domestic pints during happy hour (4-6), then $3 off wings because it was Thursday.  The sweet potato fries were AMAZING. Honestly might've been the best I've ever eaten. They were battered in something (possibly panko, tempura-style), and were slightly al dente. They were served with a soy-based dip. Very unconventional for what you'd find in a pub but very yum.  There's also a huge selection of wing flavours and styles - it was hard to choose! We ended up going for the rosemary lemonade chicken wings because they sounded the most unusual. They were delicious! While rosemary and chicken is a well-known pairing, I would have never thought it would be good for wings. Top-notch.  It was also very clean, much more so than the average pub - and it was decorated in a way that were personal to the staff/owner(s) etc. Nice touches that made it feel like more homey and less like a generic pub. I'd definitely come back for pub grub and drinks - on a specials night."}
{"text":"Best wings in the city.... love the horseradish wings!!! Sorry Duffs and St. Louis =("}
{"text":"This place is not all what it is made out to be.  Wings are good, I will give them that.  But service is lacking.  The girls look like they rolled out of bed and threw on the oldest pair of worn-out yoga pants they could find.  They just don't look presentable to be serving the public.  Also, a few of them clearly just want to do the bare minimum at their jobs, and their demeanours show this.  Rushed order taking and delivery of food.  Don't check on you to see if everything is ok.  Oh and be forewarned that if you ask for anything \"extra\", you will see it on your bill.  Glad I didn't bother using ketchup or salt.....I would have likely been charged for it.  This place could stand to improve."}
{"text":"Great wings terrible service when busy. If you see a line give up and walk alway. We were in line for 30 mins when a pushy couple snuck if front of us and another group. Server wasn't paying attention."}
{"text":"Si pudiera darle menos de una estrella lo haría, simplemente el peor servicio de mi vida. 40 minutos para unas simples papas, una mesera prepotente que me arrebató el dinero de la mano y encima tuvo el descaro de decirme estás haciéndome perder el tiempo... Simplemente pésimo servicio"}
{"text":"We recently won a gift certificate to the Crown and Dragon pub via Twitter, a midtown bar located just past Yonge and Davenport that is well-known for its delicious variety of chicken wings! We sat on their patio this past weekend and enjoyed a casual lunch before a stroll through Toronto's Summerhill neighbourhood.  Crown and DragonThe Good: The small Yonge Street patio had the perfect amount of shade as we sat enjoying our Dragon Caesars ($7.25), an extra spicy cocktail mixed with their signature Dragon's Breath wing sauce. Their wings are half price after 5pm both Tuesday and Thursday nights, as well as all day on Sundays. We got a pound of their Smokin' Gun wings ($10.95 regular price), a sweet and smokey version of buffalo wing sauce, and they were cooked perfectly.  The spicy spinach dip ($9.95) wasn't too fiery, and tasted amazing with a side of chips and pita. We were stuck between deep fried pickles ($8.95) and jalapeño poppers ($6.99) but decided to go with the latter, which were very similar-if not the same-as the ones in the frozen section of the grocery store. But, I do love the grocery store kind and they were about the same price!  The Bad: The interior space of The Crown and Dragon is totally outdated. For this upscale area of Toronto it seems kind of run-down, but there's a sort of endearing homey charm to the atmosphere which almost functions as a sort of redeeming quality. The prices also seem a bit high considering the atmosphere.  Overall: The Crown and Dragon is the sort of place that I will probably go back to have a beer with a friend in the summer, when the patio is open. The service was friendly and well-paced, it was an extremely laid back and casual atmosphere, and the drinks are just slightly cheaper compared with many similar venues in the area (take Spirits at Church and Bloor for instance). The food is pretty good and comparable to Jack Astor's, and the wings specials make it worth going back.  The Crowd: Around noon on a sunny Sunday, there were a handful of other people, mostly mid to late 20-somethings sitting outside with mid-day beers and caesars.  See their menu for pricing here.  890 Yonge Street 416-927-7976  And don't forget to check out the Crown and Dragon Twitter account, they give away a $25 gift certificate once a month to one their followers!"}
{"text":"Also not feeling the 4 star rating at this place. Went on a Sunday night 2 weeks ago and they had a great deal for a pound of wings and beer. Great deal, but the wings themselves were not what i expected. I understand the wings were fried, but the skin tasted oily and when you bite into the meat, even that was glistening in oil. Further, the skin and meat were both very dry, like they fried the wings for too long in oil that wasn't hot enough (I've actually done this at home, unintentionally, and i ended up throwing out the entire batch because it just wasn't appetizing). There was also very little sauce/spice on the wings, I had to send mine back because they were tasteless, and even after they added more cajun spice, there was still no taste. Anywho, not coming back and not understanding how they won so many awards."}
{"text":"One wing place that I appreciate the taste in downtown Toronto is here. They sometimes do little events like stand-up comedy. If you're tired of those franchise wing taste, go here."}
{"text":"Wings, although often taken for granted, are an art form unto themselves. The Crown offers a full page devoted entirely to wings, and I ordered the baked Cubans and the Jerk wings. My opinion: forget the jerk wings - not authentic. But, the Cubans were pretty fantastic. My friends ordered a bunch of others, and I was pretty impressed overall with their selection and quality.   This is definitely not a healthy choice. I would suggest a once-a-month at the very most."}
{"text":"I had a business meeting down the street and was meeting a friend for a casual beer afterwards and saw that this pub was close by.  Upon entry, it is quite rustic in decor with aging wood beams and furniture.  Not a place to impress but it's definitely a local watering hole with sports paraphernalia and a Leafs count down clock to the next game.  The prices were very reasonable considering the location so close to Yorkville.    Onto the menu items:  They were sold out of the 2 draft choices my friend picked and I settled on the yellow tail shiraz as the white wine section was quite poor with options that sell around $10/bottle in a liquor store.  Typical pub food included chicken fingers, burgers, etc and their wings looked to be their main feature.  The servers were pleasant to start until I received my orange and goat cheese salad.  Upon the first few bites, I tasted a very aged cheese, much like blue cheese which I do not like.  I offered some to my guest to test and he agreed this was definitely not goat cheese but blue cheese.  I advised the waitress and she brought it to the chef who looked over at my table in a very unfriendly demeanor.  I received the same salad back with more cheese on top with the waitress explaining that the chef opened a new package and confirmed it was goat cheese.  She insisted that the old package was also goat cheese. (I think I would have been more relieved to know it was the wrong cheese..  not a rotten cheese!)  I did try a bit on the top and agreed this was goat cheese but the stuff mixed in my salad was indeed not fresh goat cheese if from an old package which obviously smelled and tasted off.  She asked if I wanted my steak added to a new salad???  I insisted on a fresh new salad without rotten cheese,  which I did receive over time with an apology. While eating I received a few more glaring looks from the chef which made me cringe at the thought of what he did to my salad in haste.  We have all heard and read about the horror stories of sending food back... With those looks, I had a 95% likelihood.   My friend ordered a regular salad with grilled chicken which was a pile of lettuce from a pre - washed package.  98% lettuce with a few slim shreds of carrot and cabbage.  Yes you know what I'm referring to.   Plain and simple for the watering hole that it is.  The bill arrived with no offer for a reduced cost.  Surprising, but having worked in the industry, I am not one to be petty but it was too awful not to return. In fact, I rarely complain and just deal with what I receive.  We paid, left a standard gratuity and will likely never go there again.  Final notes,  I should've known better to order fresh salad at a dive bar.  Would have been safer to order something fried to a crisp."}
{"text":"Wings are not bad. I can't even say there better then Kelsey's. Def over cooked and the draft beer very skunky frozen boxed wings on par with this place."}
{"text":"Yes yes, this place has great wings. Half price deals on Sundays (all day), Tue and Thursday (5PM to closing) and Wed (1-4).  The Yelp description says they accept reservations, that is not correct. And expect an hours wait on a Thursday night.   Apart from the wings (my favourites include Dragons breath, Asian heat, Mardi Gras) their Yam fries are great. (ask for their dill sauce with it)  Keep in mind that on half price nights they expect you to order a drink with the wings and if you want to take out your left overs you will be charged full price for the wings you are taking back with you."}
{"text":"The best place for Chicken Wings in Toronto that comes in many different and delicious flavours.  We went for the Tuesday Half price wings special and we were not disappointed.  The wings were large and meaty about 7-8 in a pound. We had 6 pounds of six different flavours a mixture of Spicy, Sweet and Salty- Dragon's Breath, Smokin' Gun, Holy Habanero, Honeycomb Heaven, Don Ho Hawaii, and Mardi Gras.. service was great and the staff (Tks Steve) was friendly with offering suggestions of the flavours to try.  Definitely going back !!!"}
{"text":"Valentine's Annual Wing Date - Feb 2016. Tuesday half price wings, $10.50/each round.  Round 1: Dragon's Breath & Cuban Sun (baked). Round 2: Holy Habanero & Original Buffalo Butter. Round 1 was better which we thought was due to round two being over cooked.  The wings are breaded. Flavors where good, though the habanero was different than we expected and hard to describe. Domestic beers were also on special for $4.50.  http://www.crownanddragon.com/sg_userfiles/Crown__Dragon_Menu.pdf"}
{"text":"Came here after hearing great things about the staff and also the wings. We went on a Wednesday night and the place was in full swing due to the leafs having a game.   Started off with the garlic cheesy bread. You can't miss with that as an appetizer and we weren't disappointed. Next we ordered 2 pounds of wings and asked the server for sauce recommendations. He suggested we try one wet sauce and then baked wings. They were definitely worth the wait. So good in fact, we ordered 2 additional pounds after the first 2.   Not many places get how to make good wings. I would easily come back and eat here again. If you're a wing lover you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I went last Thursday at seven and it still wasn't too busy. I was worried since I heard that Tuesdays, Thursdays and Sundays are packed in the evening because of the wings discounts.   I ordered a Sprite and two pounds of wings. These are the best wings I have had in Toronto, bar none! Both the meat and the sauces are well worth the money. The flavour selection is modest but ranges out enough that it should please most patrons. I personally had their Dragon's Breath and Key West varieties. I would have to strongly recommend the Key West sauce. The hint of lime with the smoky barbecue sauce pairs very well."}
{"text":"Best wings in the city! Mardi Gras, and Viva Italia with Dragon's Breath sauce on the side are among our favourites."}
{"text":"Holy amazing wings, batman! These puppies (chickies?) are big, juicy, moist, just saucy enough. And... the baked wings are gluten-free! The deep-fried ones are breaded (even before I was gf I hated breaded wings), but the baked ones are totally safe. There are only five baked flavours and none of them are spicy, but you can order whichever kind you want and get a side of one of the hot sauces for dipping. That's what I did and it was exactly perfect.   The beer selection is meh - most interesting thing on draft is Fuller's London Pride. There's also Mill St Organic (local but dull) and a standard selection of big names and european lagers. They had Flying Monkeys but only in bottles, and it just feels wrong to drink bottled beer while eating wings.   Atmosphere is pretty standard pub - with lots of tvs, if you're into that sort of thing. I'm not, so I appreciate the lack of volume on those tvs. Service was friendly and attentive (no empty glasses for us!).   I will absolutely, most definitely go back. Probably soon."}
{"text":"This is my kind of place! A 5 star dive bar, trust me, that is a huge compliment. It's not really a dive bar, but it's not some pretentious, gastro pub type establishment either. This is a local bar with local people and great food. Their wings are in my all-time top 5, the beer is fine, it's your standard stuff, the rest of the menu is ... actually, I've only had their wings. I usually stick  with the Dragons Breath and Buffalo Butter, but their baked wings are a game changer, Foghorn Leghorn and Cuban Sun are especially good.  To the people complaining about the size of the wings, you don't know shit about wings!  First off, the size is good and you order them by weight not amount so it's not like you're getting ripped off. Second, what's more important is how they're cooked and sauced. Third, if you want giant mutant chicken wings that are pumped full of god knows what head down to the States where their regulations are much more laxed on the matter so you can get unnaturally large chicken wings."}
{"text":"I've been to the Crown and Dragon a bunch of times, always for wings and beer, but neglected to write a review until now.  These are my favourite wings in the city for sure.  Tuesday and Thursday are wing nights and Thursday is busier by far (last night it was about a half hour wait for a table for 2).  It's a pretty small place and gets packed on wing nights (not sure what happens on non-wing-nights).  The service is always very good and the wings are ready really fast, even when it's packed in there.    The wings here are BIG and they're nice and crunchy on the outside, not chewy.  There's just the right amount of sauce and the meat is tender.  They've got something like 30 flavours but I think the more classic ones are the best (buffalo, hot, honey garlic...) but I haven't met a wing there I didn't like.  One thing to note is they won't pack up uneaten wings on wing night, so make sure your eyes aren't too much bigger than your stomach.  They have a special on pitchers of Canadian a few nights a week but it tasted watery and seemed like the carbonation was off so I wouldn't really recommend it (bonus: the waitress was totally gracious and took it back with no arguments).  They also have two decent dart boards and darts available from the bar if you ask but you pretty much have to choose between wing night and darts because otherwise it's too busy."}
{"text":"I always went there when I lived near by. They have special price for chicken wings on Sunday. Their chicken wings are really good."}
{"text":"The Dragon's Breath wings have really won me over. I've yet to eat wings this good since going there. They put places like St. Louis to shame."}
{"text":"Wings are amazing! Great selection. Half price a few days a week too. And they have sommersby cider for $6.95. Meghan was our server. She was great and knew her wings. Will defiantly be back soon!"}
{"text":"hands down the best wings in the city ... and long before they had the award to prove it, i've been scarfing down pounds of wings here regularly.  if wings aren't your thing ... the menu is full of pub classics ... many with their own twist (for the better). but if you are a wing fan ... this place is your heaven! the wing list goes forever and i haven't found a flavour that i don't like. being a fan of heat though ... dragons breath and holy habanero are my personal favourites.   everything from the friendly-neighborhood-pub-feel, to the friendly staff and great food ... the crown and dragon won't disappoint, and with three days a week with half price wings - can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Love this place! The only thing preventing me coming back here on a regular basis is my waistline and blood cholesterol levels. Awesome wings, lots of variety of flavours, decent grungy atmosphere. Unpretentious. Recommend the 'Italian', 'Roadside Lemonade', and Original Buffalo. Come early for 1/2 price wing nights. Gets a 5* for being the best at wings in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Best wings in Toronto!  Unless you go on a Sunday.  I've probably been to the place 7 or 8 times.  Sunday is wingday special, but the two times I have been on discount night, I have been disappointed.  Unlike other nights where the chicken is delicious and the the great flavours they have shine through, it almost seems as though the microwave defrosted the wings.    Great place for wings and beers on a full price night.  Like some people said, the place could be a bit nicer.  But it's not a dive by any stretch, and the staff are generally pretty awesome.  Try the baked wings.  Fall off the bone awesome.  Just make sure to ask them which of the baked wings came out of the oven most recently."}
{"text":"Great place for wings. Dedicated chef with tested and proven recipes.  I cannot say that all choices are as strong as others. However, when they hit their mark, you will be hard-pressed to find better wings. Their signature \"DRAGON'S BREATH\" wings are outstanding and not as spicy as they sound. Large, Moist, and tasty!  My other favourite has to be the BOLLYWOOD (TANDORI) wings. They easily rival what you might find in a great indian resto.  I sat at the bar, ordered 4lbs and tried 4 flavours. Tuesday, Thursday and Sunday are HALF-PRICE. It is a decent pub, and they do get busy , so I would say go early, order early and plant yourself down for a satisfying wing night.  Service is friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"After reading all the great reviews, I was anticipating having some great wings here. We arrived around 5:30 Friday and sat down in the warm and inviting space. Since St Patty's day was the next day it was already decorated with some stereotypical Irish style decorations. It was never more than half full at any time while we where there (we left just after 7pm).  We ordered 4 pounds of wings (Traditional Hot, Viva Italia, Caribbean Coconut, Killer Bee) and the yam fries. The fries were quite good, unlike many places that seem to just use McCain sweet potatoes fries nowadays, these were thick cut and breaded. The wings however (and it pains me somewhat to say this cuz I know they pride themselves on their wings) were quite average, both my brother and I remarked that they seemed rather dry. Flavor-wise they were okay but there were really no standouts.  The service was also average, the one server who seemed to be serving the whole place checked on us once, but we had to flag him down several times to get more beer and the bill.  Overall it was a passable experience but not one that left me wanting to return soon; I wouldn't be averse to returning but I wouldn't go out of my way to go back either. Total price including tax was $89 + tip for 4 pounds of wings, yam fries, and two pitchers (non-domestic)."}
{"text":"Just wanted to bring to people's attention: they have altered the Sunday/Tues/Wed/Thurs Wing deal. Instead of half off, it is now $3 off per pound.  So our 2 lbs of wings on Sunday came to $15 + tax.  As well, they offer Canadian/Coors Light tall boys on Sunday for $4.50.    I'm with the majority here, the wings are fantastic.  We really enjoyed the Dragon's Breath (they were a good level of spicey, though if that's the \"hottest\" rating, they're going easy on us).  Looking forward to coming back to try more flavours."}
{"text":"I had heard this place had great wings, so my girlfriend took me there this past weekend to try them. They did not disappoint. I had Dragon's Breath, which was tied with their Buffalo Wing selection from that night. I want to go back at try their spiciest option, as I found that these two choices had a nice kick but wasn't enough for me to curse my favourite food sometimes causing me so much pain.  Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Home away from home. Look for a bar that has the right specials at the right time of day. Wings are phenomenal. Servers know your name."}
{"text":"So I've been to this place 3 Thursdays in the past month - absolutely LOVE it. Half price wings plus $10 pitchers how can you go wrong. The flavours are very inventive and delicious - I'm in love with the Key West BBQ and the Black & White wings are so good. Everytime I've brought a different group of friends who equally love it.  The crappy part is the long lineup - waited 30-45 min both times but the staff is amazing and helpful.   This is definitely my favourite wings place in the city!"}
{"text":"Came here for half-price wings on Sunday. Great flavors to choose from and in general, I would say well executed. You know what you'll be getting when you come here: solid, hearty, great food."}
{"text":"Very good wings.  Some of the tastiest flavored wings to be had!  Nice bar and atmosphere, just near yonge and bloor"}
{"text":"The wings were decent. The best ones are Mardi gras with honey garlic sauce on the side...  The waitress unfortunately spent more time taking selfies than taking care of the restaurant. I'm not generally a stickler for service, but we were sat beside an incredibly messy table and it stayed that way the ENTIRE time we sat here. Really awkward eating beside this"}
{"text":"Always love the 1/2 priced wings. Reasonable price yet awesome wings. It could be packed when they have the 1/2 priced deals. Sundays might be the best time to visit as it's less packed and there's also a 1/2 priced wings deal! If I'm not mistaken, sometime in the late afternoon they even offer 1/2 priced appetizers! So why not?!"}
{"text":"When I'm in the area, this is my go to place for wings. Forget the other places. They may not have 100 flavors like some other places but so what. Their modest amount of flavors is more then made up for the quality and size of their wings. They are big, juicy, and hot, but hot I mean when they are brought to your table they are fresh from the kitchen. I have taken 2 friends here just for wings, and they both loved them. I can't speak for other menu items but the wings are top notch."}
{"text":"It would take a few beers for me to say these wings are any good.  Let me start like saying they are small like they got wings from pigeons . Sauce is very light wings are not all covers by sauce.  I should of known any place that offers 1/2 price wings must not be good what was I thinking."}
{"text":"Truly awful service. We (two of us) waited at their entrance (we were the only people in line) for close to 20 minutes without even a word being said to us. Can't imagine the food being any good if the service is this appalling. The server and bar men saw us waiting to get seated (or atleast spoken to) and yet no one moved a muscle. After 20 minutes, we left. And they saw us leave. And again, nothing.   Never going back !!"}
{"text":"This place is easily my favourite bar in Toronto. Anytime I want to have a good night out with my friends or family; Crown and Dragon is always the place to go. The Dragon Burger rocks, the service is always good and personable and they even have a dartboard! (good place to hone my skills!)"}
{"text":"I had wings here a few years back and was looking forward to some last night after work. After 10 minutes I was approached at the bar and told the kitchen was probably closed. I said I just wanted wings and the server gave me a menu to look at flavours. A few minutes later the bartender arrived and said the kitchen was closed. I ate and drank nothing. I think this is fair based on the circumstances. As is this note."}
{"text":"Amazing wings, even better since the half price deal returned on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Sundays. Yam fries are amazing but apart from that I haven't tried much on the menu apart from the wings.  The excellent service and attentive staff make this the best wing joint in the city by far!"}
{"text":"Went Thursday night for the 1/2 price wings & $10 pitcher deal and was very pleased with the experience.  Firstly - Crown & Dragon is small.   The wing deal starts at 5 PM - so get there at 4:45 and wait until 5 to let the chicken pieces roll.  Secondly - the wings are very good.  I opted for the fried variety (vs. baked) and sampled a few different sauces.  Cooked right, just enough crisp, just enough meat and saucy taste to wash it all down.  Thirdly - $10 pitchers of beer is a perfect pairing with the most finest of chicken wings.  Will I be back?  You bet!  Probably one of the best wing joints in the city."}
{"text":"This place has my favourite wings!! Better than Duffs or wingporiumn. They are full of flavour and taste amazing. There honey garlic is my favourite. Best to come on a wing night as they are half off. I would rate this a 5 but their service really needs to improve."}
{"text":"Sunday, Tuesday and Thursday they do half price wings. Pitchers are cheap too! It's cozy inside and fills up quickly.  It's a favourite of mine."}
{"text":"This is probably my favourite place for wings in Toronto. They have awesome flavours like classic coke, dragons breath, Buffalo butter and Korean bbq. They are so flavourful and juicy, the service was awesome and the owner Mike even came to personally say hi and couldn't be nicer. It's a simple dive bar for great food and I would highly recommend coming here"}
{"text":"FatCat's friends and family stage intervention for FatCat, because FatCat not able to stop eating chicken wings.  During intervention, FatCat hear many heartbreaking stories from loved ones about how FatCat's chicken wing addiction killing FatCat's most cherished relationships.  FatCat get sad... but problem is... FatCat get chicken wing craving when FatCat sad.  So FatCat promise everyone he never eat another chicken wing again, and sneak out of intervention to go to Crown and Dragon.  Things FatCat like  - Variety of flavours of wings  - Wings themselves - fat and juicy - FatCat suspecting Mr. Owner chasing after most sexiest chickens in farm when Mr. Owner go to farm to get chicken wings for restaurant. Yummy.  - Onion rings.. FatCat always order onion rings with wings at C&D.  Things FatCat not like  - Not many good beers on tap..  - The taller waiter cool, but shorter waiter give FatCat attitude in past when FatCat go. FatCat not know why. Recently, even short waiter become little nicer..  Maybe wife of shorter waiter not on strike from bedroom anymore?  FatCat not want to speculate too much. Just enjoy wings fast, before friends and family from intervention show up to drag FatCat away from C&D.  SIDE NOTE:  Please watch movie called \"Trainspotting\" to get better idea of FatCats chicken wing addiction.  Just replace every scene when man doing heroin, with scene where FatCat eating chicken wings. Other parts of movie exactly same.  FatCat try heroin before..  Trust FatCat, chicken wings much more dangerous!!"}
{"text":"I don't get it.  I did come in with high expectations due to the favourable reviews but I found the wings good but not great.  There were a good number of wings to choose from but I didn't find the signature Dragon's Breath hot at all and the Classic Coke was alright, some glaze but still tasted more of the fried.    The food ain't bad but I just don't see myself going out of my way to come back here, thus I'm giving this place 3 stars.  I can see how this might be a 4 star spot if the wings were half the price based on value for the dollar but I paid full price on my visit.  Drink selection could also be better and service was a bit slow and disorganized but I guess that's part of the charm of this dive-ish spot."}
{"text":"Came here for their Thursday's 1/2 price wings, and it was great! Ordered dragon's breath, viva italia and killer bee. Our favourite was viva italia, very unique, flavourful and has a great Parmesan taste. Killer bee was really good too, sweet with a kick. Our least favourite was actually dragon's breath, but overall they were all good, all were crispy and had good flavour. We also ordered onion wings- mediocre, but the focus is on their delicious wings! Thursdays ( also Tuesday and Sunday I believe) are a really good deal, highly recommend !!"}
{"text":"We have our monthly wing night here after work.  I believe Tues & Thurs are half price wings day with a purchase of a drink.  They have like 20 flavors to pick from.  I usally get the Mardi Gras or the Killer bee/Honeycomb Heaven.  Place gets pretty pack and they do not have a lot of large tables. So if you go with a large party 5+ you might have to wait for more than 1 hr sometimes.  The servers are nice and they always show the games here. Good place to hang out"}
{"text":"The best wing place in Toronto! And better yet most days of the week has some kind of special. Every Thursday night wings are half price, get there early it gets busy."}
{"text":"I tried 3 flavours in the selection. All failed. The waitress was too busy, the sauce was a bit odd (different from the ones I usually had), and the chicken wasn't very fresh."}
{"text":"Fantatic wings! dragon breath flavour was so tasty! Excellent service, price very reasonable - i would totally recommend this place!"}
{"text":"My favourite wings in Toronto!  They have a great list of wings and almost all of the flavours are amazing. It's not like places like Wild Wing that have over a hundred flavours but most of them are disgusting. Here there are a few dozen well thought-out flavours. Some of my favourites are Original Buffalo Butter, Honeycomb Heaven, East Coast Donair (naturally!), and Asian Heat.  There's also a decent number of beers on tap. It's not an amazing selection, but they have Kronenbourg, so I'm happy.  This would be a 5-star review if the actual bar was a bit nicer. It's not a dive by any stretch, but it gets a pretty cramped in there, especially when there's a wing special."}
{"text":"Great place!  I visited thevCrown and Dragon for the first time last Sunday, after having the place highly recommended to me by friends.  They were so right!  This pub is nice and casual, with a friendly vibe.  My friends and I enjoyed sitting on the patio, and we made great use of the Sunday half price wing deal.  We ended up having 8 lbs of wings, which definitely took care of our hunger pangs, and at a GREAT price.  We chose both the Original Buffalo and Dragon's Breath sauces, and liked both.  The Dragon's Breath is definitely hotter/spicier, but both were enjoyably hot without being overwhelming.  Special shout out to our server!  She was great!  Very attentive, and seemed to actually anticipate when we needed something, and was right on it.  Had a great experience, and will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Don't come for the service. It sucks. We've been waiting for our bill for about half an hour now. The baked wings are wet and slimy, we tried the jerk and the buzzard. Never again. However, the middle man were awesome, and for that, ill return.   We also like the darts."}
{"text":"We stopped in one day for lunch after renewing licenses at the Canadian Tire across the street, just on a whim, and I've been back a couple of times.  The wings are amazing - big, juicy, and with great sauces. They have a huge range of sauces, and every one that I've tried has been great.   There isn't much ambience - it's a bit of a dive, but it works."}
{"text":"The one and only time I ever sent back a pound of wings. ...they gave me another pound but I got back the same  dry hard little stones. As if cooked well before serving and reheated. No stars for these but yelp makes you choose."}
{"text":"Amazing wings, meh service and terrible beer options.  I'm not sure how Rickards Red can be considered Premium Beer.   I had the Cajun wings, the black and white (salt and pepper) and the Cuban heat wings. All were delicious and very large and meaty. Would definitely go again."}
{"text":"Great wings, rundown place with disinterested staff. Asked to replace the water glass twice, got another dirty one back each time. The wings are amazing though."}
{"text":"Came in on a sunday for their half-price wings (with drink purchase). Place wasn't too busy after 8, but we still waited some time at the door despite there being several empty tables.  Overall, service was kind of slow (they have like 2 guys attending customers) Washrooms are not particularly enjoyable to go in.  They offer baked or fried wings and a couple dozen different flavours. Normally 1 LB costs $12, but if you order more than 1 LB you can save $1 per pound.  At the bottom of the menu it says a LB of wings comes with 7 or 8 wings, because they're \"bigger than other places\". I feel this is only somewhat true, for example if you compare it to St Louis wings it's a bit bigger.  Wings took about 10 minutes to be served, which may be reasonable I guess. The fried wings were a bit hard. The baked wings were much better. Although there are less flavours for baked wings, if they have the flavours you like I'd go with the baked wings."}
{"text":"So much meh in this place.  Apparently Sunday - Thursday is wing night, so the place was pretty full.  My friend and I were seated at a patio set at the back of the place, which is not my ideal seating arrangement, but I was hungry.  Being wing night, I ordered a pound of Cold Sweat wings, promising a mix of Chinese and Indian flavours. What a disappointment. The wings were overcooked and the meat was tasteless, the spice mix on top was okay, but not nearly the flavour explosion that was promised.  There are better wing places out there, in my opinion, I won't be going back.  On the bright side, I enjoyed the most effervescent pint of budweiser ever. Really, it's like they put an extra shot of fizz in there or something."}
{"text":"Ok.  So I finally ventured to the Crown & Dragon after much fan fair and great reviews.  We went in for lunch a were greeted by a super friendly sever.  I asked her how the wings were and she told be they are the best in the city and always win the wing awards.  I eagerly ordered the Dragon's Breath and awaited my wings.  First of all the I want to know who is judging the wing competition and who shows up?  The wings were dry after I asked for extra wet and the heat was most places mild.  The wings themselves were small and dry.  No idea how this place it number 1 on any ones list.  The only reason it gets 2 stars is because they have really good service and it's a clean pub."}
{"text":"I am not feeling the four-star average of this place. At. All. Maybe we should have tried the wings. There is obviously some drug in them that dupes folks into thinking this is a good pub when in actuality it's passable at best.   Beer selection? Almost non-existent. Mostly variations on a theme of bland big-name lagers. The little card on the table that proudly states they \"pour\" Flying Monkeys fails to mention they pour it from a bottle. Or actually they don't. Since there was no glass and no pouring. And they only had the worst of the three Flying Monkey options listed on the card.   Somersby Cider? Pretty flat ... and for some reason served with ice cubes in it. Really!? Is that a thing now?   Medium rare steak? Well done. And served with flavorless veggies and salad.   Yam fries. Passable (and pleasantly thick) but for some reason served with a soy dip that should go with egg rolls. Blech.   The only good thing was the calamari, which was tender, if a bit oily. But they even screwed that up by serving it with boring tartar sauce.  This place definitely struck out with us."}
{"text":"Service each and every visit is quick and attentive.  We love the half price apps and the atmosphere is great. Washrooms are pretty clean and most importantly, on the same floor!  Lol"}
{"text":"Hello everyone,   Firstly, location of that restaurant is definitely amazing. It's fairly close to yorkville as well as Dundas square. Ambiance of restaurant is really cool which demonstrates true Canadian pub style. However, restaurant needs to increase number of employers because when I had my dinner there, there was only one waiter who served to table and there was a one guy who filled glass up with beers except chefs.   Secondly, soup of restaurant was definitely disappointment, which has been marked that spivey it is cool but it not even mentioned that it is bitter and taste like juice of washing dishes. Onion rings and fries were cool though. As well as fish and chips...   Benefit: nice place to watch hockey or baseball game with your friend, cool burgers and pub stuff   Drawbacks: number of employers, taste of soup   Bottom line: I think that would be nice choice to have dinner or drink something at downtown..."}
{"text":"Gotta be one of the best wing places in the city. Especially on 1/2 price wing night! (Tues/thurs night and Sunday all day). Over 20 flavours.. all unique and innovative. My favourites are dragons breath, classic coke, and smokin' gun. Good wings.. not tiny and dry like the chain restaurants  Classic / average looking pub decor. Lots of tvs for game night. Average service. Haven't tired other dishes here."}
{"text":"I was honestly quite disappointed with the wings here. We got Asian, barbecue, and lemon wings and only the BBQ even peaked my interest. The wing sizes were pretty small for a place that advertised big wings and the flavours fell flat. The price was palatable and was the only reason I didn't leave more disappointed (we went for the half off deal).   Service was standard, and the space is what you would expect. There's a nice outdoor seating area but it gets pretty loud and busy being right on Yonge. Overall, a place like Einsteins mops the floor with these folks, in my opinion."}
{"text":"The wings are good, lot of flavours so a wide range to choose; however I would dare to say, the worst service I have ever had whole canada!! It is insane!! They left us stood up for so long, then a table was available and they let another group to get seated!  The bartender was so mean, we complaint but he just shrugged his shoulders and didn't apologize at all!   There are Better places to eat wings and have a relaxing night after work!"}
{"text":"Don't order the lobster grilled cheese. It was very underwhelming.  Too much crust on the bread. Boring flavor. Barely cheese and barely lobster. Tasted like an avacado sandwich ($16) So dissapointing when your bill is $25 and you leave feeling unsatisfied.  The wings looked good. They were 1/2 price. Could have saved some money and ordered them insteas"}
{"text":"BEST CHICKEN WINGS IN TORONTO!!! Just came back to Toronto from three and half years and one of the first places I needed to go too! Was not disappointed at all! And all the staff that was still there remembered me by name! Found this place about a year before I left for Calgary after probably walking past it 100s of times and literally came here almost all three wing nights, Sunday, Tuesday and Thursday for almost the entire year or at least 2 of the 3. I introduced it to so many of my friends. Only knock is its a tiny little place so sometimes it can take awhile to get a seat but it's an awesome place to catch a sports game and sitting at the bar you always meet tons of interesting friendly people. Back to the wings, mmm I want them now lol My favourites are the dragons breath, killer bee and smoking gunn but probably tried 90% of the flavours and they are all amazing!"}
{"text":"Ok I admit I am a princesss I don't take public transit. Parking is freaking hard to find in this location. You will have to parked a block a two away. Not that painful on a nice day I must admit. If I have to walk out in the cold. FORGET IT.  I like the sister place up in Unionville \"Dragon Birsto\". I dicided to give this place a try. Since my friend live downtown I didn't want to drag his lazy ass all the way up to Unionville \"where parking easy to find\" for chicken wings.  One of my favorite food in the world is Chicken Wings. I can eat wings 7 days a week if god gave me special gene that I can never get fat. Unfortunately he/she said I am not the luck one. Haha. To balance tipping scale on the heavy side I tried my best to shuff down as much wings as I can every month and run to goodlife after so I don't feel guilty.  OK, here's my 30 second thought about this place. Small, friendly staff. Cold beer. Wings OK not the best. I prefer the sister resturant up in Unionville. The cook must be mad that day that's why my wings didn't taste good.   Overall not a bad place to go eat if you around the neighbourhood. Hopefully the cook will be in a happy mood when you are there so your wings will be TASTY :-)  2 guys + 1 Baskets of Onion Rings + 3 lbs wings + a pitcher of beer = 60 bucks. incl tips. (We went on the wings night which was Tuesday.)"}
{"text":"After watching a bad movie with a bud we found ourselves asking over and over again what pub did we want to end up at for some beer and wings.  We ran down the usual suspects in the Bay & Bloor area.   Then I remembered that while buying a barbecue at Canadian Tire I had seen a little tiny English pub across the street.   I remembered it because my roommate and I had a discussion afterwards about what constituted a pub vs. a bar.  Neither my bud or I had been so we decided to check it out.   When we arrived we realized this was a local, which suited us fine, but we hadn't known what to expect.  There was a large old looking window that made the pub look like it was out of the shire.  There was a jukebox hanging on the wall playing anything and everything and a few big screens littered with American football.    The people there all seemed friendly enough, and about the same age.  Late twenties to early thirties.  It looked like an older couple or two were having a pint and supper as well - it was obviously a local to have the clientele they held on a Sunday night.  We found a table for two and noticed it was wings night.  Perfect!  1/2 priced wings all day on Sunday.    And with something like 30 flavours, and your choice of baked or fried, this was a pretty sweet find.  It also explained why a small local bar was doing fairly well on a Sunday night.  The wings came to our table - from a friendly server/hostess - and we chowed down.  We commented on how amazing the wings were, and how massive.  We've sat down at most of the wing joints in the city, but these were a real treat!  Best wings in the city bar none.  In short, it's a small pub with a tonne of character and a mighty fine wing list!  It's a short jaunt north of Bloor on Yonge right across from the Canadian Tire.  If you find yourself wondering where to go and you're in the area, this might be the perfect fit for you and your mate!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"It's just so darn good!!! I can't get enough of their big fat tasty wings. It's a party in my mouth. Foghorn Leghorn and KeyWest BBQ are beyond impressive. It's worth every penny full price. No need to limit visiting only on half prices wing nights."}
{"text":"Excellent wings! and they are 1/2 price Tuesday, Thursday after 5PM and Sunday all day.   I start with that because that is the best thing about this pub. Mind you I have not tried much else. OK fried. Onion rings are pretty good.   Service is hit and miss. The place is always clean and did I say wings are pretty good. Good enough too get 4 star with much else."}
{"text":"Sadly the wings have shrunk and the once liberal spread of delicious sauce has become scant. This changes my rating from 4 stars to only 2... What use to be a great guilty pleasure of yummy wings at half price has become no longer worth it at even a quarter of the price. Another one bites the dust."}
{"text":"Went for wings here twice in 2 days - must be pretty good! I don't understand what some of the other reviewers said about small wings; I did not have that problem at all. Wings were def meaty and not small.   I had the honeycomb and the medium BBQ. Honeycomb was delicious! Deep fried and crunchy but smothered in honey. I didn't taste the garlic to be honest, but did not dimish the yumminess. BBQ was ok- nothing too special. Also they were not deep fried so not crunchy which was disappointing.  Others who came with who did not have wings reported just mediocre food and drinks. I'd say def go for the wings,  especially on half off Sundays. Can't beat $6/lb wings!"}
{"text":"Went here after playing tennis with some friends. One of them suggested this restaurant as it was nearby and half priced wings on Sunday with a purchase of a drink. There were some empty tables but we sat somewhat close to the TV to watch some Sunday Night Football.  They have a wide selection of flavours for the wings and when you order 2+ lbs, it will save you about $1 per lb with a choice of 1 flavour per lb. We decided not to share flavours as it made not much difference with the half priced deal. The staff were nice and quick when we needed them.  My friend said we would get more carrot and celery sticks if we split so it evened out in the end.  There is a patio but with summer almost over, the nights could be chilly. May go back if I play tennis nearby again."}
{"text":"If I had've received 6-7 wings for the full price of a pound then I'd probably have been disappointed. Sure, they claim their \"Dragon Wings\" are bigger than the usual chicken wing, but they really aren't big.  The good news is that half price wings take place on Tuesday and Thursday nights and all day Sunday, so you have pretty good odds of stopping in during a wing night when the 6-7 wings for $5 does seem like a justifiable good deal.  Lets talk flavours. We ordered: -Medium -Smokin' Gun -East Coast Donair -Cold Sweats -Cuban Sun (baked wings)  A lot of places that offer tons of wing flavours always seem to drop the ball on the basics like a good medium, but I will admit that while ultimately perhaps closer to a traditional \"mild\" chicken wing, it was quite good. The Smokin' Gun was closer to a medium in spice and quite tasty too. The baked wings were good and a nice bit of a mix-up, and when dipped in the accompanying dill sauce were dyno-mite! On the less impressive side, the Cold Sweats we're just too asian in flavour and not savoury enough, and the East Coast Donair had a weird special sauce (Im thinking tahini as it had a bit of a hummus vibe) that while interesting and overall non offensive, it was still not a memorable choice.  In the end on a half price wing day for 3 pints and 5 pounds of wings we spent right around $50 after tax before tip. So I was pretty happy with things and I'd say it was perhaps closer to a 3.5 star experience, but since Yelp doesn't allow half stars I'm going to give it a 3 star review as had it not have been a half price wing night, my opinion would probably be lower."}
{"text":"If I'm going to give five stars for wings, this is the only place in Toronto that earns it. There are plenty of four star wings out there but only one place can get five.  Perfectly battered, perfectly moist and perfectly flavoured, these wings embody the main three attributes that define a chicken wing.    They have about 30 flavours to choose from but I usually gravitate towards the Roadside Lemonade and then mix up my second pound of wings with another flavour.  There was a point in time where they strayed away from their discount periods but I'm happy to report that Tuesday evenings, Thursday evenings and all day Sundays are half price.  The only other menu item that I've tried are the fries and onion rings but I am not going to penalize Crown & Dragon for them being mediocre. Besides, all I want are their wings!"}
{"text":"Crown & Dragon has the best wings in Toronto. Don't come expecting great service or great decor - this place is all about the wings. Unlike other wing pubs that have a huge list of wing flavours, this spot has a dozen that are all great. My personal favorite is Dragon Breath but honey garlic and regular Buffalo are also very good. Expect a wait on wing deal nights."}
{"text":"I've only been for the half price wing specials (with a beverage) LOVE the fried wings and various options. Also the beer list while limited has some good choices which I think if you need a drink to get the half price wings is much better than say having to buy a beer you don't like. The choices are broad... I am always a fan of the honey hot concept and the Killer Bee is great, spicy and sweet and not to far in either direction. The lemonade rosemary option sounds weird but tastes great, also same for the coke version. We tried one of the \"hot\" buffalo butter, tasty butter came thru but not as hot as we thought it could be.  Good service, small but adequate tables, sports on tv...pretty much what you want a wing joint to be!"}
{"text":"Great place to hangout to catchup. Food is decent with good portions & great prices during their daily specials."}
{"text":"\"Best wings in Toronto\" is a title this pub does not deserve. How this spot gets so much accolade is beyond me.   Anyone who enjoys wings will cringe when they order what appears to be a signature sauce but comes out like the generic \"hot sauce\" something PC would produce.   The wings are pretty small, which also means the bone to meat ratio is brutal when you're ordering by weight.   In terms of drinks, my girlfriends caeser was 90% water. I appreciate that this isn't the place to get nicely made drinks but this was very underwhelming.   Repeat? No. Recommended? No."}
{"text":"My favourite wings in the city.  They recently changed up their recipe for the bollywood and they taste just like tandoori chicken, they're terrific.  Big fan of the Killer Bee and Dragons Breath. Their dill dip is good too.  They could use an upgrade to their TV's but they always have the sports game on you want."}
{"text":"The wings are phenomenal. The service exceeded my expectations, especially since I came on a Tuesday where the wings were half price."}
{"text":"The reviews on Yelp are what got me to try Crown & Dragon, and boy was I impressed! The wings that we had were absolutely amazing. The service was a little bit slow, but understandably, it was Friday night so that won't stop me from going back. Will definitely be trying out some of their specials, and I can't wait to try more wing flavours."}
{"text":"An adequate British style pub within walking distance of the Bloor/Yonge subway crossroads. Not a bad place to meet friends who are coming from practically any direction.  I didn't have the wings (not a wing fan) but the fish 'n' chips was actually quite good.  The Crown & Dragon is on the smallish side. Maybe there was a backroom I didn't spot, however. It's kind of dark and there's a photo of Ben Mulroney near the exit. If there was ever evidence of an Illuminati and Brian Mulroney's membership in it, that Ben Mulroney has a media career I think is proof of the Illuminati.   A decent enough selection of beers on tap. A pretty big menu.   Nothing really wrong about this place. It's location I think its its strength."}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time last week! I am amazed at the variety of wings that this place has! The honey garlic and Tuscan sun are amazing ! Also out table ordered a side order of poutine which was a good portion size and quite tasty!  Best time to go is either Tuesday or Thursday know 1/2 wing nights after 5pm"}
{"text":"Best chicken wings I have ever tried   I've tried Dragon Breath, Honey Garlic and Lemon something and were delicious. We had 3 pounds of wings plus drinks for only 22 $"}
{"text":"Came for 1/2 price wings and left satisified. Service was great as well. TVs are old though.  Wings we tried:  Viva italia: it's really good but needed more cheese to hit the next level in my opinion  Dragon's breath: a little hot but easily manageable. Flavour was not bad  Don Ho's Hawaiian: a little pineapple flavour but still tasted good.  I think I prefer Duff's to be honest but can't go wrong with 1/2 price."}
{"text":"The wing specials are great. Vast selection of flavours. Great service. Great location. Top wing joint in yorkville.   5/5 *"}
{"text":"I am a sloth by nature and when the weather gets cold-ish, I am a hermit and very few things in life gets me out side of my apt away from the cat and comfort except for good food.  So of course this was the reason for the outing to try the \"best wings in the city\" and my gawd, it's so true.  The selection is also decent; it's no 88 wings or Wingporium but it's not in the middle of nowhere either.ALL THE WINGS are JUICY inside, perfectly moist that after the first bite you're waiting to swallow so you can have another bite (that sounds really bad, but its so true). Although I shared the 4lbs that was ordered, I think i can easily finish it by myself and if not in one sitting, I will certainly sit until I am done them.  Can't say much for service though; the dude that served us completely ignored us until we went to get him then left us alone until we got the bill. He was super quick to grab his tip. However, apparently this is a rare occasion and the service is decent 99% of the time - I will not be verifying THAT any time soon because, I know that's one too many times and sooner than later, i'll be making a daily stop.  You should try it though, it really Is FINGER -LICKIN' good( there really should be a BOLD , UNDERLINE and font size 72)...heck I'd probably lick the plate too ....but I couldn't embarrass my friends like that...:)"}
{"text":"Got the garlic bread and viva italia wings while I was here, and both were pretty good. I prefer softer bread, but the crispiness was still good. The wings were really filling, albeit a little dry. I would love to try more of their other flavours. 1/2 price appetizers were also a bonus.  Our waiter was really nice, but I think he was the only one working at the time, and he got distracted talking to some people at the bar, so we waited quite a long time to get our bill and pay.   It's a pretty average-looking pub, but I think their specials are worth trying if you're in the Yorkville area."}
{"text":"Toronto's Best Wings!!!! - hands down.  Look no further. They have amazing flavours to choose from - my favourite are Buffalo butter, dragon's breathe, foghorn leghorn, smoke gun and honey comb. All the wings were perfectly glazed and crispy, with the exception of the foghorn because those are baked.  I will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"Crown & Dragon is right across the street from my office but this is my first time coming here. It's a rustic, traditional pub that looks like it got stuck in time but not in a terrible way. It does kinda have a certain charm of its own. There are dart boards, TVs, and handwritten specials on chalkboards above the bar.  Apparently, their wings were voted and judged best in Toronto and they're offered at half price (with the purchase of a beverage) all day on Sunday and after 5:30pm on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Good deal!  I didn't feel for wings today so I had a small order of Slow Baked Pork Back Ribs with their award winning \"Key West\" sauce. It was served with a whole roasted corn on the cob and I opted for fries on the side.  The ribs were tender and tasted good without being oversauced. The fries were cooked perfectly crispy and I love roasted corn. This was a good meal for $14 and a small order wasn't that small. Good value!  My friendly server, the only one on duty, took care of all the patrons while hobbling around in a boot cast. Good job! Bless her!  I'll have to come back to try their wings. Maybe with a cold pint or two over a game of darts!"}
{"text":"The first time I went to Crown & Dragon was with a friend and we didn't feel like driving up to Bayview and Eglinton to go to Duff's, but we wanted wings. He had heard about this place and it was apparently really good. The rest is pretty much history.  There were about 30 flavours for wings on the menu which is pretty decent; less overwhelming than the 100 flavours you find some places, but better than just ordering based on temperature (mild, medium, hot, etc). On that first visit we decided to go with a few of the award winning flavours. That was many months ago but I am pretty sure we went with Dragon's Breath, Honeycomb Heaven, and Key West BBQ. When the food came we were impressed with not just the sauces, but the wings themselves were tasty and not greasy like you find at a lot of places these days.  As a side we went with the garlic bread with cheese and the yam fries. The garlic bread was like anywhere else, but the yam fries were actually really good. Instead of the thin cut sweet potato fries that are served everywhere now, they slice a fresh yam into long thick fries and batter them slightly. I have had them both ways, so I can recommend to everyone to get them well done or else they can be a little too soft for my liking; almost like a baked yam when done normal.  Then we were onto the dessert which was interesting to say the least. I had never heard of a banana chocolate spring roll before, but we decided to give it a shot. When it arrived, it was exactly that, thin spring roll pasty around banana and chocolate with a caramel sauce on the side and ice cream on top. I am a very picky person when it comes to food and while it looked fine, I was worried about how it would taste. The ice cream was starting to melt as I stared it down and eventually decided to give it a try. I was pleasantly surprised when I took the first bite and before I knew it I had eaten the whole thing. Now I can't go back there without getting this dessert.  I have been back a few times since, introducing different friends and crowds to the goodness that is Crown & Dragon. While the service can be a little slow at times, the food makes up for it completely. Ever since they started free comedy show on Saturday nights from 9:30 until 11:00ish it has added even more of a reason to go. Great tasting wings and a place to laugh and pre-drink that ends early enough to go to a club or where ever the Saturday night adventure takes the group of friends I am with at the time. This is a pub with so much more!"}
{"text":"Had visited this place but never tried the food and was very excited to place an order. Living only five minutes up Yonge street I was curious as to why it took over an hour for delivery. The food was cold when it arrived ( cold fries are never good) and we ordered (and paid for) 4 drinks, but only received 1...? The wings were ok, but the coleslaw had gone bad... will not be returning"}
{"text":"This place for sure is overrated, i don't know how but this review is real! Nothing is especial about the wings! We ordered the Viva Italia and another popular type of wings that they have and both were normal or below normal quality. Also there is nothing especial about the place and its decoration. We went there on Saturday night and based on its location and rating, I was expecting a packed restaurant. However, except us, there was one more table filled. About the service, I left the place very unhappy, we booked a table by phone and ordered our food as we would arrive there 5 min after closure of the kitchen (as I said, I was imagining a packed place that minutes matters:)) ). We ordered 2 pounds of viva Italia and 1 pound of another type but they billed us for 4 pounds. I was with my friend and we are all sure that we ordered 3 pounds in total, but the server said that it is impossible and just left us like it is your problem and go F yourself... not the best feeling...We paid for the extra pound, who cares, but definitely won't go back to that place again..."}
{"text":"They really are the best wings in the city, and I don't use that term lightly.   Good brine, good fry, good size and great flavours which is really the key. A lot of places in Toronto have great wings but with the boring \"Mild, Med, Hot, Honey\" same old.  $5 pounds Sunday-Tuesday sweeten the deal, but I'm more than happy to pay full price for them anyday of the week!"}
{"text":"LOVE the wings at Crown & Dragon.  Staff are really nice too.  A bit of a pit but they're currently primping the place up.  The \"Dragon's Breath\" wings are AWESOME (much hotter version than their sister pub - The Dragon Bistro - in Unionville)!  It's a good time & great wings - GO!!!"}
{"text":"This place was great. I tried four different types of wings: dragon's breath, jerk, Cajun and the spicy honey. All were very tasty, with the spicy honey being my favourite. I will definitely come back on half price night!   What made this place special to me was the service. The bartender and server were extremely friendly. The chef was eating at the bar and we ended up chatting with him. He paused his own dinner to go grab a newspaper article about the bar to show us! I don't think I've ever come across service like this in a pub."}
{"text":"Came here for regular priced wings. 4 lbs for $41, about 7 wings per lb.   Chose Dragon's Breath, Honey something, Mardi Gras and Coca Cola. Dragon's breath is supposedly the award winner and very spicy, but it was neither very hot nor that great. As my buddy described \"tastes like it was tossed in Frank's\". Mardi Gras was the dry rub one and definitely the pick of the bunch. Had some cheesy-parmesan like taste as well, which was good. The honey and coca cola ones were too sweet for my taste.  Not the best in terms of value, but not many people were here on regular-priced wing night. Come on Tuesdays and Thursdays if you do come!"}
{"text":"heard that these guys will be delivering soon---wow, awesome wings right to your door!  Always give an extra star when a pub offers delivery ;)"}
{"text":"MMmmmm I love chicken wings. And I discovered I sure love chicken wings at Crown and Dragon! I'm glad my friend introduced me to this place. I got the Dragon's Breath which is a level 3 spicy (their highest) and I ate the whole thing and survived! Woot woot for me! :D   Okay actually, it wasn't all that spicy, very tolerable I would say. Their wings are a lot bigger than average (and meaty!) so 1 lb is about 8 pieces and comes with veggies and dip.   They also have killer yam fries - made in house, super long, hand cut style and crispy on the outside, tender on the inside, perfect I say!   Besides the wings and fries, I also like this place because they got GREAT DEALS! Tuesdays and Thursdays are half priced wings. They have specials every day of the week. Beer specials works for me!"}
{"text":"First time coming to Crown's with a late Sunday night craving for wings. Ordered 3lbs of wings between 2 ppl with the intention of taking most home but we put a pretty good dent in It. Only 5 to take home! We got the Dragon Breath, not as hot as I expected, but still good. The Honeycomb was great, not too sweet and the Mardi Gras which tasted even better dipped into the honeycomb sauce! All in all great wings! I would come back the taste the Classic Coke, Holy Habanero and Smoke N guns"}
{"text":"My beer seemed watered down which is never a good start to a meal. I ordered a Canadian burger with fries. The fries were crispy which is great but the burger was from a frozen patty. I admit I'm a total burger snob so this experience really turned me off making me not want to return again."}
{"text":"Food quality here has dropped substantially.  They used to have very good wings here, maybe not Toronto's best but pretty close.  Now they skimp on their sauces and a lot of the wings just come out dry and flavourless.  Maybe it depends on who is working that night but I won't be back and cannot recommend."}
{"text":"I. Love. Chicken.   The waiting took long which is understandable considering it's half price wings on Thursday's. We had to share a table with some strangers, but it was fine. I had my chicken. I am at peace."}
{"text":"If I could give this place less then one star I would. I went there earlier today and I'm still mad about it. I went in for the half off wings and I dont even think you can consider what they served me chicken wings, they were more like chickadee wings cause boy where they tiny.  I love spicy, vinegary wings and these weren't spicy at all I got the buffalo butter after asking one really confused waitress what the classic chicken wings were cause the menu has a ton of random gross sounding wing options all I want is whatever the franks red hot sauce is! You have to order a drink with the wings whites $2 ands no free refills.   Now onto the food, The wings were tiny absolutely shamefully tiny and I would bet that isn't 1lb of wings because Duffs chicken wings are like triple the size its like the Duffs chicken ate the crown and dragon chicken. The wings were under sauced  like there was drought on chicken wing sauce and they had to use in sparingly. Toss that stuff on those tiny chicken wings make them a little better! My high school cafeteria had better chicken wings at least they were bigger... The fries weren't even bad costco fries they were worse, they wasn't a lot of them and they went even hot. they gave me dill sauce with my wings and it was only half full I use that stuff to dip my fries in and I ran out right away! It wasn't even half full!  Now onto the service, we mistakingly decided to be seated towards the back of the restaurant towards where the waitresses hang out, and I had to over hear their sorority girl conversations no girl nobody cares how drunk you were honestly NOBODY WANTS TO HEAR IT!   It was honestly a horrible experience from start to finish and Im pretty sure the only reason that this place has some rave review is because people who work in the area stop in for the cheap drinks and grab some half off wings. If you actually like wings go to DUFFs anyone who says these are the best wings in the city clearly hasn't tried enough wings in the city.   I will not be back and I've already complained enough I made my Dad glad he never tried the place out because it was just BAD!"}
{"text":"So I just got back from this place. Here's the scoup.. paid $12 for \"7\" no big deal wings, which means each wing is a little under $2 A WING !!! Are you kidding? Get out of my face for that price.   $3 for fries that were soft when I asked for crispy. $1.50 for a watered down gravy. And the male bartender that took my order seemed like he would rather be somewhere else, like his boyfriends place.   I'm going somewhere else for my wings, this place is pathetic and a rip off."}
{"text":"I will say that these are the best wings in Toronto and the Selection is GREAT.  Dragon's Breath is aptly named as you do eel you can breathe fire afterwards. I would avoid the Coke flavored wings, they didn't really do it for me.  It's even better when they are half priced on Tuesdays and Thursdays!"}
{"text":"Service is POOR! They do not check on you enough, they charge for refills of pop/soda, AND only gave me water and cutlery after I asked. My husband asked for a coke refill, and was informed that there was a charge for the refill, we said that that was fine, and the waitress said 'okay' and NEVER returned. I had to ask the other server for our bill later.   The wings are good enough, not the best I've ever had. There are quite a few flavors that were offered. I had the Japanese Teriyaki and Hawaiian. I enjoyed the Hawaiian more.   They did have a half price wing deal on the day we went, and my husband and I ordered two pounds each, 2 flavors per order. We managed to eat most of them, however I had maybe 4 wings left each. When I requested a box, I was told that there was a charge for each wing that I wanted to take home. This seemed strange, as I have already paid for my order. If one has paid for the number of wings served, why is there another charge to take the rest home.   Parking is also not the easiest. You can park across the street at Canadian Tire for 8$ an hour, Or take you chances on a side street. There is no parking on Younge."}
{"text":"I'm shocked, SHOCKED, that this place doesn't have a line-up out the door when I go on Sundays for half-priced wings. Oh wait. Now you know my secret. If there's a queue to get in the next time I need wings in my belly I have no one to blame but myself.  Best wings in the cit-tay! GUITAR SOLO!!!!"}
{"text":"I haven't had chicken wings (that I have liked) since moving back to Toronto. I wouldn't say they have the largest wings of places I have eaten wings at (back in the USA) but they have a great array of flavours and they aren't overdone. The Lemonade and Rosemary combination was a very interesting one to see but I opted for the honeycomb instead, not overly sweet or gooey as stated but that was a plus, they had Canadian maple syrup (not the corn syrup the yanks use) and were light, very well made. Their basket of fries, however, were amazing, It's so rare that people know what oil to use and how long to cook french fried potatoes. The waiters were a bit slow, the crowd a bit young and loud but I zone out when that much sugar enters my body. I didn't mind the full price as the place isn't very large and could see it being crazy on a Sunday."}
{"text":"GREAT WINGS!  And They're HUGEEE.   I'm not a fan of spicy wings (Im a baby I know)  so I tried to Caribbean Coconut and its fantastic....I am NOT a fan of the baked wings (hence 1 star off).  But the regular ones are FANTASTIC.  My boyfriend had the Viva Italiania and OMG I'm getting them tonight....  Tues and Thurs is 1/2 price thats honestly like 5 bucks...all you need a drink.  How can you go wrong?    I didn't know they had $10 pitchers....all over that tonight ^_^!"}
{"text":"Not a bad place. Shame about the curt and surly waitress who seemed legitimately bothered at the idea of doing her job on a Monday night."}
{"text":"I love love love wings. I also know my wings.  These dragon ppl also know their wings. Now my go to place, with Anchor bar in buffalo a first for me.  Restuarant is kinda tight inside, great looking bar.  Loved the itlaian herb, uber yummy."}
{"text":"I have walked past Crown and Dragon many times, but had never gone in. So when I won a $25 gift certificate on Twitter (@CrownandDragon) it was a bit worrisome since I live a short walk away, and if I liked it, chances were that I would make excuses to return - cause I love pubs, and one that serves great wings would be a dangerous place for me to frequent (got a figure to maintain ;)). Anyway, I contacted three of my closest friends, and suggested that we visit Crown and Dragon on an evening when wings are 50% off - so we went with a Tuesday night.  Ambiance  I arrived at 5:45pm and restaurant was already at 75% capacity. I agree that the furniture and vibe is quite dated, but if you have frequented as many pubs as I have in Ireland and Scotland, the best pubs are the ones that have not seen a coat of paint in decades, if not centuries, and you wonder whether the chair you are sitting on can be considered antique. So I had no qualms with the dated space.  Service  There was one bartender and two waitresses. By 6:30pm the restaurant was at full capacity, and there were several groups waiting near the entrance for a table. Unfortunately, I felt that our waitress was more concerned about refilling our drinks, than food, so she would only come by when our drinks needed refilling (no, there are no free refills), but when we tried to get her attention for issues related to food - as in we want to order more food or inquiring about our missing order - she was difficult to flag down. But I guess it is understandable when you have a full house with limited staff.  Food  It is true that most people visit Crown and Dragon for the wings, and rightly so. They have 18 flavors of fried wings, and 5 options for baked. We started with 4lb option and each one of us chose a flavor: Honeycomb Heaven, Don How's Hawaii, Smokin' Gun and one baked option - Do The Jerk. The wings came with the standard celery and carrot sticks, with a side of ranch dressing. We actually enjoyed all four flavors, though I preferred the fried wings, over the baked. For the 2nd round we chose: Dragon's Breath, Turning Japanese, Mardi Gras, and Cuban Sun. I really liked the Dragon's Breath, though I thought it could have been spicier, and also liked the crispness of the Mardi Gras but it was a tad too salty. I really did not like the Turning Japanese and the Cuban Sun - to the point that I only took one bite of each and refused to finish it.  Also, since appetizers are discounted before 6pm, I ordered the Spicy Spinach Dip ($9.95 - a spicy spinach and cheese dip, served warm with a side of pita and crispy tortilla chips), and was pleasantly surprised by the taste, though it did not look very appealing when it was placed in front of me. I also loved that the pita pieces were served warm.  My friend Angela loves sweet potato fries, so she ordered the Yam Fries ($6.95 - sweet potatoes that are hand cut and dipped with our own seasonings and golden fried) right after we had our first round of wings, and did not get them until we were almost done our second round of wings (the kitchen and waitress forgot about them). When the fries were placed in front of us, we did not know what the heck we were looking at! Each piece was massive, and unfortunately soggy! It also came with a really weird sauce on the side (soy sauce plus hot sauce combined). It was necessary for us to dip these beasts into the ranch dressing that was meant for the wings.  Overall...  I really enjoyed the food and experience at Crown and Dragon, and loved having the option of trying a bunch of different wing flavors, so that on future visits, we can choose our favorites. Though I think that next time we will try the flavors we have not tried yet - 8 down, 15 to go! Oh, and I also want to try some of their other appetizers.  Been trying to upload my photos for 2 hours now. Don't know what the issue is. Please check out the photos on my blog: http://playingchef.com/2015/02/07/wing-night-crown-dragon-yorkville-yonge-davenport-rd/"}
{"text":"First time here and man was it packed! Came to check out the \"Best Wings in Toronto\". This place actually didn't disappoint. I've been to numerous wing joints throughout the city and this place is currently takes my top spot!   The wait time for the 1/2 off wing nights are quite lengthy but if you stick it through you will be pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"Truly is The Best wing place ever! Esp on wings night! Their half price wings r back! We tried their 3 hottest wings;  Dragons Breath -similar to hot in other wing places African firecracker - our fave! Spicy and sauce with a slight tang! Very flavorful! Holy Habanero - was intimidated by the 4 star spicy! But it wasn't too bad! Quite a slow burn! Unlike the other two...wings were juicy and not too sauce! Crispy on the outside, juicy meaty wings on the inside!  $15 pitchers & half priced wings! Can't wait to go back already!"}
{"text":"Amazing wings for an amazing price when you go for the half off special! Service is meh places is meh but food I's awsome so that's what I care about the most when it comes to wings"}
{"text":"Perhaps the best wings in Toronto are served here. I love their honey garlic wings. Even better, pair them with the yam fries, served with soya sauce. Heavenly! So bad for you, but tastes so good. Another thing they do well is their burgers. It can get quite busy here on games nights. Pro-tip: The wing special nights are Tuesday, Thursday, and Sundays. Pro-tip: Go early to get seats or you'll be waiting for 20-30 minutes. If you're looking for amazing wings in Toronto, look no further."}
{"text":"Looks like someone got an attitude adjustment.... not me, I mean the guys at Crown & Dragon!   I was in a wing mood so hubby and my made our way to this pub for some amazing wings. As previously mentioned if it were just about the wings, this place would easily get 5 stars. Once again I got Viva Italia and I was not disappointed. Portions here are huge and 7-9 wings is equivalent to most dozens at other pubs (you've been warned).  Our waiter was super sweet and attentive. In fact the only reason they are getting 4 stars instead of 5 was because of the beer selection. There are no ciders on tap or in cans... all they have is Peeler Premium Light Cider, which is disgusting!"}
{"text":"Came on 1/2 priced wing night on Thursday and it was packed when we arrived a little past 6pm. Be prepared to wait for ~15min for a seat.  Flagged as one of the best wings places in town - and I admit the flavours are really unique! But the wings itself are pretty small. Ordered - Mardi Gras: mild Cajun dry rub that's a good mix of a kick of spice and saltiness - Viva Italia: you can definitely taste the Parmesan... delicious! - Key West BBQ: a very normal BBQ, more sweet than spicy - Dragon's Breath: a more spicy buffalo flavour, but not as spicy as the hotness level describes it   I usually prefer the wet flavours but I was really impressed with the dry rubs here!"}
{"text":"To the best of my knowledge, the Crown and Dragon Pub does the best chicken wings in Toronto.  Allow me to qualify my statement by defining my standards: when I eat a buffalo-style chicken wing, I want it to be naked or only lightly battered, ideally with a quick dredge of flour and some seasoning.  That's it.  The word \"breaded\" is heresy.  The word \"baked\" is even worse - chicken wings should always, always be fried.  The wings should be large and cooked through, the skin crispy.  The sauces I can be flexible on - an actual buffalo wing should be tossed in a mix of hot sauce and butter, without much wiggle room for anything else.  Other sauces can be whatever they want to be, as long as they aren't misrepresented: listing a wing as \"buffalo\" and then delivering a bbq sauced wing, or god forbid a sauce-free wing with a \"buffalo dryrub\" - a work of fiction that does not exist, there's no such thing - would get you hung for treason in any country I was in charge of.  So with those standards in mind, the Dragon's Breath wings at the Crown and Dragon earn my full endorsement.  The wings are big, the dredging subtle, the skin crispy.  The sauce is a nice heat level, and if you want them spicier that's easily arranged.  The vast breadth of sauce choices beyond traditional hot wings is tremendous, and most of them are very good - the Lemonade Lavendar is a particular standout.  The prices are fine, and get even better on half-priced wing nights, Tuesdays and Thursdays.  The service is good, and it's a pub with a pretty average pub atmosphere.  It's clean.  The washrooms are fine.  With chicken wings this good, I don't really ask for much beyond that.  The rest of their food could be terrible; I really have no idea.  I've eaten here many times, consuming nothing but wings, surrounded by people eating nothing but wings.  Wing fans won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great wings! I am a big fan of spicy food so on a snowy Sunday afternoon I ordered the Dragon's Breath and the Holy Habanero. Amazing! Had to order garlic bread (which was delicious too) coz the habanero was spiiiiiiicyyyyy! I also had the Dragon Berry to drink... Not a fan. But everything else was great. My only regret was not eating 4lbs of wings!"}
{"text":"Haven't been here in a while, but I really like this place.  If you want the best wings in the city, check out Crown & Dragon. The service is good, beer is beer, and I've never tried anything other than the wings. This place has a great variety of flavours.  You'll be able to find a flavour for everyone in your group.   My fave?  I like it spicy.  Holy Habanero!"}
{"text":"Simply the best wings in town!!!!! Nuff said =)"}
{"text":"HOW HAVE I NOT WRITTEN A REVIEW FOR MY MOST FAVOURITE PLACE FOR WINGS?  Seriously though... This place has about 30 different flavors for their wings. I always try to order different kinds each time I come. I have yet to be disappointed. I love love LOVE coming here on their half-price days... which are Tuesday & Thursday after 6pm AND all day Sunday! They usually have happy hour drink and food specials and other specials throughout the week. I imagine their food is just as satisfying as their wings. I swear that this place will not disappoint for wings. Every person I bring here are instant fans!  Also, the servers are super chill, friendly and competent. Good food. Check. Affordable and reasonable prices. Check. Good service. Check.  BESTEST!"}
{"text":"Hands down my favourite place for wings.  Ive tried many flavours on the menu but my favs are the Rookie bbq in medium and Mardi Gras."}
