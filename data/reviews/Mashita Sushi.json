{"text":"Don't let the small & humble looking place fool you. The food is great plus they deliver outstanding customer service! The ingredients look and taste fresh. My wife and I ordered the lunch special. We love it! We will be coming back for more."}
{"text":"Great pick-up Sushi - Mystic Pointe, quality and variety - had Sushi & Sashimi Combo, with Gyoza, Shrimp tempura, Green dragoon roll - will be back again - on the same level as Pearl Sushi Mimico."}
{"text":"This is my favourite sushi place! Always fresh, beautifully presented, affordable, and absolutely delicious. And the staff are, as others have noted, very wonderful."}
{"text":"Great food, very fresh and friendly staff. My place to go in my neighbourhood. The loyalty card is an excellent addition."}
{"text":"Decent place for sushi. Nothing fancy, it's a more of a take out spot than sit down sushi bar. Very kind and professional owners."}
{"text":"Best sushi in the GTA. I have tried hundreds of sushi places but this one beats all of them. Highly recommend. You won't be disappointed! 

Amazing sushi, fast and friendly service.

Since I started coming here for my sushi fix, I would never try another sushi joint again.

The sushi is fresh which is a major deal for me. A lot of other sushi places uses old fish or frozen fish. Their spicy salmon roll is the best! The ratio of meat and rice is perfection. The portions are great for lunch or dinner. 

The salad is fresh as well. Their miso soup is more rich. 


Overall food 5/5
Service 5/5"}
{"text":"Every time I go the staff has been courteous and friendly. The food is excellent, and the prices are very reasonable!"}
{"text":"If I were only rating their spicy maki rolls, this place would be a 6. The rice is laid out to the perfectionist thickness of a single grain.The pieces are all cut the same size. The fish is perfectly seasoned. Usually with spicy maki I use a bit of extra wasabi but in this case it would interfere with the flavour. There is SO MUCH FISH in this maki. It is perfect. Coming from someone who has eaten as much spicy maki as I have it means a lot. 

Even the ramen is pretty decent. Somewhere between 3 and 4 stars. 

Specialty rolls are quite good as well.

The wakame salad is quite nice. It has tiny bits of cucumber to add texture and some shredded white thing that tastes nice.

The seafood udon is a disgrace. An utterly disgusting insult to the rest of the food here. Get anything else. Everything else. Just not the seafood udon. Literally the only thing you need to do with seafood is make sure it's fresh. Or at least that it's going to thaw well. The clams were like a floury paste. The shrimp was tough, rubbery, overcooked AND HAD THEIR ENTIRE SHELLS ON. Really guys... this is a korean style, fatty, red udon soup. If you're going to leave the shells on at least slit them down the back so you don't cover your hands in the otherwise delicious but oily, red broth. 

Summary: Best maki ever, worst seafood udon ever. Everything is good but the seafood udon."}
{"text":"This place may not be favourable for dining in because it's so incredibly small (literally has one table of 4, 1 table of 2 and 2 stools by the window) but being in the same building as my condo, it's my sushi \"go to.\" Their lunch specials never fail. And I'm that person that pretty much craves sushi every single day. For those quick and dirty take out days, this place meets all my needs!"}
{"text":"Love this little mom and pop sushi shop in my area. Though they have a table and some bar seating, I've only ever ordered take out from them. The service is always super quick and everyone who works there always greets you with a smile. Their signature Mashita Roll (spicy scallop roll wrapped with fresh salmon, tobiko, crab meat, avocado & cucumber) is my favourite. Perfectly balanced. Rice to fish ratio is spot on (not overloaded with rice). Their Hot Fire Roll is also really good.. try it as part of Roll Set F (3pc spicy salmon roll and 8pc hot fire roll) for 13.95 (includes miso soup and salad), it's a solid deal and more than enough for one person. The Hwae Dup Bap is also a generous portion of fresh sashimi on a bed of a ton of veggies and a side of rice. My boyfriend who doesn't like seafood enjoys the teriyaki combos they have to offer and says it's both tasty and a great value. Can't really ask for more of a sushi place. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"WORST PLACE EVER! We phoned in a pick-up order - they tell us our order will take 40 minutes. We head over after about 35minutes only to be told they gave away our order to someone else. They were not willing to do anything to help us and acted like it was our problem. We are now starving, with no food and back to square one. Will never be trying this place again. Should have known better as their Street sign has spelling mistakes."}
{"text":"This place is right around the corner from my condo. The owners and staff are really friendly. It's a community sort of place. They have a couple of tables for eat in and when I've been waiting for my take home order they always offer me a cup of tea on the house. Their sushi is fresh and good, nice selection. Never had a bad sushi meal from them. They also make nice tempura, lightly battered and not greasy. I love their salad dressing too. And their prices are great. They are a real gem for the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Mashita is the best sushi take-out place in lakeshore. The rice is thinly wrapped around the rolls and they are super fresh! Even though you order take-out, they pack you salad AND miso soup. The price is super affordable. My favourite is the spicy tuna (more fish than tempura bits) and the hot fire roll (has sliced jalape√±os inside with tuna) 

I think it'll be better if they used better take out containers instead of styrofoam ones."}
{"text":"This little sushi place has been reliably delicious and reasonably priced. Wonderful for takeout and delivery. This little business is worth supporting :)"}
{"text":"Cute and small shop. Mainly for takeout but can do dine in. The fish was so fresh that it melted in your mouth. The rice was just right. Not too dry and was nice and sticky. The workers are very polite. Recommend this place for sure."}
{"text":"Great value and fantastic food. Had a quick lunch special, good portion size, came with miso soup and salad. The staff were awesome, very kind and accommodating.

Definitely would recommend!"}
{"text":"I've wanted to try this place out for months now but every time I call to order, the wait is always about 45 minutes. Around Christmas, I believe it was a 90-minute wait. Anyway, one day I was off work and had a lot of time to play with so I decided this was the day. I called at about 2:30pm and ordered the Sushi & Sashimi Combo (8pcs assorted sashimi, 5pcs assorted sushi & 3pcs California roll) for $11.95 and, this time, it was only a 30-minute wait. As most of you already know, there is only street parking in Mystic Pointe. The restaurant itself was immaculate, the service was friendly and they offered me a loyalty card.

Here's my take on the food itself: they were quite generous with the portions and the fish was extremely fresh - just melted in my mouth. Unfortunately, so sorry to say, but the rice was way overcooked. I had to take the fish off the rice as I couldn't enjoy it with the mushy textured rice. In addition, a very little amount of wasabi was provided but, luckily, I had some in the fridge.

I'm going to go out on a limb and say that, given all the five star reviews, I genuinely believe my experience was a one-off. I do plan to return but, for now, I rate it 3.5/5."}
{"text":"This is probably the worse sushi place I've even been. Salmon was defrosted and tempura shrimps and eel were so old that they tasted sour. The waitress picked up our rolls using bare hands. And avocado were all black/brown color. I will not recommend this place to any friends."}
{"text":"yummy and so fresh both times we ordered from there! reasonably priced and staff is really nice."}
{"text":"When it comes to takeout sushi, that place does it right! Not only are the prices low but the service is also super fast. My order was ready for pick up 12 minutes after ordering! They provide excellent quality fish. 

I had the spicy tuna and salmon rolls and it is had a great kick to it. I was truly impressed. Maybe not the best choice if you can't handle a bit of spice!"}
{"text":"Good value for quality sushi. This is my go to for take out since its across the street from my apartment. 

I particularly enjoy the teriyaki beef which is a great value as it come with soup and salad for $8. The rolls are the standard you'd expect from a smaller operating sushi place. The white dragon roll is my personal favourite.

They have customer loyalty cards, one stamp per visit and I think your 8th time you get a free roll or something. Also they are quite polite and friendly, which is always welcome in this stuffy area."}
