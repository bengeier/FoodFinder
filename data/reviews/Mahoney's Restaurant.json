{"text":"Terrible. The food they brought us didn't match what was on the menu. They brought out a different wine then we ordered and didn't tell us until we ask. They messed up out bill. They didn't accommodate for a member of our group that had an allergy. The beer was skanked. The soda was flat. Possible the worst restaurant I was ever in."}
{"text":"After a long morning meeting at the beautiful August Wilson Center on Liberty Ave. My coworkers and I needed food ASAP! We decided to go right across the street to Mahoney's! It didn't look like it would be pricey or the food would be bad. 

As you walk in you immediately see the bar area with TVs and Bar stools, as you walk in a little further the tables are set up in the back with plenty of room. A different set up that you don't see often, but I really liked it. 

The food was typical bar food, but with a little more pizazz. The 1/2 sandwich soup and sandwich combo was actually smaller than I had hoped. The food itself was not too bad. Not my favorite. The French Onion soup was a bit salty and the mayo for the sandwich seemed warm. I tried the fries which were good but a bit too greasy for my taste. 

My friend's Greek salad however was very tasty. It had a great mixture of greens, feta cheese and even potatoes! 

The staff was nice and the prices were good. 

A place I would go back to but not regularly. Maybe try a happy hour there?"}
{"text":"When I travel for work I alway go in search of a comfortable place, unpretentious, good local beer, friendly vibe, good food. I stumbled upon Mahoneys and instantly felt at home. Friendly staff and crowd. Great collection of Steeler drawings. Definitely heading back next time and grabbing a James Burger. Ask around. James may be there. Say hello to him for me!"}
{"text":"Found this place while looking for someplace to stop in for lunch before driving back to NYC. I was surprised at the food, which was good. Loved the lamb burger with feta cheese and the cole slaw and the tomato, basil soup with crab meat was much better than I expected.

The decor is sports bar with posters of the Steelers, a few of the Patriots and Penguins. Very nice and friendly and the waitress was very friendly. 

Would return for a quick lunch if I am ever in Pittsburg"}
{"text":"Worst experience at a restaurant ever.  I don't need anything fancy but this was pathetic.  My coke was colored water, when I sent it back she said they just changed it.  Came back and said we don't have coke, would you like a sprite.  The sprite was flat but I was afraid to order a water after that.  Why didn't we just leave then.  The menu had quite a few spelling errors we joked about but no joke - don't go here.  If I could rate this a zero, I would."}
{"text":"I'm all about dive bars as long as there is some redeeming quality and not too many disappointments.  Unfortunately, too much not to like, mainly 1) cleanliness is seriously lacking, especially in bathrooms, 2) grouchy and rude service

Food is ok is you go for the standard bar fare.  I don't recommend ordering anything \"fancier\" than that."}
{"text":"Couldn't even get a drink... My cousin literally returned from deployment in the middle east yesterday... We had food at Sienna Mercado, went to the DLCC and decided on drinks before the Arcade Theater... We stopped at Mahoney's at 9pm on a Saturday, which was a horrible decision... The place was empty and we were greated with a \" kitchens closed -I need to see ID\" which is a compliment since we are all in our mid thirties. However that was followed with a \" I should be home right now, I don't even want to be here\". Let me just say I am not a reviewer of things, this guy happened to piss me off to the point of writing this. Not only did he try to prevent us from sitting down but once we did, he did everything he could to get us to leave. No joke, the (bartender/mgr/owner?) + his friend were,the only people in the place. Regardless to say the guy is a piece of shit and should just close the doors. The only positive reviews are of the 2 friends that the guy has bc he gives them free booze. The long gray greasy haired fuck completely disrespected a veteran of foreign war, his wife, my wife and me. He is fortunate the only thing I left him with is a piece of advice...CLOSE THE DOORS AND SELL. Fuck this place do not give this dirty shithole your money."}
{"text":"Not for vegetarians but I stopped and had a cocktail anyway on a sleepy, cold winter Monday night. Less than 6 bucks for a top shelf cocktail. Interesting decor. Casual, neighbourhood-y bar."}
{"text":"Definitely has the local Irish Bar feel to it. I ordered a Stella and my buddy ordered a whiskey. Mine was not very cold and his pour was light. Can't say I would go back, not with all the other places to chose from."}
{"text":"I'm giving it three-stars, but it honestly started as a one-star experience.  The appearance and feel of the place is that of a diner/Irish-dive-bar hybrid.  It isn't dirty but it is a bit dark.  It isn't all-american diner, but there's a diner-esque  feel to the floor-plan.  But it is Irish, and that's super fun.

Mel U. wrote that the first impression was that of \"MAKEOVER TIME!\" and I agree.  But I wouldn't change their motif or the theme ... I just would update a little.  And perhaps send some of the staff to polishing classes.

Our bartender had no issue making it clear she was tired, didn't really want to be there, and felt somewhat inconvenience by the fact that people showed up right at 430pm.  About 30 minutes later tho ... we were all laughing together and having a grande ole time!!  So I'll file that into \"crappy first impression\" archive and give her the benefit of the doubt. (I used to work retail, so I know sometimes customers is that last thing we want to see.)

Now on to the booze and drinks!  Our drinks were STRONG.  Linda W. asked for a Dark&Stormy which caused the initial inconvenience wave since ginger beer was in the kitchen coolers.  I went with a basic Diet & Vanilla vodka.  Drinks were strong and good.  The D&S could have used some extra lime but it was heavy enough that it was good in its own right.

The food was good.  My burger was cooked to order and the sweet potato fries were scrumptious.  Linda W. was able to get a basket of fries which were a great value!

There are a couple drink-and-chill all the time type customers there so the conversation was rather interesting once Serena R. arrived dressed as Carmen SanDiego.  We left with smirk and a bit of an eye roll at what was certainly a unique experience in one of Liberty Avenue's eating establishments."}
{"text":"Great little spot for lunch. You can get a NY strip steak with vegetables and fries for $11. The menu is surprisingly large for a place of this size. The waitresses are friendly and remember your name. It's a bit of a dive, but in a good way.  While there are always one or two older guys who may or may not be alcoholics drinking at the bar as you walk in at noon and the decor likely hasn't been updated much since it opened in 1963, you'll also find businessmen in suits having a bite. It feels like the \"real\" Pittsburgh inside."}
{"text":"Poor service and even worse food ... music they where playing was the only good thing about my experience...."}
{"text":"Saturday afternoon.... and not a soul in this place? 

We stopped in only to grab a Bloody Mary. The bartender was sort of in love with herself and claimed that she made THE BEST Bloody Mary ever! Well, it was actually  good but it was certainly not the best ever. I am not sure why people insist on talking themselves up all of the time. 

They had a menu but I only glanced at it as I'm sure the food would have left a lot to be desired. Especially after reading some less-than-stellar Yelp reviews. 

But okay, decent Bloody Mary... it could have used some garnishes like celery or olives to be better. (damn, I'm a snob.)"}
{"text":"Walk past here quickly, do not look inside, do not go inside, but if you accidentally find yourself here, definitely do not eat!  Had an apparently innocuous grilled chicken salad.  That piece of chicken had been lying around way past it's \"eat by\" date.  Didn't keep the chicken in my mouth very long, but it tasted as if it were par-boiled and then dragged across a nasty grill.  There wasn't much more that was redeeming about the rest of what was in the salad bowl either. Have a couple drinks and plan your escape. I did enjoy our server who commiserated with us about the lack of heat in the room."}
{"text":"Good service,  didn't eat just had a beer.  Nothing to brag or complain about. Scouting for a corporate event in dtown Pitt but the place is a little to run down."}
{"text":"I am not digging the set up here the bar stools have arm rests which are fine  if the chair swiveled which it didn't and it was very awkward for me to get down with out the person next to be having to get up.

The bar area felt cramped and made me uncomfortable. There  is apparently a small collection of dictionaries and thesauri that are keep  above the register that are in serious need of a dusty.

I won't  be back soon."}
{"text":"This is a local dive bar. If you're looking for anything more than that, don't bother."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best and manager is a prize winning jerk. Too many great new places in the burgh to waste time there. They are more interested in hanging out on the sidewalk than customers."}
{"text":"bad bad bad


I was in town for colts steelers in October 2014. i got the steak and fresh cut fries. 

the steak was rough and bad. i love most French fires. he fries were a joke. they were thin and small. 

for me to say i love French fries and be disappointed with them says that they were un filling. 

i will never be back. i live in small town ohio. i have better food in m own. 

i disliked the meal so bad i could make better food at home then there

the bathrooms are a health department violation"}
{"text":"The restaurant itself needs updated, but the staff are great and the food is reasonably priced and tastes great. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is a very small Irish pub.  The set up is relatively nice, despite its small size.  However, the location had a poor beer selection when we visited and appeared to be out of at least 3 of their draft selections. For well drinks, my girlfriend typically drinks vodka and cranberry and noted that their pour was very weak on vodka."}
{"text":"Nice weather has returned to the 'Burgh so I thought I'd get out a little bit for lunch.  Hey, it gets a little boring eating lunch at my desk all the time.  

Mahoney's is typical bar fare though.  The prices aren't too bad, but it's your typical salad and sandwich menu.   I opted for the 1/2 corned beef with French Onion soup.  Good way to spend a lunch hour out of the office."}
{"text":"The service was great and the food was ok. I had a cheesesteak sandwich and fries. They have a lot of salads I'd like to try so I'll certainly go back to try some other menu items. The owner has twins. I'm not a fan of busy 2 yr olds running around a business."}
{"text":"I am happy I was introduced to this spot back when I was in college. I was in the city working on a project for class one day, and the front office lady mentioned the salads at Mahoney's being excellent so we decided to stop in for lunch. 

I will say that each time I come here I get the steak salad that is made with filet mignon. Let me add that the steak salad is probably one of the cheapest steak salads around; it's only $9.75. The steak melts in your mouth with flavor, the ranch is homemade and the country style sliced potatoes are the major selling points for me. I can't speak for any of the other menu items, but if you are looking for a good salad for lunch make sure to check this place out."}
{"text":"In the nicest way possible, I will say that I am wondering how this place is still open. I learned the bartender was also the owner and witnessed him being extremely rude to the servers, who were very nice, but obviously overworked and receiving very little support. 

The food is cheap and you get what you pay for. I wish I could've just ordered something easy like Chicken Fingers, but their menu instead has a lot of steak and seafood options, which I would not venture to try. I had a Reuben which was ok, my fiance had a burger which was very overcooked and dry. The fries were so poorly cooked that I barely ate any of them. 

Might be a nice place to stop in for some quick, cheap drinks if you're trying to avoid the high prices of other places in the Cultural District, but I can't recommend it for anything more."}
{"text":"Mahoney's is the type of place where women are accosted by the bartender as my girlfriend was this evening. Don't go!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today and the Reuben was delicious.  The sweet potato fries were not, soggy with grease.  Service was pleasant and the jazz music was soothing."}
{"text":"St Paddy's day bar crawl first stop! So walking around the cultural district after the parade I had to come here. I had passed by when wandering around the city and it called to me with the Authentic Irish name. 

It was really really busy that late morning. The bar was hopping and everyone was excited to start the long days libations. It took a long time for us to get served. Most people were already in the party mode and it was our first stop. The bartender was busy I know but not incredibly happy to be there it seemed. 

We finally ordered a draft of Guinness and chatted away. I can't say the atmosphere had me wanting to stay so we downed a shot of Jameson to pregame for Market Square. The Shots were cheap, the beers were not!
When I asked for green beer they had already run out. The bartender complained that they \"usually sit on it\"...who knows, it was only noon. It did look like there would be a band playing later in the day. We didn't sample any food so I can't comment on that. So my opinion good for one drink on a bar crawl."}
{"text":"This place is great for some things and not so great for others.

For me, this is a good spot for lunch during the week (if you happen to work downtown, because it's not worth a drive).  They have a pretty decent menu (the usual sandwiches, burgers, and salads but also a sprinkling of nice homemade Italian dishes like Chicken Parm and some \"diner-style\" foods like meatloaf).  I recommend the Lamb burger - like an Americanized gyro.  The meat is delish and the veggies fresh.

What is this place NOT good for: happy hour.  Why?  Not because of selection, but because the price of a beer is expensive.  To be fair, I don't think I tried this place for happy hour in about a year, but I was so turned off by paying over $5 for a bottle of Yuengling, that I made my mind up then and there that this would be pigeon-holed as a lunch spot for me.  If memory serves, it was closer to $6 than $5 for a bottle.  C'mon!  This is a local brew with mass distribution.

Final answer: good food, expensive beers, nice staff, horrible decor (but this is clearly old school 'burgh, so that I just overlook naturally)

PS.  If you sit in a booth, you'll be rubbin' bums with the dude sitting behind you.  Try it, you'll know what I'm talking about."}
{"text":"We went on a random Thursday night for dinner.  Our expectations were thinking this local establishment might be a great local pub with sub par food.  This is what we found. 

Our server was friendly enough and welcoming, but dining room area is out dated decor.  Food was not awful, but just barely average.  I had a salad and my husband had a fish sandwich.  They arrived quickly, were reasonably priced and by friendly staff, but the food was nothing special.  Nothing unique or notable about either one. 

The bar area up front seems like a small, local friendly place to go after work, but I would skip the food."}
{"text":"A couple of us needed a place to pregame the Looney Tunes Yelp Elite Event at the Toonseum recently - Mahoney's just happened to be the closest place and so, by default, it was the winner.  Mmmmm, \"winner\" might be the wrong choice of words.  Interesting, maybe.  There were highs, there were lows.  

Let's hit the \"lows\" first and end on a \"high\" note.  My companion and fellow Yelper, Ricardo, and I took comfortable barstools at the end of the long, well-stocked bar.  The female bartender came over and said to me, \"What do you want, Grandma?\"  Really?  This is a chick who depends upon the kindness of strangers for her tips?  I laughed it off with a pointed comment to her as Ricardo and I looked at each other with mild shock and amusement.  Fortunately, she redeemed herself later.  (Full disclosure....yes, I AM a grandmother several times over, but.....)  

Another Yelper joined us a little while later and was the object of quite a bit of interest from owner and a friend of his/customer at the other end of the bar.  Some good natured kidding is one thing, but it bordered on creepy....especially after the two of them later came uninvited into the Yelp Event (smoking horrible-smelling cigars!)  to see her later in the evening! Precautions were taken to assure our fellow Yelper got to her destination safely.

The highs.   I ordered a Dark n Stormy which the bartender had never heard of, but the owner told her how to make and sent her downstairs to get a few bottles of some really good ginger beer.  The drink was assembled in a double old-fashioned glass with an amazingly large pour of Goslings rum - far more than a double!  She added just a splash of ginger beer and a healthy squeeze of lime.  Although it wasn't the best DnS I've ever had, it certainly packed the most good, dark rum.  And at the Happy Hour price of $4.50, it was certainly the best value in a DnS I've ever had!

The fries at Mahoney's are another high.  Crisp, fresh fries, perfectly salted and another bargain at less than $2. The bartender was friendly and fun....well, after she warmed up a bit!  Good prices, good food, good drinks....the highs.  Would I go back again?  Probably not.  But, if you're feeling adventurous, brave and are looking for a Happy Hour bargain, go for it!  Just take a thick skin and, perhaps, a great big boyfriend!"}
{"text":"It's just plain shitty here. Service, cleanliness, all of it just shitty. I have no other words to explain how bad it was. I'm guessing the owner was there (his picture is everywhere of him partying).  Older large man with shaggy brown hair cared only about himself and his friends rather than any other customers. Never again!"}
{"text":"It took over two hours for our lunch here and it wasn't even busy.  When the food finally came it was bad.  We never received an apology.  The prices are cheap, but it's not worth it."}
{"text":"This quaint bar / restaurant has been in the Burgh for as long as I can remember.  It has cozy booths as well as table seating and a full bar.  The walls are adorned with a mixture of drawings of Steeler greats, old photos of downtown Pittsburgh and beer signs. In the background there's jazz playing loud enough to hear but not so loud as to make you raise your voice when speaking. The wait staff is pleasant and attentive without being overly so. 

There's a pretty good selection on the menu at Mahoney's... Salads (in a huge bowl I noticed), seafood, burgers, sandwiches, steaks, pastas and \"old time house favorites\" which includes meatloaf over Texas toast with mash potatoes, gravy and veggie. I was tempted to get the meatloaf but instead opted for the special of the day, country fried chicken with mash potatoes and gravy. 

My order came about five or ten minutes after I placed it.  The chicken was perfectly done, crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. My broccoli was cooked perfectly as well.  Unfortunately the mash potatoes were just average and lacking anything really worth mentioning. But for a nice comfort meal for under $10 on a cold February day I was satisfied. 

Overall, I can't say that I would enthusiastically recommend Mahoney's given all the other options available in town, but I wouldn't discourage anyone from dining here either.  In my opinion it's better than average but not really all that much better.  I'd like to come back sometime and try the meatloaf and maybe one of those huge salads."}
{"text":"I had an aweful chicken parm sandwich.  Chicken was really thin and rubbery.  Absolutely terrible.  Fries were greasy and limp.  Owner seems grumpy and not friendly towards the guests.   I don't understand how places like this survive."}
{"text":"Food is average, atmosphere is old school (painted brick, old tables and booths). Wait staff is nice thought! very welcoming:) quick, easy dive for a bite or a drink. Would recommend the blc (I think it's called)- like a blt with no lettuce:) yum! I would like to see the night crowd... Bet it's \"interesting\":)"}
{"text":"After a work happy hour a few doors away, several of us were looking for a place to eat, and were having a hard time deciding. I was the pain in the tukkhas, since I'd driven my antique car, and kind of needed to be able to park it where I could see it, plus, I'd really planned the evening to be a birthday dinner for one of the co-workers. We decided to split up, and me and the birthday girl go somewhere, and the rest would hit something within walking distance. Then as Birthday girl and I got to my car, we realized we were parked in front of a restaurant, and Mahoney's won out by default.

We should have gotten in the car and driven somewhere else.

The atmosphere was pleasant enough, but the food...yeesh.

Everyone placed their orders, mostly sandwiches of one variety of another, sided with fries, plain or sweet potato, or slaw. I ordered the Reuben hoping for the best, but definitely not receiving it.

Michael's chicken breast with plain fries arrived with sweet potato fries, and instead of just bringing him a side of regular fries, they took the whole plate back to make the switch. Kim's turkey Rachel arrived, and as it was handed in her direction, half of the stuffing fell off the plate and onto the floor. The server took the plate back to the kitchen so that Rachel could be re-stuffed, and for the rest of the evening her initial guts laid right there on the floor. Kim #2 had a fried fish sandwich, which looked a little withered, and then there was my Reuben. More like an Ewwwwww-ben.

The bread was dry as chalk, and the corned beef had been so overdone, it looked like bacon sticking out of the bread. Dry, dry, dry...and I took maybe two bites of the slaw, and that was quite enough.

The prices aren't steep, but seriously people, take some pride in what you're handing off to a customer. Would YOU eat that?? Seriously, put that order down on the counter in front of you...and take one minute to LOOK at it...then make one exactly like it for yourself. Are you gonna eat that? If not, um, why would we want to pay for it?

The service was pleasant enough, and the atmosphere was comfortable enough for nice conversation. But would I go back? Nope. The food, my reason for going to a restaurant, was dreck.

My apologies to my co-workers for forcing them to try it along with me."}
{"text":"Bartender is very personable and knows how to work a menu! Didn't have time to eat but this place is on my bucket list the next time I'm passing through. Atmosphere is great, visited on a Saturday around 11. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"The food was terrible! I got the crab cakes and they were mostly bread crumbs. Two people at our table got the crab bisque and neither could take more than 2 spoonfuls. It was a Wednesday at 7:30 and the restaurant was completely empty besides our group. We quickly found out why. I would NOT recommend this place for food."}
{"text":"A dark, dingy, and dirty dive that I'm pretty positive doubles as a Russian mail order bride service. Regardless, burgers are great, sides are good, salads are big. They're usually out of ingredients to make reubens, so I'm hoping to try them one day... The little breadsticks on the table don't last when you're hungry, so feel free to take them from other tables. Service is pretty good and it's hardly ever busy."}
{"text":"Excellent food, nice beverages, more than fair prices, & great service. Waitress remembered us & was a doll. Owner Elias is a delightful gent & such a really welcoming character. We'll be back. Very pleased."}
{"text":"Worst restaurant ever. Only place with openings on a Saturday night. Waited for 25 minutes to be seated when there were multiple tables open with workers walking past us not acknowledging our presence. Finally got seated and waited 20 minutes for waters and then ate mediocre food. Won't be back."}
