{"text":"Over priced and poor service.  I'd recommend Earl's a block away if you are looking for a place with prettier servers and better food options. The pizza isn't bad if you do go. Pip"}
{"text":"Great music, good services and fun environment for after work. The place is very convenient if you are working in financial distinct. I am a huge fan of their after 11pm 50% pizza and $5 drinks. It is a great cheap date place after a late movie or night out! Their pizza is a MUST! I usually toss out the pizza crust but for this place....i alwaysss eat their crusts!"}
{"text":"Sehr gro√üe Bierauswahl. Sehr leckeres Essen. Sehr empfehlenswert. Nette Bedienung und sehr sauber."}
{"text":"Been there a couple of times since they opened and I have to say it's a fancy place with good choice of music and nice deco. The food on the first time was ok, (didn't expect high quality food). Service was great (a bit slow for drink service I have to say). The second day the food was a bit lower in quality. We had the minimacks which I really recommend because they are amazing. But after we had a burger and a Cesar salad with chicken. The burger was good, but the fries coming with the burger were way to salty, soggy and too fried. And about the Caesar salad I have to say they put too much lemon on the sauce and the leaves of iceberg where way to big same as the chicken. A think I don't understand is the wine service. They serve they champagne in margarita glasses and they don't have real wine glasses for their wines. Even tho we ordered a Chablis (20$ a glass) it was served in what in my opinion is not a right glass for wine. The place is really cool, the atmosphere is great but I can't give it 5* for the little problems I think they still need to solve. It's a new place so I guess they still need to work on it."}
{"text":"Incredible beer selection. This is the only place in Toronto with good selection of sour beers I've found so far.  Make a reservation in advance, this place is always busy."}
{"text":"This is a fairly new place in town and can be quite busy- if you are going a reservation might be worthy. The atmosphere is very nice with really great music. The power bowl was very tasty. This place can be quite pricy but that's downtown Toronto for you!"}
{"text":"This is a new place just open this week. A friend and I are visiting from out of town from the States we discovered it, and the place exceeded our expectations. Great food, amazing service, live music was really good!  I suggest you check it out. I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. I made a reservation on their website but they lost it...\"no record of your reservation\". Hostess wasn't apologetic at all and couldn't make a reservation for us. Said everything else is for walk in only.  And couldn't even tell us the liking of us getting a table for 4 people at 5:15.  The team needs a lesson on proper customer service"}
{"text":"The ambiance of the main bar area where we were was dim and lively.  The room was full of people talking and, while loud, it was never so loud that we had to shout to hear each other.  We waited about half an hour for a table for two and, so, had a few beers at the bar.  It wasn't easy to squeeze in to order, but we managed it and were served by an absolutely lovely bartender who was friendly and I appreciated the effort she made to get to us (in my experience in these types of bar situations, such an effort is rare).  Our waitress was also great.  As was the hostess. So, top marks for service here for being professional and attentive without being formal or stuffy.  The beer selection is well curated with many familiar choices and a selection of things you won't find in the LCBO or a typical bar or restaurant.  They were, unfortunately, out of Braufactum Progusta, the beer I was most eager to try.  But these things happen.  There was plenty of other things worth trying or revisiting.  We ordered a couple of pizzas which were great.  Think Neopolitan meets Detroit style.  Or maybe call it thin crust Detroit style?  I dunno. The crust is crispy, thin, salty, and delicious.  The Quatro was melt-in-your-mouth good.  The Pomodoro (or whatever it was called again) sauce on the Margherita was spot-on.    I would go back to King Taps for beer and pizza in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"Club sandwich is delicious and a fine selection of beers.  Had lunch on the patio, great atmosphere.  Will be back."}
{"text":"Sports bar with tons of tv but still very posh at least for a sports bar. In the states we are used to a different kind of sports bar. Awesome whiskey sours n old fashions"}
{"text":"Candace our server was great!! So helpful and (ps her ring is absolutely gorgeous) . Her pizza and drink recommendations were helpful. Pizza, calamari was amazing! Margaritas were so good. Only thing would be a slide of cake or something to show for my aunts birthday. Other than that we all had a great time!"}
{"text":"Love King Taps! Their food is amazing, the forager is a great choice for vegetarians and also the veggie burger. They can also make other vegetarian options like the tuna bowl and the risotto. Always a great experience and LOVE the cucumber mules, BEST!"}
{"text":"Tried their $19 mediocre pizza. I was disappointed. Nice little place with loud music video playing on TVs. It's definitely overpriced for what it offers."}
{"text":"Came over for dinner with a friend around 5:00 p.m. on a Friday night. We waited about 25 minutes for a table.  The food overall was quite good. We had two dishes: the Stinging Bee Pizza and the Bang Bang Shrimp. The pizza was amazing, if only slightly overly greasy with salami, olives, and honey while the shrimp were merely satisfactory -- it seems that the pizza set too high of a bar.  I was thoroughly impressed by the wide selection of beers. We ended up going on an adventure using a random number generator on our phones to pick beers.  I enjoyed the atmosphere -- it seemed like a cross between a lounge and a sports bar. That being said though, I had issues holding a conversation at times due to the amount of noise. It didn't help that we were seated below a speaker!  Definitely would go again -- but perhaps with a larger group."}
{"text":"Working in a building next door to King Taps I'd been bound to check them out. Love love love the beer selection. There are options aplenty! Less love for how busy it gets at just about any hour on a weekday. That being said I've never had an issue getting seated when going with my girlfriend (i.e., just the two of us). The better deal with King Taps is to go on a weekend. The Financial District is kind of a ghost town on Saturday/Sunday (which is super refreshing when you see how bonkers it is every other day). And they offer discounted drinks and food special on weekends. Plus, when we arrived there was live music from an acoustic performer which was a great treat. If you love beer get a flight - there are several options to choose from. If you love pizza, try theirs. The pizza is a bit overpriced but the beer is average priced. On a Saturday afternoon while the crowd is almost nonexistent it's a great spot. On a Friday night it's not the best choice if you looking to escape the craziness of the bustle of work."}
{"text":"King Taps has the Best pizza in Toronto! Even the salads are very tasty. service was great also."}
{"text":"Not only is the vibe and atmosphere totally hip and awesome, but the service and workers are AMAZING. The experience my friends and I had was incredible. Two of my good friends were visiting from out of the city and we wanted to show them a good time in Toronto. Thank goodness we took them to King Taps because they delivered!   The hostess, Monica was very accommodating and ensured we had a table. She continuously would check in on us to make sure everything was good. Our server gave great, and honest recommendations of what they had on their menu. She would also bring us samples to try before ordering what we wanted. If we didn't like a drink we ordered, she had no problem taking it back for us and bringing us something else.. free of charge! After 10 pm.. their pizza is HALF OFF. If you are looking for authentic, fresh and tasteful pizza.. then this is the place. Hands down best pizza in the city!   I cannot recommend this place enough! For sure a new favourite of mine. When I go out for drinks, or for food.. it isn't just about the quality of the beverages or meals.. it's about the entire experience, from music, to workers, to ambiance etc. King Taps has it ALL!!"}
{"text":"As soon as I walked in I knew this place would be great the atmosphere was amazing. They have lots of space - a bar up and downstairs as well as outdoor seating on both levels. The margarita pizza was my favorite here! We ordered a burger and beef tacos for dinner and both were exceptional as well. The only thing I can complain about is the amount of time it took for our food to come out. Usually people like when food comes out quickly but I thought it came out way too quickly here. We were still eating our pizza when our entrees came out - I just wish I had some more time to enjoy a drink and appetizer before dinner came out."}
{"text":"Good drinks, good service, great food, fun environment. Specifically, the potato skins and pizza were amazing; way better than typical bar food. My wife, friends, and I had a really fun night here. Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"We came in with 15 people. Maybe 20. Have you ever entered a resto with 15 people and asked to be seated? Chaos.  Mind you we called ahead. Let them know a day in advance we were coming... but no reservations. And they say us with a smile not a scowl.  I have never had better service with such a huge group. Repeat: we had phenomenal service.  They take your name to help make splitting the bill easy. They had 4 servers for our table (as opposed to maybe 2 that you'd get at jack Astors). Four servers!!!! I'm still flabbergasted.  They were on top of it the whole night. I still can't get over how great the service was.  The food was also delicious. Came out timely. My fianc√© got the royal burger... freaking delicious. Like to die for. Pizza? Delicious.  This place is doing whatever they are doing the right way. I just didn't like my beer... not their fault.... it was mine. I ordered a sour beer that tasted like vinegar. It was fresh tho!!!  If you have a party or group I highly recommend this place.  Keep on it King Taps."}
{"text":"The claim on their website on menu to be \"The best pizza in Toronto\" is a big one to make but after having their mushroom/truffle pizza and the heavenly dough, I have to agree with them. They have better than pizzeria libretto, just fewer options. Other recommended dishes: crispy sushi, brussel sprouts (yes, really), minimacks (burger sliders), and their cucumber cocktail."}
{"text":"We are staying at a local hotel and asked two gentlemen there (from the hotel, but not the concierge) where to go for drinks, food, and just to relax. They both suggested Kings Taps. It is located on the ground floor of the Bank of Montreal (I think). The greeter was friendly, and hostess cheerful and optimistic that she could seat us within thirty minutes (it was around 8:30 pm, but opening day for the Blue Jays). We had a drink at the bar-- great sour beer! we were able to get a seat. The music was loud but we could still talk-- things were pleasant.   Within 30 minutes, we received our text and began to make our way upstairs. Disclaimer: This was my first time here, I'm 40, and I assumed-- my fault-- that the level of the music would decrease, not increase, but it was fine. The table are pub- style tables (obviously) or high booths, and we had a pub table. Looking around, I realized 1) the place was packed 2) we were in the middle of happy hour leftovers. The server was super perky, but forgot a few things like drinks.   Remember how I said our neighbors were decent? They still were and then a new guy joined the group who planted himself next to our table (did I mention how close the tables are). I was seriously going to offer him a fry the way he kept eyeing up our food! We wanted one more drink, but the Guinness was gone so we decided we should go as well.   The food was very good and staff couldn't have been nicer! If we were 25 again, I would have loved this place (sans the rude neighbor and kicked Guinness). Today, I think this is a fantastic day drinking place and somewhere I'd pop into for lunch."}
{"text":"King Taps should be King Pizza. Never would I think Toronto would have top notch pizza but this place is world class! I was just looking for a late night snack and found it based on distance to my hotel on Yelp.   I would describe it as Neapolitan in its thickness but the crust is something special. It has a slightly sour doughy taste the closest dough would be Bay Cities amazing sandwich bread in Santa Monica. Having had some of the best Neapolitan pizzas throughout Italy this one was still something incredible. As a comparison five days earlier I had Roberta's at the Culver City Pop up location which this pizza beats hands down. For comparison I had the King Taps Bee Sting pizza which similar to the Bee Sting at Roberta's except King Taps had olives on there pizza. It's basically a soppresseta pizza with honey drizzle.   Also grabbed there cucumber mule which was their take on a Moscow Mule and that was great too. Before I left I did sample some beers and they had some excellent local beers which I would definitely come back for.   At the end of my meal I was so impressed that I had to tell both the wait staff and manager how good the pizza was both were nice and friendly and super helpful.   In case you are wondering yes this is as good or better than some of the well known NY pizzerias and I've made it a point to try at least the top 20 places in NYC."}
{"text":"I've been here many times and the food, drinks, and service are always great (shoutout to Cynthia in particular for her amazing service!). Yes, it's always packed, but the vibe is always great and you can easily make a reservation which is a rarity in this city. It's my go-to for after work drinks, and my favourite pizza in the city."}
{"text":"Great selection of beer and the staff were very attentive and friendly. Went with a friend for dinner and drinks and we were not disappointed. I would definitely recommend the Bianca pizza. Only complaint is that they were out of quite a few of the rotating taps, however there were plenty of other beers to choose from. It was super busy when we arrived, 7:45 on Thursday night, but we had reservations so we walked right in and were seated right away. We definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"A whole bunch of beer to drink. I love beer. Too bad we got harassed to death to order food (at the bar no less). What's the point of offering so many beers when you won't even allow me to enjoy my first one??? No exaggeration here: at least 3 different people (one is a manager) asking us if we decided on food, multiple times each, in the space of 10-12 minutes. I can understand that you want to turnover restos real fast during a lunch rush.... but hey Gang... I'm at the bar. When I'm hungry I'll wave my hand or something. Sheesh. Relentless. On a positive note, the beef dip was satisfactory."}
{"text":"There truly wasn't anything bad I could say about my experience here. For a spot full of weeknight suits, I thought maybe this place was all hype... I hate being wrong, but in this case, it felt so good to be so wrong.  I grabbed a couple mojitos and shared the crispy chicken burger and the Stinging Bee pizza with my friend... Oh my dear sweet flavourful god.   The mojito: I couldn't believe what I was tasting. Expertly mixed, perfectly sweet, brought out quickly and with not so much ice as to feel stingy on the ingredients.  Chicken burger: basically a gourmet McChicken. High praise coming from someone who has an unhealthy McChicken fixation. Generous cut of meat, not too saucy, held together by an incredibly tasty and fresh bun.  The pizza: my groans of sheer delight punctuated by the occasional profanity do not do it justice. The flavours of honey, olives, and salami are not ones I'd ever deign to mash together, but King Taps seriously got this one right. The crust on this pizza truly lives up to the hype too. Think an airy, delicate, buttery, crispy kinda crust.  Oh yeah. You know you want it.  Service was efficient and accurate, and we were not pressured to leave once we stopped ordering drinks and commenced girl talk (which for the first 15 minutes after plates were cleared was centred around just how amazing the meal had been). This is because, after the dinner rush, the place slows down juuuuust enough for there to be available tables for any straggling walk-ins. They could've been pushy about us overstaying our welcome and I would've understood, but the staff was nothing if not completely welcoming. Major kudos to 'em.  My other friend had the beef tacos and barely stopped to breathe between bites so I THINK that counts as a thumbs up?  Listen, if you rate this place poorly because you didn't manage to snag a table, that's on you. Call at least a week in advance for your reservations and you'll be fine. In fact, you'll be better than fine."}
{"text":"Great food amazing atmosphere. Good date spot I got the pizza and fish tacos would definitely recommend . Right downtown amazing location"}
{"text":"Really like this place. It's a Cactus Club spin off (same owners) and done pretty right. Food quality and execution is about the same as a Cactus.  I've been here a couple times on work days (get here early to avoid lines after work), but at the end of a week stay in Toronto I decided to check out their Weekend \"House Party\". All day Sunday they have half priced pizza as well as 2-5 every other day. Also 60+ or so beers on tap.  The gorgeous and engaging staff don't always hit it out of the park on product knowledge, but they are more than just pretty faces in terms of hospitality and helping with the good times! The hostess team seem unusually snobby in person and on the phone. The too cool for school attitude needs to STOP, as Cactus Club learned years back.  Food: I had the Serrano Ham Pizza, and the Forager Pizza. The crust was really great and the edges almost had a \"crackling\" exterior, best way I can describe it. The Serrano pizza had an okay amount of Serrano ham, grana padano, and dressed arugula. There could have been a bit more fior de latte and san marzano sauce, and it also could have been warmer, despite the fact that the arugula and ham get added at the end... I ate half since I had another pizza coming. The Forager Pizza was next and upon arrival I asked which types of mushrooms were on it and everyone was a bit stumped, as was the manager guy on shift. The lovely Audrey finally asked the kitchen and advised it was Creminis, Shimejis, buttons, and one other that escapes my recollection. The truffle creama could've used a touch more truffle, but then again I ordered extra mush, so who knows if that threw it off balance.  The room is tight, love it, the music (often live) is one of my favourite things too. I remember a looping artist on one night who was covering old school hip hop and was blown away by his talent, and that stuff sells, as I had atleast 2 more old fashioned just to hear his renditions of tribe called quest, jamiroquai and others."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, service and management needs attention. I know it must be hard to run such a large operation but the first impression of coming in being put on a list then taken to our table was not very nice..... Then even though we waited for a table for 4 we got to our table to find only 2 chairs. When we asked for the other 2 chairs we were told by our server Ill see what i can do we're very busy.... Hmmm interesting... Eventually this got sorted out and we ordered several share plates for the table.. Everything was good nothing to rave about... Elevated bar food is how I would describe the food here. If you like a busy place for some drinks and some nibbles try this place out. If you are serious about food and service not so much..."}
{"text":"Excellent location and atmosphere (indoor /outdoor). Great pizzas (stinging bee).  Would have liked more cheese on the nachos.  Great beer options on the tap.  Service was excellent as well!"}
{"text":"Good sports bar with DJ playing some retro tunes.  Beer selection was good with 60 or so options.  The food was ok. The wings were small but you get a good amount. The Cobb salad was delicious.   Biggest draw back was the artificial wait to make them seem busy. We were told 30 min so we got a beer while we saw tables open, within 12 min we were seated.  We saw this happen to most people."}
{"text":"My group had a terrible experience here! If we could find a table at another restaurant under such short notice we would have.   We had made a reservation online weeks before. When we went to the front desk, the girl had problems finding it. It took her several minutes so a co-worker of mine tried to find it for her on her screen. He was then told to step back to the other side of the desk. We were all shocked at her attitude. This was within minutes of our experience at this restaurant and was indicative of what was to come the rest of the night.   We were then shown to our table for 7. A booth seat that could only comfortably seat 5. 2 of those at our table had to be crammed at the side of the table. This was booked far in advance, why they didn't reserve a larger table for us is beyond me. Here we are sitting at a tiny table for 7 people while others had a tables far larger for a much smaller party. The planning was terrible!  When we were placing our ordered, a member of the party indicated she was allergic to onions so we wanted to make sure there won't be any. She assured us that there aren't any onions in or order......there's only green onions... she didn't seem to believe us when we told her she's allergic to onions. My nervous co-worker lost confidence in her answer and just stayed away from that dish entirely.   This was the first and last time we will be going to kings tap.   p.s. I ordered the steak and prawn. They gave me tiny shrimps and charged me 60 dollars for it. I should have gone to the keg and had better steak for half the price."}
{"text":"This place is the real deal!  I have never dined in, only ordered as a take away 3 seperate times, and every time I try a new pizza (or two) from they're menu.  The pizzas are light and incredible tasting, and their signature pizzas are unique but worthy flavour-combos. My favourite so far is a tie between the Forager and the Stinging Bee pizza.  Although I've never dined in, the place is packed with bar goers every time I'm there. It seems most people are there for the drinks (at least late at night when I go) but they're food is totally on point and highly recommended by this food junkie.  Again, I can't comment on the dining-in service, but from all the service I've encountered through ordering and picking up, it has been excellent."}
{"text":"We have been meaning to try out this spot for some time now and so finally made the reservations and decided to check it out last night. I would give this place a five star rating but taking a star away because of the hostess at the front.  When we first arrived, the hostess seemed super confused and could not find our name. Even when I showed her our confirmation and the text confirmation that said they had a table ready for us. Despite this, she insisted we were on a waitlist.  I spelled out my name for her and phone number almost 4 times. She was not warm and seemed very nonchalant about the mishap. She finally gave up, called a server who then took us to a free table. We were quiet annoyed by this and by her lack of apology and sincerity at what had happened.   BUT, once seated, we could not have asked for a better experience! Our server was fabulous! She went above and beyond to recommend dishes and drinks to us, checked up on us and always, always had a smile on her face. She was so sweet! The food was also incredible!! We had the forrager pizza, minimacks and chicken tacos. The minimacks were great, the chicken tacos (some of the best I have had) were topped with this amazing corn aioli which blew our minds! The pizza, literally, was the one of the best pizzas I have had in the city. The truffle riccota cream added such a nice flair to the dish and we are still raving about it. The beer selection is quiet good and the vibe is super chill, semi-casual and fun! Would definitely recommend :)"}
{"text":"Great spot for happy hour. Went the first weekend they were open in July 2017. Great service and selection of beers. Only caveat is that its gotten really popular so wait times can get steep. Otherwise, no other complaints. Try their pizza!"}
{"text":"Came here to celebrate a birthday. I had made reservations - well in advance to be sure we'd get a table.  When I arrived there, I was really surprised by the size of table they had for such a large group.  It hardly fit all of us in a small booth and I was practically standing while eating my dinner.  I was a little disappointed considering I had made reservations.  The restaurant was nice.. they have 2 levels - the first floor was closed off for a private event and upstairs was the dining area with a full sized barand the kitchen was all open.  The lighting in the restaurant was dark and they had tv all along the bar area.  I did notice there was a lot more men than women in the restaurant.  Our waitress came to greet us right as we sat down and I started off with a beer that she suggested and Nachos to share.  The waitress came back with the beers a couple minutes later and I tried mine and wasn't a fan but I drank it anyways, because beer is beer.  For my main, I decided to try the \"Stinging Bee\" - Soppressata Salami, Kalamata Olives, Mozza, Calabrian Honey. It was really delicious! It had a soft thick crust and the honey worked well, surprisingly.  I'd have to say their pizzas are on the pricer side, considering they were individual sized.  Halfway through dinner, I decided to order another beer.  Half an hour later, I still didn't have my beer and the waitress never ended up getting it.  Second disappointment of the night. She did check up on us often but she didn't offer us any desserts at the end.  Overall, I'd have to say the service was mediocre since it was a busy Friday night, but the food was good and the ambience is very chilled and laid back with good music.  I would highly recommend coming here for a Guys Night to have a beer and watch sports or if you want fresh oven-baked pizza.  May or may not be back again, I guess we'll see!"}
{"text":"Came here on a date on a Saturday night.  Crazy busy, but got seated within 15 mins . Its a very live vibe here , busy, loud (but you can still speak to your partner without screaming) , great music. Similar vibe to Cactus .   The service was pretty great despite the fact that they were crazy busy. They have enough staff out on the floor , which is great.   We were there mainly for drinks, but got the forager pizza which was delicious! If youre a mushroom person, u want this.  My phone was dead so unfortunately no visuals.   Patio looks beautiful, cant wait to come in the summer.   Will be back!!"}
{"text":"This bars general demographic is the after work crowd of king st, which is fine, but the overall vibe I got from the place was snobby or stuck up maybe? I feel like king taps would have done so much better, in terms of its feel, if it were in the west end of The downtown core, could have been a trendy hipster spot, but hey what do I know. Wasn't exactly impressed by the quality of their food either. Just your typical bar finger foods nothing special or new. Seemed to be lacking spark. They do have a fairly nice selection of beers though, that was a plus.Over all a mediocre experience, hence the mediocre review."}
{"text":"A work culture (cocktail hour) after 4pm, this place has great music! The pizza was really similar to the one you get at True True (pizza place). It's authentic. The Forager was an amazing vegetarian option. Sadly no dipping sauce to go with the pizza.   Our waitress seemed slow to get us glasses for water and took a while to just check up on us. Think we can improve on customer service. I had to ask two random hostesses passing by to get us a refill or an extra glass, etc."}
{"text":"Hump day is our day to head out for group lunch, my friends at work asked me to select a restaurant. After reading all the good reviews, I really wanted to give it a try.  Ordered the: Forager ROASTED MUSHROOMS, KALE, TRUFFLE-RICOTTA CREAM, GRANA PADANO.  18  Amazing. Basically I was sharing pizza with two friends as I wanted to try two different toppings. My friend asked to swap another slice of the prawn and pesto for my Forager. It was so tasty that I didn't want to swap. From the truffle flavour to the crust. The salt went well on it and doesn't taste greasy.  Prawn and Pesto ROASTED PRAWNS, FETA, OVEN-DRIED GRAPE TOMATOES, BABY KALE, PESTO. 19  Crispy sushi SEARED RARE ALBACORE TUNA, CRISPY SUSHI RICE, AVOCADO, YUZU EMULSION. 13.5  Everything was fresh. The chilli oil was very tasty. Fell in love with the Forager pizza and will definitely be back. Service was way better than many self proclaimed fine dine restaurants. Next time I will come back and order the whole pizza for myself!"}
{"text":"WHERE DO I BEGIN?  Well for starters, I'd like to thank Yelp and King Taps for hosting an amazing Elite Event. It was my first time attending an event with the full experience.  I really didn't know what to expect coming here other than the background info I received from other reviews. I must say it was far more than I could have imagined.  1) Ambiance: (5/5) Spacious, modern, trendy, and patio. All you need to know.   2) Service: (5/5) The waitress Nina, I believe that was her name, was beyond helpful and kind. She really went out of her way to service my friend and I when it came to ordering drinks. Not only was she really consistent with her assistance but also very polite when checking up on us.  3) Food: (4.5/5) The unique flavours are beyond my palette - but that's a good thing. I was able to try dishes such as Crispy Sushi, Bang Bang Shrimp to Margarita Pizza. Everything that came out was delicious. However, I believe there were some listed i was excited to try, but it never made it out of the kitchen. Although, that didn't ruin my experience. I was very happy with the different flavours and wide range of options provided. It definitely encourages me to come back to King Taps!  4) Beers: (4/5) We were told the beers were exclusively for King Taps!  - To start we tried the Mango Guava: more on the sour side - East Coast Lager: light beer with a tangy after taste (still pretty good) - Pale Ale: probably my favourite because it was the smoothest and best tasting (coming from someone who loves Keith's and Stella)  5) Patio: (4.5/5) Spacious with umbrellas and heated fires for those cooler nights. Overlooks King street and has amazing service for they provide you with blue blankets to keep warm!! That's something I've never seen before.  King Taps really went above and beyond for not only the event, but for all their customers. I found that everyone who had left, left with a smile and positive things to say. I most certainly will recommend this gem of a restaurant. Probably will find myself back here with more uplifting things to say!"}
{"text":"Excellent all around!  Great atmosphere, great surroundings, excellent service.  Pepperoni pizza and the crunchy chicken sandwich were excellent.  Fries were just the way I like them.  We went for a mid-week lunch, and were in and out in under an hour.  Perfect, as we had to get back to work.  Can't wait to go again -- next time, for a more leisurely dinner!"}
{"text":"Went for drinks and some appetizers. We were 4 in the table and we ordered 4 margaritas and a pepperoni pizza. Pizza and margaritas were good, service was slow and not friendly. 3 stars for poor service"}
{"text":"There's been a lack of great bars in the financial district. The ambiance, art work and music were top knotch when we visited on a Friday night. The amount of beers of tap and the variety of cocktails were pretty good. I thought their old fashioned was quite decent. Pizza seemed a bit pricey. I ordered the margherita pizza and the forager pizza. The forager pizza tasted like the pizza version of mushroom soup. The margherita pizza was pretty good. Would recommend either pizza.  I hope this place continues to do well! P.S please keep the music guy"}
{"text":"4.5 - I'm really impressed by this place!   I brought my friend from out of town here because I wanted to show her somewhere hip and fun. King Taps definitely encompasses these two things.  I've been here twice: once in the summer and again last night, Each time the food, drinks and service was great. The place has a great atmosphere but it can get pretty noisy, so if you're looking for something a little more intimate this might not be the place. Great place to start off your night (or finish it, depending on the mood you're in). Everytime I pass by it's always busy.  Last night my friend and I arrived around 8 and had to sit at the bar. Not complaining because they put the Raptors game on for me. They also had a special on wine, half off a bottle!  Naturally, me and my friend ended up splitting two bottles (very happy with this deal!). The bartender was very attentive even though she had a full bar and the food didn't take long to come out.   Each time I come here I order the pizza. It is honestly one of the best pizza's in the city; thin crust with a pretzel-like, chewy crust. I ordered the Forager (which I am still craving today - highly recommend!) and my friend ordered the Serrano.   I will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"best pizza in toronto, awesome beer selection, great any day of the week. reservations recommended."}
{"text":"Had a great first impression when I came here on a Tuesday night. Nice, clean and modern decor and quite spacious. Two-storey patio which is great for the summer! Very busy for a weekday so there was actually a wait list for the patio but since the place is very open concept, still got the patio vibe even though we officially weren't sitting out on it.   The DJ that night was awesome as well. Loved all the songs and mixes he was spinning. Nachos were awesome for our after-dinner meal (before you judge, it was a Summerlicious meal from somewhere else that didn't have the biggest serving sizes). Our server was super nice and gracious too. Despite it being busy, we still felt very attended to.  Overall it had a great vibe with lots of the Financial District crowd. I'd definitely come back with friends."}
{"text":"Love this newly opened spot to grab a beer after a long shift at work. I ordered a beer flight when I visited and loved it! The place has beautiful layout and ambiance! Comparable to Earls, Cactus club. Etc."}
{"text":"I've been dying to come to King Taps as it seems to be a hot place in Toronto now. I have to say the ambiance is classy, upscale yet subtle easy-going. It's complicated and everyone here looks very attractive which is intimidating. I'm not basing the review on the people watching though! I'm giving it three stars because the lower floor of the restaurant is very squishy, tight and feels like you don't have space when you're eating. I think there were a few items that make it hard to relax and enjoy your meal here.  I ordered the pizza and calamari which are alright. The crust on their pizza is salted perfectly with some extra seasoning, making it very unique. It has a thick crust around the edge but the actual pizza is thin crust, so that's interesting. The calamari is not fried nice because it did end up being a little soggy as well as the vegetables. There seems to be more cool places to hang out in the downtown core with just alright food.  Also be prepared to wait for a table which is common but the bar area is a little small so the wait in uncomfortable!"}
{"text":"Myself and a buddy visited King Taps just for a quick bite and drink and originally only wanted the bar. We were told by the hostess that the bar was first come first serve but when we arrived at the bar there were no seats and tables. Although we couldn't find a spot around the bar it was only until Sabrina came up to us and offered to sit us at a table. We told her we were only here for a quick stop and told us she had the perfect spot for us that we were very happy at. Very accommodating and very friendly. Service was great, Stinging bee pizza is absolute heaven and a must try with a huge selection of beers on tap.  Will be back especially during patio season."}
{"text":"King Taps has great tasting food and nice second floor with a patio area perfect for summer. The calamari and brusselsprout appetizers were both done well, although it would be nice if it came with a few more sprouts. For main course I had the chicken club which was definitely above average and I really like their fries especially compared to other similar restaurants. They also had a half price wine special the night I visited which worked out well. I look forward to returning and trying the pizza."}
{"text":"The food was a sweet little treat...but i hadn't eaten in days to be honest. Also haven't been doing much sleeping... but its June, right...so like who gives a shit.   The loud mouth soups were super cold,....so thats also a good thing I would imagine. Arjeta made my cheeks hurt, cause I smiled a lot....so that could be taken as a good or bad thing depending on how you prefer your cheeks while trying to chill out. I was ok with it.   I would consider her for upper management or ownership. In fact, if I come to find out that she hasnt been given a substantial raise, I will revise this review.   I didnt get her last name....and i would imagine that there are probably multiple Arjetas that work there. Shes short, and prefers dry cab sauv."}
{"text":"A great place for business lunch, team gatherings or hanging out with friends over happy hour! We were there for our Christmas lunch and ordered the prix fixe menu.  The ambience was chic and hip, and it truly is a posh and modern pub!   I ordered the tuna sushi over fried sushi rice... and when it was presented, it was awesome! The plating over a small cheese board was brilliant and the three bite size sushi tasted great and the perfect finger food!    The main was a salmon risotto. The portion was perfect and tasted very well. Salmon was done perfectly, medium. And risotto was not too thick.  The final entree was dessert. I had high expectations after the first two dishes but the rocky road icecream did not have marshmallows. A big no no to claim the name.   Finally, the service was really great! Our server was very patient with our large group, courteous and friendly.   A must go if you are at the downtown core!! Two thumbs up!!"}
{"text":"Went for the first time yesterday for dinner and drinks. Great environment, very lively, crowd pleasing music. Food, drinks, and service were all great. A nice girl named Emily showed my friend and I around when we asked to take a peak upstairs, she really went above and beyond to make us feel welcome ."}
{"text":"awful service. from the phone calls to being grated and putting my name down. the hostess could never tell me how long they anticipate the wait to be. the very first time i called for a wait inquiry, she basically told me it'll be so packed, so full ... so are you telling me to not come?  when we arrived and put my name down, the next hostess again, was unclear. said i just have to wait and see. we sat at a booth that sears maybe 5 people comfortably ... when the party was for 7, had to let the server know again that we were 7.  we came for the pizzas since they're apparently known for their pizza. and thankfully that didn't disappoint. i had the stinging pee pizza which was great, soppressata salami, kalamata olives, mozzarella, drizzled with Calabrian honey. definitely good pizza, i recommend it. our server was okay.   i hope that was just an off day. as the first point of contact, the hostesses definitely need to ensure customers actually look forward to their visit. not sure i'll be racing to come back."}
{"text":"This is right across from my work so it was a last min thing, came with my girlfriends on a Tuesday early evening and we stayed till around 930...it gets so busy right after work...the patio was very nicely laid out..with many seats..but it definitely fills up very quickly for happy hour...  Thankfully, one of my girlfriends arrived around 430 and we got a table on the nice patio..i liked the fact that there was a variety of beers available to choose from (+1 star) many of which i haven't tried before so that was interesting...after a few beers, we ended up ordering a bottle of wine, we chose 2 different kinds and didn't like both of them but the manager was super nice and offered us to choose a different bottle..great service (+ 1 star) usually alot of places will give attitude when they open the one and not end up buying the bottles they open so that is definitely a plus...  we ended up ordering 2 different types of pizza, delicious and thin crusted pizza was delish! calamari was an A-Ok, had much better elsewhere, dirty bread was pretty good but a bit on the oily side...korean chicken didn't really scream delicious, just average..  All in all, I'm gonna be here for happy hour without a doubt...=)"}
{"text":"Came here to watch the soccer game!  Luckily was seated on the 2nd floor - it's a very large restaurant, 2 floors and a patio!  Located in the financial district, I can see how it would be very busy around 11:30-1pm-ish for the lunch crowd.  Luckily by 2pm it was about 1/3 full.  They have 2-5pm specials - half price pizzas and some $5 beers!  We ordered the mushroom pizza (DELICIOUS) and the prawn pizza - pretty interesting, but the mushroom pizza is the winner winner pizza dinner here!  The drinks were flowing, the game was on, but unfortunately the service was sllllllllloooooooooooooowwwwwww.   Which was odd b/c there were way more staff than customers at this point.  But it took quite a while to order our food.  I'd still come back for that pizza though!"}
{"text":"I came to King Taps on Saturday with a friend and had a great time! Whether you are there to watch the game or to socialize with friends this place is a great option in the financial district. The staff was very friendly and attentive, and the food was great! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I've visited several times and I will probably continue to come since it's in financial district. It's so convenient to come after work to get a drink.   Most times I've visited I didn't have to wait long despite how busy this place can get. Probably because there is plenty of seating. I love coming for the patio on the top floor. It looks beautiful at night. It's a nice spot to socialize or while on a date.   The service is adequate. Nothing over the top.   In terms of food and drinks, nothing stood out. It's average bar food/drinks. Nothing spectacular. I will still continue to come since they have tons of patio seating whereas there is probably a queue for getting patio seats elsewhere in financial district."}
{"text":"Such a cool place. Food was good, drinks were great, the music was killer. I'll be back next time I'm in Toronto."}
{"text":"Decent beer selection, although more tilted towards local craft beer selections versus \"beers of the world\". Food portions and menu prices are commensurate with what you pay downtown these days. That is too much for a simple burger and fries and fries amount to a dixie cup. Not a fault of the venue. Blame rents.   Service is also commensurate with the downtown upscale pub experience. Decent, professional.    Despite Bay/King traditionally being dead on the weekend, this place was actually quite hopping Saturday."}
{"text":"Love King Taps! It's in the perfect location for lunch or after work drinks as it's in the heart of the finical district. That being said it's full of suits.   I normally make a reservation if I know I'm going two days in advance though they are great with walk ins.   Make sure and hit the happy hour! Before 5PM and again after 10PM.   The food, atmosphere and service are all outstanding!"}
{"text":"I tried to get into King Taps for a drink after going to the CNE with my boyfriend. Some bouncer-type dude at the door straight up lied to us saying they were at capacity and it would be over an hour wait. We saw a ton of empty tables but there were still enough people eating and getting drinks that it didn't look like they were rushing trying to close. Plus it was a quarter to ten so I didn't buy that there was magically a bunch of reservations that hadn't shown up yet. The only reason I could think of for why they turned us away was that we were dressed casually, but after we went to Cactus Club (which I think has a more upscale/bougie vibe) this was no problem and they actually treated us like people. Plus Cactus Club was MUCH busier than King Taps but they were still willing to accommodate us.  I hate being that person that gives 1 star reviews without even getting to set foot inside the place, but they didn't give me a chance to give them my business and after that experience, I definitely won't bother."}
{"text":"2 places I call the best pizza in Toronto. If you want a deep dish pizza then it would be Descendent on Queen East. If you want thin crust, then it's definitely King Taps!!! Man oh man the pizza here is highly addictive, I've tried all of them and enjoyed all of them. Staff here has always been friendly and personable."}
{"text":"Came at 2pm for the half price pizza special (2-5pm and 10pm to close). Great deal! The pizzas are thin but with a thick crust which is great for dipping in the garlic mayo. I tried the Forager (mushroom & kale) - it had a slight hint of truffle and a slightly sour balsamic vinegar type taste. The Bianca (cream sauce, caramelized onions, fennel sausage) was more flavourful and my pick out of the two - great combination of flavours.   Must make reservations! This place is always packed."}
{"text":"NOISY! If you are looking for a quiet evening out THIS IS NOT THE PLACE. I was hoarse by the end of the evening yelling at my dinner companions. Had the King burger which was OK. The Dulce & Peanut Sundae could have used much more Ducle and once you got past the top layer there wasnt much else left other than Vanilla ice cream.  This place was chosen for a birthday dinner by someone seduced by the good reviews but I wouldnt choose it again. On the positive side our server was GREAT and we even gave her an enhanced tip. THe reception desk on the other hand seemed a little lost in space (all 3 of them)."}
{"text":"Let start off, I'm here for the game on a Sunday. Worst staff at the bar. I'll give you credit, your food is good; although it took a REALLY long time to even get their attention to place an order in the first place. So I found it disrespectful when when they took everyone ELSE'S order and (I'm not sure if intentional) but skipped me. Let's just say I had to wait another while til my friend just helped me order too. Embarrassing, for myself to say. Moving on, they ran out of beer....OUT OF BEER. How are..you the king of taps if...anyways, again the food was pretty good but it's just a shame that their customer service sucks."}
{"text":"It's a shame that they have the music so loud. It is hard to hear people across your table. They have so many beers on tap it's great - not so happy about the wine glasses (there are none)."}
{"text":"I've had a great time here so far, it's a go-to spot for my boyfriend and I when we're craving for some delicious beers. They have great choices of rotating taps (the lavender one is my favourite, don't exactly remember what it was called and stouts are also a great choice, just avoid fruity ones). As for food, it is a bit pricey but you are in the financial district after all. If you're grabbing food as well, I recommend any of their pizza. There was always a wait but they weren't long, we're fortunate to have had friendly servers, and it's located in the first canadian place, it's hard to miss it!"}
{"text":"Went to king taps for the first time. Not impressed. We ordered an appetizer and 2 entrees and got them both at the same time. When we mentioned it to our waitress she thought that was odd but never offer to take away the entrees until we were ready for them. I also think she wanted them entered before the 2pm discount but we didn't even know about it until after we left. She then took our appetizer without asking if we were done. Not impressed. The food was ok. The crust on the pizza was way to puffy. Didn't eat any of the crust. Overall not impressed and probably won't be back. There are many great restaurants so if they don't appreciate the customer experience, I wouldn't go back. Like who serves the appetizer with the entrees!!!!"}
{"text":"King Taps is the place for after work drinks and a casual meal. A few notes...  1. Bankers. Accountants. Business professional crowd. Suits. Not a hipster place. 2. Go early or try to get a reservation. Even though the place is modern and big, it attracts a crowd. 3. $3.50 craft beers (a selection of 4) on Monday nights. Half-priced wines on Tuesday. 4. Lots of beer choices.  5. Food is elevated pub food. The Hawaiian pizza is delicious and damn near perfect. The Bang-Bang shrimp is also a good choice, though the portion is small. For a bigger side to share, opt for the calamari. 5. Service is quite good. Very attentive.  All-in-all, a really enjoyable place to meet friends after work or to get a sense of that scene."}
{"text":"Friends were visiting from Vancouver -- being the intrepid explorers that they are, they booked a table at Cactus Club... (sigh).  So, not really wanting to go to Cactus Club -- I Yelped and found a nearby beer bar with a legit looking tap list... a beer bar directly behind Cactus Club.  So I wrangled the early arrivals and we went over to King Taps for a beer while we waited.  So we roll by and there's doormen, attractive waitstaff, an area cordoned off for a line... peering inside, it was the typical Financial District crowd and inside a restaurant-aspiring-to-be-a-club vibe.  Ugh.  Not my thing, but I talked everyone into this, so I'll soldier it out.  We ask for a table for 3 - they ask for a number and promise to text me back when a table is available.  We are escorted to the upstairs bar and we grab a beer while we wait.  As I'm finishing up my beer, I get the text, bound downstairs and am told someone will grab our party from the bar when our table is ready.  I go back upstairs, settle the bar tab and we are all looking blankly at each other with our empty glasses as we wait.  And wait.  So I go back downstairs and politely remind the host we're still waiting before we get a patio seat.  Not a great start.  But the second-floor patio was really nice - surrounded by all the lights of neighbouring skyscrapers and a great vantage point.  The old martial arts movie fight scenes they were playing in black & white on the monitors were oddly hypnotic.  The beer list is pretty legit with a lot of local craft beer selections on their 50 taps.  And King Taps has a few collaboration beers with local breweries (Rainhard, Creemore, Muskoka & Batch) which were price at $5 each the night we went.  In short, it's not your typical craft beer bar -- it's bringing the craft beer scene to the Financial District crowd.  No hipster waitresses and beer belly bartenders here - it's a place to use your business account while ogling the waitstaff.  Our waitress was excellent - but I must admit it's bit awkward watching her fumble with the beer names and search for the beers as she punched our orders into her tablet computer.  Definitely not a place where you can ask the staff for their opinion on the beers and expect a competent response.  But if you overlook this, the tap list is excellent.  And we did overlook this as we called an audible and just decided to stay at King Taps rather than head back to Cactus Club for the reservation.  The other part of our group joined us on the King Taps patio after they finished up their dinner at CC.  Pizzas are 1/2 price after 11 and the $9.50 Prawn & Presto pizza we had was a steal.  Nice, chewy crust and good amount of salt for some beer drinking.  Later in the night, my tourist friends heard from someone that Drake was in the house.  Bleh.  We asked our waitress and she said he 'probably' was around because he's been there about 4 nights in the past week.  Later, I came to find out King Taps is actually owned by Cactus Club.  Hence all the similarities in ambiance and hiring practices.  Can't hate on them for riding the craft beer wave and they did a decent job with some minor missteps.  Overall, not my first choice for a beer bar.  But if I'm the area and looking for some beers on a nice patio, I might brave the potential 'club line-ups' and running into Wheelchair Jimmy to come here again.  Not bad."}
{"text":"Dropped by for a pizza and dessert. The pizza was a Hawaiian with drizzled yogurt. The pizza texture and taste is like thin crust version of Pizza Hut. Quite tasty, probably unhealthy, but a lot less oil and flour than Pizza hut.  Strawberry sundae was good, but absolutely nothing surprising about it. Pretty expensive at 8 dollars.  They played good music, which is important because it's relatively loud. Appropriately, because it's a bar, but not so loud that it was difficult to talk. On a Sunday afternoon we heard: Fleetwood Mac, Eric Clapton, Bill Withers, etc. Much better than I expected.  Lots of good TVs. It might be a good place to watch The Game, but I don't know if they put the sound on."}
{"text":"Be prepared to wait. I came on a Tuesday after work and there was a large crowd of people and a waitlist situation happening. Thankfully, King Taps has their business in order. You give your number to the front desk, and you will get a text when your table is available. In the meantime, grab a beer from the bar (there is a whole wall of beer taps that covers the back of the bar) and mill around with the crowd. The staff was friendly and made sure I had everything I needed, even grabbed me a stool at the bar when it came free (I was in heels). Once you get your text, pay the tab at the bar and get back to the front desk.  The situation on the second floor is much of the same. It's crowded but people are now crammed around tables. We were seated next to a booth that had overflowed into the central isle so we got jostled frequently as patrons and staff walked past us. Trying to ignore the seating issue, we got a pizza on our waitress' recommendation and continued to enjoy their beers. The Kona pizza is their take on the Hawaiian and it was good, fresh toppings with a chewy crunchy crust. We had the Sierra salad to balance out all the beer and pizza, which was as described but also forgettable.  Great beer, good pizza but crazy crowded. Be prepared to be rubbing elbows with the post work crowd."}
{"text":"Beer selection and atmosphere amazing! Smoked olives were memorable. Burrata salad was lovely. Chicken tacos were nothing special_ the slaw was incredibly acidic. Service was great after a bit of a run around with the hostess not knowing how to find our table and us having to follow her up and down the stairs around the restaurant"}
{"text":"Went there for a team lunch, atmosphere was nice, hostess was friendly and knowledgeable, and the food was great. Half price pizza on Tuesday from 2 to 5"}
{"text":"Delicious food. We got the brussel sprouts and the margarita pizza. Both were amazing. The atmosphere was great. The music was great too."}
{"text":"The food was good so why am I giving this restaurant one star? I came in by myself. They wanted me to sit at the bar. I asked  for a table. They told me there are no tables available EVEN THOUGH I could clearly see there were tables available. They told me those tables were reserved. I watched throughout my entire meal. No one was seated at those tables. Why?? Because I'm ONE GUEST. Toronto, your money isn't good enough at this establishment if you walk in as one guest. Will I come here again? Absolutely not."}
{"text":"a resto-bar-lounge in the financial district boasting tons of beers  i came in for beer some time around ten o'clock uh, p.m. of course  quite the loud ambiance clubby-loungey vibe.  it's just... not for me i guess  waitstaff punch orders into their apple ipads looks kinda awkward  standard beer pricing 'round seven to eight a pint great local choices  some late night specials such as demi-priced pizza might be worth trying  you'd prob' find me at beerbistro just down the street but hey, that's just me"}
{"text":"So I actually came back for food, and it surprisingly did not disappoint. We got the steak and the grilled cheese, which were good, the ingredients were fresh, and the meals well prepared. The soup was a little too salty, but otherwise it was a good meal.   The drinks were excellent, we ordered margaritas (definitely get the flavoured ones as they come with macerated fruit at the bottom and the classic lime slush! Apparently there was alcohol in them, but I didn't taste anything. Their other mixed drinks were also good, albeit slightly sweeter than I would have expected (so ask for no simple syrup if you like the subtle flavours of the description ingredients).  What really sets them high is their fantastic service. This place is crawling with people, and the servers behind the bar are constantly being harangued by group after group of people, along with the table orders. They are prompt, and equally serve everyone efficiently. What's more all of the attractive ladies behind the bar do tireless work in flirting back with the throngs of men, while still doing their jobs. One of the drinks we ordered (a bourbon something sour), was just not to our taste, and our waitress took it off our bill without our asking saying \"no one should have to pay for something they didn't like or drink\" which was a really nice touch!   ASIDE: My mom came here with a girlfriend and some dillweed knocked over their wine glasses onto their pizzas when he swung his jacket around to put it on. Instead of being a gentlemen and offering to buy their next round, or anything of that sort, he gave them a curt \"sorry\" and left. The staff had witnessed this entire situation and comped their pizzas, telling them that the guy had been a jerk, and they were sorry that that had happened to them."}
{"text":"I like the atmosphere there, always lively and lots of people every day. I tried 2 dark beers there which is already a plus because not many places carry dark beer other than Guinness, sometimes not even Guinness. Pizza is alright. My friend ordered that, didn't think there was enough meat options for the pizzas on the menu as I'm a hard core carnivore. I had the tuna bowl which I liked mostly, but the fried rice cubes were a bit too dry.   Another person had the salmon risotto, that looked good and moist. The music was a bit too loud though, have to yell to talk to people beside me."}
{"text":"While visiting Toronto, we had an awesome time at King Taps. So much so that we wanted to come back for the second time. Have you ever visited a city and wanted to come back to the same restaurant multiple times? Me neither, but this place is well worth it!  On a Monday night this spot was buzzing! The music was playing, a bunch of happy patrons enjoying their drinks and food. We requested a table on the balcony but everything was booked, so we opted out to join the fun at the bar. The vibe at this place was definitely something that draws you in.  Food:  My wing Nazi got an order of spicy wings and was very pleased! He got a good sized stack and the wings were smaller than what we are used to, probably the size of what a chicken wing should be...  We also ordered two pizzas, the pepperoni and the Stinging B. Both pizzas were amazing! The dough was perfect. I couldn't handle eating a whole pizza so I finished the other half for breakfast the next day. Felt like a champion! Dranks:  Refreshments included Makers Old Fashioned for the mister; Cucumber Mule and Cajun Ceasar for me. We both enjoyed our picks. Cucumber Mule was deliciously refreshing! King Taps also offers a great selection of beer on tap. Their beer list actually made me want to have some (not a beer fan). That was my absolute plan for our return. Unfortunately Toronto traffic did not allow us for the opportunity to do so, however King Taps will forever be in our heart."}
{"text":"Checked out this place on a Sunday eve and it was slammed. The staff was more than accommodating. And knew their brews.  Be sure to ask them what they prefer on the limited taps.  I would say if you are looking for a quiet place this may not be for you.  Perhaps once they have their second floor Each day has a different special.  Check the menu online"}
{"text":"Pro tip: Must go during off hours or else you will not be able to get a table.  I'm not sure why they don't seat downstairs because like other reviewers have said, there will be a massive line / wait, and a completely vacant first floor and patio.  Is this to keep the buzz hot?   Doesn't work for me, sorry.      I find the crowd less douch-y than Cactus, and the beer selection is very extensive.   Have tried two different pizza's now (Forager and Margherita) and both were incredible.  Thick bubbly crust on the border but thin throughout the rest of the pizza.  Easily able to eat an entire one!    Have also tried the Dirty Bread, Brussel Sprouts, Potato Skins and Truffle Fries.  Delish :)   Ladybug Rose and the Pizza's are both 50% off after 11 p.m."}
{"text":"We ate here last night as a group of 3 and loved it! Had a reservation which was good as it was surprisingly busy for a Sunday evening. Awesome beer selection - not cheap but lots of interesting beers, quite a few from Ontario & Quebec. I tried the Duchesse de Bourgogne which is a sour from Quebec, it was fantastic - darker and funkier than most sours, really unique. For food I had the clubhouse sandwich which was one of the best sandwiches I've had in a restaurant. Really filling with grainy bread and lots of avocado, turkey and bacon. The bacon in particular was delicious, very thin and somewhat candied. Service was friendly, slight delay waiting for server to come by to ask for bills but not a big deal. Our server also brought the wrong side for one of us but she corrected it and we got the right fries pretty quickly. Overall a good dinner, looking forward to going back!"}
{"text":"Great place for lunch in the financial district especially if you don't want to go outside. It is connected to the PATH and has an entrance inside First Canadian Place.  My friend had the Margarita pizza and really enjoyed it. I went for the healthy option and had the tuna bowl, which tasted great. I especially like the crispy rice thingys and the sauce. Tuna was fresh. But I think next time I'll probably go for the pizza - just look at the picture, looks amazing. The pizza had a thin-dough so one person will be able to finish the pizza for lunch.  We saw they had a lot of different beers on tap, so we will probably come back for happy hour."}
{"text":"Came into king taps on a Tuesday night, which was \"wine night\", half priced wine! We ordered stinging bee pizza and the chicken tacos and they were both excellent.  Service was also fantastic. Our server Brooke was attentive and really made our night special."}
{"text":"Hands down the best pizza place in Toronto. Half price pizzas after 11 are unbeatable in terms of value and price. I've tried the forager, serrano, pepperoni, and prawn & pesto. All excellent choices."}
{"text":"We came here on a Saturday night for a 9:30pm reservation.  Even though we booked on the phone, days before, they didn't tell us until we came that they cannot seat us until 75% of our party was there. So we did have to wait around for a bit.   After 10pm the pizzas are 1/2 price and there are tons of drink specials especially in the selection of beer. We were celebrating a birthday and they kindly accommodated us well with our birthday cake we brought.   I tried both the Strawberry and Mango Frozen Margaritas as well as two of the beers on tap. The Moscow Mules were also pretty popular at our table. Everyone at our table ordered either a Margarita or Pepperoni Pizza  and could hardly finish. They were made well, and tasted delicious.   Our server was great! she was so attentive and quick with our orders! We  asked her if they have dipping sauce to go with our pizza, but they unfortunately did not. She went above and beyond to bring us a garlic aioli that is normally served with fries, which we greatly appreciated .  Overall, this place has a great trendy vibe with great food and drinks,  the only drawback is, that seating is a bit limited, especially when you have more than 8 people with you."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Toronto!! Great any night of the week and servers are all great. We love Brooke!"}
{"text":"I came here with some co-workers around 5pm on a weekday- we had a few rounds of drinks and shared some appetizers and pizzas. Pricing is about right, leaning more on the expensive side for a restaurant of this caliber and location. The margaritas are tasty and well-made and the beer selection is impressive. The food was decent- my favorite was the mushroom pizza, very flavorful and delicious. The entire service from beginning to end was pleasant with the right amount of attentiveness. The music wasn't so loud that we couldn't have a conversation without yelling and the atmosphere was really lively. A very convenient place to come straight after work for drinks. Will definitely come back again soon!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to the bar to watch the jets games at king taps. Skye and Jess took time to get to know me, gave me some samplers and really made me feel at home WOOOO GO JETS GO!  Great service and awesome humans."}
{"text":"One thing I really like about this place is the spacing between tables. I know it's weird but it made the navigation in the restaurant easier even when it's so crowded. I find their truffle appetizers are the top food in their menu. I love truffles! And of course, the beer choices great too!"}
{"text":"Went on a Monday night (18th) at 10pm. Hostess told us to go upstairs and \"sit at the bar\". When we asked if we could sit at a table, she said the same thing \"just sit at the bar\". Went upstairs and it was empty. On the left were three round booths. One full of people, the other was just a couple sitting there. My husband and I wanted to sit together at the empty booth. The Asian manager walked over with a grumpy face and said \"you can sit at the bar\". We asked politely if it was okay to sit at the empty booth. She said \"you're only two people, you can sit at the bar or here\" (a small square high top table). We said there was a couple sitting in the other booth, why can't we? She would not stop firmly telling us to sit at the bar or small table, until we literally just sat ourself at the booth. Keep in mind there were 2-3 other empty booths on the far side of the restaurant. She walked over and told us that if a large group comes in she will ask us to move...... in other circumstances I totally get it but there were 2-3 other empty booths and what large parties are going to come there on a Monday night at 10pm? The dj was playing 80s music probably on purpose so people would leave and they could close early.  The managers attitude and negativity completely ruined our night before we even sat down there. Shouldn't you be concerned about your customers experience in the restaurant. Instead you're making a big deal about a stupid booth? Because of her we won't return... Earls is down the street, open till 2am and nicer service."}
{"text":"Great Saturday night atmosphere, and awesome food! I had the fish tacos and my husband had the pizza, both were really really good. One of those places that I can see us going back to for sure. Also our waitress Ana was really really nice!"}
{"text":"I had supper this evening at King Taps.  They just opened about about month ago.  There was a half hour wait for a table so I sat at the bar.  They have over 50 beers on tap but because I'd spend the afternoon at a beer festival, I was beered-out so had a rum and Coke instead.  I'll be back another time to check out the beer selection.  I ordered a Just Gimme a Pepperoni pizza ... and it was really good pizza.  There was enough cheese and pepperoni and it seemed like there was salt sprinkled on it.  The pizza dough was soft and chewy.  I'd get it again.  Sarah was my server/bartender.  She was friendly and took good care of me.  I'll be back"}
{"text":"King taps is a fairly new restaurant/bar in the financial district. It's pretty busy inside and without a reservation we sat at the bar.   The place itself is very modern but fairly generic with lots of tvs. Food was okay but not the best. I had steak frites and the steak was quite chewy and not the medium rare I had requested. The fries were pretty good though. Would not recommend this place for the food but the drinks selection is pretty good for an after works drink spot."}
{"text":"Great vibe at KT, fabulous truffle fries with my huge chicken sandwich and awesome server Kaylee G! Oh, and the $5 Caesar cocktails were delicious....I am not sure what the rim spices are on the Caesars, but we loved 'em!"}
{"text":"My friends and I came here on a Tuesday night for drinks and food. I walked in knowing we would be on a wait list because theyre usually busy. This time there was an event happening in their downstairs bar/dining area so we had to wait about an hour for a table to clear up upstair. The bar is first come first serve so we decided to grab drinks while we waited for our table. Their drink selection is huge with variety. Flights are a little overpriced so we didn't do those.  When we got seated we decided to each get a different pizza (seems to be known for their pizza) and try the calamari, also more drinks. My friends got the Serrano and Stinger(?) Pizza. I got myself the forager pizza. We shared a plate of calamari between the three but the calamari was a bit cool and soggy. Guessing they let it sit there for a bit before serving it to us? The pizzas were very delicious but too oily for my taste. Service was very friendly and the place had a good vibe."}
{"text":"King Taps is the next after-work Downtown hotspot, after Earl's, sister restaurant Cactus Club, etc.  The service here is great, not pretentious as I'll admit I expected it to be.  I had a pizza and it was also great. The crust is cripsy and bubbly and the toppings are high quality.  The only gripe I have is that we arrived at 4pm to beat the rush but still waited one hour to be seated... The whole bottom floor was empty. It seems the servers start their shift at 5 which is why we waited so long, but they could have at least told us."}
{"text":"Came here without reservation on a Friday evening after work and was able to grab three seats near the bar! We ordered a couple cider/beer to start. I really liked the kronenbourg rouge even though I'm not a big fan of beer. We ordered the Korean chicken appetizer to share. The portion was generous. The dish was very flavourful but a bit on the spicy side. For main, I got the Baja fish tacos. There were three in an order and they were amazing - so flaky and crispy (although the portion was smaller compared to my first time here). My friends ordered the king burger and shaved pork sandwich, which looked quite delicious as well. Looking forward to come back and try their pizzas."}
{"text":"2 weeks later, 500 miles apart, I'm back in the states and am missing King Taps *books flight back to Canada*  The whole establishment is phenomenal! From the business casual ambiance to the trendy atmosphere this is the place to go if you're looking for a cute night out or a casual lunch. My friend and I stumbled upon this gem while browsing the streets of Toronto. They have so many drink options it was a bit overwhelming! I stuck to my usual ~hard cider~ and it was delish (although I don't remember the name, hehe sorry!)   Okay let's get to the important part - the *PIZZA*. I'm not sure if they're 1/2 price everyday or if we just got lucky. The 4 cheese pizza with caramelized onions was delightful. The thicker crust takes you on a trip to savoy beignet paradise. Not exaggerating at ALL. Perfectly seasoned and the cheese was quality.   The servers are very attentive but if they see you're chatting with your company they won't really come around. Not sure why that happened but when we stopped talking they suddenly came.   Grab a friend, come during the lunch special and have some awesome pizza~"}
{"text":"Great service and great food... Coming from a server perspective, everything was flawless."}
{"text":"Service: came here on a busy Sunday evening, had to wait for a table, but service was very good and attentive, no complain.  Food: we ordered the Crispy Sushi appetizer, Tuna Bowl, and Forager Pizza (asked for tomato sauce to sub for the truffle cream and cheese because of my lactose intolerance, THUMBS UP that they were able to accommodate my request!)  CRISPY SUSHI - this was an interesting twist on sushi with deep fried rice base, topped with avocado, tuna, and sauce. It tasted very good, but 4 TINY bites is not worth the price imo.  TUNA BOWL - it's the same deep fried rice squares and tuna from the crispy sushi, along with other veggies on top of jasmine rice. Go for it if you want something light and healthy, but not the best choice for taste.  FORAGER PIZZA - it was about a medium size pizza. Since I asked subbed the original cream and cheese base with tomato sauce, I can't say anything on the original pizza, but it still tasted great imo! The mushrooms, kale, and the sauce were all well seasoned, on top of a thin and crispy pizza crust worked very well together, would order it again in the future!  Overall: it's a great place in the area to chill with some drinks and food, they also have sports on TV, outdoor patio, and live music on the second floor!  P.S. 1/2 price pizza on limited hours everyday and all day Sunday! Can't say no to that!"}
{"text":"food and drinks are okay. the patio is nice.   service, however, is a deal breaker for me and the service here sucks. it's needlessly slow and over-the-top snooty."}
{"text":"Love the decor and vibe here - it's fun, energetic and best of all, with around 60 beers on tap. I would however, say that most of their craft beers are really toeing the line between craft and big brew (seeing that they have Creemore on the list).  Came here with a craft beer aficionado and neither he nor I were impressed with the selection. We did not like the fact that the beer flights here are fixed (meaning you cannot choose outside of pre-selected beers), and we thought the flights were pricey at $12.  We did enjoyed the burgers that we ordered. We thought the fries that came with the burger were a bit stingy on the portion size, but otherwise quite tasty and well prepared.  Overall, it's basically A-OK for me....3 stars for the food and decor, 2 stars for their beer selection."}
{"text":"If you order a pint of beer, that's what you should get. If they use tiny little glasses then the staff should tell you. Not stare at you blankly and look confused about how our system of measurement works."}
{"text":"Went to King Taps on a Sunday, and they had great deals!! All of their rotating drafts were only $6 and they had great $3 chicken tacos and mini cheeseburger sliders. We got 3 of each and shared. Unfortunately they were out of IPA rotating drafts and the server brought us the wrong beer, otherwise a great place!!   The atmosphere was pretty good. We sat in the outdoor patio area which had a ton of heating units, so don't be detected if it is cold out. Only complaint about the atmosphere is that in the middle of eating a DJ started playing music that was SUPER loud."}
{"text":"Finally got to check out King Taps last night. We tried a few months ago, but the wait would've been 2 hours.  So we made a reservation and didn't have to wait.   I liked the ambience of the bar - it was very trendy yet comfortable and relaxed at the same time.  We were seated at a huge comfy booth. My only small issue is the music was a little too loud so it was hard to have a decent conversation that didn't involve yelling!   The food was pretty good. We ordered the margherita pizza - even the crust was very tasty and the burrata and tomato.    Service was fantastic - efficient and friendly. We didn't need to ask our waitress for items twice and were checked on regularly to see if we needed more food, drinks etc."}
{"text":"Glad to have another viable after work option in the financial district! The atmosphere is lively (and loud) and food is decent too. Overall, a fun spot to hang out with friends for some apps and drinks.  Would suggest making resos when possible because as with Cactus and Earls, it gets very busy here!"}
{"text":"My wife and I along with some friends went to Toronto last night. The ladies went to the Pink concert so we were looking for a place to go for some beers and food.  I always use Yelp. And again it did not fail. We went to King Taps based on some great reviews. This place was dynamite. Great atmosphere, incredible selection of beer, the staff was great and the pizza might be the best I've ever had. If you're in the area, it's a must stop. Amazing!"}
{"text":"I'm so impressed with King Taps! They are owned by the same people who run Cactus Club, for those of you who are familiar with them on the East coast.   I was in Toronto for the holidays and was told by my friends in Vancouver that this is one of the new spots to check out - so I did just that.   Turns out my uncle lives down the street from King Taps, so my brother and I walked over to grab a mid-day drink (hey, it was during the holidays!) and some lunch. It was fairly slow when we came in, so lucky us, we were able to grab a table right away. We were seated at a high-top table in the center of the room - perfect views of the whole restaurant. Our server came over and greeted us with water, and right away I had asked if she could bring over a pitcher. She brought that over quickly.  They have a pretty good selection of different cocktails, wines, and beers. I ended up ordering a caesar, because, why not? And I have to say, that it was one of the most satisfying (and yummiest) caesars I've ever drank. I always respect people who can make a damn good caesar that just hits the spot. So shout out to the bartender on duty that day for creating a drink that washed my hangover right away.   My brother and I weren't too hungry so we decided to split the shrimp and pesto flatbread and an order of their potato skins. They both came out really quickly, but I guess given how slow it was when we were there, this made sense. I was super impressed with the food. The flavour and quality were all there. The portions were large for what we were paying, which I always appreciate at restaurants.   Sidenote // Apparently this is a fun spot to come to have drinks at night, and so I came here to grab a cocktail at the bar one of the nights I was downtown. Service, food, and drinks were equally as awesome as my lunch experience. The music was loud, the people were friendly, and it was a great spot to start off my Toronto bar/drink adventure.   Overall, both times I came in were wonderful! Come in, have a drink, grab some food, and enjoy the ambiance - you'll have a great time!"}
{"text":"Great food and a huge beer selection. Some notable beers include the cucumber infused one and the jelly beer (cant remember the names)  I tried the forager pizza and it was amazing. Cream sauce and mushrooms and a match fir eternity. Their light buttery crust was perfect.   Korean chicken tasted like the fire noodle challenge, but without the spice. I love fore noodles, so I felt a void without that insane kick.   Parmesan truffle fries were a little bit underwhelming.   Calamari was okay-  a lot of soace was taken up by fried pieces of nothing which I didnt really like.   Dirty bread was nice and chewy. Super oily though. The dip it came with was so damn good!!.   Highlight was definitely the pizza!  Servers were very friendly and despite having a server-in-training she was excellent."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to try this place since it opened a few months ago and I finally made it here for lunch this week.  The place is quite spacious with 2 floors of bar style tables and booths and outside patio.  It's a great location in the First Canadian Place for people working downtown.  It was a little loud so it's not the best place for an intimate dinner but great for hanging out with friends.  I only got to try 3 items on their menu.  We got the calamari to start which was very nice with a mix of jalape√±os and red peppers and 2 dipping sauce.  It was tasty but I would prefer the squid pieces to be a bit bigger.   As for the Crispy chicken burger that I got, it was good but not great.  I heard the beef burgers are delicious so maybe I made the wrong choice.  My friend got the Stinging Bee Pizza which I tried a slice as well and we both thought it was tasty especially with the honey but just a bit oily.  Overall, the atmosphere was great and excellent service.  I'll definitely be back to try the other food items like their crispy sushi which sounds really interesting."}
{"text":"It locates at First Canadian Place; you can enter either on ground level or at food court level. Service is friendly and prompt.   The ambiance of the place is trendy and good for business lunch and office gathering. There are TVs With sport channels; perfect place to enjoy drinks and snacks while watch games.   I came with a group of 7 people; we shared 2 pizzas and 4 appetizers. Surprisingly, the pizzas were very delicious and I enjoyed them the most. My second favourite was Korean Chicken which had sweet and spicy sauce. The Nachos was so crispy and with lots of fresh toppings.   The portion was very generous and great for sharing. For the price and portion which is a pretty good deal in such a prime location.   There is half price pizza from 2-5 PM everyday.  Wide selection of Beer and wine is the highlight of the place. Although I don't drink alcohol, my group commented the beers were very delicious.   I would definitely go back with group of friends to share the delicious food and to have great time together."}
{"text":"I had a surprisingly good time here! I work in the Financial District and assumed that this would be your typical FiDi restaurant.   Other than a slight blip where the server forgot that we were her table and we weren't attended to for about 15 minutes at the start...the rest was wonderful!   A friend and I ordered the Kona pizza (think Hawaiian pizza with a spicy yogurt drizzle) as well as the Clubhouse sandwich on gluten-free bread, to split.  The pizza was great - delicious dough! We ate the whole thing despite being extremely full, we couldn't help ourselves.   The sandwich was absolutely amazing. The winner of the whole meal. I hate most gluten-free breads...this bun was just as good as a regular one. Honestly, the sandwich itself sounds a little average (turkey, avocado, bacon, tomato) - but it really stands out! A week later and I am still talking about how good it is.  This place gets busy at around noon, but we were able to get a reservation at 11AM and it was mostly empty. If you feel up for an early lunch, I'd definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"King Taps opened not too long ago.  It used to be Vertical now changed to King Taps.  There's 2 levels very nice decor. Since this restaurant is fairly new it's always busy so you need to make reservations.  The service was great. Our server was nice and very helpful in the recommendations.  Tuesday's are half priced bottled wine day however it was lunchtime too early to drink a whole bottle of wine. We ordered the calamari to start and it was excellent. Crispy and yummy. I ordered the braised beef tacos and my friend ordered the battered fish tacos and we shared a side truffle fries.  So much food we couldn't finish everything.  Portions are good size and price is reasonable as well.  My braised beef tacos hardly had any beef on it I would not get that next time.  However I would come back here again. It's convenient, in the financial district and the ambiance is very nice."}
{"text":"It wasn't my first time at King Taps--more like my twentieth  just never got around to writing a review.  On Family Day a friend and I decided to have a late lunch and catch up.  After 2pm is half off their pizza pies--wonderful since their pizzas are delicious and this does include gluten free option (which is normally an extra $3).  Not the busy or usual finance crowd on the Holiday Monday but still quite a few tables occupied.  The ambience: Classy Sports Bar--the Rangers were playing, Bar was occupied and lots of patrons chatting away.  So the food... truffle oiled fries are great but the pizza...always declines!  My favourite is the forager but today I opted for a simple Margherita, tomato sauce, mozzarella and basil.  So simple yet so good if done right!  The Forager on the other hand is for those that love love love mushrooms where each bite is a funghi explosion in your mouth . The cream on it does contain gluten.  The service at the start--we were sat down but they forgot about us... after the waitress saw that we were there she was very nice and attentive.  I didn't like my co/lab which was essentially a shandy of Blood Orange and Beer and was offered to have it replaced but I decided not to.  Monday's special was also $3.50 co/lab specials.  It was a lovely time and service ended up to be wonderful.  Ambiance better than the usual FiDi feel which was great!"}
{"text":"First came on a Saturday night for drinks- if it matters, they have an amazing playlist going. The setting was dim and there was a bit of a table wait, although you can stand at the bar between stools if you want to get started while you wait. They text you when your table is ready, so it's very convenient. Was happy to see they had daily drink specials as well as their after 11pm drinks/pizza specials going on on a Saturday.  Came back for food on as weekday lunch spot. As much as they advertise their pizza to be \"the best in town\", they were far too thin for me. Think of a NY thin slice and cut that into half- that's what you get here. To each their own, but I'll order something else next time. Their apps are very similar to Cactus Club- the Poke here is equivalent to their tuna stack. You can't go wrong with the regular financial district apps here. Great service too."}
{"text":"Great spot with a nice selection of beers (it is called King Taps for a reason). Came here with the boys and had to wait for a spot on the patio but they had a great system of doing so (they grab your number and text you when it's ready).   I found service to be quick, attentive, and friendly. Really good vibes from the staff as well as the atmosphere created by the other patrons as well.   I got a few flights, just to taste some of their favourites and it was great. My food was pretty good too (I went with the burger + fries). Homeboy didn't like his risotto though. I tried it and I agreed, the rice was wet instead of creamy and it tasted like they didn't cook enough for the rice to break down a bit more. The steak was good though so maybe their forte is traditional bar food.  I would return in the future for sure. There's just more beer I would want to try."}
{"text":"My friends told me this was the new Financial District hot spot and massively hyped up the pizza, so I was pretty excited to try it and ultimately ended up being a bit underwhelmed. I had a decently good time there - we had a reservation and ended up being seated downstairs on a Friday afternoon/early evening. They obviously make an effort to make the atmosphere \"hip\" and \"live\" by having a DJ spinning tunes loudly all night. The crowd was decent and didn't seem noticeably obnoxious or pretentious. Service was alright, although our server seemed a bit absentminded? We needed to move an extra chair over to our table and had to ask our server twice.  Most of the food is pretty standard bar food, so it's not terribly exciting. Just burgers, sandwiches, etc. They are known for their pizzas though, and I will say they have some pretty unique offerings. My friends who had been here before convinced me to try the Stinging Bee (soppressata salami, kalamata olives, mozza, calabrian honey) which seemed intriguing and promising, but well... my overall impression of it was that it was just... salty. Like overwhelmingly salty. I actually kind of stopped tasting any distinctive tastes other than saltiness (and maybe the tiniest bit of sweetness from the honey.) I guess they salt the crust of the pizza, and then in combination with the salami and olives and it was just WAY too much for me. I did try a slice of the Forager pizza and found it much more bearable to consume, and if I were to come again, I would maybe order that one. It is a matter of taste though because my friends didn't seem to mind the saltiness.  They do have a large selection of beers, including craft beers, but that seems to be the case for plenty of establishments in Toronto, so it's nothing standout.  They do do half price pizzas every day from 11 to close, so that's a good deal to take advantage of if you happen to be in the area. I personally would not be willing to wait a long time to get into this place, but you know, overall it's a decent place to come and chill after work."}
{"text":"Nice alternative to the Cactus Club (although same owners!) upscale but with a more pub-feel. Can't comment on the food as I came here on a liquid diet (vodka after vodka after vodka...) but I hear it's fantastic from the group I was with! Drinks are great and for those beer lovers, I think 50+ on tap! Servers are great...great looking and on top of things! Great place for a drinks or lunch meeting.  Really like this place, will be back!"}
{"text":"Staff is rude. Waited for a table for 4, which was fine....until I was seated at a table for 2, then rudely approached by another staff member with \"you can't just sit here sir\"...completely disorganized and just rude service. Which is too bad, because first visit here the service was very good. Won't be back. Plenty of other good spots."}
{"text":"TIP: MAKE RESERVATIONS! (even if you think you're going during hours that people wouldn't typically be eating at)  After a long trip downtown, my boyfriend and I finally stumbled into King Taps! Oddly enough, even though I thought we were going there during non-peak hours, every single table was either reserved or already seated with people. We still managed to get a table without waiting, but was given advance notice that we had to be out of there by a certain time because of reservations - fine by me!   The food overall was delicious. I didn't get a picture of any of it because as soon as each dish arrived, we dug right in. To be fair, it was between lunch and dinner hours (around 2-4PM) so we were both starving.   The calamari was probably my favorite dish out of the three that was ordered. It came with two very different, but equally delicious sauces for your choosing to dip the calamari into! I ordered the vegetarian burger - which was messy, but still good. My boyfriend ordered the pesto pizza with shrimp and tomatoes on it and said that despite the fact that each slice was dripping with oil, it was a positive in his books.  Give this place a shot if you're in the financial district!"}
{"text":"WHAT TO TRY?!  Their pizzas!! I love the crust of their pizza. Very chewy and moist, not hard or crusty at all. Personal favorite would be the mushroom pizza though. Hands down. Way better than the other one I ordered - stinging bee pizza.   The calamari was alright. Typically fried but what I loved about it was the fact they garnished it with some parsley and it added a different flavor to the calamari. There were two sauces that came with the calamari too which gives you a choice to dip in whatever you want. Awesome!   Ordered the truffle fries too but meh, it was OkY. Nothing special. King Taps is a pub so the food should be bar food but if there's one thing to look out for, it's their pizza!   LAST TIP?!  It's super busy on Thursday evenings because of bankers Thursdays but if you like live DJ, and 80s grooves then you'll like this place. Can get SUPER loud though so be prepared to yell and if you want to dine here, make reservations, they take it here!!"}
{"text":"as much as i love this place & the dozens of times ive come here for its pizza & beers, the only reason it doesnt score 5 stars is due to the service. The only thing that isnt consistent is the service. one day youll get a very cheerful server and the next, theyre grumpy or rude. its quite loud in here in the evenings given the fact that its a bar/lounge. they have a great happy hour deal (2pm-5pm & 10pm-cl, 1/2 priced pizzas) every day! and sundays is all day! a lot of my guests say the pizza is too greasy, but come on, its pizza!! its not a salad!! their dough is so chewy, yet crispy & airy all at once!! i highly recommend the stinging bee (hot sopressata/salami, kalamata olives, cheese & honey glaze) or the forager for the veggie lovers (mushroom, kale, truffle & arugala). ive also had their mini sliders & tacos! everything on their menu is so strategically paired, it all tastes amazing!! They have a huge  selection of beers on tap and its always rotating!! The cucumber mule is really refreshing too. Overall a great place to grab a bite/drink w.your coworkers or friends after a long days of work."}
{"text":"We came here for dinner. Waited for an outdoor table for about 25 minutes on a Friday night in august. Once seated, the music was so loud that patrons needed to talk very loudly to hear one another. This only made the noise problem worse, of course. We couldn't hear one another.   We decided to \"cut bait\" after our one round of drinks and find somewhere else to sup. The food may be very good, but I'll never know because I don't want to shout over \"foreground music\" to talk to my dinner companions."}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner on our way to Invictus Games Closing Ceremonies and we were not disappointed.  The kids loved the home made four cheese pizza using real ingredients and polished it off in no time flat.   Wife had beef tacos and said they were delicious .. and she's very picky about upscale food most of which she eschews as overcomplicated.   I went for an Ahi Tuna bowl and it was an awesome flavour mash, with complementary textures and bright cilantro-lime Asian dressing that exploded on the palette.  Just the right mix of casual and classy, high top tables and TVs but intimate lighting and ground level street views of King St, and the prices didn't break the bank either.  Would return again and try almost anything else on the menu."}
{"text":"Great experience at King Taps! Great food, vibes and service! I went for the first time with a couple friends to try the beers on tap - which I've always heard great things about.   I drank the jelly king and ordered the stinging bee pizza, which were recommended by our server, Asli, who was very attentive throughout the evening, genuine and knew so much about the menu. She helped me decide what to order, and gave me the perfect recommendation. The drinks and food were delicious! A great night all in all. Fun atmosphere. Would recommend."}
{"text":"Came here Tuesday after work and had to wait 15-20 min to get seated. It was packed! We sat upstairs and I ordered the cucumber mule, didn't try any food. The music is quite loud, I had to shout and sit really close to hear what she was saying. It seems like a good place to go for drinks but if you want to have a real conversation I would go elsewhere!"}
{"text":"I had actually never heard of this place before but came here at a friend's suggestion for a mini reunion with some former coworkers. I wasn't able to get a reservation for our group of 8 as I was too last minute (you can make online reservations for groups less than 8 people), but was told to come anyway and put my name on the waitlist. The place was already very crowded by the time I arrived at 5:30 on a Thursday but we were able to get seated at a booth on the second floor quite quickly.  I ordered the shaved pork sandwich and nearly had buyer's remorse when I saw my friends tacos arrive because they looked GOOD. Thankfully, I loved my sandwich. The pork was cooked perfectly and the tangy kale and cabbage slaw complemented the house-made BBQ sauce really well. We were all really impressed by the food.  Service was very friendly and not at all snooty which I always appreciate. Shoutout to our server Brooke for taking great care of us! Loved the vibes of this place (open kitchen, live music) and I can definitely see myself returning...especially to check out the long drink list and half price pizzas during happy hour (2-5pm and after 10pm)!"}
{"text":"I have been here multiple times and will continue to go back because the food and drinks are totally worth it. Even the service at the bar and tables is good.The pizza is on special everyday and its definitely worth the trip, my favorite is the Kona. On tuesdays wine bottles are half price and the selection is great.  My frustration with this place starts and ends with the hostesses and door staff. Every time i have been here there is either some confusion with my table or a ridiculous wait. Most recently, i called around 2 to see if any tables were available for around 5 since the online system was already closed for the day - the person on the phone was super curt and said well were empty right now but i cant guarantee we will be at 5. OK, can i reserve a table....no we don't take reservations over the phone. that's dumb. I called again around 4 saying that i was on my way to the restaurant asking if tables were free. Again, I was told yeah its not busy right now and that they couldn't save me a table even though i was almost there. when we arrived probably 20 min later the girl at the door stated that the downstairs was closed and that there was no more tables but offered to add my name to a list where there were 4 people ahead of me but offered nothing else, super uninterested. I asked if the bar was free and she goes I don't know but you can check. Fine, so we put our name on the list and go look for seats at the bar. We grabbed the last two and got drinks while we waited for our table....1.5 hours later we were seated. In the mean time many empty tables were around - some not seated up til the time we left at 8.   This place is popular, I get it. What i don't get is having an attitude and being super unaccommodating."}
