{"text":"This place is somewhat tucked in a residential area/plaza. At first, I was a bit thrown off by the restaurant's very old signboard outside. As I walked in, my first impression was completely changed. The place had nice atmosphere and really clean.   I tried the lentil soup and a falafel sandwich. The soup's presentation was good as it came served in a nice bowl that had a small handle. It tasted good but it was too thick for my taste. The falafel sandwich was quite full, fresh and crunchy.  Overall it was a very good experience, they had friendly staff and I recommend it."}
{"text":"This is easily my favorite restaurant. The food is always SO delicious, fresh,  and full of flavor! Honestly if you haven't tried this place you are missing out! My husband loves the \"Adonis Shawarma\" and I love the falafel, hummus, and the amazing vegetarian cabbage roll! Every one I take here, loves it!"}
{"text":"This is one of our local favourites and probably the place we frequent the most for take-out.  As most other reviews mention, the location is unusual.  You would likely pass by this place without a thought if you'd never tried it or it wasn't recommended to you.  Despite the lackluster strip mall, the interior is very nice - tastefully decorated and super clean, and we enjoy eating in when we get the chance.  The owners and staff are absolutely lovely.  They willingly make substitutions for my kids with picky tastes or check ingredients for restricted diets.  And above all, the food is consistently good.  My favourite for this genre of food in Oakville.  In fact, I'm looking forward to my Adonis Shwarma for dinner tonight!"}
{"text":"I went here last night with my Sheridan Theater friends. ( On a side note the Main Stage series of musicals this school offers is top notch and the price is right)   Atmosphere- MapQuest guided us away from the QEW all the way into a residential street. We kept going while I checked the address again. Yes , this place is in a tiny strip mall on house lined street. When we arrived no one was in the place but what caught my eye was the gorgeous colourful glass mosaic balls hanging from the ceiling and the beautiful smile of our waitress .She was just so welcoming. She explained the restaurant was run by her family and the cooks are mainly her mother and sister.   Food- All I can say is everyone at my table agreed we will be back again the food is that good. Our dishes included 1) Adonis shwarma- chicken with peppers, onions and pineapple. Two of my friends had this dish and I heard so many Mmms throughout the whole meal. 2) I had the lamb stir fry ( the name of the dish escapes me) This dish was mouth watering with thinly sliced lamb, peppers, onions, and pineapple .After I heard my friends were getting pineapple in their shwarma I asked for it to be added to my dish as well. If you like pineapple I highly recommend it. The result is scrumptious. 3) Vegetarian cabbage roll- My vegetarian friend who said since she has become a vegetarian 15 years ago she has never seen a cabbage roll offered for her. She smiled happily as she dove into the dish. The sides that were chosen at our table were the following: 4) fattoush salad- a little vinegary. Not the best I have but freshly made .- I would not pick this side again. 5) greek salad- a better choice 6) hummus- excellent 6) stuffed grape leaves- wonderful flavour. Highly recommended 7) falafel- nice taste. 7) fried potatoes- I would recommend these to anyone. The spices added to these were so full of flavour. I would love how they make them. All of these dishes were accompanied with a garlic sauce that added to everything. We all enjoyed it so much.   Service- The waitress was lovely. Her cook sister came out to say hello to people in the restaurant. ( Did I mention that in the time we ate the place filled up with a steady stream of take out patrons) The father and mother of this restaurant were both in hospital because a drunk driver had hit them head on. We heard a lot of the people in the place asking about them. This place has a large following . They were extremely busy and the cook sister still had time to greet the guests as they wished her parents a speedy recovery.   Impression- If this place was closer to my home I most definitely be a regular. Since it is a bit of a drive I wont be there often but I will most definitely be back again. ."}
{"text":"This is a fabulous local eatery with great service and delicious food.  My favorite is the Adonis swarms.  The service is always fast and friendly.  We have been back several times and never dissapointed.  Give this great spot a try and you will experience one of Oakville's best restaurants ."}
{"text":"Why is this place popular is the first question I had after ordering their food for takeout.  The place is close to where I live, and neighbors said it was quite good, and the place is busy, but it simply prepares a very bland and flavorless version of Greek food.  Perhaps this appeals to older anglo residents of Oakville or for families, but there is no zip to any of the food we ordered.  If you are looking for something with fresh flavors (say, like Mezzes on the Danforth in Toronto), save your money and try something else."}
{"text":"Great family restaurant in a quiet neighbourhood. Everything here is amazing! The home fries are perfect and the grilled vegetables have so much flavour! I'm a big fan of their cabbage rolls too! Friendly staff make our regular visits all the more enjoyable!"}
{"text":"Very hospitable service and the appetizer calamari as well as the mezze plate was fantastic. Definitely recommend"}
{"text":"To start it seems to be in a very odd location.  The food is just amazing.  Over a few trips we've had the Adonis shawarma, kafta, grape leaves, lebneh, roasted potatoes, home fries and lental rice.  Everything was excellent.  Very good and friendly service.  It does get very busy at dinner time so reservations are recommended."}
{"text":"First time at Adonis and this place is over the top! Small family run business with great service and excellent food/portions. If your in the mood for Mediterranean food you should definitely check this place out."}
{"text":"Adonis is a great neighborhood restaurant. We decided to give it a try last week,. The food was amazing. The mushroom soup was fantastic, and the chicken souvlaki was delicious. The service was very friendly as well. We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"So after reading that Adonis is the #1 restaurant in Oakville, I just had to try it for myself. Let me tell you I was not disappointed. Weird location in a residential neighborhood strip plaza but so good. As soon as you walk in the door you knew it was going to be good. The restaurant is very nicely decorated and laid out. It was nice and warm on a cool foggy night, the food smelled great and the staff were very friendly. Took the chicken schwarma in a pita and fries home and l probably didn't need the large schwarma. I'm still stuffed. Will definetley be back, this time with friends and to dine in!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, clean with good ambiance, good food at reasonable prices. I definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Arrived late, just the family was tiring to clean up, but they made us welcome and made us great food.  A really local place in the best sense of the term, with an excellent authentic \"Mediterranean\" feel, ie Greek/Turkish/Lebanese type of thing.  We will be back and will be regulars for the near future. Which shows good food and good service is always a winner."}
{"text":"This place is really good. Their pita sandwiches are yummy and well-constructed. They actually stuff everything into a large pita and roll it up like a burrito. Not like other restaurants (e.g. Montfort) which give you a small pita stuffed like an envelope which makes it hard to eat the sandwich. Their sauces are tasty.   They are quite popular and it seems like there's usually only one waitress and one lady preparing food so the wait for your food can be  a while. You do not want to come here if you don't have a lot of time for lunch.   If you want falafels, don't order them here. They're a bit on the drier side. Do yourself a favour and go to Raging Olive in Burlington to try amazingly fluffy and tender falafels."}
{"text":"So much better than Montfort! The Adonis shawarma was delicious. Very friendly waitresses, but the wait for things like drink refills was too long, so I took one star off. Otherwise a great place."}
{"text":"the chicken sharwama was sooooooooooooooo dry.... i couldnt finish it.... I was really looking forward to this place. -_-the service was okay, but the blond lady there, she should smile more often coz she is terrifying"}
{"text":"Pretty place tucked into a plaza in a residential area.  Friendly service.  Food presentation is great, not the typical slap a mound of food on a late a la Mr Greek style.  Ordered hummus and lentil soup to start and chicken shawarma and lamb souvlaki entrees.   Hummus is a nice garlicky dip with fresh pita bread and a nice side of Lebanese pickles.    Lentil soup came with crispy pita chips.  Was ok and would have been better with a fresh squeeze of lemon juice.  The lentil rice was very yummy.  Veggies were fresh grilled and crisp tender.  Greek salad was freshly made.  No soggy lettuce!!!  Lamb was grilled perfectly with a nice herb marinate that you can taste.  The chicken shawarma was moist and came with a garlicky tsatziki.  Dinner for 2 with non alcoholic beverages came to $70 including tip.  Bit pricey so worth it on a special occasion."}
{"text":"Adonis is definitely a hidden jewel here in Oakville.  Tucked away in a strip mall in a residential neighborhood, Adonis is definitely tough to find unless you are looking for it.    Adonis is by far my favorite Mediterranean restaurant in town; much better than Monfort and Agabi in my opinion.  Usually I come here for one thing, and one thing only; the Adonis Schwarma on a pita.  It is quite similar to the Monfort Chicken on a Pita served at Monfort, but with one brilliant addition - BACON.  You get seasoned chicken breast, pineapple, garlic sauce, your choice of a wholewheat or white pita, and the option to have it prepared spicy, plus BACON.  Delicious!  Additionally, the portion size is larger than at Monfort's, and I prefer the taste of the garlic sauce at Adonis.    The service at Adonis is super friendly.  You can tell that it is family owned and operated as it is the same staff working whenever I visit.  You also know it is good service if every time you leave walking away thinking that the waitress is flirting with you.  Me and my friends all feel this way, which is a good way to leave a restaurant.  If anything, it does take a while to prepare your order, so I usually call ahead and take it to go.    Overall, I highly recommend Adonis.  It loses one star for the wait times, but it is certainly one of Oakville's best hidden jewels!"}
{"text":"Dinner here was a mixed bag. The food was alright, but not necessarily worth the price. The food service was slow, which was confusing given the fact that it's primarily fast food, and quality was inconsistent. The restaurant was almost full when we showed up around 7, but almost empty by 8.  We started with the hummus, baba ganoush, and grilled calamari. All of these appetizers were good, though the pitas were sliced a bit thin. The baba ganoush was my particular favourite, and possibly the best thing we had.   For dinner, we had the shawarma plates, which left something to be desired. My chicken was a bit on the dry side, and the portion was small for the price. It was served with a garlic sauce (which tasted a bit yogurty), but no hot sauce or hummus, or any of the usual trappings you might expect.   Overall, the meal was enjoyable, but not necessarily worth the cost. There is much better shawarma to be had in Toronto, but this might be as good as it gets in Oakville.   Just a note, but the \"roasted\" potato side is actually a boiled potato. If you want roasted potatoes, order the home fries.   Dinner for two will run you about $80."}
{"text":"Such sweet ladies work there!!! It was my first time and I will defiantly be back. The food is amazing"}
{"text":"Hi everybody in Yelpland, it is Chip's B here reporting in from Adonis Mediterranean Restaurant (AMR).  Located in the middle of nowhere section of suburbia Oakville stands AMR.  Talk about hidden.  Small Strip Plaza with plenty of Parking.  Lets start my review with,, damn,, they changed the exterior signage of the restaurant.  Awww,, I was expecting to see the Big Red Block Letter Adonis sign..  Oh well, it's ok,, Chips moving on.   The interior of the AMR is very nice and cozy but most importantly, clean.  The restaurant wasn't busy when we arrived so we were immediately attended too.  The front end staff were friendly, courteous and attentive. They made us feel comfortable.  The one thing I couldn't help but notice was all of the signed \"reserved\" tables.  Impressive.     Our order was from the Lunch Menu:  One Chicken Shawarma with Fries and Salad, one Beef Shawarma with the upgraded Lentil Rice (for a buck) and Salad, and lastly, one Adonis Shawarma - HOT.  Please note that the Dinner Menu offers a larger sized platter.  It took about 15 minutes and our food arrived.   The results:    The Beef Shawarma Platter.  Now here we go!  Yum yum yummy!!  Lentil rice was soo delicious.  Had lightly spiced sauteed onions as opposed to caramelized onions as a topping.  Different and I like!!!   Beef spiced just right and moist to the last bite.  This brings Chips to the happy yet sad ending of the AMR experience.  The Chicken Shawarma Platter.  The Chicken was spiced nicely but sadly it was dry.  The Standard Garden Salad with Oil and Vinegar Dressing was decent but wished for more.  My Baes and I shared the crispy fries.  The Adonis Shawarma (AS).  I shall describe the AS  with two words. \"Scrumptious and Aww Man!!!\". Pineapple! Bacon! Chicken! Sauce!  The sauce, veg and pineapples took the dry Chicken Shawarma Meat and elevated it to a heavenly delight.  Only two complaints with the Adonis Shawarma.  My order was for spicy hot and spicy hot it was not.  What truly saddened me the most about the AS was the size of it.  Whoever said size didn't matter is way wrong.  Size matters!  Chips loves it girthy.  Chips loves it when it's too big to fit inside of his mouth.    It was a four bite Shawarma and we all know that we need at least six to the most pleasurable fifteen biter to satisfy our earthly desires.  I had to chew so slowly and savour eat delicious bite but it all came to an end so fast.  It was over before it even began.   Dont you hate when that happens?  Is it just me? Does anybody else know how I feel?  LOL.   Now, despite all the lows points, I still have faith in AMR. AMR your clientele reviews give me faith and I promise that I will give you another chance to satiate my never ending desire for GREAT FOOD. Chips B keeping it PG-14.  Peace Out!"}
{"text":"Every time I want a shawarma in my area, I make the drive over to Adonis.  These are the best shawarmas I've ever had and could possibly be one of the best in the GTA.  They greet you with a smile every time and the quality/taste of the food is well worth the wait!  I recommend this restaurant to anyone and everyone I meet!"}
{"text":"A hidden gem - love the service and the food!  We are regulars and have never ever been disappointed. The Adonis shawarma is a must try."}
{"text":"Really great food in a strip-mall location.  Our party enjoyed:  grilled calimari (didn't try the breaded/fried); mezze platter (moussaka was heavenly); lamb souvlaki and lamb pitas. All great...  Highly recommended. And yes, you SHOULD make reservations as they are busy!"}
{"text":"The best food and service you'll get in Laguna Beach! We drive over 65miles each month to Adonis just to have their gyro and chicken wraps! I promise you won't be disappointed by coming here! It's a MUST TRY! Truly a yummy place, with fresh food!"}
{"text":"You know how most shawarma places, even if they are tasty and cheap, are filled with either grease, very fatty sauce, or sometimes even French fries? Well, this place is not. Each Adonis Shawarma wrap is filled with relatively clean meat, lots of veggies, TOASTED PINEAPPLE, and BACON! They taste so good it's really not fair to other shawarma places.   In addition, the service is amazing, and the place is family owned and operated. No rude staff here. All smiles, no asking for extra napkins (they are brought to you before you even know you need it), no limit is on the tasty garlic sauce that is provided with each pita, no dirty tables or floors, just a nice cozy place with some good food.   Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"When we eat at this restaurant we feel like we're eating in Greece. The food is hand prepared by the in-house \"Mama\". It's a open concept kitchen & u can tell the foods good. The flow of neighbourhood people for take-out was uninterrupted....always a good sign. Dinner was Mazza for 2, Greek salad & the Mixed Grill. All hand made & beyond tasty. We were served by the nicest young lady that was very polite & ready to serve. We've been a couple of times & will go back again. It's a do-over!!"}
{"text":"This is a cute family run business that has amazing Lebanese & middle eastern food. I cannot forget the mousakka I've had; the roasted melted eggplant in olive oil and peppers was simply to die for. I recommend platters rather than wraps if you want a proper dining experience. The meze platter has very interesting tapas I've never had before and they all are delicious!"}
{"text":"Run by a mother and her two daughters, this restaurant provides great food at reasonable prices. The family is very friendly and they love what they do. It makes  a difference.  We usually go for takeout but eating in is more fun. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"So glad I came back here  a number of years after discovering this spot on Urban Spoon (I believe). It was 3.5-4 stars for me back then and I have to think that's just because of the meat-heavy menu choices I made.  At almost $20 with a tip for lunch Adonis is not inexpensive and it is not one of the plethora of Mediterranean spots that piles on quantity over quality.  A simple flavourful falafel sandwich and a cup of perfectly cooked rice along with a healthy glass of fruit juice could not have satisfied me more.  Top it off with very friendly, but far from pushy, service and you know I will be back soon."}
{"text":"Great food and really nice people. I went for dinner with my parents and all three of us enjoyed our meals.  The food seemed really authentic and the atmosphere was quite and comfortable. If I lived closer, I'd definitely go back often."}
