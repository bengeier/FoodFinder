{"text":"I've been coming here for 24 years I didn't know that they changed ownership!  They took the pretty art off the wall wouldn't know where you are by looking no art at all looks like a bar and they changed the almond clicked it comes in big chunks and the vegetables too and they charged me for hot tea! Won't be back"}
{"text":"This place was awesome. I don't take 5's lightly. Price, flavor, selection, customer service is grade A.  You MUST do the Pu Pu plater.  You will not reget it.  And you MUST finish it off with the \"Fruit on Ice\", not sure what kind of fruit it was but it was good

There were lots of locals eating there. If I lived in the area I'd be a regular."}
{"text":"My family and I have been eating here for over ten years and love it. The ownership changed in the past year or two and for a while the food seemed a little different, but they are definitely back on track now. Delicious dishes! Haven't found a bad one yet. The atmosphere isn't the loveliest, but hey, I'm here for great (and affordable!) Chinese."}
{"text":"Ok.. First time I ordered from this place. I wanted to try something new. Sorry I did! Ordered some thing simple, Mongolian beef. I took a few bites and i was disgusted how raw the beef was. I don't mean med rare or rare. I mean raw! It was so unappetizing I just threw it in the trash. I can't find one redeeming quality about what I ate. Don't even get me started on the wife's entree and soup! Yuck! However, the egg roll was good! At least it was cooked! What was delivered to me was not even fit for the stray cat in the front yard!  Please... Read this.. I rarely criticize, but this was down right horrible! What a waste of money!"}
{"text":"When my husband worked near Arcadia, this was our go-to place for a \"cheap Chinese\" lunch. It was a good solid experience, nothing delightful but nothing offensive either. We give the overall rating of food, service, and ambience 3.5 stars. 

Our experience with the food is the standard fare:  Lemon Chicken, Moo Goo Gai Pan, Kung Pao Shrimp, and Sweet and Sour Chicken. In particular, I recall the Lemon Chicken was tender and plentiful but a tad too sweet for me; also, I probably liked the Kung Pao Shrimp the best for the well-cooked veg and yummy shrimp. On the side, I found the eggrolls rather average, but the hot and sour, as reviewers have noted, well above average for the bevy of complex flavors and numerous shrimp.

The decor is plain and slightly 80s cheesy, but it's fine for a quick lunch drop-in during the week. The staff is friendly but not too friendly, which is acceptable and probably preferable to over-attentive in my opinion. It's a solid place overall.

I wouldn't go out of my way to head down this way to Little Shanghai unless there was a reason to be in the area, but I would stop in \"when in Rome!\" Cheers!"}
{"text":"Overpriced. Horrible food. An hour and 15 minute wait - are you kidding me? We won't be going back!!!"}
{"text":"We have eaten at this place for 15+ years, almost always for lunch. A great spot for great Chinese food at a good price. Love this place..."}
{"text":"Little Shanghai has the best Chinese food that I've been able to find in the city. The steamed flounder with bean curd is great. It comes in 2 fillets for $13.95. I loved the texture of the crispy tofu in the spinach with garlic and tofu dish. The broth of the noodle soup with spare ribs has a wonderful flavor and the dish is more than enough to fill up one person.

I wish the restaurant had better loose leaf tea (they use a tea bag) but the food is excellent. I would highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Nice food for the price. Typical American Chinese food. Portions were good and the cuts of meat were very good and tender. Sauces were good without being too sweet. Definitely will eat there again."}
{"text":"good quality chicken. Sesame seed chicken was good not overly impressed but will give other items on the menu a chance. Friendly staff"}
{"text":"My very favorite Chinese food place in AZ. I have been going there for about 15 years now and the food is consistently delicious. The honey dipped wings are amazing! Poo Poo platter = yum. The house fried rice = yum. The shrimp chow mien =yum. I haven't tasted anything on their menu that I didn't love. Great service, great place to take your family."}
{"text":"I checked this place out based on the Yelp reviews and I must admit.... The food was great and prices are good. We will be going back in the near future!!"}
{"text":"Awwwe - I call this \"the little unknown Chinese food treasure of PHX\" So good - cooked fresh, fresh ingredients and awesome staff. Doesn't look like much from the outside and inside is kinda plain and basic but the food is D'lish! I took some friends that didn't like Lo Mien, sweet and sour pork or fried rice - well now they like it! Don't forget to try the very healthy yummy Soup Fried rice :)"}
{"text":"We like to order from here for take out.  We usually get Moo Goo Gai Pan, Mongolian Chicken, and egg rolls.  They always get the order right.  It is nice to eat here too, there usually isn't a huge crowd for dinner (I'm not sure about lunch).  The decor isn't much to look at, but the food is very authentic and that is what I come here for. Very tasty."}
{"text":"I am really worried that my boyfriend and I will get nicknamed the Pu Pu Plater couple. That possibility be damned, the Pu Pu Plater is amazing. Fried shrimp, yes. Wontons, yes. Egg Rolls, yes. Beef Skewers, yes. HONEY DIPPED CHICKEN WINGS, OH HELL YES. Seriously these wings are so good. The skin is super crispy and coated in the most delicious sauce. The plater also comes with a confusing burner thing. We didn't know what we were supposed to do with it at first, but the last time we went the server put the Beed Skewers on there, so I guess that is what it is for. But the beef is already cooked so I am not sure why it is necessary. The hot and sour soup is awesome. The veggies in the soup are super fresh and delicious. The Egg Foo Yong is amazing as well.

The decor is very 80's: grey tones and tons of mirrors with the strangest bathrooms ever. The stalls clearly used to be showers and the it is creepily well lit. Blinding even. Very strong smell in the restrooms also, but it is pleasant, like laundry detergent. It is also giant inside and no one is ever there. It may be a front for an opium ring, but I don't care. Bring on the Pu Pu Plater!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing service! Came in to order some food to go. The host and all the staff were polite and incredibly kind. We got our food quickly and were out the door in no time. 

I ordered the teriyaki chicken and it was delicious!  The portion size was big, enough for two people, and it tasted great. Would definitely order it again."}
{"text":"The food at Little Shanghai is plentiful and reasonably priced.  The architecture and ambiance is a little dated but still has a high level of authenticity that is fitting and functional.  I haven't been to a better chinese restaurant in Phoenix.  The house chicken is to crave for late at night in your  refrigerator.  The sizzling beef should be a little more dangerous, kind of didn't sizzle the way my imagination played out.  The bar even works functionally and has some character.  Highly recommend if your are in the Arcadia area."}
{"text":"Definitely the best authentic Taiwanese food restaurant in Pittsburgh.  What? Authentic Taiwanese food? Yes, you got it right. The owner/chef and the older waiter wearing a cap speak Taiwanese (and of course Chinese mandarin). I guess having such a \"wrong\" name is mostly for marketing reason. 

Unfortunately, the best menu is not in English, but the menu pasted on the wall in Chinese.  There are only a few dishes overlapped in both menus.  I am not sure why the owner doesn't give non-Chinese speaking customers a chance to have really delicious authentic Taiwanese food, but if you want to know how real Taiwanese foods taste, try the following menu:

*For those who comes there alone, I recommend 1. noodles with bean sauce or 2. beef noodle soup.

**For those who come with three or four people in a group, I recommend:

1. Fried pork chop with pepper and salt-- it's pronounced like: Chiao-Yen-Pai-Gu.
2. Pork with snow peas--it's pronounced like: Shuei-Tsai-Mao-Dou-Ro-Shi.
3. Dried soybean curd with beef and bell pepper-- it's pronounced like: Shiang-Gan-Chiao-Chiao-Niou-Ro-Shi. 
4. Codfish with crispy deep-fried bean sauce--it's pronounced like: Do-Su-Shuei-Yu.

Since the first time I went to Little Shanghai, I seldom go to the other Taiwanese restaurant in Squirrel Hill.  The one in SH has many advantages that Little Shanghai does not have, like cleaner tables and restroom.  However, Little Shanghai's foods always make me feel like I am eating in a typical restaurant in Taipei."}
{"text":"Tried it based on ratings and pleasantly surprised.   Food was delicious anf fresh.  My new go-to Chinese delivery for sure."}
{"text":"For what it is - straight up Americanized Chinese food - this place is a great deal for great flavor. We usually can't go wrong with the saut√©ed spicy shrimp and the string beans. The Hoisin beef is also really delicious.  Delivery is quick and they've never gotten our order wrong. It's definitely become our go-to for Chinese takeout."}
{"text":"I.do not care what anyone says if you are in the mood for greasy delicious and heavy chinese go here...the mooshu pork and house fried rice are delicious...the sesame chicken and potstickers are to die for...gave it 4 stars because the decor is not great and the service is touch and go but its great if want great take out!!! They deliver too!!! Yay!!"}
{"text":"Great take out. Sesame chicken a must try. Good stable for those nights when cooking is just too much."}
{"text":"Good but not great. Some dishes are inconsistent but Phoenix is not the best city for Chinese"}
{"text":"Okay used to be a 5 quickly turned into a 1 star all because of one night my family & I had been screwed over by this place.. If you have a family of 4 or more be prepared to wait wait wait and watch everyone else eat & leave before you even get the sight of food. I really enjoyed getting the hot tea they bring to your table before your meal I didn't even receive that we got one pot for 8 people including children.. two people were served food after 2 hours I honestly question myself why we waited so long waited some more, two people in our family finished their meal and the rest of us were still waiting. Did not even refill water, told the server continuously that other guests were eating and leaving before we even got a plate of something...we decided to leave we expressed our frustration to the \"owner\" if that's what she even was and we refused to pay for nothing we received, we stormed out of there and she had the nerve to run out and record all of our license plates.. are you flipping kidding me.. no one was kidding when they told us \"all they care about is, you got your food right?\" The two out of eight people that came to dinner came back to the restaurant asked for them to please throw out the license plate numbers they \"sightly\" discounted the bill for the two plates & we now vow to never return to this crap hole of a restaurant. I will miss that lemon chicken but im sure there is another restaurant out there that would gladly appreciate our money than this place...

oh & I went into labor a few hours after this to top it all off. thanks little shanghai, thanks for sending me into labor...."}
{"text":"Well it started off great but then we found a staple in our food and the female server said it wasn't a staple. When clearly it was and she just wanted to get us another plate. So we left and then she gave us the finger outside as we were leaving. No apology or anything."}
{"text":"Ordered the takeout combination special for four.  It was awful.  The chicken wings were raw, not just under cooked.  We stopped to  alert the management.  They refused to reverse the charges even though we dropped off their food to show them. The ridiculous reply was. \"You bit into the wings, so no refund.\"  Although we order take-out 3 to 4 times a week, we will never go back."}
{"text":"Decided to try on FRI 04MAY2012 - it was about 1:30PM and they close at 2PM; so, the expectations were not high; but, I was pleasantly surprised.  I ordered the combination noodle soup; I really enjoyed it; but only thing would be do not put in soy sauce in the soup; it was a little dark for me, also wished they had BBQ Pork in the soup also.  But, will be back!!!"}
{"text":"ordered food while at work not only did we get about food over an hour late  but i've had better frozen eggrolls than this place and the rice was terrible. Definately have had much better food in the valley."}
{"text":"I agree with everyone else you do not go to this place for the decor you go for the food.  My wife LOVES Chinese food and could eat it every night.  This is one of a hand full of places that she will get take out from.

The Moo Shu is some of the best i have ever had.  I mean better then the stuff i remember eating back on the east coast growing up and that is hard to do."}
{"text":"Since I was 8 years old I have been coming here. I am 24 now. That's sixteen years as a customer. We order about 4 times a year for the past few years.

Let me detail some changes. Instead of serving their food in the take out boxes many people associate with Chinese they changed this procedure about a year ago. Now they come on cheap plastic plates with a top that can be sealed. Why does this matter? The volume of food you get in these plates is less than what it used to be. So I let that go, I kept ordering. My orders usually end up about 45-50 bucks.

Yesterday, I had my worst service and food that I have ever received. I MADE a yelp account because I am so pissed off. The Teriyaki chicken was hard, rock hard. It tasted like 2 day old leftovers. The kind that were left under a lamp. The PuPu Platter which costs 9.50 a piece contained jack sh1t. I ordered TWO of them , that is 19 dollars of Pu Pu Platter and the result I took a picture of because I couldn't believe it. 

This is what 19 dollars looks like : http://i.imgur.com/TZhEuV5.jpg

I called back, and was told this was a normal portion. Lol. 

I have been going here for years, and they finally lost me as a customer yesterday. I can say for certainty that I will never order from this place again, and neither should you. 

As an aside I added up 50 an order 5 times a year for 16 years, me and my family have probably spent around 4000 dollars at this one place throughout that time.

Bye bye."}
{"text":"Ive been here twice in the past two years. Both for lunch hour. They were extremely slow both times(first time was with a work group of 15 and the second 3 weeks ago was 3 of us). Its good food nothing too special though. They have lunch specials and regular menu."}
{"text":"It was Christmas Eve, and we were hungry so we followed some other cars turning into their parking lot.  We were the only Chinese people in there besides the staff.

OMG, it was like a time warp back to when Chinese were cooking for Americans.  The decor was so eclectic, I can't even tell you what style it was.  Not real Chinese or pretend Chinese, not upscale or tattered.  You've got to see it for yourself (if you really want to know).

I had to order a pupu platter which came with a flame and some sweet, sticky chicken wings, fried wontons, fried shrimps, beef on sticks, and shrimp toast (I think).  All the Chinese restaurants I go to in NY don't have it in their menu.  What can I say...fun and not too bad.

The fried duck was overcooked and dry.  The other things thing sauteed string beans and shrimp with sizzling rice were alright.  

Let's just say it wasn't the best meal I ever had."}
{"text":"Went here based on Yelp reviews and everything was great, had the pupu platter, loved it all except for the wing sauce (I'm from Buffalo), wonton soup, mongolin beef and orange peel chicken. Clean restaurant, plenty of parking, good prices but service was slow as molases and there was only 3 other tables occupied when we we there."}
{"text":"Just ordered food from here this evening for delivery. I have NO idea how this place gets 4 1/2 stars on here.  It was the worst chinese food I have ever eaten.  We ordered sesame chix which was soggy and gross. The eggrolls were overpriced and are more like a spring roll. the lomein is okay but will never get food from here again."}
{"text":"A fake plant in the corner was so thick with dust it made me question the cleanliness of the kitchen. Every door was dirty even the entrance doors which were glass and easy to clean. Food was not awesome."}
{"text":"Great treatment.  Tasty food.  Clean.  Friendly.  Price is right.  Very accommodating.  My first thought for Chinese food is to patronize Little Shanghai.  Bring your business here.  Even if you live a bit far away, the drive is worth it, in my opinion, because they treat you well and give you the food you want.  Go see for yourself."}
{"text":"Great Chinese food at a great price. I can not speak for the actual restaurant atmosphere as I have only ordered delivery from this establishment, but my experiences have been excellent. 

I wanted delicious staple Chinese food and that is exactly what Little Shanghai has consistently given to me. My go tos are the crab wontons, a sizzling chicken and rice soup, and the Singapore noodles without peppers.  There is plenty of food leftover for lunch/dinner the next day. 

The delivery time has always been about twenty minutes shorter than what was quoted. Every time. I love it. Thank you for a dependable, quick meal when cooking just is not on my agenda for the evening. You have a loyal patron right here."}
{"text":"The $6.50 lunch special here is an incredible deal. You get soup to start, and then your main course comes with fried rice, a fried wonton, and a spring roll. I had the lemon chicken, and it was great-- very tender, yummy sweet sauce, and tons of chicken. I will definitely return."}
{"text":"The staff is always friendly.  They never ever get a Pick Up or Delivery order wrong (tested over the years).
This restaurant does a great job with Hot & Sour soup, it has a lot of stuff in it including nice fat shrimp which I love, very complex flavors. YUM
I am an eggplant fan - they treat it right!  Spousal Unit favors the Kung Pao Beef which is not on the menu but they always make it for him with a smile (its fried, you have been warned).
I love this place, its like going next door to your friends house and having her Chinese Grandma cook for you!  Down home, good portions, veggies are never overcooked!"}
{"text":"We called for delivery at around 6:45 or so, and were told it would be between 30-45 minutes; it took a little longer, but there was a good reason!  When our delivery man arrived at the door breathless, he told me his car had broken down a few blocks over where he was making one delivery, but rather than make us wait, he WALKED all the way with our food to make sure we got it!  Tremendous service! 

The food was delicious, and worth the wait -- plus, SUPER generous portions.  We got Chicken w/Veg and Orange Chicken, and there's enough left of both for at least one, if not two more meals.  The crab puffs were excellent, as well.

It's nice to have a good, reliable Chinese delivery in the center of town!"}
{"text":"Chicken egg foo young is amazing. I tried to order food there today but they are closed for Holiday so I ordered some where else and I'm so disappointed it made me realize how good Little Shanghai is"}
{"text":"Absolutely typical mid-range Chinese fair. The Pu Pu platter that other reviews raved about was middle of the road, with the eggrolls at the low end and beef skewers a bit better than average.

The House Special Sesame Chicken was good, but nothing special, and a bit too sweet for my taste. The Moo Shu Pork was not bad at all, but was absolutely typical of the dish.

In general, it was slightly above average for typical Chinese food fair. Nothing special to remember the place, and there are a dozen others like it in town.

At 6pm on a Saturday night, we were the only table when seated, with two other tables being seated afterwards, but there were at least 5 phone calls for takeout while we were there, there was certainly nothing about the decor to recommend eating in versus takeout."}
{"text":"This is my favorite chinese restaurant!  I go about twice and month and if I lived closer I would go more often.  Their mongolian beef is great!  Their lunch special is a great deal if you dine in."}
{"text":"Ordered from here and something told me not to but I did anyways. It was just on the other side of gross. It was delivered very quickly and that was nice and the lemonade was really good. That's it though, those are the two highlights. I ordered a shrimp dish that was so bland I couldn't tell which bites had the shrimp or were just white rice. The other dish was chicken and i took a few bites of it and wish it's only problem was blandness. Yuck.....those two dishes with one large rice and a large lemonade cost me over $30 never again"}
{"text":"I really love this place. A friend of mine who is the \"know every great place foodie\" told me about Little Shanghai and I can't agree more. 
More down the line of Thai food - they have some seriously hot dishes - but know how to calm them down if you ask.
Their summer salad: the Cold Calamari salad is the BOMB! It's a chili and ponzu-esque sauce and fresh tomato, onion, jalepeno and boiled calamari are a flavor sensation that you will find you will have to return for again and again.
They have a great beer selection and the service is always friendly."}
{"text":"$35 for some noodles and burnt chicken. Wow. However, they do not skimp on the fortune cookies."}
{"text":"Great food with quick delivery. I would recommend calling the restaurant direct for delivery. I use the Yelp app and it always takes an hour longer."}
{"text":"Good stuff, real stuff.  Owned by real Chinese.  We have gone here for twenty years. Always a good and an honest meal at quite a fair price. Not cheap but not expensive. Quite nice inside too. I heartily recommend it. Get one of the big, round tables for a family feast and put some of everything on the lazy Susan.  Relax and enjoy."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere with good food service was good, lots of seating area.

When you walk in you're faced with great lighting and an elevated seating area it was very enjoyable."}
{"text":"The shrimp fried rice and teriyaki chicken were good, but the rest of our order left a lot to be desired.  The crab puffs were missing a key ingredient....the crab!!!  That was really disappointing.  The beef and broccoli and cashew chicken didn't score high marks with our group.  Not sure we will give them another try."}
{"text":"Great authentic Chinese food! Will definitely be back. Doesn't look like much from the outside but it's what's inside that counts and it was amazing."}
{"text":"We ordered delivery. The eggplant is fantastic and was the star of the evening. I would definitely order it again. The other dishes were just ok (tangerine beef, general Tso's chicken, cashew chicken, egg rolls) but the eggplant was so good that I didn't even really care.  I would definitely order from them again."}
{"text":"Been here a couples these last couple of weeks. Lunch combo is great here and the service is great very quick too! 

This will definitely be a regular lunch spot since it is so close to work."}
{"text":"I was invited to lunch here by a former co-worker.  In short, the food was fantastic.  Fast, good and lots of it.  Their lunch specials are very affordable.  Service was friendly and fast.  I always get their almond chicken and it is delicious.  Spring rolls are good as are the fried wonton.  I understand the soup is really good as well.  I've been back a few times and it is always good.  Getting lunch from there today for myself and two co-workers. :)"}
{"text":"Reasonably priced but the food was not good. Ordered shrimp fried rice, the shrimp was rubbery and had a very intense fishy smell. The Mongolian beef had a weird taste to it and made my friend sick. The orange chicken was bland. Probably won't be ordering again. Boo I was hopeful by previous reviews."}
{"text":"By far the best Chinese food in the valley. The interior decor is terribly dated and looks straight out of late 80s early 90s nightclub and lots of ceiling tiles need replacing. Many would view this as a drawback but they don't get the genius. The staff is friendly and familiar. Hot & Sour soup is the best item on the menu. Beef sticks are a close 2nd. The only mediocre dish is the duck. Overall a great place at a great price!!!! Would give them 10 stars if I could"}
{"text":"Little Shanghai has pretty good chinese food. I had some sort of shrimp and chicken dish (I forget the name), and found it made for a decent Sunday night dinner. The restaurant itself is small and the staff is a little icy. All in all though, it's worth checking out."}
{"text":"One of the best Chinese restaurants in Pittsburgh. It's a little small and the restaurant itself may look dingy but don't be fooled. The food here is delicious. Definitely go with someone who can read/speak Chinese to order the more authentic dishes.

Some things to order:

Salt and Pepper Pork Chops
Steamed Fish (Dou Su Yu)
Flounder (Xue Cai Long Li Pian)"}
{"text":"Delivery took over 1.5 hrs.  Food was average but was not pleased with the delivery time, especially for fast food Chinese."}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice now. The first thing that you will notice is that the restaurant completely looks like crap ; they are going for the authentic vibe apparently.

The first time I had chicken with garlic sauce ($6.40 with tax), pork with dried tofu (~$12), and the second time had chicken with dried tofu ($12.85 with tax). Overall the winning dish was the Chicken with Dried Tofu (but the pork variant was good too). The lunch menu prices are insanely cheap around $6, but you don't get a ton of food either. The chicken with garlic sauce dish was loaded with veggies that I dislike, such as celery, but the flavor was pretty good. The lunch special came with 2 crab/cheese ragoons which were very good. 

Service is non existent. Water didn't come with ice, and there were no refills. 

Credit cards are accepted here and as of the writing of this review doesn't have a minimum charge like most Chinese places do.

And getting down to the creepy washroom is a challenge unless you are from Vietnam.

One possible complaint is that the second time I ate here, I developed a headache about an hour after eating and it went away a few hours later which concerns me that large quantities of MSG is used here (I am sensitive to it). Be warned.

{"text":"went to Little Shanghai last night (wednesday) with a friend; we were in no hurry, had a lot of personal stories to catch up on, so the slow service didn't bother us.  they were busy and i think there were only four people working: Dad in the kitchen, Mom taking orders, and two boys who didn't speak much English delivering food and cleaning.  we shared some pot stickers that were excellent and a spicy sauce with fresh scallions; Tommy had the lemon chicken - breaded boneless, skinless breast in a tart and tangy lemon sauce; i talked to Mom and asked for suggestions, and wound up with crispy noodles \"with three\" - turned out to be shrimp, beef and pork.... plus some lobster bits and pea pods, broccoli, oyster mushrooms, water chestnuts, bean sprouts, carrots-celery-onions (if i said Mirepoix would that be snooty?) .... anyway the dish was delicious!
We spent a casual 2 hours with great food in a comfy place for twenty bucks apiece including wine and beers.  the food was fresh and properly prepared - a good Chinese restaurant catering to Arcadia Honkies."}
{"text":"There are so many Asian restaurants, including the Chinese Cultural Center near by the office.  Little Shanghai has been by far the most consistent with the quality and customer service.  The delivery is super quick to our office (about 2 miles away), they never miss an order and the food is great.  I always get the Beef and Broccoli and the office usually splits a few orders of Pork, Vegetable or Chicken lo mein.  Very yummy stuff!

2 years later, still great food and service!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Only thing good here is the grandma salad and terr chicken. Everything else ordered hurt everyone's stomach after they ate it. Heads up!"}
{"text":"Food is good but I was told I could not have a refill on my soda... Completely turned off by this. You charge me $2 for a soda and will not give 1 refill? Shame!"}
{"text":"Over prices for quality! No lobster in seafood platter. Pushy and rude waitress. Owner picked his nose behind the bar before making a Mai tai! Seriously."}
{"text":"Came here on a recent Sunday for lunch with some friends.  Our friends have been here many times and said that Little Shanghai is recently under new ownership.  They open at noon on Sunday and we arrived just after they opened, were the first customers of the day.  I am not sure the sign on the door indicates hours for Sunday??  Anyway, we received attentive and pleasant service.  All 4 of us enjoyed our meals.  

We ordered chicken egg fu young, lemon chicken, sweet & sour pork, and chicken w/ vegetables.  Most of the entrees were around $9 each and came w/ family-style white rice.  No lunch specials/combinations available for Sunday (maybe same for Saturday?).  Portions were large and we all ended up with take-home containers for another meal.  Overall I thought the food and experience was good.  I would like to try lunch special when they are offered, would be nice to see something like this on the weekend. 

The waitress said they will be open through all the holidays including Xmas and New Year's.  Something to remember if you don't feel like cooking...."}
{"text":"Best Chinese restaurant in Pittsburgh. You've gotta try it."}
{"text":"Little Shanghai's chicken lo mein was just what I needed to keep me running during the Texas Hippie Coalition concert across the road at Altar Bar the other night. Noodles as thick as bass strings, chicken as tender as woman's kiss, it was so succulent, I downed it in...

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92NrGpC9bng

Well, not really. Haw."}
{"text":"I don't think I stopped smiling once the entire time I was at Little Shanghai. This place is so reminiscent of the Chinese places I used to go as a West Side youngin. It's a composite of everything that I adored at the age of eight.  Someone could have reconstructed this place based off odds and ends plucked from my noggin. Dinner here seriously made my night and was a trip down nostalgia lane.

I suppose it doesn't hurt that the decor hasn't been remodeled since the mid 80s or early 90s, and is therefore in keeping with everything I think a Chinese food place should be and more. Splashy, geometric tablecloths and carpeting, tall cut glass dividers, raised dining area, strage L shaped booths and large circular tables.  All of which looks like it was designed around the needs of Delta Burke and other Designing Women lunching on Peking duck in their shoulder-padded power suits. For serious.

Now everyone needs a bit more pomp in their life, so make temporary peace with the nemesis that is fried food and indulge in The Flaming PuPu Platter of Delight.  Fried shrimp, fried chicken wings, fried crab rangoon, fried wontons and to be (relatively) health conscious, beef strips on skewers.  In the middle of it all, towering above the fried feast is a small iron grill all aflame, so you can roast your little beefy sticks to sizzling perfection.  Try to imagine how effing cool that is to a six year old's fruit fly attention span, and how pretty effing cool it still is 20 years later. Fire! Caveman brain grunts, \"Good.\"

So resign yourself to the fact that you're totally going to mow down a thousand calories in PuPu platter form.  Believe me, sometimes it's just the right thing to do.  Now if you really want to dine in style and have a friend in tow, pay 14 bucks apiece and order the supreme super deluxe dinner special that includes: One glorious PuPu platter, your choice of soup, two entrees, and fried rice.  You'll feel like a king sitting down to your feast of plenty. You'll be full after the first two courses.  You'll have more leftovers than you'll know what to do with.  But again, sometimes it's just the right thing to do.

This is my new go to place in the Arcadia district for Chinese. With this, Mama Mia, The Vig and Over Easy all in the same intersection, I've got breakfast, lunch, dinner and my drinkin' needs met. And it's cheap enough to order out and have an awesome Chinese dinner at home. Recommendations: The house sesame chicken, the house lo mein, the wonton soup and The Flaming PuPu Platter of Delight. Seriously. Do it."}
{"text":"Obsessed with their Orange Chicken:) Love how nice they are and I am supper picky when it comes to Chinese food."}
{"text":"I love me some take-out Chinese. My body is programmed to crave it every Sunday night. 

I've never eaten at Little Shanghai (only take-out) but what everyone is saying is spot on... very 1990's Chinese restaurant decor, which I kinda love. It's absolutely not a place I'd want to go for a date night (I'd feel very upset I'd wasted the time and effort getting cute because you probably won't see other human beings - probably why they offer a 20% discount for sit-in dining) but its great for good, reasonably priced take-out Chinese food.

I've had four-star experiences at Little Shanghai but in general I'd give it 3-stars. I get Moo Goo Gai Pan - basically chicken and vegetables and its good but could use a little more flavor. My husband gets the sweet & sour chicken or Seseame Chicken and they could use some vegetables and more chicken, less breading. 

The house fried rice is tasty and the egg rolls are pretty good. It looks like I need to try this Pu Pu Plater everyone is raving about."}
{"text":"Went here for the lunch special last week for the first time. I ordered the beef broccoli which came with egg flower soup first which was deliciously fresh and hot. Then came the lunch platter! Wow! Beef broccoli, egg roll, fried wonton, fried rice, as well as 2 condiments of hot mustard and sweet and sour sauce. I thought it was delicious, all of it! Definitely going back."}
{"text":"Nice quiet, unique building, atmosphere and seating arrangement. The staff is always extremely friendly and more than happy to cater to requests. Food is great for dine in , take out , or delivery. Since moving to the area little Shanghai has become my 'go-to' for Chinese food."}
{"text":"This place has pretty good. Food was fresh and the service was good. Just not the best chinese food I have had in phoenix."}
{"text":"Favorite Arcadia Chinese Delivery!

We've tried a few different places in the area, and decided Little Shanghai is consistently our favorite! Great spring rolls, wonton soup.  Have had everything from mu shu, fried rice, chow mein (beef chow mein is our usual order), etc... it's all good! 
The meat seems better quality than other chinese takeout.  Staff is friendly, have never had an issue with wrong order.  Also - huge props, they bring the order in a sturdy box, especially when ordering soup, so that's appreciated.  Delivery usually takes 45 minutes on a standard night.  Only complaint is that we've gotten food that is a little cold, probably on busier nights when it takes more like 45-60 mins."}
{"text":"I ordered (for delivery) the honey ribs, crab puffs and mixed fried rice. What a disappointing experience. The order was submitted at 5:52pm and it arrived -cold- at 7:06. The ribs where as \"hard\" to bite into as a piece of wood. The crab puffs appeared stale and tasteless. The only passable item in the order was the rice. The driver, Timmy is a VERY incompetent employee who doesn't know how to deal with a disgruntled customer and was extremely foul mouthed.  I spent over 30 dollars in this order and it was a complete waste. I will NEVER order from this place again and will take every opportunity to discourage my friends, coworkers and clients against doing so as well."}
