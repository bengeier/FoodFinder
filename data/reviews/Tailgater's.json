{"text":"This place is an absolute joke. Jacque the bartender is ignorant, rude, and constantly under the influence of either alcohol or pills. My first time there, she asked me to find someone that wants to buy pills and I was highly offended. Also, I caught Jacque red handed trying to add drinks on to my tab that weren't mine to make the bill higher, and when I called her out on it she had me thrown out of the bar immediately bc she knew I was blowing up her scheme. If you're looking for drunken, rude, ignorant, and low life company, enjoy a night at tailgaters with their loser patrons and drug addict bartender."}
{"text":"I know cigarette smokers who cannot stand the smell of this bar it's so strong. I lost my friend at this bar and it ended up she was in the bathroom doing shots with bartender, Holly, while on the clock. I would consider taking down that \"best bartenders\" sign they paid a lot of money to put up and invest in surveillance for their staff instead."}
{"text":"Neat little place for a sandwich or wings.   Had the wings...spiced whole wing that come in a brown paper bag if you get it to go.  Very good, very nice flavors and spice.  One/half of a sandwich that is Pittsburgh style is about 9 inches....Wow is it big!"}
