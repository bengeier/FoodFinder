{"text":"I'm not a gambler but not having any luck in finding a place near my hotel to captivate me to give it a roll of the dice. I played it close to the chest and went to Stentson's

I tried the chicken parmesan after seeing the menu was limited after burgers (I simply was not in the mood for a burger, am I getting old?). The chicken parmesan was good but can't say it was 'yum yum for the tum tum' but it satisfied the hunger for the night.

The service was OK when it comes to basic service, but my server was a bit on the quiet side but could be she saw no reason to turn on the charm for a guy who is so old, he isn't even interested in a burger.

In fairness to Stentson's the choice of burgers and how they are prepared did sound appealing and am confident that if I was to bet on it I come away with at least 3 stars and perhaps I get some"}
{"text":"We've tried this place a couple more times since June.  They have a great staff here.  The handpay cashiers are also the peeps that get your drink orders.  The two lovely ladies with the long hair as well as the dude with the cute smile are the best and all are so sweet.    It's so nice to enjoy yourself someplace and forget about your worries and troubles.  This place is definitely a great place to relax when we play in Henderson. : )"}
{"text":"I took my dad here for lunch. The food was alright. I had the spinach dip for lunch and I would never get it again, not even as an appetizer. The long island iced teas were premixed with a touch of coke and a touch of triple sec. My dad liked the wing and fry combo plate. I won't be returning. The service was great and polite, but really slow. There were only one other couple in the restaurant and the food took a while."}
