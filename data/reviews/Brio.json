{"text":"We went to Brio at Piedmont Row Dr in Charlotte, NC. around 2 weeks ago on a Saturday. We were very disappointed with their new menu and new decor. One of their best appetizer was the bruschetta which they eliminated. The menu was a cut to approximately 1/3 of the old menu.  There was no specials on appetizer and entree. We loved the original decor which gave a Tuscan feel to the place.  We used to love Brio but don't think we will be back."}
{"text":"I'm finding my experience to be rather in line with what many of my review predecessors have said.  I went there the other day with my partner and my sister in law; we wound up there by chance, because it was after 8:30p on a Sunday and we're in the Cleveland area ... most everything else was closed.  The place looked nice enough, and they serve Italian food, so how bad could it be, right?  I'll start off by saying the food wasn't horrible or anything, but it's far from impressive.  For starters, I was looking for some sort of basic pasta.  I don't eat  pork or shell fish and I wasn't in a meat mood, and I thought there would be a number of veggie options: ravioli, gnocci, risotto, canalone, eggplant parm ... other than the Chinese, I think the Italian's always have great vegetarian options, don't they?  Well Brio doesn't.  The only thing on their menu that came close was some bland looking angel hair pasta thing.  For those of you who are wondering, \"why not just pick a dish that looked good and ask them to take out the meat or other offending part?\"  Well the reason is that all the dishes had been created to incorporate everything as an inextricable feature.  It would be like asking someone to take the meat out of a meat sauce or the shellfish out of a lobster broth.  So after scouring the menu incredulously, I decided to switch gears, and I chose the roasted chicken.  It was one of the less expensive items on the menu at $16, and it was one of the few things without a procuitto crust or an andouille remoulade, or some other extraneous use of a pig, for no clear reason.    My partner got the shrimp & scallop risotto, and the other got a seafood pasta dish. Those dishes were both about $20.  My chicken was perfectly fine.  It was a large portion, not dry, and quite tasty.  The others, however, found their food extremely salty; the risotto looked like a pile of white mush on a white plate, and the pasta was nothing special either.  I clearly got the best bargain, as far as price, quality and taste.  And the service ... wait, what service?  Well my co-reviewers are absolutely right, and it's a shame the Brio management isn't reading these reviews, because it seems pretty crappily consistent.    When we were seated, the hostess gave us menus, and our waiter arrived about 2 minutes later to ask if we were ready.  We said we needed a few minutes and he told us he'd bring us some bread and come back shortly after that.  After about 5 minutes of perusing the menu - a disappointing perusal for me, as I mentioned before - we had all decided what we were going to order.  Our waiter had not returned with bread, nor was he anywhere to be seen.  What we did see was a crowd of wait staff hanging out by the pass, chatting and ignoring the tables.  Another 10 minutes passed, and still no sign of our waiter ... no bread, no order taking, nothing.    Finally I flagged down a different waiter and told him we were waiting on bread and ready to order, and we'd appreciate it if he could get our guy.  He barely acknowledged my request and disappeared.  About 5 minutes later (it was at least 20 min total) our waiter came back with bread and asked what we wanted to order - no apology, no excuse, nothing.  This appears to be Standard Operating Procedure at Brio.  I already told you about the food, but the poor service continued throughout our meal, while the crowd of wait staff continued to mill about in plain sight near the kitchen.  Our waters went unfilled and our plated un-bussed for a LONG time.  I won't go back.  The menu selection doesn't  meet my taste; the service is atrocious and the prices are on the high end for what they serve.  In short, don't waste your time, money, or calories."}
{"text":"One of the best meals I've had in a long time...or ever. We came in drenched from a mini-typhoon, but were warmed right up by friendly service, a mellow acoustic band playing some folk and classic rock classics, and delightful food.  My parents and wife and I were new to Charlotte and we were looking for a few good meals.  Brio definitely pleased.  All four of us were very pleased with our entrees (I had the pork chops).  Based on the reviews I've read for Barrington's, it seems like it's a local favorite. However, I have to say that even after eating at Barringtons a couple of nights later, we unanimously all preferred Brio."}
{"text":"WORST DINNING EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE...  Let me begin by saying that Brio used to be one of my favorite places to eat whenever I was back in Ohio. That all changed thanks to one arrogant, unprofessional, rude and disrespectful manager named Chris Snyder.  I've never EVER been treated so inappropriately in my life and the fact that Brio would ever put someone like Chris Snyder in a customer facing position astonishes me. Not only should he be fired for the way he treated us but he should never EVER be allowed to be in a customer facing position ever again!   We understand that mistakes happen at restaurants especially on a busy night, but we had 8 people dinning with us that evening and when half of the table had either cold food or mistakes to their meal we thought we should let a manager know.  As any good manager SHOULD want to know when things are not being done properly...but apparently Chris did NOT want to listen to us nor did he want to work to make sure these same mistakes didn't happen again.  From the second that Chris Snyder the \"manager\" at Brio came over to our table he was unbelievably rude.  My sister was going to let him know about the issues we had with the food and instead of politely coming to her he basically said \"I can't get to you where you're sitting so you can come to me\".  OKAY... So she gets up, walks over to him and lets him know that we had 2 meals that were cold, one pasta dish was supposed to have Feta cheese and it didn't, another dish had basically raw vegetables and shrimp that came out like burnt hockey pucks, etc...instead of any apology or concern that this many mistakes were made just at OUR table he basically says \"well what exactly do you want me to do?\"  EXCUSE ME? Did you really just say that? We responded saying we didn't want anything we just thought he should know as that's an alarming amount of mistakes at one table.  After barely listening to what we told him he then basically insinuates that we came for a free meal so he'll take care of our bill for us.   He came back a second time and my boyfriend who owns a restaurant quietly and politely says that, \"he has some restaurant experience and it seems like the expo guy isn't paying close enough attention,\" as it's the job of the expo guy to make sure that the meals aren't coming to customers cold, without ingredients, etc.  Chris Snyder did NOT like my boyfriend's advice and Chris snidely and condescendingly says that he's glad my boyfriend has had \"some experience working in a restaurant but that it's not the \"expo\" guy but rather the executive chef making all those mistakes.\" Your executive chef? WOW...not something to brag about that your executive chef can't cook these meals properly!!!!!     It baffles me that anyone would ever let Chris Snyder speak to customers and I'm appalled at the way he spoke to us. Brio, you can thank your very rude and unprofessional \"manager\" Chris Snyder for driving away not just a few customers but quite a few VERY regular customers."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 11 stars I would. My husband I got married this weekend in a small ceremony with just our immediate family. In the interest of bypassing the craziness of wedding planning we decided on a small ceremony and a nice dinner out afterwards. After doing a bit of research we decided on Brio. None of us had ever been before so it was a gamble but it was the best decision we made for our special day.  I came in with the expectation of a dinner and they made our experience feel so special that it could have been a small reception. A beautiful private room was set aside. We had two waiters for 6 people [Gary and Dan were absolutely phenomenal]. They even brought out our cake for us to cut together as the bride and groom.  The food was out of this world. We ordered the calamari, breschetta, and the shrimp and eggplant for an appetizer. The shrimp was wonderful. My husband doesn't even like egg plant and he couldn't get enough. The entrees and drinks were just as great. The steaks were generous and cooked to perfection, the lobster bisque was the best I had ever had, and the pasta was fresh and perfectly balanced. At the end, the GM Robert came over and promised us a free dinner for our 1 year anniversary. It was special from beginning to end. We will be back for our anniversary and many more times before then. Thank you for making our day so memorable!!"}
{"text":"8 of us for dinner on a Friday nite. Ordered surf & turf but they had no bernaise sauce to go w/ it. Caprese Salade was fabulous Could NOT hear each other speak because the band was very very loud. So no conversation at the table.  I would go back but not when the band is playing."}
{"text":"Wonderful experience at Brio, our waitress Lauren was very attentive to our needs and made us feel at home.  The food was great and plentiful. Good job Brio!!"}
{"text":"WORST experience. Booked with Open Table for a Christmas Eve reservation. It was raining & there was an accident so called on the way to say we may be running late. Was informed our reservation could not be held more than 15 min. We made it on time. 1st issue- they're supposed to have Valet parking- we get completely out of the car without the 2 valet workers even acknowledging any of us (3) finally, after standing there waiting, my husband walks up to them as asks if they are going to take his keys? Their response, that the restaurant is open but valet is not. HOW RUDE to not even look up and stop someone from stopping and getting out of the car, let alone standing in front of you obviously waiting to be assisted.  Then to the restaurant. My daughter and I walk in as my husband parked the car. We were informed that our reservation has a problem because Open Table malfunctioned and there are no more open tables. It is CHRISTMAS EVE I am immediately panicked, where are we going to just show up????! I go on to ask why no one called me? Their response was that they have been booked for weeks. This was from who I think was a manager or just a very aged hostess. I was beginning to fume at this point. I asked how was I supposed to know that?! We've never even been there before! They were acting as though it was my fault for booking a reservation and not knowing they were booked. Again I asked, you didn't think to call to notify us ahead of time, or maybe during the call I placed saying we may run late?!?! This was absurd. Then they go on to say there's nothing they can do and that if we want to just stay, they have a table but it's in the lobby. LITERALLY in the lobby, next to a waiting couch. OMG it was terrible. Being that my husband just took 10-15 min to park, at dinner time on the eve of a major holiday, I just conceded. Furious, but I was trying not to lose my mind, after all, it was Christmas so we sat. The young hostess shared that people have been complaining. The server, Justin, was great. The food was ok. I was absolutely appalled that a manager NEVER once came by our table in the middle of the lobby to apologize profusely for the issues. We've never had such horrible service. We'd have been better off having fast food I'm comparison! Worst experience!"}
{"text":"Years ago, we tried this place and received bad service.  So happy we gave it a second chance.  Had the best caprese salad and Gorgonzola crusted beef medallions for dinner.  David, our server, was attentive and cheerful.  The cocktails were icy cold and the perfect mix of ingredients.  Looking around, it seemed all the patrons were having an equally enjoyable evening. Overall, the experience was exactly what we needed on a Friday night.  Give this place a go. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Service was fine, but could've been more personable.  The food was kind of bland.  It was good, but I expected more.  The italian wedding soup was excellent though.  The bread was very good.  The spicy tomato cream sauce I had on my pasta lacked flavor.   My wife's chicken sandwich with applewood smoked bacon and avocado, had very good flavor -I wish I had ordered that.    Overall good, but I expected more."}
{"text":"I eat at thus Brio about once a month or more. I was there on Friday for lunch. We arrived shortly after eleven thirty. Our experience was not great. They had plenty of servers but ours was really slow but she had plenty of time to talk with other servers at the bar. The food was ok but not great! They have a new menu for lunch which is a lot smaller than before."}
{"text":"I have been to few different Brio's in different states. This one is my favorite. Food tastes consistent every time and service and view are exceptional. My favorite is the happy hour menu. Great portions and great price. Must try"}
{"text":"They have good food, and the experience is OK... other than the fact that every single time I go there they somehow mess up an order as simple as a side salad! This has happened on multiple occasions. Obviously not the brightest bulbs on the Christmas tree work there."}
{"text":"Understandably, Friday evenings are very busy. Four of us arrived for a 6:45 reservation and were escorted to a comfortable booth. Our waiter was prompt and attentive, at first. Within minutes he was given two large (6-8 people) tables, and that was it. We were on our own. The food tasted good, but portions were small. This is rather surprising since pasta is sooooo cheap. Twice as much pasta, with the same amount of sauce and additions would have made a huge difference and cost pennies. What a shame. We were sitting in a booth adjoining the backside of the bar, and the music from the live entertainment was so loud we couldn't hear each other, even when raising our voices. Yikes! Dessert tray brought to the table had 3 choices. We were told there were other choices, but they wouldn't fit on the tray. Seriously? We decided against ordering one. I've been to Brio for private parties, and they did an excellent job. Plenty of attention from ample staff.  Brio has all the ingredients for a great Italian restaurant, but is getting the proportions out of whack. Small tweaks could really improve this place."}
{"text":"Great food, great service and great atmosphere. I'm never disappointed when I go here to eat. I love their spicy eggplant with shrimp and steak here. They also have great mix drinks and recently added the eggplant fries that is a MUST try!! I've also tried their lamb chops and its so juicy and tender!"}
{"text":"Gone down hill fast. Filet mignon ordered medium, came out raw to rare. Sent back and returned rare still. Vegetables were hard and uncooked. Hubbies salmon special was dry and flavorless. Never have yelped to complain, but feel the need . Brio's used to be worth the drive but sadly no longer is."}
{"text":"I like Brio... there i said it. I have to admit that I am stuck of 3 of the dishes there, so you wont get much try this or try that from me I go for  The Limone chicken the 1/2 lemon roasted chicken and the Shrimp and Lobster Fettuccine.. (only with angle hair) Stick with these 3 and you wont go wrong"}
{"text":"Very good. One of the few chains I will eat in. Had the Chopped Salad and Chicken \"Limone\" and, of course, the delicious warm bread and cool buttter. The service was excellent. I don't understand why it gets poor reviews. Much tastier than a 5 star deli sandwich."}
{"text":"Brio has the trappings of a good Tuscan restaurant, but the food falls short. I had the carbonara and it was slightly off. They used the wrong noodle--a penne instead of a papardelle or some larger flat noodle, and it was overdone and mushy. The carbonara itself was thin and tasted as if they had substituted olive oil for egg yolk and cream. It was underseasoned, which I corrected with cracked pepper. If you have never had a good carbonara you might be satisfied with this. I was not."}
{"text":"I had put in a corporate order on a Tuesday night (04/19/16) dinner for about 9 people and they ended up missing my order which was the lone vegetarian  order in the lot. When I went to pick up the delivery i could not figure out where to park they were kind enough to get the some one deliver to my car (so i could not check the order contents when I took the delivery. The total was around $167 and with tip the total was around $200).  Only an hour later i realized that my vegetarian dish in the order was missing and I called up the location to report the issue. Not only did they put me on hold for about 20 minutes after which some one finally put me in touch with the manager Diana. She was pretty rude and was basically told me that I was lying about the missing \"fettuccine rustica\" and said that the chef was 100% sure that the order was there.  Never have i received such a rude service in the service industry. As a precautionary note to folks putting in bulk orders please double check before you get the delivery. I would suggest that you avoid this place altogether if you are ordering takeout."}
{"text":"Brio has a new look and it's awesome. Lighter, brighter and fresher. Had the new shrimp napoli, della casa salad and peanut butter pie. We also tried the new fruit infused drinks and the blueberry cream soda. Can't wait to try more new items."}
{"text":"Had dinner there last nigh, Hostess was rude and not helpful. Staff were not presentable and just looked like they did not want to be there. Manager was no where  to be seen. Not the same as when it was just brio. to bad we used to like going there."}
{"text":"Great place but not for Mother's day.  They take reservations, but then take walk-ins even though they have no room. So it took us 3 hours for 2014 meal service was terrible and food was sub par. If they turned away the  walk ins because they were filled with reservations they would have made people happy giving, away fewer free comp meals [like ours] and probably  come out ahead. However by not politely turning away families at the door without reservations they served no one well.  It used to be our families go to place for family events and holidays.  Now we are trying out other places and definitely won't be there on mother's day.  Just a friendly warning before you make your plans."}
{"text":"My sister lives on Piedmont Row and we have been to Brio several times.  We have yet to be disappointed.  The waitstaff is always very attentive and the food is very good.  It can be a little bit of a wait on certain weeknights and weekends, but they do a very good job of managing their tables and getting you in as quickly as possible.  I will go again and again!"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant!  The service is consistently great, with a welcoming and attentive staff.  The atmosphere is perfect for just about any occasion concerning adults.  I have celebrated my birthday here a couple times and each time the staff has gone above and beyond to make the day special for me and my guests.  The food has such an authentic italian flavor and I have never had a dish I did not like.  Some of my favorites are the campanelle carbonara, lobster and shrimp ravioli, and the crab and shrimp cakes.  Friends have also told me the salmon is perfection as well as the veal.  The wedge salad and lobster bisque are also amazing.  On top of the great food and incredible staff, the atmosphere here is also amazing.  I love the decor and lighting.  I will definitely be a returning customer."}
{"text":"spent week in Raleigh... had lots of chain restaurants to choose from ... decided to give Brio a chance.. service Excellent.... my husband enjoyed the lasagna. Being an Italian and I can make this  eh....my entre  was good would go again if in the area .. good hearty food... for a good price... nice !"}
{"text":"I went back for a second time to Brio since the first had been un-memorable in a large group. The decoration is nice and seems to have a cool bar.  The food is mediocre at best, overpriced for what it is, bad mixed drinks. Service is OK."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here three times int he last 2 months. Out of the three times, the service was fairly good 2 times, but horrendous the last time. I watched our food sit in the window for seven minutes before it was brought to our table by a different server because ours had disappeared. The food was lukewarm and bland 2 out of the 3 times we ate here. I would expect this kind of food/service at an Olive Garden but not at Brio."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: This is a Pepsi place!  I absolutely adore Brio! I came here with family a few weeks ago and got seated right away. The atmosphere is very pleasant, there's a bit of mood lighting (though enough to see your food), and the main dining room was on the verge of filling up. The wait staff was ever so kind! The waiter I had (though with my fish memory cannot remember her name) was energetic and super sweet. She seemed to be actually enjoying her job, which is good, because if the waiter seems easily bugged, I tend to take it personally.  To start off, we ordered the spinach and asparagus dip as an appetizer. I was shocked when the waitress came out with flatbread, rolls, and butter, but then I realized that it was the typical bread that came with every meal. Shortly after, the giant bowl of dip came out. It was so good! It came with flatbread rather than chips, which gave the restaurant even more character than it had gained itself previously. And then came the entrees.  I command you to get the portobello raviolli. It is well balanced, the cream sauce it comes drowned in is above par, and even a picky person like me couldn't stop eating it. I ate until I absolutely couldn't stuff in another bite. But apparently I could, because we got dessert.  If you ask them for the options, they will bring out samples. You can't taste them, but our waitress describes them so vividly that we almost could. We decided on the chocolate lava cake that came with vanilla ice cream, and it was really impressive. Practically gourmet quality. The bill came out fast and we were on our way with no mistakes on the tab.   Therefore, that is why I recommend Brio to all people who have thy mouth."}
{"text":"I recently had a mix-up with one of my call-in orders, but wow was I impressed with the customer service. While the hostesses themselves were either hit or miss, the GM Robert absolutely had everything firmly under control. I will gladly order from Brio again because of the way he handled things. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"I love coming here when I'm craving Italian cuisine! The food is always great, but my favorites are the Ravioli de Bello and the Lobster & Shrimp Fettuccine. The service is always friendly and helpful, and I love to see that everything is always consistent.  Overall, great food, polite customer service, and a beautiful location!"}
{"text":"Tiny portions  Flavorless pasta sauce.  Expensive and so not worth it"}
{"text":"Good service,good food, nice decorum. You won't ever go wrong with the lobster bisque and the pork chops! And also the pasta dishes are top notch."}
{"text":"Well I'd like to know what \"reservations\" means at this restaurant. Still waiting to be seated 30 minutes after our reservation time! Seriously! I know things happen but it's quite annoying to start things off! I hope this isn't a sign of things to come when we're eventually seated! Three trips to the reservation stand and we were finally seated 50 minutes late! Now for a food review...don't get the chopped salad---not fresh tasting and too much dressing. Others had the wedge salad and enjoyed it. Lamb chops and Gorgonzola Medallions are excellent. Milanese Chicken was average. Overall the experience was not the best and it will be a long time before we come back."}
{"text":"The food is always delicious! However,  the service is pretty bad. They clearly do not have enough servers. Service is very slow. We waited over 35 minutes to get our entrées. Had to ask repeatedly for drinks. I don't blame the server thought. They had him working too many tables.  We will keep coming back, but it would be nice if the service could be addressed."}
{"text":"Brio is an affordable American Italian eatery in Southpark.   It was out second time eating here and the place is clean, very busy, and the staff is attentive and friendly.  The atmosphere is warm & relaxing with live music playing in the bar, but not too loudly to interrupt our conversation at the table.  I had the 5oz filet [med rare] and it was delish. The mashed potatoes needed mo butter imo, but no big, I stole some from our bread and slapped it on those puppies.   The server kept coming by and asked us how our food looked? Ummm, it looks fine?  I've never been asked more then once how my food looked. Truth be told, I'm MORE interested in how it tastes! Go figure. haha   I just think she was busy and kept catching us when our food came out.  Anywho, an enjoyable evening with good food and a beautiful lady! [the wifey]"}
{"text":"Our food and service by JAE was excellent !    It was my first time going and I wasn't disappointed to the least, felt the price and ambiance was good.  Will definitely be going back"}
{"text":"One of my favorite Italian restaurants for sure. The location and outside seating on a nice day is really fantastic. The food is great and the service is excellent. My favorite dish is the shrimp and lobster fettuccine."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times and have generally been underwhelmed. The food is slightly above average for non-chain Italian and the service staff and kitchen can't seem to get in sync. One such example was delivering my entree three minutes after delivering my dinner partner's salad and my lobster bisque. This is completely unacceptable for any restaurant. Perhaps the greatest strength Brio's has going for it is the live music sometimes offered in their lounge area. Unfortunately for Brio's it isn't either their food or service."}
{"text":"Walking into Brio, I immediately recognized the similarities with Bravo.  Our server was polite. The bread is always a welcome appetizer. On  a warm day, the berry lemonade was amazing. The lobster bisque is a great soup. However, my chopped salad had almost no dressing and was somewhat bland."}
{"text":"Bartender Sarah P. blew me away today with her amazing service! Although I haven't eaten at Brio for several months, she remembered my name, drink, and important aspects of my life. Couldn't have been more impressed with her genuine interest in me and my guest. Made us feel valued and appreciated and makes me want to dine at Brio more and more. Food was excellent as always. Thanks Sarah!!"}
{"text":"A consistently good (albeit a bit pricey for the quality) Italian spot with pretty standard fare.  Though the crowd can sometimes be a bit more dressed up than the food would suggest, we have found it to be relatively kid-friendly ... in our experience the wait staff (which overall comes across more as one you'd find in a franchised setting -- not really 'professional waiters') has responded surprisingly well to the usual needs of a young family (quickly getting kids' food out to the table, checking in frequently, etc).  Lots of seating indoors and out, so pretty easy to get a table when we've gone."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS CRAZY GOOD!!!!!!!!!! Shout out to ALL staff at Brio! The food is incredible, the ambiance relaxed and comfortable. There is free Valet parking (of course tips are accepted). For the appetizer had the crispy calamari, entrée short ribs, side brussels sprouts. calamari was tender - yet crispy with aioli   short ribs were fall off the bone tender with an amazing sauce sprouts had bacon among other favs in them and were delish  The GM Robert and his crew were amazing - I watched him check every table multiple times to make sure that all of their needs were met. Our server Gary was part of a team of 4 in one of the areas, all of his partners made sure we lacked nothing!. The place was busy but everyone there seemed to really be enjoying their foods, as were myself and my girls. My first time here - it will not be my last. This is a place to go as much as possible, and the cost for the food and service well worth it!"}
{"text":"Wish I could tell you about the food but that would require a reservation to mean something. 90 minutes after our reservation time we were still waiting to be seated \"very soon\". We gave up when we realized how many others were in the same situation and the couple next to us had waited over an hour for their food to be served at the bar."}
{"text":"Why mess with s good thing? Brio used to be such a great SouthPark restaurant ! Although the food we ordered was quite good, I definitely miss the classic feel of the former restaurant that fit the Piedmont restaurant scene so well. Starting with the hostess that greeted me wearing jeans and a hoodie! Seriously? I get the vibe is more casual now but looks sooo unprofessional. The colors are lighter throughout  the restaurant but the \"coastal\" look they were striving for just doesn't fit...  Service was lacking but the 2 small plates we ordered as well as the Brussels salad were yummy! Miss the awesome bruschetta they used to offer as well as some other classics. They will still probably get the transient customers so we will see..."}
{"text":"Service was great. Waitress was very nice. Food came out in great time. We were told 80 min on a table but we're sat in 20.  We say at the bar while we waited. Nice bar area great bar tenders.  Lobster ravioli was perfect. Brushetta  (shrimp) was so good!"}
{"text":"Loved our waitress Cynthia and the bruschetta with the tomato jam was \"the jam\".  Loved it!!"}
{"text":"Service here has been a consistent struggle clearly for management.  Lot's of mass production food and process sold as made to order.   Food arrives half hot...half cold every time.   Staff not trained to keep pace with the complaints heard coming from other tables.  Profuse apologies abound.    If not for my father-in-law who loves this abuse, and complains profusely at every visit... I would not eat here.    Perhaps it's just this location.  I would love to eat at their flagship store to compare.   It's not working here, that's for certain."}
{"text":"My family and I went for Sunday lunch and we had the greatest experience with our server, Travis. My Pasta Brio was delicious, but the rest of my family thought their meals were just okay. The bread they have there is special, as is the creme brulee. I would definitely go there again!"}
{"text":"AMAZING HAPPY HOUR that starts early and includes an extensive variety of cocktails and small plates.  You can definitely enjoy a variety of dishes for an early dinner.  You DO need to sit at the bar to take advantage of happy hour; however, Brio provides a wide range of seating and accommodates families."}
{"text":"The first and only time I went, I was on a date with my boyfriend at the time. We decided to try something new, and were still in our late teens, which meant, we didn't have a lot of expendable cash. We expected it to be just a little more upscale than Olive Garden.  The look of the place did throw us off. The employees were all dressed up but the place was practically empty, during a lunchtime hour too. I was just okay with my food, a simple over-priced pasta dish, while my boyfriend was really upset at his. He had paid almost $20 for an order of crab cakes, and to his dismay there were only 4 very small crab cakes. He was so upset that he only ate one, and when he got home, one of his friends ate the rest (which is a different story). Anyway, we ended up paying a lot of money for our budget for a meal that would have been half the price and more tasty at Olive Garden."}
{"text":"I love the new decor, blue and white. Very Italian coastal.  Fresh, bright and welcoming atmosphere.   Menu hasn't changed much.  The grilled salmon Fresca is a wonderful choice.  Grilled asparagus, roasted sweet potatoes, spinach, red peppers, pesto vinaigrette, Feta, tomatoes, balsamic glaze. A very colorful plate and not too filling.  The waitress very helpful and great service."}
{"text":"Great romantic night on the patio. I recommend going later than fighting thru the rush. Patio was perfect. Take your time here. Have a bottle of wine, the bruschetta sampler, great specials, and shared deserts.  Valet was convenient. Greeters hospitable. Our waiter was so kind! I wish I remembered his name for next time. Marco Bella runs a great team of chefs here.  Honestly I don't think I'd change a thing."}
{"text":"Was planning on dining at the Cheesecake factory, but the wait was too long.  So we decided to go to Brio.  I ordered the Shrimp linguine and lobster bisque.  The lobster bisque taste like chardonnay.  The shrimp linguine was also mediocre.  No wait, good.  Food, not so much.  Maybe that's why there's no wait here."}
{"text":"Brio, Brio, Brio.  The location, outdoor space, and aesthetic is great.  There is complimentary valet and they were very quick to return my car upon exiting.  The food was pretty good.  I had some Mahi Mahi that was on special enjoyed it, but was not blown away.  I don't recall much about the service, but I think that is a good thing.  Given the upscale environs the price is also good.  You can get away with salad, dinner, and drink for about $30.  The beer selection is minimal, only national brands.  Good spot, sit outside."}
{"text":"Great place for business lunch or just to catch up with friends.  Food is fantastic!"}
{"text":"Got take out. Order a pasta dish (pesto angel hair), chopped salad with added shrimp and a   margherita pizza. Food was just ok and definitely overpriced. Thing we liked the most was the pizza but it was pretty salty. Also, customer service was not good. Person who took our order was not very friendly and same for what appeared to be 5 hostesses when we picked it up."}
{"text":"Brio has always been one of our 'go to' places.  Something has happened. Management change? Short staffed? We went on Mother's Day.  Had a reservation and had to wait maybe 15 minutes after our Rez time... no big deal... But the staff was running at a frenetic pace.  We had a waiter approach our table and say he be back shortly.... then another waiter came in as a sub.  My wife ordered tea.... after the third time asking for it she got it. (20 minutes after being seated).  The neat little crackers and bread?  No crackers but bread (finally) with no butter??   After dinner we want the hot chocolate cake with gelato.... maybe it should be renamed tepid chocolate cake...... not hot at all.... barely warm.   We've always liked Brios but now we'll think twice.  They'll get one more chance, but only one more. Oh.... and another thing..... they should hire a busboy .... the table across (and one across the way) from us sat empty with dirty dishes for 30 minutes.... (people waiting to be seated) And a runner (literally) ran our food out, and all but threw it at us......  I hope they get it back together."}
{"text":"Brio is always a solid choice for lunch or dinner. I've always had a good experience here and enjoy it whenever I go."}
{"text":"Dear Brio in Legacy Village: I have enjoyed your food, but when we were in town this weekend your shrimp made my boyfriend very ill and caused problems on our flight home to Chicago.   It will make me think twice about eating here next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"We are very disappointed with the quality of the food.  The name of the restaurant used to be Brio Tuscan Grill.  They kept the \"Brio\" and some of the same items are on the menu.  The Pasta Brio had lousy tasting sauce, a couple bits of chicken and a few mushrooms.  It makes you wonder if the restaurant is trying to save money by giving out very little chicken and vegetables in the dish.  My husbands pasta was not very tasty either.  A friend had lukewarm lamb chops even though the plate was warmed up.  He was given a few pieces of asparagus too.  The wine was served in stemless glasses.  A huge no-no if you know anything about wine.  Our server was very nice, or I would have given one star.  Brio is overpriced and has crummy food.  Sad"}
{"text":"Brio is a hot spot for their reverse happy hour.  Hard to beat $3.95 for a plate and their $5 drink specials.  You have to try their shrimp and eggplant and dip up all that sauce with their sourdough bread.  The brio burger hits the spot as well.  Go during a summer's evening on the weekend and you can hear a live band playing on the lawn!"}
{"text":"as far as chain restaurants go, this place isn't a bad one.  the food is decent, and they have plenty to choose from.  being the girl from hickville, i was the only one surprised to find they didn't offer as many pasta dishes as the average italian restaurant.  i mean, i guess that's not a bad thing, and maybe they're setting themselves apart from the flock.  but i was still surprised.  so the food.... i had pasta because i can't go to an italian type restaurant and *not* get it.  the sauce was pretty good.  not enough chicken, though.  and if i'm paying an extra couple bucks for chicken, don't slice me off a millimeter of meat and mix it into my dish and hope i don't notice that you're running low on chicken.   but i guess that's better that than putting something else in there and hoping i say \"mmmm...tastes like chicken\".  a friend had the crab cakes, which we joked were the crab cookies.  they were small.  how small?  well, ladies, think of your ex and how you want to describe him at your angriest.   eww.  i bet you're never going to eat crab cakes again, huh?    here's the general synopsis from the rest of the crew.  the pork chops were gigantic, and well worth the money.  and though it was pricey, the lobster bisque seemed to be a big hit, though i calculated at six bucks a pop for the amount they give you, that's about a dollar a spoonful.  for that amount, that shit better have gold in it.  interesting offerings of desserts, but i can't yelp 'em because none of us had room to try any.  service and ambiance?  i thought we had pretty good service, and our waitress was pretty on top of things.  she did disappear for a bit, and it seemed that those random disappearances only occurred when someone at our table needed something.  though when she *was* around she was over accommodating in a good way.  as for ambiance...not so much.  i felt like i was in an over-decorated warehouse.  it was noisy, and we had a difficult hearing people on the other side of table.  sure, the mood lighting said \"hey baby, how YOU doing\" but it was kind of...institutional.  if you want to take your lady out for a night of bam chicka bam bam, don't bring her here for setting the scene.    i'm just sayin."}
{"text":"Just got back from Brio Coastal Bar.  It was fantastic.  In contrast to my last review on 6/17/2017. Quite different.  The manager Robert spoke with me after my last experience.  I received a gift card to try them again. We went today with our kids before they left for college next week.  The waiter, Anthony, was on point for everything.  We received our drinks promptly and anticipated everything we needed without even having to ask.  But not in a hoovering kinda way.  We had our space to have nice conversations.  The new menu was excellent.  I think I even like it better than the previous menu.  The lobster bisque was awsome.  We all had something different and everyone loved their choices.    We will def go back to Brio. So glad we gave them another chance.  Thanks Anthony for wonderful service and your great wit."}
{"text":"A very classy upscale restaurant that we love to go to  Lobster bisque is best in town 2nd to none period!!  Shrimp is good too  Bread is nice too  Ambiance is great  More varieties of food will be better"}
{"text":"Very fresh. Lots of great gluten-free options which is what attracted me to them. Definitely be eating there again when I'm in town."}
{"text":"Amazing food, service, and entertainment. Went on a Friday night and the band that played had us there until they closed. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Brio and make a visit any time I'm craving some lobster bisque. Brio has the best lobster bisque I have ever had and I am a huge fan of their bruschetta sampler. I find that it's a great place to order a bunch of appetizers and share them with the table. I rarely ever get my own meal here because the apps are just too good!"}
{"text":"Underwhelming at best!  We came in as a party of 9 with reservation and were seated fairly quickly.  The waiter was clearly not a regular waiter (he later admitted that he tended bar, but offered to help because they were understaffed).  But he kept forgetting little things we asked for.  Three of us ordered the Strawberry salad and when they arrived, one had a decent number of strawberries, one had 2 pieces and one had none.  My salad had a sufficient number of all the things it was supposed to, though none seemed to have the onions, but the lettuce was wilted and it was clear the only reason I had everything in mine was because they made one big salad, splitting them out between the three of us; clearly mine was at the bottom.  At almost $14.00 per salad, this was hugely disappointing.  They were not terribly large salads.  My husband had a caper salmon which was flavorful, but the portion was very small (maybe 4 oz), a spoonful of overcooked vegetables, and a scoop of bland mashed potatoes; all of it lukewarm.  This was just under $19.00.    The prices for a chain restaurant with mediocre food at best are exorbitant and totally unjustified.  I won't be back anytime soon,"}
{"text":"Sunday brunch with dear friends and it was so good and refreshing.  Had the brio Benedict. Don't mind saying I would prefer a rusk or English muffin to a biscuit.  Waiter was friendly but seemed a little nervous while pouring coffee and water. The atmosphere is fun, festive and inviting.  Definitely would go back."}
{"text":"This is a very good place to have lunch! The lobster bisque was delicious! I also enjoyed the sausage and pepperoni flatbread. It is not too pricey and the atmosphere is warm and welcoming. The employees are friendly as well! I would definitely recommend trying it out!"}
{"text":"Brio is probably my favorite Italian food chain, and I say that as a former Maggianos and Olive Garden employee. If you enjoy vodka sauce or cheese ravioli, you NEED to experience the pasta alla vodka if you haven't already.  I first discovered Brio in college when it was still branded as a 'Tuscan grille' but also enjoy the newly rebranded 'Coastal Kitchen' theme as well. Both themes have beautiful decor and every location I have been to has had its own twist but the consistent experience has always been the service. Friendly but not intrusive servers that are good with questions, short waits, and usually a quick manager hello.   Food-wise, if you love bread, Brio has the best bread while you wait. They have a warm sour dough round and several herb seasoned flat bread crackers that are to die for. Get a second order just to dip in your entre sauce! At the Tuscan Grille Brio I would use the bread for their spinach and artichoke dip, which is not available on the  new Coastal Kitchen menu, probably because it is too addictive. This most recent visit we opted for the shishito peppers and a side of brussel sprouts, and the sprouts stole the show with their balsamic glaze, maple bacon and pecans. The shishito peppers were pretty good but even better when dressed in the leftover balsamic from the sprouts. For dinner, we went with two orders of the pasta alla vodka and were not disappointed. The spicy tomato basil creamy vodka sauce and fluffy cheese tortellini pockets are one of my favorite meals.  If you want a gift card to an Italian restaurant go with brio of the other chain places."}
{"text":"Being an Italian girl, I am very picky about the Italian food. When I go out to eat, very rarely do I opt for Italian since I can make most of the dishes at home. However, I had a BOGO coupon for this place and decided to check it out. It was a gorgeous night so we had a short wait for the patio area. I like how they have cushioned seats outside where you can get drinks and also eat if you choose to instead of waiting for a table. They had an intriguing selection of wine and I had a smooth, robust pinot noir while waiting for our table.  The service could have been better as our waiter wasn't too attentive. He did the job but forgot an item or two that we requested however the artichoke crusted beef medallions redeemed the bad service. They were absolutely perfect---cooked just how I ordered and they melted in my mouth. It was served with mashed potatoes and a hearty portion of fresh veggies and I couldn't have asked for a better meal. Others got the pasta which wasn't drowning in sauce, which is a nice change of pace compared to some Italian restaurants in the area. The chopped salad was wonderful as well-it reminded me of a greek salad.  I absolutely love the patio area, selection of wine and was very happy my meal along with the variety of their menu. They had traditional Italian dishes along with more modern Italian dishes so you can go old school or new."}
{"text":"Terrible service.  I had to ask the woman  who seated us to send over our server.  Train wreck.  Took a long time to get drinks and even longer to get our food.  Pasta sauce on my dish was watery.  No thanks.  Reason #62 why I dislike chain restaurants."}
{"text":"Drinks and an appetizer at the bar. Nice atmosphere, most everyone else were awaiting tables. We ordered the beef carpaccio appetizer and it was delicious, fresh, and just the right size for a light dinner for two. I'd definitely order it again."}
{"text":"If your a kid at heart and love spaghetti o's   Order: make your own pasta.. Rigatoni Tomato cream sauce With cheese melted in.   It tastes just like it!   I'm not big on them, so it will probably be the one and only time I go back.  My friend enjoyed her meal, but not enough for a second go.   I ordered two Mix drinks. Nicely prepared, but lacking in tasting good. The Hendrick cucumber drink & the peach sangria. Go to carabas to get a good peach sangria. Then, you'll know what I'm talking about."}
{"text":"Not sure if everyone got the same service we did, but we are happy. I was reluctant from poor service many years ago at another location prior to name change. Seated immediately with reservations on busy night, even though we were early. Table not bussed properly (no glasses, knife, or bread plates) but waiter fixed immediately.  Carpatio very good. Mustard a little sharp and hid some of beef flavor. Crunchy shrimp app a little greasy and cooked too low temp, but shrimp very good, cooked to proper doneness, high quality. I am a seafood snob. Would have sent back for this but was more interested in Carpatio. OK I had a burger at an Italian restaurant. Wasn't in mood for pasta. Wow. Great burger. Wife had shrimp and grits. Meh. If you liked smoked gouda go for it. I'll leave my shrimp and grits fix south of Mason Dixon line. She liked it. Pleasant experience. I will note several large parties and lots of food under warmers for way too long. Waiter or kitchen? Hard to say. At some point bring out that food and apologize for wait of other dishes. Will try again but hesitant if I had a large group. Now if our waiter was made head waiter.... Can't recall his name. Great job, sir."}
{"text":"Nothing really special here at all. To be frank, overpriced non real Italian food. They have a sister restaurant as well. Which has the same food and same menu."}
{"text":"We were out of towners looking for a good place to dine out and eat dinner, we stumbled upon this place called Brio Tuscan Grill, the place looks great the atmosphere seem lively and comfortable, and so we wanted to try their food.  The service was a bit slow, the menu was pricey like most Itialian restaurants, and their food was no impressive. We had ordered a pizza for our kids off the kids menu, and the pizza had no tomato sauce on the pizza which was strange when the menu said it comes  the pizza was  made with house tomato sauce along with cheese and your choice of topping. The manger took off the price of the pizza on our bill which was good customer service move because it was only $6. My meal was very tasty I had beef tenderlion with some mash potatoes and spinach salad their portion size was small not enough to share and the prices were high. We won't be returning to the Bro if we ever had to visit Cleveland Ohio again."}
{"text":"Happy hour is the best here. They also have a great little private room too! Mixed drinks are awesome, especially sangria. Pasta dishes are always pleasing. Heavy sauce and huge portions. I always leave stuffed. Servers are very knowledgable and seem happy- which is rare now a days."}
{"text":"Been here several times and it's pretty good. For a smaller Italian chain, it's menu is surprisingly detailed with many entrees, pasta, apps and salads. They have a nice outdoor patio and relaxing bar area. Been here for semi-private dining before as well and the space is large enough for a small work function/dinner. I usually get the veal marsala which is is good, though the portion is a little small. All in all a nice inexpensive option to the Piedmont area that contains Del Frisco's & Georges Brassiere"}
{"text":"We went to Brio last night to celebrate my birthday.  I had signed up for Brio's email club several months ago and got an email wishing me a happy birthday and offering me a free surf & turf dinner ($30 value!).  Naturally, I couldn't pass that up.  Plus, we had been to Brio before and had an exceptional time.  This time, though, we brought my partner's kids.  I was very impressed with the kids' menu.  It was quite extensive.  There were regular kids' portion size items and then there were bigger portion options for older kids.  Some were full dinners -- grilled chicken or a pork chop with mashed potatoes and broccoli!  Then there's the create your own pizza where kids can choose three items on top of their humongous-sized pizza (it's literally enough for two meals).    Anyway, enough with the kids' stuff.  I don't order steak out very often, but I have to say that the filet served with my surf & turf dinner was one of THE most amazing pieces of steak I've ever had.  It was so thick, tender, and perfectly cooked and seared.  I savored each and every bite, and there were a lot of them.  The crab & shrimp cake that I was looking forward to was delicious, too, but the filet really overshadowed it, both in size and taste.  Rounding out the meal were roasted veggies and potatoes.  It was just the perfect amount of food so I wouldn't be overstuffed for the birthday cake that was waiting for me at home. :)  My partner ordered the Sweet Potato & Chicken Risotto, which was prepared with pancetta, roasted chicken and sweet potatoes, grilled asparagus, Parmigiano-Reggiano, and pine nuts.  Our server described it as \"Thanksgiving in a bowl,\" but it was SO much more than that.  I tried a taste of it and it was incredible.  It had so much flavor to it, including hints of wine.  My partner gobbled it right up (pun intended).  I seriously think he could have eaten another bowlful.    Brio may look intimidating, but they're not as formal or pricey as one might expect.  Plus, they have a great, spacious, comfortable bar area, which I hope to experience sometime."}
{"text":"We came 15 minutes before close and let me tell you. Please be prompt if you want good service. The bartender was more than kind enough to come and take our order however. We were practically invisible to everyone else.....I'll finish this after I eat!"}
{"text":"This past Monday was my roommates birthday so we went to celebrate and came to this place. Talking about wonderful! The service, ambiance, the happy hour and 3.95 food specials are the best! Love it b/c it's a nice chill spot to go to relax after a long day of work or to just lounge and kick it."}
{"text":"Great time at the bar. The staff works together to serve everyone. The Beef Carpacio is great."}
{"text":"Brio used to be one of my favorite places. The food used to be good and we even had several birthday party events there. The last two meals I've had there have been very disappointing. The salads were soggy and wilted. The music was terrible and loud and made conversation almost impossible. It's a great location and it is unfortunate it has slipped in quality."}
{"text":"Would have given 5 stars, except it is a bit on the expensive side especially if you are going with a large group. However, the steak was cooked perfectly and came with delicious mashed potatoes as well as asparagus. Also the caprese appetizer was the best I have ever had!! Tomatoes and cheese were both super fresh."}
{"text":"Yum. Our waitress was Kayla and she did a wonderful job and served us some amazing food. My fiancé and I got the bruschetta appetizer to share (to DIE for) and the mushroom ravioli and the chicken pasta pesto for our entrees. Everything was delicious and the service was great."}
{"text":"Man, we just got back from a laughable dinner at Brio.  What a joke.  It is a prime example of just how low American's have let their standards get- mediocre Italian food with an astronomical price tag.  I looked around the packed restaurant at all the people eating the relatively tasteless, gigantic portions and felt a little sad.   We have eaten here several times.  The best thing on the menu is the chopped salad.  Tonight my wife ordered the ravioli appetizer that was described as \"romano crusted\" and came out so deep fried the NHL could have used them for hockey pucks.  I ordered the Tuscan pork dish which has two pork chops, a huge mound of unseasoned mashed potatoes and three miniature asparagus spears without the woody stems removed.  That's it.  No sauce.  Hardly any seasoning.  Not worth the $20.  Now let's move onto the service.  Shame on the Brio management for not teaching their servers how to open a bottle of wine.  Our server was so scared her hands were shaking.  She had no clue how to use the wine key- I mean couldn't cut the foil or pull the cork.  My wife is studying to be a master of wine, so we gave her a few tips and helped her out.  Completely ridiculous.    Other than that, she was relatively clueless about how to serve people.  She didn't bring a wine brick with the white wine we ordered, my wife ordered her salad tossed and it came out not tossed and they up-charged us for meat sauce on our son's tiny portion of ravioli even though we didn't order it.  It appeared as though she was helping every table around us even though we were trying to get through the meal quickly due to our child.  The desert was just terrible.  Don't order it.  For the price, walk around Legacy for a while and choose something else.  Anything else.  Jeez, this place is the pits."}
{"text":"i love my italian food and this place is great specially for a non traditional chain type of italian restaurant. the prices are really reasonable, always great service and a nice atmosphere. there complimentary breads are also really good.  i have been there a half dozen times and never had an issue. i recommend taking advantage of the valet parking as the parking situation in piedmont is not always to convenient."}
{"text":"THANK you for the excellent dining experience last evening!  Our server was Jackie, and she was extremely courteous, friendly, helpful, and attentive. Our food and wine were also superb all-around.  Fresh, delicious, perfectly prepared, and beautifully presented.  We sat on the outdoor patio and it was absolutely lovely. Thanks also to the Executive Chef, who personally visited our table to make sure we were happy with our selections and any substitutions. One of my favorite restaurants!  Well worth it to be on the e-mail list, too. Excellent specials all the time!"}
{"text":"I have been to many brio locations with my work travel. We had a nice company dinner here. The table was set up for us when we arrived. We were promptly greeted by our server and placed our drink orders. The wine selection was pretty extensive, which was a nice positive. Food quality was good for our salads and entrees. The service and attentiveness was poor. We had to keep requesting water and drink refills. Bread was provided but not nearly enough for a table of eight.   Will not return."}
{"text":"just had dinner at the bar here. nice crowd, and good bartenders who are busy but good natured and will joke around a little. drinks are good size. hankering for pasta and ordered the carbonara. it was great and an appropriate portion size, i could finish it without hurting myself. will defintely stop back when im back in Charlotte.  sporky mcnapkin"}
{"text":"My family and I chose to celebrate my dad's birthday this year at Brio's and we were not disappointed. We made reservations for 6:00pm on Sunday night. This was the perfect time, the place was not overwhelmingly busy and our service was fast.   Here's a rundown of our night:   Drinks: They serve some signature sangarias and martinis for only $5 so we helped ourselves to the White Peach Sangaria and a Cosmo. Both were pretty good (a little light on the liquor) but still very tasty.   Appetizers: My dad ordered the lobster bisque. It was fabulous! Very creamy and rich...with perfect flavors...Be prepared to practically lick the bowl! Yum. My mom had the Chopped Salad-cucumbers, tomatoes, feta cheese and black olives. It was also very tasty! Really good combination of flavors...and the dressing was delicious. I chose the Bistecca Insalata which is basically their version of a wedge salad. It's a wedge topped with Gorgonzola cheese and bacon with a creamy Parmesan dressing. I was a little disappointed with the ratio of lettuce to toppings...I could have used more cheese and bacon BUT the dressing was divine! Like, so good I asked for extra so I could dip the bread in it! Ha.   Dinner: My dad chose the Sausage Peperonata Pomodora it comes with sausage over angel hair pasta and tomatoes....delicious! It was a huge portion and the sauce was awesome! My dad really enjoyed it!  My mom had the crab and lobster cakes again winners...nice chunks of crab and lobster not a lot of filling or breading....I'm still dreaming about them! Mmmmm....I chose the Gorgonzola Crusted Bistecca with the filet and it was perfect. O.M.G! The meat was so tender and juicy! And the steak came out exactly as I ordered...and that cheese was to die for..I could seriously eat this...again and again! The only downer was the veggies, they were a little over cooked and not seasoned to my liking. But when everything else is so delicious this seems irrelevant!   We were wayyy too full for dessert! But everything on the tray they bring around looked wonderful! I'm definitely trying something on my next visit!   Go ahead! Give Brio a try! It's definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"The food is great but definitely expensive. I recommend the Caesar salad and really ant dessert, their all great"}
{"text":"We ordered from here again recently; the service is good but boy are there entrees TINY!!!  It was so embarrassing that we had to order extra food for our guests after the entrees came out. And I thought italian restaurants were supposed to have larger portions."}
{"text":"Dined there for lunch. My friend and I both had the lunch special which was a Seafood Salad. The salad consisted of mixed greens with tomato's, Gorgonzola cheese, pine nuts, 1 crab cake, a few shrimp and pieces of lobster. It was very tasty and very pricey. $20. YIKES! The problem was my salad also came with a rather long piece of plastic mixed in. Luckily I found it before I started eating. Our waitress was not around so we flagged down another. They quickly replace the salad, sans the plastic but didn't seem to upset about the mistake. The service was OK and the atmosphere was nice."}
{"text":"Went here last night for my MIL's birthday.  The service was okay - when we asked the waiter to take our photo I'm pretty sure he rolled his eyes.  But the food, the food was AMAZING!  My Hubs & MIL both got the lasagna.  I had the Pasta Alla Vodka and my FIL ordered the Pasta BRIO.    Hubs considers himself a lasagna connoisseur, and he says that the lasagna at Brio is THE BEST in Charlotte (2nd and 3rd place go to Mama Ricotta's and The Open Kitchen).  When asked to describe why Brio is the #1 lasagna in Charlotte he said, \"It's better than the other lasagna's because it incorporates alfredo sauce in addition to the red sauce.  I also believe that it's not sliced out of a large pan but built to order with fresh pasta.  It's also very meaty.  Can't be beat.\"  My FIL took a bite of the lasagna and said, \"That's the best thing I've ever eaten.\" :-)  I'm also convinced that my pasta alla vodka was made to order with fresh pasta and it was phenomenal.  If you're looking for a great italian meal in CLT you have to try Brio - and I highly recommend reservations, there was a big crowd on Saturday night."}
{"text":"I enjoyed a birthday lunch here with a long time acquaintance and family. Having reservations and valet parking were a big plus for our party of 6. The outdoor dining area was very enticing but the weather a little too windy and chilly. The spacious, pristine dining room however was lovely. Our hostess was welcoming and our waiter patient as our party arrived in pairs. We ordered a bruschetta sampler while waiting for everyone. It was beautifully presented and deliciously fresh as were the bread baskets that arrived with our entrees. The lobster bisque was my favorite part of the meal. It was everything it should have been. The entrees were the least impressive aspect of our meal except for the salmon which was exceptional. The pasta dishes looked tired and overdone. The chicken limone was bland but saved by the mashed potatoes. The meal ended on a high note with a trio of desserts for sharing. There was no clear favorite but there was not a bite left so kudos for the dessert chef. We had to ask a passing waiter for refills on our water but other than that our waiter was knowledgeable and efficient. Overall it was a pleasant experience and I will likely return."}
{"text":"Whenever I'm around the mall during the week, I always try and make it a point to stop here for happy hour. From 2-6:30 (and 9pm-close) they do bar bites in the bar area ranging from $3.95-$5.95. They also have a selection of cocktails ranging from $4-$6.  HH Drink Recommendation: The Italian lemonade ($4) -- vodka, gin & orange liqueur blended with fresh lemonade. It's basically a long island without the Coke ... and it's basically delicious. It's loaded with liquor, so you're definitely getting your money's worth for $4.   HH Bar Bites Recommendation: 100% first order should be the Black Pepper Shrimp ($5.95). It's 12 pan seared shrimp served over crusted eggplant (think eggplant parm without the cheese) and covered in a delicious pepper cream sauce. The Sausage, Pepperoni & ricotta flat bread ($4.95) has great flavors to it. It's just the right amount of spicy sausage toned down with ricotta & a house made tomato sauce. New to the menu is Italian \"tots\" ($3.95.) They're good, not quite what expected. They're basically breaded/crusted mashed potato balls with bacon & cheese. The brio burger ($4.95) is a full size burger served with chips, another great value.  If you're around Southpark after work, this is a great place to make a pit stop!"}
{"text":"Food is great but waiting 2 hours to get your food is not. Its my birthday & not really enjoying as I am still waiting .... May take longer ...brrrrrr"}
{"text":"I love brio's brunch menu! My favorite is the \"Eggs Benedictano.\" The eggs are poached to perfection and the potatoes are absolutely devine! I had to stop myself from eating. It was a failed attempt at portion control. You know when you're at the point where you're really full, but it's too good to stop eating and you've eaten too much to take home? Yeah.. that's where I was lol This is by far, my FAVORITE place for eggs benedict. The waiter tried to convince me to sway away and get the \"Berries & Cream French Toast\" which is brioche stuffed with marscapone cream cheese and topped with fresh berries and a vanilla cream cheese drizzle. He made a very convincing argument, but I was craving the eggs benedict. The french toast sounds amazing though so I'll have to try that next time!"}
{"text":"A lot like Olive Garden in my opinion, but a little fancier.  I really like the flatbread they bring out as a starter, but the other dishes are kind of hit or miss.  For the price, I'd probably go elsewhere to get better value for my money.  Never had a bad dish here, but never felt wow'ed either."}
{"text":"After a very long wait we asked our waitress when food would be ready.  She responded, \"If it was ready it would be here!\"    Then the minestrone soup came and it was just a thick mush like it was scrapped off the bottom of the pot.  We complained and she said,  \"this is how our soup is\". We asked her to take it away and she flounced away with it and banged it on the next table."}
{"text":"The food is excellent and the wait staff was great......have been 5 times in the past two months have yet to have a bad experience"}
{"text":"Brios was ok. I had the grilled shrimp and orzo and my wife had a grilled chicken salad and both were nothing special. The atmosphere out on the patio was nice though."}
{"text":"Went to Brio about a month ago. Ambiance as well as the service was great. Had the shrimp and grits, ok, a little light on the seasoning though. Drinks good. Will need to return and try desserts."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with colleagues and I don't think I will be returning. Half salad/sandwich combo took over an hour.  Salad was over dressed and the chicken pesto sandwich had a sliver of chicken and no pesto. Not worth the  $$$"}
{"text":"Service wise: terrible! We made an 8:30 reservation as a back up plan but were able o arrive by 7:00. When we checked in with the host he proceed to give us a rundown of \"how restaurant reservations work!\" Begrudgingly he sat us 30 mins later. After being seated I asked the waitress what the name of the dessert was at the the table behind us was eating.  When she replied \"mini desserts\" I tried to clarify if that's what they are called on the menu. She brushed me off and said \"I'll bring them out to you when it's time.\" She also hardly checked in with us and spilled water all over my friend's bread plate. HORRIBLE service!  Ambiane: classy. High celings, classy decor, clean.  Food: pretty good. The lemon chicken came with orzo and sweet potatoes that were great, and the side of grilled asparagus was delish.  The service and they way they treat customers make this a 2 star place. I would not go back and support such a restaurant."}
{"text":"What a beautiful restaurant.  The interior decor deserves 5 stars all by itself, it is absolutely gorgeous.  I love sitting in there, the surrounding is so beautiful and comfortable.  It doesn't have the look and feel of a typical upscale restaurant, it's like stepping into a beautifully decorated custom home.  Definitely a nice place to take a date."}
{"text":"Went for a baby showers and had appetizers and great food and really cool options, little pricy for what it is but they have great happy hour deals through the week!"}
{"text":"Dishes ordered:   - beef short ribs - NZ lamb chops - Pesca piccata - Sicilian roasted cauliflower  The beef short ribs were good, and the marsala sauce was a nice compliment.  The garlic mashed potatoes were flavored well, with the level of garlic and salt being just right.  The dish should have come with some type of nutritious green vegetable, though.  The lamb chops with melted Gorganzola were excellent.  Again, though, for the price, there should have been a choice of side dish.  The pesca piccata was a disaster.  It was clearly a pre-battered, frozen fish fillet, and the roasted brussel sprouts were severely undercooked, making only the outer leaves edible without risking severe gastric distress. The other vegetable side dish was OK.  The Sicilian roasted cauliflower was very tasty, but there was a bit too much cheese for my liking, leaving the dish over-salted and my mouth dry.  When I got home, I chugged some V-8 for the counteracting potassium, and my palette returned to neutral."}
{"text":"The food here was great, highly recommend the FTC (flat top chicken). Anyway, I went here for dinner and we had quite a large party. Being that I work in a restaurant as well I can always tell when a server didn't wanna take care of us. That night, we had two servers that were not happy about taking our party. We ordered our food and then it took an hour and a half to come out. Then, we didn't get out checks till about another 45 mins. Not sure why the kitchen was so slow that night but, I was not happy."}
{"text":"I have been here many times for brunch on the weekends or lunch. Glad to say they help out with finding out what is Gluten Free for me and what is not from the Chef since i have Celiac Disease. Love Love Love the brunch Mimosa's! the chef's special is always a winner too!   Even if people do bring their kids, it's almost too big, or they are just well behaved, to even hear them.  Recommend it. I know a good restaurant when i don't get sick within 72 hours. ( Celiac Symptoms) or when i eat the food and i don't spit it out because it's tasteless and gross!   Brio is definitely a go to spot that won't empty your wallet!"}
{"text":"Excellent service, food and atmosphere.  Highly recommended.  I had a nice salmon dish with a kale Cesar salad and it was all excellent.  Hot bread is served to your table.  Prices are fair, including the drinks."}
{"text":"Just fyi....I would have given only one star however, I don't enjoy cafeteria style Italian food so I am already biased against this joint. I should have known better. However, needed to get some food for the kids after a day of shopping. Made a reservation through \"Open Table\" for 7:30.....got seated around 8pm after arriving at 7:15 for our table. Manager apologized that they had some big parties earlier. Ok..but as a manager you need to manage your resources like turning off your availability in \"open table\" when you are slammed. Dining room was at an uncomfortable cold temperature.  Seated near kitchen....usually not.a problem for me. Couldn't believe the cacophony of broken dishes etc. coming out of that kitchen. Very unprofessional.  Bolognese sauce for spaghetti and rigatoni tasted exactly the same as the lasagna  sauce. At the prices charged...I expect a lot more. I feel like I get higher quality from Olive Garden. Water glass was brought to me approximately 2 inches lower than the other glasses of water brought to table. \"Uh....was somebody already drinking that?\" Gross! Then another couple sat down at the table next to us...I had placed my used napkin on top of the table inadvertently on a menu that was still lying on our table as we were eating. The couple asked to see a menu and the server grabbed the one out from under my napkin and handed it to them. Gross! On top of this, our server never offered to get us drinks...instead my wife ordered a glass of wine after the appetizer came out. Even at this time I was not asked what I wanted to drink. our server seemed nice but untrained. Not what I expect when I am paying 16.95 for a bowl of spaghetti. Manager Mark came around and asked how the spaghetti bolognese tasted and I told him I had better. He told the server to take it off the bill and I explained that it was unnecessary because I ate it. Just all around not a good experience. Except for the bruschetta, that was actually pretty good."}
{"text":"Honestly. Just go to Cheesecake Factory. I like the food but service is terrible. Recommend the spicy eggplant but it might be cold by the time you take a bite. No joke"}
{"text":"It's funny -   I'm really getting the impression that I'm going to be harsher on most of the asian restaurants here, and much too easy on the Italian ones.  I  guess I need to re-calibrate for the plethora of high quality Italian restaurants here!    I've been here twice for brunch; the first time I had mushroom ravioli, calamari -- the second I had a steak bruschetta, calamari, and bistecca with yam hash in a truffle oil.  I liked it a lot.  Wine selection is strongly tuscan influenced with the waitstaff have pronounced the dishes with the right consonants.  A major plus for me.    The bread is served with two varieties, a white bread and a flat biscuit-like bread with zesty seasoning and cheese baked in.  Fantastic stuff.  Sundried tomatos in the olive oil also doesn't hurt.    They play italian pop.  I love it.  They even played Nek.  :)  I'm not sure any of the waitstaff knows the music otherwise -- I asked, and they had no idea what was being played.    Decor isn't too extravagant, but the fabrics and fresco style painting recall Italy pleasantly.    I feel lonely as the highest rating for the restaurant, but until I can bring my expectations up for all the Italian fare, I keep getting pleasantly surprised!"}
{"text":"I used to eat lunch here about 3 times a week. The patio is great and the bar is comfortable. When I was there they had a great \"happy hour\" where appetizers and small menu items were about 5.95. They carry Sketchbook Cab by the glass which was my staple and the wait staff is very professional and sweet. The managers are great too.. Say Hi to Julian for me..   My faves were \"The Salmon Salad\" and the \"Chicken Parmigiana\" as well as the \"Wedding Soup\"  and the cute little mini tiramisu in a cup. The take a long time to make a cappuccino though and it is always scolding HOT, so if you are like me and want an after meal coffee, make sure to tell them about 10 minutes before you actually want it.  The main dining room has many big booths and they are great for when you are having a working lunch, you have room for your note pads and things.   The patio is great for chillin out with appetizers and wine in the summer time.. the place does get packed during special occasions, but they move pretty quick..   I used to get sick of Brio, simply because it was the place downstairs from where I worked, but actually it was great to have them so close on those days when deadlines did not permit me to sit down and eat in peace.. the take out is just as good.."}
{"text":"Being from New York I can't always come here but every time I come to NC I run to this place.  I happen to dream about their lobster bisque...it is a must! The bisque is not that fishy...it is just right!  Service is a hit or miss but I've had worse service so their \"miss\" is really not that bad, the person may come over to refill your drink only to find out that you had ordered something else.  Anything from the menu would be a sure thing. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I think Brio is a great option for lunch. Their menu has mostly Italian cuisine on it, but some options are pretty American. I think the portions are the perfect size and not overly filling. I highly recommend their grilled chicken sandwich for lunch. The chicken was tender and juicy. Cooked to perfection. The sandwich was served with fries which were also nice and crispy. The server I had was hilarious and very pleasant. Over all I had a wonderful experience here and will definitely pick up a bite to eat here when I'm hungry around legacy village."}
{"text":"The decor is absolutely stunning and the staff is super friendly, overall great service. We enjoyed the bread given at the beginning of the meal (aunt loves bread) and it was different from other restaurants in their selection of the bread, which is always interesting to see what different restaurants choose. My pasta was really good and the shrimp I had was cooked to perfection. There is a very calm ambience and was a delicious experience!"}
{"text":"No words but fabulous ! Service was great and everything was delicious . From the salads , bruschetta and entrees to the wonderful bread . All wonderful !"}
{"text":"Went with a business group. Exceptional service from the manager. Food about average. Very good wine selection. Stay away from the steak, and stick with pasta and pizza selection.  Beautiful interior. Bar bites menu very good value."}
{"text":"Delicious food! Great place to accommodate large parties. There is a private room and they are also great for catering."}
{"text":"As with most chains, they are pretty consistent one location to another.   This one is the same as most.      The food is generally good.  We had a large party and were able to make late reservations.  Happy that the restaurant was able to accommodate us.   We also had to waitresses serving us.   The both did a good. job.     In general, the service was good.   The food was ok.  I had a pasta dish but the pasta was a bit overcooked.  The sauce was good.    Most people at the table seemed to enjoy their dishes.    Overall good job.     Biggest headache about this location is location.  It is part of Legacy Village.  Parking is pretty poor here especially during the holidays.  There is valet parking nearby."}
{"text":"Been here a couple times and the only thing that I've really enjoyed was the company.   I've come here both on group outings and dinners with my boyfriend. Regardless of the occasion or company the service, two out of three times, was bad. The last straw for me was when my boyfriend and I came in with another couple after a long day out. The restaurant wasn't terribly busy but was well staffed. However, the amount of time it took for us to even get drinks and have our orders taken was incredible.   I had ordered a side of sauteed broccoli with my dinner and I figured that shouldn't be an issue. When it arrived it was steamed. No biggie, but it was super mushy so I figured I would just let our waitress know when she stopped by. By the time she's back, we're all almost done with our food but I was really craving sauteed broccoli - what I ordered. When I brought it up, our waitress was clearly was annoyed and took it back to the kitchen - which is visible to the dining room (and where we were sitting, I was looking straight at the kitchen).   The four of us watched the exchange with ended with the manager handing the plate with the broccoli to the chef who dumped it in a pan and re-plated it in the same plate seconds later. The waitress then brought it out to us. Of course, it just tasted like oily, mushy steamed broccoli. By this point I was more annoyed now at the manager but my better half calmed me down with the promise of ice-cream afterward. (;   This place may look nice but the food is overpriced for the money and the service is mediocre at best.   Two stars for the decor and the few pleasant servers I've had the pleasure of meeting."}
{"text":"I came here on a Friday night with friends after our choice of restaurants were fully booked for the evening. I normally do not like eating at chain restaurants and prefer to try places unique to the area I am in but on this night, it didn't happen that way. This is a chain restaurant so I wasn't coming with any high expectations, yet still excited to try a place I've never been before, but unfortunately it was well below average.  The pros: our waiter was wonderful and very helpful with answering questions. He was patient and pleasant when we weren't ready to place our orders after his third time coming around.   The food is really bland in my opinion and I really would not give it more than 1 star. I feel like microwavable entrees are better made than this. I did not complain because really what can they do about tasteless food? I love food, and I love reviewing what I eat but this place made it really hard and I can't find one good thing to say about the food I ate that evening. If anyone is curious, I had the lobster bisque and the margherita pizza, neither of which I had more than a few bites from.  Two stars for the service we received that evening, zero for the food. I would not return and I would not recommend coming here."}
{"text":"In town for a wedding and had dinner here with a large group on a weeknight.  The restaurant was fairly busy but definitely not overcrowded.  We were assigned two servers and both were fairly attentive even though it is difficult to please everyone in a large group.  The positives:  the food was excellent.  Shrimp Mediterranean was just as good as advertised and was bursting with flavor.  The dish was a little light on shrimp for my liking but probably because I had not eaten since breakfast.  The wife had Eggplant Parmesan which she thoroughly enjoyed as well.  The kids meals were a good size and the little ones enjoyed them as well.  One negative was that the food took a very long time to arrive after ordering.  I understand the complexities of trying to deliver it all at once with a huge party, however since the restaurant was half empty by the time we ordered it still seemed like it took too long.  Overall we enjoyed our meal and would recommend this place to others."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I visited Brio during restaurant week and had the Queen's menu. This menu changed my feelings about Brio as every other time I have been here the food was very good. I started with the caesar salad which was overdressed and small. Then I had the shrimp orzo - spicy jumbo shrimp served with orzo, asparagus, zucchini, tomatoes and lemon vinaigrette. The vinaigrette was probably the most tasty thing on the plate. The serving was large and for the most part, tasty. For dessert I chose the tiramisu however they informed me they were out at 6:30pm so I opted for the cheescake which was very good. The desserts were mini sizes served in shot glasses. I didn't feel like the meal was worth $30 and if you added up the same items on their regular menu, it only comes to $28 which makes me wonder why I didn't calculate this before ordering the 3 for $30 menu! I was disappointed in the end and probably won't be coming back here for restaurant week again. In general, I like Brio. They have great cocktails and normally good food and portions."}
{"text":"Great place to enjoy an adult  beverage.  Sarah, and  Davis always go above and beyond .  Great menu."}
{"text":"It was a beautiful afternoon in November, who could say no to eating outdoors?! Went for lunch. I got the Mediterranean pasta. The portion size was good and the quality was delicious! My husband got the crab cakes. We're not familiar with crab cakes, but the people we were with said they were the best they've ever had. The rolls were sourdough, my favorite!   This was my first time eating in Piedmont Row. We ate out on the patio to enjoy the sun and watching all the other people doing the same. There's a great fountain in the middle of a variety of restaurants...makes it feel high end. Atmosphere was beautiful.   The service was great! It made for an easy afternoon and I could have stayed there all afternoon.   Bathrooms were spacious, clean, and private."}
{"text":"So service here can be hit or miss. I totally understand why people give them bad reviews based on that because I've had some fairly crappy waiters. Whether it be incompetence or haughtiness (I've had both types) they should really work on that.  However they have some really REALLY good food here. Not everything is amazing but there have been some stand out things.  I love LOVE their sweet potato and chicken risotto!! Seriously I would cry if they got rid of it. I don't like asparagus but I will eat it in this that's how good it is lol.  My partner in crime absolutely loves the Ravioli di Bello (lots of mushrooms). I've tried various appetizers which had all been decent and the desserts are good. My favorite is the chocolate chip bread pudding seriously sooo good :-)  Even with the hit or miss service I still will give this place 4 stars because the good is so good!!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at this highly recommended Italian grill. The Moscato i had was a well balanced sweetness with hardly no after taste!!! I ordered the Mediterranean Shrimp at it was great! Grilled shrimp on a bed of rice,spinach,cherry tomatoes, broccoli and asparagus!! Lite but filling!! My date had a Carbonara chicken dish, which was very flavoful!! Their pretty busy on a Saturday night, so make reservations!! Aithough we did not ha e s reservation, we were well accomodated in the bar!! Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"So I'll start out by saying I've been here before and will go again but had by far the best experience on Mother's Day. I made a reservation and thankfully it was nice enough to enjoy the patio. We were seated promptly and our server was attentive. Bread was brought over and we ordered a pitcher of the Peach Bellini. Sooo good. My dad sat trying to figure out what the ratio of everything was so he could duplicate it. The food menu was a little different than normal but the Ham & Biscuit Benedict was a favorite with the guys, I got the frittata special and my mom ordered a Strawberry Balsamic Chicken Salad. Everything came out perfectly and Annie definitely never let our drinks go empty. This was our first brunch experience and will not be our last. Thank you for helping make Mother's Day so special!!!"}
{"text":"My daughter and I had previously visted Brio for Bar Bites, evening and late night happy hour.   We went last Friday the concept had changed slightly, no longer called bar bites and appetizers were no longer $3.95, also there were no Happy Hour drink specials, just food:-(.   The new Happy Hour food selections are divided into $4, $5 and $6 categories.   We opted for the hummus/veggies, margherita flatbread and artichoke dip.   Everything was ok, nothing phenomenal.  I thought that the previous offerings were much better....just my opinion."}
{"text":"As my boyfriend and my favorite \"special dinner place\", I have come here multiple times in the past few years. I've always enjoyed the food. I thought it was good.   But they're recent menu blows everything else out of the water.   The Diavolo pasta had the perfect kick and the pesto. OH THE PESTO. So delicious. Nothing was 'too-'anything. Not too salty, or bland, or saucy. Perfection on a plate."}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday not too long ago and everything was great from appetizer to desert. I had  the shrimp and grits as my entree and let me tell you the proportions and texture  were perfect! The service was average and the only thing I really didn't like was the fact that you don't get anything on your birthday except a free appetizer for the next time you come."}
{"text":"I used to love Brio and have been here quite a few times. Unfortunately something has changed drastically. My 2nd to last visit was in February 2017 for my dad's birthday and it was a wonderful experience, from the food to the service and half off bottles of wine (on a Friyay!). I chose Brio again to celebrate a new job (July 2017) with my friends and family and unfortunately, we ended up leaving shortly after getting there.  It felt stuffed and chaotic. We did go on a Saturday evening but it shouldn't take away from the dining experience. We ordered a round of drinks (6 ppl). Two drinks were super watered down and the rest of us had wine. Then we take a look at the menu and I was completely disappointed. A lot of the GREAT entrees were no longer there and the menu itself didn't spark our interest. Not to mention service was eh! Bring back the old Brio please."}
{"text":"The food here is horrible. The only thing that taste really good is their bruschetta that has done sort of jelly and prosciutto. Other than that this place is a dump!"}
{"text":"Brio's is one of my favorite dinner spots when visiting my grandmother in Charlotte, and I never would have known it's a chain unless I looked at their website.    This location has complimentary valet which is a huge plus given the location.  The restaurant is HUGE so it can get a little loud, but not overly so.  Outdoor seating was not open when I was there last weekend, but can imagine it would be a great place to sit.  The food is absolutely delicious.  I really wanted the Lobster & Shrimp Fettuccine, but wasn't sure about the \"spicy lobster sauce.\"  The waitress was great about explaining the level of spiciness and after seeing me still look uneasy, she offered to have them make it without any spice at all.  It was so delicious - I will definitely get it again on my next visit.  We also got the Bruschetta Quattro appetizer which was delicious, but 3 of the 4 varieties came with meat.  I suppose we should have looked at all the bruschetta descriptions since the Quattro isn't described, but my mom's a vegetarian so she had to stick with the only vegetarian option.  Regardless, they were still yummy.  All of our meals out in Charlotte are delicious, but this one definitely stands out!"}
{"text":"Service was not up to par... Server ignored me and passed up my empty tea glass.. Food was not hot ( polla vodka) ...."}
{"text":"Lobster bisque very tasty! Also recommend the steak salad, it is surprisingly very filling. Could be at least two portions for me. Plenty of complimentary bread, but save room for your entree. Live music at the bar on Friday/Saturday. Valet and reservations available as well."}
{"text":"A wonderful restaurant with class, great service and a nice menu.  The outdoor area is huge and heated in cooler winter nights.  Our 4-year old grandaughter loves Brio and insists on sitting inside!  We have done lunch and dinner here and celebrate Mother's Day and other special occasions at Brio when we are in-town.  Everything is good.  What can I say beyond that?    Give it a try and I am sure you will agree."}
{"text":"I like brio... i think the food is good, however for the price some of the things are not worth it... You can get a decent (at best) chicken parm for about double the price of olive garden... but things like the pasta fra diavolo chicken are out of this world and keep me going back!  The desserts are not bad either...  I find the service very friendly... but sometimes a lil talkative...  All in all the place is good for a nice dinner but over priced compared to some places..."}
{"text":"from the bread to the salad to the entree, everything was delicious, perfect amount of seasonings and really delicious! server was a little off  beautiful restaurant, decor was fantastic, very chic!"}
{"text":"I came here with 3 other people during Charlotte Restaurant Week (3 courses for $30) The waiter was almost TOO friendly... like almost awkward but still very nice.   They bread they have is more like a cracker with herbs and that was really good.   Our appetizer was the Margherita Flatbread and that was really good.   I got the Fettuccine Rustica and that was delicious, if I wasn't so stuffed I probably would have eaten it all.   Another person in my party had the Shrimp Verduta and they said it was just as good.   The dessert was really small (it came in a shot glass), because it was part of the 3 course deal. But it was really really good.   Overall, a good experience, I would like to come back not during the restaurant week so see how it is different."}
{"text":"I'm AMAZED that this place is receiving more than one star from so many people!!! If it were up to me I'd leave no star for this awful place. Although it looks nice inside, when I go to a restaurant my main goal is to enjoy the food and the service!   When my husband and I arrived we already knew what we wanted because we looked at the menu online prior to our arrival. We ordered our food and the waitress brought our bread and appetizer to the table. The bread wasn't good...very hard, and the calamari was awful!!! It was a plate full of green peppers topped with some pieces of calamari to make it seem like it was a full plate! I've never seen that happen in life!!! If I wanted an order of green peppers I wouldn't have ordered calamari! When the server came back and saw the plate full of green peppers she didn't ask if we enjoyed it or nothing, she just took the plate as if it was normal. At this point I was so nervous about my food because I was already disappointed with both the bread and my appetizer.   The food arrived. I ordered the pasta alla vodka (which I've loved everywhere else I've had it) and as soon as the plate was put down I knew I wasn't going to like it! It looked nothing like it should've looked and of course I hated it! It tasted like I was eating vomit, so when she came to refill our drinks I told her I didn't like it and made her take it back. My husband had lasagne and said it wasn't good either so I decided to not even replace my meal with anything. We planned on getting dessert but that was scratched off of our list ASAP! I'm pretty sure the waitress knows the food there sucks because I noticed that she NEVER asked how we liked any of it.  People, please don't get caught up in the way things look!!! Restaurants are like people and not everything that looks good is good!"}
{"text":"This is so sad. We used to go to this place at least couple times a year. Now not sure if we ever come back.  They completely remodeled since the last time we were there(I did not really care for the new decor) Whole new staff including management and cooks, new menu.  We had a relatively big group of 11 people. Only one person from our group was satisfied with his dish. I had lamp chops. They were simply not good. It felt like they were boiled in the water and soaked into the store-bought gravy after. Mashed potatoes were very salty. My wife had an angel hair pasta with pesto sauce and it looked(and tasted) like they forgot to drain the pasta. My mother in law salad was not fresh at all and she couldn't eat it. Everything was edible but barely.  Not like at used to be"}
{"text":"We were a group of 14. They set a table for us in a semi private area by the window. It was great! The food was delicious but more importantly the service was perfect! Mo was our waiter and he was attentive and accommodating. Every entree came out at the same time and was hot and delicious. Kudos to the kitchen staff!"}
{"text":"My husband I have been here for happy hour before and it's bomb.com. Happy hour is till 6:30 and again from 9-close. $3.95-$5.95 bar bites?! You can't beat it! They also have select drinks on special including sangria, mojitos and martinis ranging from $4-$6.  They recently updated their bar bites menu with new options. We ordered the 'tots' which were filled with potato, cheese and bacon with a side of spicy ranch (new to the menu-  $3.95) along with the peppered shrimp with eggplant ($5.95). Both dishes were great. I was expecting the tots to be more \"totty\", but they were basically deep fried mashed potatoes balls-however they were still good. The shrimp was awesome-the right proportion of spicy and savory. I highly recommend the shrimp! I wish we ordered more. Both dishes came with 10 pieces each-great for 2 people.   For drinks I had the sangria and my husband had the \"lemonade\". Both were great- no complaints.   Overall we have always had great service, food and drinks at Brio and I highly recommend it for happy hour :)"}
{"text":"Went to a yelp Elite Event a couple of months ago and was blown away with the cuisine and service. At that time, I made a mental note to introduce my wife to this restaurant and finally got a chance.  Cold wet rainy day and my wife wanted to go to South Park which is a couple of blocks away.  Drove down from Cornelius and took advantage of the valet parking which was nice in the rain.  It was a pleasure to get inside the restaurant on such a day since the have a nice warm inviting atmosphere.  We were seated pretty quickly and our server was there immediately . Service overall was good but not quite up to what I had experienced on the Elite Event but from what I could see, the issue was short staffing because our server was trying. Just spread out a bit too much.  When she took our beverage order, I ordered a nice cup of hot coffee which was perfect on the cold wet day. My wife ordered a Peach Bellini which she enjoyed.  My wife had already decided on Soup and Salad for lunch, particular after she found out the Soup of the Day was Butternut Squash.  I order a soup course also and I had a great Lobster Bisque that was very flavorful, great texture and plenty of Lobster in the Bisque  For her Salad, she had the Della Casa which was a nice salad which she enjoyed.   I had the Spaghettini with Meatballs which was OK but at the same time, not outstanding and I would order something different next time we visit.  All and all, it was a very good lunch. Good atmosphere and good food.  Will be back next time in the area."}
{"text":"I've eaten here many times and have always been pleased. Tonight I dined with a party of 8 in a lovely private area. Our server was very pleasant. The food tonight was ok. Nothing special. Half of our party got our meals 10 minutes before the others. Some orders were wrong. Off night. Unacceptable for the price."}
{"text":"Great for happy hour with a delicious food and drink menu. The black pepper shrimp was yummy as well as the black raspberry cosmo. They had good live music too!"}
{"text":"Not great by any means - your mediocre Italian food with a super inflated price tag..."}
{"text":"I come here about once a week on average since I work in the building next door. The staff is very helpful and friendly. I have a Brio rewards card that is indeed rewarding periodically. Anyway, I order lobster bisque at least once a week because it is so good, and inexpensive. It comes with delicious bread. I also order the calamari which is perfect. The portion is great for the price. I've ordered all the items from the Fresh menu and they're all delicious. My family and I dont really like the dessert here. Favorite thing to order: Light Grilled Salmon Fresca When I consider the ambiance, the quality and portions of food, the staff, cleanliness, parking (free valet) and price, I have to say this is probably one of the best choices you can make for dinner in Charlotte."}
{"text":"There's an inexplicable craving that overcomes my friends when they see an upscale restaurant near SouthPark. I can't blame them; great location, valet parking and decor that makes Olive Garden a 70's mom-and-pop Italian Bistro. I could honestly care less about the superficial details of any restaurant. Atmosphere will never hide the taste of mediocre entrees.   And that's the case with Brio. The atmosphere of the restaurant is classy, service is great and made me feel relaxed. This all dissipates when your main entrees are served. You're brought back to the reality that there was a hidden cost to this atmosphere. My order was a Chicken Parmesan with their much coveted \"Italian Herb Pasta.\" When you look at the picture of what I was served you will understand why I have the following opinions.  It looked like a novice chef beginning his first day on the line. Nothing was special about the meal at all. Herb pasta was probably the only part of the dish that had any new or exciting taste bud busting flavors and even that was short lived. I looked around at the other meals being served at my table and it was pretty much the same. Olive Garden dishes in a fancy location. For the record, Olive Garden is just as sub-par and I'm in no way promoting Olive Garden rather providing a comparison for you to visualize. I'm not a person looking for massive quantities when I come into a place like this, but I'm expecting fresh ingredients. The salad was withered and the fresh vegetables looked just the same.   If you're looking for a great dinner atmosphere, then by all means come and enjoy the place. Just remember, \"looks aren't everything.\""}
{"text":"I came here once and will never, ever go back. I ordered a pasta dish, I can't remember which. I'd eaten about a third of the dish (it did, admittedly, taste pretty good) when I came across a gigantic bug, some sort of cricket I think. And this guy was cooked into the pasta. He didn't just fly in there while I was eating, oh no, he was nicely settled into his carbohydrate nest.   After staring at my dish's added protein for about 2 full minutes, I shakily called over our server, who examined my plate with similar horror. She whisked it away and offered me a new one. I wasn't quite the mood but she insisted I take the fresh one to go. Never really worked up an appetite for it, through.."}
{"text":"This place stinks. From the moment we walked in looking for the hostess, to trying to order with no waitress in sight, to getting our food or the check we waited, waited, and waited. Service here is abysmal and although they love to ply you with free appetizers and deserts as an apology it doesn't make up for it. We had a large party complete with kids and a 2-3 hour dinner (yes that's really how long this place took) doesn't fly well with them. I also felt that food was extremely overpriced. Are you serious? $18 for pasta that isn't freshly made? I wasn't impressed with food quality either, my ceasar salad consisted of some chopped romaine, nasty powdered cheese and croutons. Yes the portions are large, but I can't see anything there being crave worthy. The one dish I did enjoy was the free calamari appetizer, lightly battered, crispy and fresh. However, I would never come back here."}
{"text":"I am new in town on temporary work assignment from ATL and sat at the bar here for lunch the other day.  I got a chopped side salad, roasted salmon entree with fried green tomatoes, and asparagus for my sides.  The service was awesome and the bar was clean.  The food was special and I really enjoyed the ambiance. Will be back often."}
{"text":"I have spent many an afternoon soaking up the positive vibes & electric energy from the staff @ Brio. The eggplant with shrimp is to die for! The Bio burger is always juicy and cooked to perfection, what can I say I always enjoy myself when I stop in. These are just a few of the dishes I've tried but I'm convince this chain is something special. I have yet to try a menu item I did not like. Great food at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"I am really disappointed as I sit down to write this review.  I had such high hopes.  We went there after a matinee show last weekend.  When I suggested it my girlfriend said \"Brio is Yummy.\"  Score right.  So we showed up early for dinner on a Saturday.  The staff was awesome.  Very nice. But my meal was mediocre at best.  I got the chicken limone. The chicken was awful.  No taste and soggy.  The breading on the chicken was beyond soggy.  the sauce wasn't bad, but there was no flavor.  I did however enjoy the mashed potatoes.  My dining companion got her standard which is the Pesce Piccata.  She'd had this dish previously and while her meal was better than mine she agreed it was lacking also.  Maybe that had an off night.  I wasn't so disgusted that I won't go back, but it will be way way way down on the list.  Sorry charlie, this one was a bust.    Oh one last thing.  I ate all of my potatoes, but sent back at least 3/4 of my chicken.  The server asked me if I wanted it boxed up.  I said no, that I really didn't enjoy it and the chicken was soggy.  I was giving honest feedback.  He seemed not to care and I don't know that the feedback made it to the kitchen as I had no manager come to check in with me - I wasn't expecting comps, but at least be aghast that someone is sending back virtually their whole meal to the kitchen uneaten."}
{"text":"Came to NC for a long weekend...  Here from NYC... Went with a group to Brios.  Beautiful location, nice atmosphere and friendly people.  Food was mediocre at best.  Service was not exactly stellar either.  Perhaps I'm a jaded NY'er?  But appetizers were cold and looked to have been prepared some time ago and were sitting..  Entrees were small and just adequate ....dessert was ok as well..  Again, nothing special.  But the evening was nice, just nothing to write home about with regards to food.  I miss NYC !!!  :)"}
{"text":"This is a great place for any meal, specially brunch.  Great location in the Piedmont Center and parking is never a problem. Seating is comfortable, they have a great bar area which can extend to the outdoor sitting are, perfect for relaxing during happy hour. By the way, they have great specials for happy hour, good for trying out their apps.  Must tries: Bruschetta Quattro, Calamari, Grilled Salmon Salad, Pasta Fra Diavalo and if you are lucky enough to be there at brunch get the stuffed french toast, so delicious!. They have great coffee and small desserts which are perfect.   Don't forget to grab some mints on your way out!"}
{"text":"Very nice looking place. Came before dinner rush, so it wasn't too busy. Nice staff very attentive and informed us if something would take long.   Apps:shrimp and eggplant- really good,great zing of spice and they used white eggplant which i prefer over purple. Much more tender.  Chicken Milanese- pretty good...liked the herbed pasta but overall not the best I've had and chicken lacked flavor a bit  So overall not fantastic but i enjoyed my meal and such and would return to try other dishes."}
{"text":"This was one of my favorite places to come but they recently \"rebranded\", which I do like the interior decor changes, but some of my favorites are no longer available.  I loved the raspberry mojito and vanilla creme brulee, and am sad those are no longer an option. It will affect my decision on returning in the future. In addition our server had zero personality."}
{"text":"Took my mom here for Mother's Day brunch. The French toast was great, wish their brunch menu had more selections but the patio view was the real reason we came. Great atmosphere on a beautiful day with family. What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"My grandmother just turned 90, and we took 22 total friends and family to brio to celebrate.  It was a great experience.  The service was exceptional, everyone's drink was full, everyone's food came out hot and at the same time.  They served a cake that we brought.  I think their chipotle chicken panini available for lunch is one of the best sandwiches around.  The bruschetta quattro appetizer is excellent as well.  I have had 4-5 meals at brio, and each one I leave feeling happy and that I got my money's worth.  Is it the best food ever created?  No.  Some people on these review sites expect two start michellin experiences for less than $20.    I would strongly recommend you consider brio for a meal or a family party, our experience was outstanding."}
{"text":"I have eaten here several times and have tried so many different entrees.  Lots of delicious choices from calamari, lobster and shrimp ravioli, risotto, half chicken, lamb chops, the list goes on and on. Service is not quick by any means but food is worth the wait.   Since Brio is a chain they have lots to offer, have good variety of specials, and the restaurant is very well maintained."}
{"text":"I went to Brio with my new employeer on my first day at work.  It is within walking distance of our office.  I have returned twice since that first visit.   The food is overpriced.  I got the chicken arriabiatta sandwich, and while it was good there was some less-than-great quality chicken in there.  The desserts are perfectly sized for lunch (espresso cup-sized for $2).  It is almost impossible to resist dessert when it's that cheap and that small. We have also tried the pork chop, the tuna appetizer, and an omelet at brunch - all items were good, but too pricey to be worth it. I'll save this one for when I'm using the expense account."}
{"text":"Brio is one of my favorite restaurants, I went here for my birthday dinner and i have NOTHING bad to say about the service... Except when i thought it was a good idea to take my best friend for her birthday. Little did I know, I would have to find HAIR on a the oil plate. Bread is my favorite thing in the world, and at Brio it is delicious. But, I couldn't even eat it because I was DISGUSTED. I'm really saddened by this and wish I came on a good day at the restaurant because they're food is really good but I just lost my appetite."}
{"text":"Brio is a nice atmosphere with a great patio.  I have yet to be really wowed by the food or service BUT the best deal is at the bar.  They have a happy hour menu that is half priced and the food is really good.  They also sometimes have live music.  A great place to meet up with friends after work.  They have some tasty flat breads for both the meat lover and the vegetarian and I am a big fan of the extra dirty martinis!  Yes, extra dirty-the more olive juice in my vodka-the better!"}
{"text":"Visited Brio's last night.  It was the second chance for them as my family's first experience was poor.  I must say that dinner last night was excellent.  We enjoyed crab cakes, risotto, flat bread pizza, and the Delmonico steak.  Hannah provided wonderful service and the manager on duty, Diana checked on us often.  After last night I would highly recommend Brio at Piedmont Center."}
{"text":"The service at Brio is a crapshoot. We like the food, and the atmosphere, but we have gotten more than one free meal or appetizer here as compensation for the poor service.  Once the waiter took 10 minutes or so to bring back the check and our credit card and the manager came out and took care of our bill (free food yay!), another time they spilled wine all over someone in our party, and the manager arranged for free drycleaning and 3 free appetizers. This isn't just us, I have quite a few friends who have also gotten free meals, desserts, or drinks at the hands of poor servers. I should mention that the servers are always very friendly and gregarious, it's just that they are not always efficient and adept at handling large trays.  I like the food enough that I never really mind going and seeing if we get bad enough service that something is free. It's actually kind of fun. The food here is a little pricey, and the appetizers used to be huge but they have scaled back a bit. This is supposedly an Italian steakhouse, and the steaks are very good, the pasta selections are good but not perfect (for example I don't think they have  fettucini alfredo on the menu, and their lasagna is a little bland). The desserts are typical fare. Salads are excellent if a bit small.  I do like the decor, and on a nice night it's always fun to eat outside. I definitely plan to return."}
{"text":"Brio's is a lovely Italian restaurant in the South Park area. As expected the restaurant is beautiful. I set outside on the patio. I was quickly seated and had a very attentive server. I ordered the vegetable panini which was very delicious and was also a pretty decent size amount considering the price. It also came with a quinoa side salad. Overall I would say this place is worth a try its nothing super special but the food is not bad either I'd say about average.."}
{"text":"Had reservations for 5 people at 7:00. The table was not ready when we arrived. One chair had to be replaced as it was broken. We were sat in the back by a window with a draft. The server was nice but was very busy. It took over an hour to get our food. The manager came over and made excuses. When the food arrived the lamb was over cooked and was sent back. The shrimp & lobster risotto was over cooked and over seasoned, the chicken Milanese was not tough, over seasoned & cold. The lamb then come out under cooked. The forks were oversized and the new decor left me confused. I will never go back to this Costal nightmare of a restaurant."}
{"text":"I arrived a little wet from the effect of Tropical storm Hermine. I was looking for a place close to he hotel but with good food This restaurant had good ratings on Yelp. I started with the lobster bisque. Hot and delicious. I ordered the combo meal with pork chop and caramelized Brussels sprouts. The pork chop was cooked perfectly. It was hot, juicy and cooked through and had a great flavor. The Brussel sprouts  had a great flavor but we're only warmed. Although served in a small cast iron skillet they must have sat while waiting on the pork. I told the waitress so she could notify the kitchen. Tiffany was my waitress and was excellent. She notified the kitchen and they wanted to make it right  I told her I ate them just wanted the staff to know for the next guest. They did give me a slice of cheesecake. I will definitely be back when in the Chatlotte area again"}
{"text":"The crispy chicken Romano sandwich is still available to order. Not sure why it's not on the menu but a waitress told me that if you ask for it, they can fix it for you. One of the best sandwiches on the menu. Best Caesar salad ever. I enjoy the lobster bisque and the campanelle carbonara too. Favorite place for lunch."}
{"text":"I've gone twice now and I enjoyed both of my experiences so I'm really not sure why they only have a three star overall rating. From what I heard they revamped their look/menu and a lot of regulars couldn't handle the change and it made them cranky. Oh well, more for me then!  Both times I visited it was in the afternoon on a weekend and I sat at the bar. First server was Anthony with perfect eyelashes and the other time my server was Jackie, both friendly and competent. They humored me with a little chatter and I never waited long for anything.   Food: *Roasted Beets & Whipped Feta $9.50 - Good, but you only need a couple of bites. Share this small plate with others otherwise the taste is too much for one person.  *Crispy Fingerling Potatoes Brio $5 - Definitely crispy potatoes with a creamy parmesan sauce on top. Good.   *Spicy Shrimp & Eggplant $13 - Best thing I ate. So tasty and I would order again.  *Buffalo Cauliflower $11.50 - I thought this was good too. The cauliflower is not fried so you feel better about eating it. Just watch out because your mouth will feel some heat.  *Linguine Carbonara $14 - I'd say it's a good middle of the road carbonara. Not the best I've ever had but not close to the worst either.  *Peach Sangria, Spicy Mango Margarita both $9 - Standard drinks.  *Warm Chocolate Cake $8 - Got this as a special birthday surprise treat. Freaking delicious.  *Bread - They give you a chunk of bread with butter plus a couple of these seasoned bread crisps that were pretty good.   I know this place is a chain in Legacy Village, but I didn't mind making the drive from Rocky River because the area is a good place to park and walk around, the service was good, the food was good, and prices were reasonable. I'd come back again for a leisurely weekend lunch. I think people are catching on too because on both of my visits I saw a steady amount of business."}
{"text":"Save a couple dollars and buy yourself a pasta lean cuisine, this place blows. Salad was old, dressing was basically miracle whip and my entré smelled like the bottom of a fish tank from the \"shrimp\". Cereal it is!"}
{"text":"We came for a couple of friends' birthday dinner. The waitress was very attentive and the food absolutely delicious! Love the environment and will definite be back."}
{"text":"Went here for my mom's birthday dinner with some extended family. It was eight of us on a Saturday night. We arrived at the restaurant where they have complimentary valet parking. Nice. We were seated immediately (we had a reservation) and two waitresses came to take drink orders. Both of them served us the rest of the night. Much easier than just having one person serve eight of us. We ordered some appetizers for the table including bruschetta and spinach/artichoke dip. The bruschetta was okay, the bread could have been more crunchy. The artichoke dip was pretty good. The bread, though. Man, that bread was superb. Crunchy on the outside, hot on the inside. The crisps they served were excellent as well. After filling up on appetizers, we still had two courses to go.  My main course was steak medallions coated in artichoke. They were pretty good--soft and tasty, but I was so full from the appetizers that I probably didn't enjoy it as much as I could have. Oh well. Still good. For dessert, I ended up with the molten lava cake. They nailed it. 10/10. Fantastic, everyone should order like eight of them. Sublime.  Service was good. Not great, but good. It was quick and courteous, but it lacked a personal touch. Ambience was very nice as well--nice tuscan decorations and some nice (live?) music playing. I'd definitely come back--thumbs up for Brio!"}
{"text":"Five star meal (shrimp and eggplant app/lamb chops with brussel sprouts). Five star customer service."}
{"text":"Just ate at Brio and was completely outdone that the servers do not wear gloves when they prep the bread for the tables. I addressed it with the manager and this video was taken after that. Clearly my concerns were not hers. Needless to say that turned my experience from okay to bad with the slice of a loaf! Just nasty."}
{"text":"Went for lunch. Big location. Great service from wait staff, food came out smoking hot. I somehow forgot to take a pic; most likely because the food looked so good I had to eat it. Got the fish sandwich and thoroughly enjoyed. Dad got the lasagna and almost licked the plate. Cousin got the chicken sandwich and killed it."}
{"text":"Went to Brio tonite for my husband's birthday. What a great time! Everyone was beyond courteous and attentive. From the moment we arrived, we were greeted by the Host, a very warm young man named Sam. He was friendly and asked us multiple times if everything was good and if we were enjoying our meal as he walked by. The manager Diana was phenomenal. She came by once we were seated as we let the restaurant know that this was a birthday celebration. She was warm and friendly as well and sent over the Shrimp and Eggplant appetizer which was awesome. The spicy pepper sauce is tasty and the eggplant is cooked to perfection. Highly recommend this appetizer!!  Our server was Della and she was friendly and knowledgeable and was able to really make some good suggestions for our main meals. We took her advice and for dinner, we had a special which was the Risotto with Lobster tail and shrimp (mine) and the Lobster and shrimp Ravioli (my husband's). Both were great. Again, everything was cooked to perfection! The risotto was filling and i had enough of my portion left over to have for lunch tomorrow :)  Our dessert was also sent over by the manager and that was a mascarpone cheesecake with a caramel drizzle and that was a wow!!  Again. Creamy, tasty and really just an awesome light cheesecake. I finished my meal off with a cappuccino which again, was really good and wasn't bitter as a cup can sometimes be.  Overall, i'd have to give this a 5 star dining experience because everything was just perfect. So thank you Brio for making this a special birthday all around!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night with my husband and two other couples. The service was very, very slow. It was a Sunday night and there were not many people at all dining, but the service was extremely slow. I partook in their 3 courses for $27. My food was very good. I did the 3 pieces of steak with shrimp and the brio potatoes. For dessert I had the cheesecake. My husband had the shrimp Mediterranean and absolutely hated it. He said it tasted awful. Everyone else in our group liked their food. Others ordered lasagna, crab cakes, short ribs and ravioli. I wasn't wowed by the food, but it was good although the service was very slow. The one thing that annoyed me the most was the brought out 3 entrees and we waited about 5 minutes for the other 3 to come out. To me that is unacceptable. I doubt I will come back here again."}
{"text":"This place was ok nice atmosphere good service but all the food I try all kinda taste the same its not bad but not the best either."}
{"text":"UPDATE: Still waiting on my stolen forty dollars!!! But thanks for \"reaching\" out to me. Actually spoke to the manager that commented below, was actually asked if he could use my personal email as a training tool for his management staff. So the valet company blew me off, and this restaurant still doesn't care. Thanks!!!!   Went here for my daughter's sweet 16 this past Saturday. She had reserved a table for 20 and upon arrival was told they had a table of 10 set aside for her. After the hostess was kind enough to extend her seating time ( they only hold a table for 15 minutes which would have been nice to know in advance), she was told the table was cut down to six, then back up to eight. When her party arrived, they were seated at a table for ten, which ended up working out perfectly for them. Everything was delicious, her dad and I enjoyed our meal in the bar area, had wonderful service and delicious food.      It would have been a very special night for us, had I not parked my car with the valet. Upon arriving home, I noticed that the $40 cash I had stashed in my car(how dare I stash emergency money in my own vehicle, I know) was stolen when I parked the car. Upon calling the next day to inform them of what happened, I was basically dismissed, given the phone number of the \"private valet company that they hire but have nothing to do with\" and sent on my way. I wanted them to be aware that their guests were violated during their dining experience. I know it was dumb to leave money in my OWN car, but the real part that gets me was making the extra effort to walk across the roundabout to get cash out to tip them. What a joke. Thank you so much Brio Tuscan Grille, I will forever associate your business and her 16th birthday with your professionalism and concern."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with friends.  Nice menu, with pasta, sandwich, salad and soup selections.  On the weekend, they also have a brunch menu.  I had the vegetable omelet, which was awesome.  Well prepared, generous portion and good flavor.  Salads have a nice selection, and the sandwiches were well prepared with good portion size.  Pasta selection good as well.  All items tasted freshly made, and not excessively seasoned.  Service was friendly as well.  Recommend if you need a place to eat lunch at Legacy village."}
{"text":"New look to this place much brighter and noisy Menu changed small plates along with regular menu Had Veal dish was excellent!! However we shared a salad and asked for the meal to be served after we finished the salad well that didn't happen right in the middle of our salad out came our meal Server offered to take back but that never is a good idea get old in the kitchen Ben our server was apologetic about the serving of the food early  Overall meal and service was good  Not in a big hurry to go back"}
{"text":"Brio is meant to be a fancier version of Bravo, and while they do have a few unique dishes, I really believe it is the same food at a higher price point. I have not loved any of the food I have tried from there, and although they are great at accommodating large groups (we had a group luncheon for my cousin's baby shower), it is not my first choice when it comes to spots to eat at Legacy Village."}
{"text":"I recently had the pleasure of attending a YELP Elite event at Brio and throughly enjoyed myself . This Piedmont Row restaurant had a patio with giant Jenga and ping pong. Inside , it was bustling environment with great music. Our semi private dining area had several menu options on display across two neatly decorated tables. We were greeted with complimentary wine and served various samples of dishes by a informative staff. I'm very interested in coming back and having the salmon dinner entree."}
{"text":"Even though this is a chain I would say that it is one of our top places to eat in CLT. The prices are on the high end but we just keep going back because the food is so good. If you go right after work you can get a great spot on the patio. Our favorite dishes are the spicy eggplant/shrimp appetizer and the beef carpaccio. The eggplant/shrimp dish is scrumptious; it has a very yummy sauce and the carpaccio is HUGE, especially for an appetizer. It comes out in the biggest plate you will ever see and has a tasty salad, flatbread slices and capers on top to make it even better. If you sign up for their rewards card/app, they send a lot of promotions to lessen the pain of the bills. Almost every time I have been in we were able to get at least $10 off by using these offers."}
{"text":"Walking into Brio, you can definitely tell it's a chain restaurant and not \"fine dining,\" though they try. One look at the menu will confirm that. I've had better at Olive Garden at a cheaper price, and at legit Italian restaurants at similar prices.  Service was OK, not great. Didn't get a single water or bread refill. No dessert presentation. Besides that, our waitress was sufficient.  Overall, the food was not satisfying and did not justify the price. We started off with the Beef Carpaccio, which I would say was the highlight of the meal. The meat was perfect and the salad was delicious. It came with fancy crackers that tasted exactly like Cheez-Its to me, so we chucked those to the side.   For the main entree, I had the lobster/shrimp ravioli, which as I described was understuffed (maybe had one decent sized chunk of shrimp). The sauce was thin and had way too much lemon. By the end of it, I was still really, really hungry. Another member of my party ordered the carbonara, and if you like your meal tasting like garlic, then you'll love the carbonara. Another member ordered the lamb chops. They were cooked appropriately by request, with a side of mashed potatos and asparagus. The lamb was good, but I couldn't help but be reminded of the flavor of Banquet's own microwaveable dinner, the classic Salisbury Steak. It tasted exactly like it. I enjoyed it, maybe because it took me back to my childhood, but when a $27 dish tastes like a $1 TV dinner, you have some work to do. The mashed potatoes were underwhelming and bland. The asparagus had a subtle seasoning, but was cooked perfectly and tasted great.  We finished off with the dessert trio of Apple Bread Pudding, Vanilla Creme Brulee, and Chocolate Cheesecake. I'm not a sweets fan but they were all pretty good.  I won't be going back. I'm not a huge fan of Italian cuisine, and this restaurant turned me off even more."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch on a Saturday. The decor was nice, and the waiter was really friend. Food was a little bit better then average, nothing special at all. It took forever to get our food and even longer to get cappuccinos after we ate. Probably would not return."}
{"text":"Super pricey!  Neither the host, the server, or the other bazillion other people could describe the specials or menu. I think we got 2-3 apps, 4 plates, and lots of drinks. Everything was pricey for the quality.  Lavish decor, though."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to a Brio in years. Nothing against them, there are just so many places to try in this city. I went for a late lunch with my sister and immediately remembered why I liked this place. The beautiful decor and golden lighting just puts you in a relaxed state. We were seated right away and our waiter was very attentive. I ordered the pasta pesto and loved it. My sister had the parmesan crusted chicken salad and found it to be less than stellar. Still, we enjoyed a nice cozy lunch and had no issues. It will probably be a long time before I'm back again though. Nothing about my experiences there ever leave a lasting impression."}
{"text":"I've never had a perfect meal or good service at this particular location."}
{"text":"One of my all time favorites.  Very consistent, great service, delicious food.  Love, love the gorganzola lamb chops."}
{"text":"I had always wanted to check out this location since I've been to one in Houston.   Place: I like the atmosphere. It has a cozy vibe to it. When we went on a weeknight, there was a live band playing in the bar area. It was nice to see, although a little too loud if you were seated nearby in the dining room.   Food: There is a variety of food you can choose from the menu. I played safe with angel hair shrimp scampi. It was good and fulfilling. My husband ordered chicken pasta in white sauce, that he liked. Overall, the food was not bad at all. I would definitely come back to try other food items. We made room for dessert, chocolate molten lava cake that we ending up crushing :) in less than 10 minutes. Need more vanilla ice cream!  Service: good and attentive. Our waitress was kind and offered suggestions in placing our order."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch once because most of the restaurants in this area are fantastic. It's South Park, of course they're fantastic.   I'd rate the food 5 stars. I'd also rate the service, restaurant location, and interior decor 5 stars too. I went alone for this visit and the waiter asked if I would like some reading material. When I told him I'd like that, he came back with the day's Charlotte newspaper and a South Park monthly magazine. As you can tell, phenomenal service.  For my visit I had the lobster bisque and pork chop for my meal, both of which I could eat again because they were just so good. Definitely need to make more visits there."}
{"text":"Favorite Restraunt in Cleveland! Never ever had bad service or food! Friendly service and awesome food! I reccomend the chicken parm or spagetti with meat sause."}
{"text":"Brio is a good spot to partake in a hearty tasty meal.   I don't eat meat, so personally I have had no issues with the amount of food that I get from my dish. I have actually found that salads are quite large and easily can complete a whole meal. I sometimes only get a salad and a side of asparagus or something. Which mind you with the YUMMY free bread and butter is more than enough for me.   Either way, I know several people that CRAVE the appetizers here. One that is on a rotation of specials, I think with breaded squash or something. But either way I hear about that kind of stuff a lot.   I'm not a huge Italian food fan, honestly, so Brio works for me. It's not heavy on the pasta meals but still offers them. I just think I has a whole different identity, so don't go thinking spaghetti and garlic bread here.  It ain't happenin'.   I like the small cheap options for dessert. You can get a small cup of something so darn good for hardly any money and please your sweet pallet without the guilt or the usual huge proportion. If you ask me it's brilliant. On top of that the desserts are almost always really flavorable and worth the few bucks.   Brio isn't cheap but it isn't too expensive either. You just have to be smart with your choices and you can please most wallets ."}
{"text":"Fabulous food. Fabulous service. Nayla was wonderful, would recommend to anyone and will definitely come back!!!"}
{"text":"YUM!  This is a great spot for dinner (if you can duck the Sopa cougars!!!)  Service here is outstanding (we got a free plate of calamari - yay!)  Two waiters were by constantly to make sure we had enough water/wine/etc.  They didn't care at all when we lingered over wine after the meal - just great service.    The menu is a bit overwhelming and the smell in the place is so delicious you feel full when you haven't even eaten anything.  I had the ravioli - so fresh and delicious.  The sauce was light and tangy - not too garlic-y.  It was way too much food - I had to get a to-go box.      The dim lighting makes everyone gorgeous - this is a great place for first dates!"}
{"text":"I have been to Brio several times now. Each time the food and service has been excellent. Today I went for lunch and our food came out quickly and tasted great. He waitress was right on the spot. Good place for dinner but even better for lunch."}
{"text":"This place is a must if you live in the clt area.  Clean, professional and tasty...my go to place when I'm in town. Best server in town too (Daniel)"}
{"text":"The lasagna was nice... But Olive Garden nice, too much abuse and salt. Mimics savoriness without really delivering. Was warned the portion was huge but I finished the serving easily. Nothing to write home about and certainly not worth $18  Great bar staff but super crowded bar. Draws an older crowd on live music night and they tend to park themselves at the bar."}
{"text":"The best beef carpaccio. And I have had a lot, trust me. For a chain restaurant, this appetizer is not a disappointment."}
{"text":"Brios does an amazing salad. My favorite has been the sliced steak salad.  Tonight I had their wedge salad with bacon, tomato and dressing.  Absolutely fantastic."}
{"text":"Food and service were very good. I had the Lobster Bisque soup, which was tasty, although it could have used a bunch more lobster. The bruschetta sampler was delish though!!!"}
{"text":"Love this restaurant. ..the decor is beautiful and the atmosphere is a perfect complement to an intimate dinner.  Food was awesome as was the service. Unlike many upscale establishments this restaurant has not succumbed to the ripoff pricing structure of a \"fixed price menu\". Great experience for a Valentine`s dinner."}
{"text":"An exceptionally well run chain. Tuscan/Mediterranean feel creates a good vibe. Staff is exceptional. Food is average. Outside on the patio is great for nice days. But back to the food. Act like their fried Calamari is God's Gift. Making fried anything ain't hard, and there's is definition of mediocre."}
{"text":"I tend to forget about this place when thinking about a dinner out.  That's sad to say because I really enjoy the dishes here.  Great food and the service is as good as any.  Combine that with the decor and dim lighting and it actually makes a pretty good date night location for me and my love.  The particular night we were visiting they actually cooked an extra calamari starter plate and offered it to us for free. That's a win!"}
{"text":"I like Brio for a chain restaurant they always know how to make a good drink. I try not to go out to eat late after being I. The industry for many years Tahoe people that walk in 10 mins before close used to kill me  but my fiancé works late and we went in around 10:25 one say when they were due to close at 11pm. We still got amazing service , perfect freshly prepared food and were not ignored or rushed... So in one slightly dirty martini and one great tip later we have decided we will go again ... Thanks Brio...."}
{"text":"Had a great service yesterday (Sat at 7:30) at Brio legacy. Amanda provided an amazing service. Food was great lamb chops and shrimp and lobster pasta was perfect. Italian wedding soup was a bit salty. Overall had a great time."}
{"text":"My favorite is their salmon salad. The combination of the greens and the salmon with the asparagus is just so tasty. I also really love the bruschetta sampler. The toppings change often, but each time I'm thrilled with the tastes."}
{"text":"My husband and I recently had dinner here on a Saturday evening. We made reservations and were seated immediately.   We ordered the calamari as an appetizer, as well as the mushroom ravioli and Pasta Alla Vodka. I also ordered a Peach Bellini. The drink brought out quickly but after a few sips I decided it was too sweet for me so let my husband finish it. We received the appetizer pretty quickly as well, but soon discovered there was a hair mixed in with it. Someone came over quickly to take the plate away and shortly after, our waitress asked if we wanted a fresh one. We obliged and within a few minutes we were receiving our main dishes. I thought it was odd how quickly they came out. Within moments of receiving the entrees, we received our fresh calamari. We had to work on the appetizer while we ate our entrees. The Calamari was very good and the mushroom ravioli was delightful, but my husband said he was disappointed with the Pasta Alla Vodka. We also noted that all the other tables around us had bread and we weren't offered any. We decided against desserts."}
{"text":"Good spot for a light meal. Great soup choices, lovely brunch items, and elegant presentation. Any place that provides linen napkins wins points with me."}
{"text":"This is a classic Italian restaurant in the South Park area. If you dine in the evening they have a live band playing. The service was wonderful and the food was delicious. The place was clean and it seemed to be busy for a week night. The margarita was tasty and the salmon Fresca was delish. It seems to be a bit pricer of a restaurant in charlotte and I'm from a big city (chicago). They have valet and a parking garage nearby. The restrooms are clean. The offer mints upon your departure. Nice place to try."}
{"text":"This was my first time inside Brio. I've seen it often when around Southpark. But I was definitely pleased to experience it finally.   We had a ladies night full with drinks and dinner. We were planning to meet at 7:30 on Saturday night, but we decided an hour before maybe we should call to see about the wait. Thank goodness that we did. They had call ahead sitting. By the time we all got there, we were only waiting maybe 10min. With drinks, that was no time.   About my food, it was excellent - everything. We tried apps, pasta, seafood, and dessert. All delicious. The crab dip was very good. I only wish they gave you more. I ordered the Lobster and Shrimp Pasta. Beyond tasty. A little spicy, but delicious. All my favorite ingredients, seafood (lobster/shrimp), mushrooms, cheese, noodles and it had tomatoes and green onions. It was a lot for a dinner portion, so I had lunch the next day. Now on to the dessert. We tried the sampler - Bread Pudding, Creme Brulee, and Apple Crisp, as everything looked good. My favorite the Creme Brulee. Very well made.   Now I saved my favorite for last - their Flirtinis drink. Absolutely amazing! They were medium in terms of alcohol level to me. But they were so sweet and went down smooth. I also tasted the two Sangrias, but the Fliritini was the best.  Loved, loved. I want to go back now."}
{"text":"Overall, I enjoyed my time at Brio. Although she could be more knowledgeable, my server was pretty great (Jenna). I stopped by after a long day shopping at Legacy Village and sat at the bar - so I'm not sure if that makes the difference in the quality of service as you are right there in front of them the entire time.  I will say that I didn't get the oil and sun dried tomato for my bread that everyone else seems to get. Jenna's wine suggestion and the Tuscan Chicken Salad were amazing though. LOVED the food! I did sub out the Italian dressing for the red wine vinaigrette on the salad, and was really happy with that choice!  I agree with other reviewers that it is over-priced for what you get, but have no major complaints on the food itself."}
{"text":"I never expect a whole lot out of chain restaurants that dress themselves up and pretend they're fine dining.  It's not that I'm a snob and insist on REAL fine dining.  It's that I'd just rather go to a local joint that is family owned where the dishes weren't conceived at some bullshit food academy alongside a picturesque hillside in Tuscany.  All that being said, occasionally my wife convinces me that it's a good idea to go to one of those places, and in the case of Brio, their carbonara is pretty freaking tasty.  I don't care if it's even remotely traditional or authentic.  It tastes great.    Our service was comical.  My wife and I ordered a bottle of wine and our server had no clue how to open it.  She'd never seen a wine bottle before in her life - not even a picture of one in a magazine.  I'm surprised she didn't just set it down on the table and walk away.  How could she know so little about how to open it, but at the same time know that it needed to be opened?  I don't fault her at all.  Restaurants shouldn't hire people to serve food and wine unless they've proven in some way or another that they are capable of doing these things at the most basic level.  I felt so much pain in my heart for her that I eventually asked her to lean strategically into the table to hide me from her manager while I opened the bottle for her.  I wish I had video of her attempts before I took mercy on her, though.  It was positively fantastic stuff.  She was bad all around, but she was attractive and had a bubbly personality, something my wife and I both appreciate in a server of either gender.  The food, though... In the world of chain Italian make-believe fine dining establishments, Brio reigns supreme.  I could've eaten the carbonara until I exploded like the guy in Seven."}
{"text":"I don't normally dine out for Italian food but when I do it's Brio's Tuscan Grille."}
{"text":"Ya feel like a million bucks and they park your car...."}
{"text":"Great place! Had a party of 9 a very good place, enthusiastic waiter, food was great. The way the dessert menu is brought out so you see exactly what it's gonna look like before you get it."}
{"text":"The food and drinks were excellent and the staff was very friendly. Since it was my Birthday our Server offered to take a pic for us. Best Birthday Dinner ever! I will return."}
{"text":"Very nice restaurant, great deco and easy to location.  I like their dessert and steak receipe.  I didn't know it was a chain restaurant in the beginning until my buddy told me.   I saw many hottie at the restaurant which increase my ability to drink and eat more.  Great choice for a couple and weekend social lunch.  It is 100 times better choice than the \"O Graden\"... OK"}
{"text":"This place ruined my spring break the day before a flight I went here the place was crowded and the waiter mouthy.  If someone first meal in America was here they would probably jump off the nearest cliff.  I've had better food at Taco Bell I would rather eat my dogs Diet Salmon Protein Food than eat out here.  On my 7 hour flight to Maui I threw up a total of 9 times not including when I woke up if I could I would bulldoze this place and replace it with a knock off Chipotle.  Just the act of getting rid of this place would earn you a Nobel Peace Prize."}
{"text":"Service was outstanding. Food was tasty as well. Those bread crisps they give you with the pre-dinner loaf of bread- wow! I wish I could buy those! Maybe soften the pad of butter you serve b forehand because you know no one can spread that when it's straight out of the fridge. And the caprese salad, really, the greens on top? I literally couldn't see the cheese or tomato underneath when it was served and was confused. It was like you forgot the greens and just threw them on top of the actual caprese part? Odd. But all delicious none the less, I was recommend to others and return."}
{"text":"There are many things to love about Brio Coastal Bar and Kitchen--this restaurant serves up made-from-scratch dishes for breakfast, lunch, and Sunday traditional brunch, with $5 happy hour wine, cocktails and bar bites.  My personal Brio Coastal favorites:  - All infusions specially the pineapple vodka, and the spicy mango tequila.  - Whipped ricotta toast, or avocado toast for brunch. - Grilled salmon with couscous. - Their two weekdays happy hour (3:30-6:30pm) and (9pm to close). Try crispy shrimp napoli and quesadilla.  Great  laid back spot. Four solid Yelps."}
{"text":"I just recently visited this restaurant this past Friday. This restaurant had a really nice crowd, it almost looked full. We did not have to wait, and were helped immediately. Our server was really nice. They had a live cover band performing. The food was really delicious and flavor full. We did not have any complaints. (I ordered the Glaze Salmon w/ Asparagus)"}
{"text":"I was doing some shopping at the mall for running shoes and it was lunch time so I headed over to Brio for their Chopped Salad and a beer.  Got out of there for less than 10 bucks...not bad.  I sat at the bar, but during the late afternoon the place was dead...so either there or in front of the kitchen are good spots if you don't like sitting in a place with no one in it."}
{"text":"I would have normally given a higher rating to Brio, but I have one major complaint about this location in particular. The bar area is ridiculously cold, I had to sit in a winter jacket the entire time. After asking the waiter, he said that the temperature sensors are next to the kitchen, so half the restaurant is very warm and half is very cold. For that reason, I simply could not enjoy my dinner."}
{"text":"This was the first time we have been in years. Had a CitiPass coupon and thought we'd try it. The food is SO good! And plenty for leftovers!   I had chicken Parmesan. My husband had shrimp Mediterranean. And I had a spicy tequila drink that was awesome.  However their website needs some work because I can't find it on Google. I found the menu on yelp.   It's a bit pricey, so probably need another coupon before I return. Can't wait! Dinner with one mixed drink, one glass of wine and one beer; two entrees and one side salad was about $77. Coupon helped...$20 off.   Great job Brian Wells, GM!"}
{"text":"Slow service..... Bottle of wine came post dinner and Irish coffee came post dessert........ No excuse"}
{"text":"Good eggplant Parm. Lukewarm, barely-drained pasta in a passable sauce. Meatballs described as having beef and pork tasted more like beef and sausage--big difference. Overpowering rosemary overall--even in the bread. Indifferent service. Won't be back!"}
{"text":"Everything was great! I got the lobster bisque and shrimp with lobster fettuccine. My husband got the carbonara and we split the warm chocolate cake for dessert... everything was really good!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed our YELP Restaurant Week 30% off and please see the ticket to see the charges and discounts.  Lobster Bisque was tasted during the Yelp Xmas party and it was still consistent. Very good.   The risotto wasn't the greatest as I've had better in Denmark of all places...some porridge shop but the shrimp were plump and a good size. For lunch you'll get the risotto and soup or a salad. On this cold day, the bisque was it.   The burger was a double patty with special sauce and no onions. Toasted bun and I was impressed enough as I got a sample plus the fries are tasty and seasoned well.   We returned, SAME DAY, for the Happy Hour special and really WON!  Nope, the 30% off doesn't apply to additional deals and it shouldn't. Yo, everything is $5 on the bar menu. $5. $5 $5   The shrimp and eggplant is my new go to!  Tried the quesadilla AND it had no meat = okay.  Tried the napoli shrimp and I don't care for it for me as I need my red sauce limited to certain items and shrimp ain't one of them.  Tasted the nacho's and the chips were fresh and well seasoned. Didn't eat it with the toppings.  Service is a tandem thing here and that's the best part. They need to workshare so the customer is never left behind.   Live music was setting up on our way out.  Relaxed atmosphere.   The lobster & shrimp risotto is back on the dinner menu.  Lemonade is NOT fresh sequeezed but instead is OUT THE PACK. Insert emoji eyes here.  Anywhoo, you should give this place a good great once over.  None of the fried items were greasy nor heavily weighted with batter nor old grease.  Kudos, Brio!  The family was impressed as well. Considering that includes Gen Z to the Greatest Generation - I'd say you're winning."}
{"text":"Went to Brio with another couple last Saturday night for restaurant week. We were seated upon arrival which is always nice. Our server, Kelly, came to the table quickly and provided excellent service throughout the meal. I have been to Brio several times before and it was always a good experience and so was this time. All of us enjoyed our meals. The atmosphere is very nice too. Restaurant Week in regards to the price is an ok deal but nothing to go out of your way for."}
{"text":"Nice Italian food. Service may not always be fast, but if enjoyment of a great meal with friends or family is your goal, Brio will be your best bet."}
{"text":"On a whim we decided to go to brio - we had a kid in our group and figured it would be a good choice despite the yelp reviews. upon arrival the hostess said it would be at least 45 minutes, which we were not really interested in doing.  She could sense our distress and came over and said she had a reservation cancel and could get us seated in about 10 minutes - she was a very nice girl, I wish I could remember her name to give her kudos.  Our waitress was very nice, and service overall was prompt.  I have to say, for a chain the food was very good.  Everyone in our group of 5 had a good meal.  I ordered a NY Strip and a Crab Cake - the crab cake was good, full of crab meat.  The steak was cooked perfectly and was very flavorful and tender.  I was kind of shocked by it.  My girlfriend had the short ribs which she said were excellent.  She barely at half of the dish because it was so much food.  The manager, who was constantly walking the room noticed she stopped eating and came to the table to check in an make sure everything was ok.  I was kind of blown away by that kind of service at a chain.  I have had plenty of meals at Cleveland's best restaurants where the service was lacking so much that it made the whole experience poor.    Overall - was very good, food and service - and while we don't eat at chains often it's nice to know this option is here."}
{"text":"We just walked in for lunch about ten minutes ago and we were greeted and sat almost immediately. The server came over in a rush and asked us what we wanted to drink, never told us his name, and left. He returned with the drinks and told us that the soup was mushroom and that he would be right back, he never came back. We ended going up to the host stand and I told them that we were leaving and why and all they could say, there were two of them, is that they were \"soooo sorry\"! And just like that they let two customers walk out the front door. I guess it's a good thing that this particular location is always busy. Way to go brio, bravo is no better."}
{"text":"Great food, horribly long, slow service. My guess is that the restaurant was understaffed yesterday but we had a party of 7 with reservations. It took 18 minutes to get seated and then an hour to get our entrees. It was bizarre. Our server was kind, but we saw many tables eat and leave during the time we were seated, then she brought the check without asking how to split it--she was stressed. We also froze to death in the room where we were seated. Several requests to turn the heat up and we still had to eat with our coats on.  Maybe call before you go to see how they are staffed?"}
{"text":"Dined here for the first time and loved it. I was seated immediately with my reservation. Great customer service from beginning to end. The food was plated well, great portion,  and fair pricing. The decor and vibe was good in the restaurant. Free parking close by. Also the old fashion cocktail was great!!! Strong but good. I will for sure be attending again."}
{"text":"My fault for not making a reservation this last Saturday Night!  They were packed with a 1.5 hours wait.  I said \"cant wait that long\" and the front desk guy said he'd look in the bar.  He got us to the last open table immediately.  We were served fast a wonderful waitress: Amanda, great, great food and he saved our evening.  I highly recommend the place!!"}
{"text":"Bad night at Brio. Smoke in the restaurant. Food cold. Service slow and overwhelmed. Missed order items."}
{"text":"What used to be a great chain is now a fallen giant. I used to love this place. I won't be back. Lobster bisque (why we came here) and the mushroom soup was salty. Very little lobster. Huge disappointment. Two of us had chicken Marsala with Yukon gold mashed potatoes and vegetable medley. Both were served cold an sent back. The bruschetta was good but the balsamic reduction was sparingly added. We were given free dessert to make up for our expensive, lousy meal. :-("}
{"text":"Amazing Beef Carpaccio!!  Best we've ever had!!  Also great pastas and salads and really delicious sour dough bread!!"}
{"text":"I went with my wife an friends on Saturday this was a birthday meal , the food was excellent I had the shrimp and lobster fetuchinni is was awesome we had the peach sangria is was awesome and I also apreciated the complementary valet parking. I will definitely return ."}
{"text":"Having lived in Virginia before coming to Charlotte, I frequented the Brio in Tysons Corner quite often. It was a nice place for lunch and dinner with friends.   Since moving, I've visited this location three times and it does not disappoint. This location has a larger dining room and bar area than the one that I was accustomed to. And since the VA one was in a mall, it lacked the outdoor seating that this one has. Which is a definite plus!  The food here is terrific. I'm a fan of their pastas. Good portions, nice flavor. Good stuff.  We also had the chocolate molten lava cake. I must say, it was delicious.   Service was fast and attentive. Our meal was out pretty quick. Our waitress was especially warm and personable and gave her share of suggestions.   Price isn't bad. Definitely a nice place to take a special someone to dinner. The bar area is cool too. And apparently they have appetizer specials in the bar area on weeknights.  Definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Excellent chicken pasta recommendation by the bartender. We sat at the bar and got quick good service. Bartender was extremely friendly. Great location. Indoor and outdoor dining. Outdoor party was going on and the let you bring in your own table decorations."}
{"text":"This was our second visit. The service was unprofessional and hurried; the waitress removed one dish, all the bread, butter and utensils while another person on the table was still eating. Another waiter yelled to a table ten feet away... To add to that poor service, the bathroom was deplorable. We complained to a manager who just said sorry and shrugged it off. A true disappointment!"}
{"text":"Really sad happy hour with really limited options. Server was super nice though! Spicy mango marg was not spicy and didn't taste good.  Disappointed."}
{"text":"Came in & sat at the bar again for dinner.  Bartenders are helpful when you can get their attention.  I think if I was on display (behind a bar) as they are...I would be more circumspect about discussing the tips I get, what I did last night (:O) etc...  My pasta dish was really spectacular though!  It was the Lobster & Shrimp Ravioli with Crab Insalata.  Very well stuffed ravioli, cooked perfectly!  The crab insalata was some yummy dark greens dressed with a light viniagrette & plenty of yummy chunks of crabmeat.    The tomato sauce really was the best though...very bright, creamy with a slight smoky sweetness.  Chunks of stewed tomatoes throughout (but not stewed down to mush).  I'd definitely recommend this dish."}
{"text":"We came here for my husband's 40th birthday surprise dinner and were treated like royalty here. We had a table of 15 (they took our reservation where other restaurants in the same complex gave me issues when trying to make one for a large party) and had multiple servers helping us and we never felt rushed the entire time. We also brought in an outside cake that they stored for us in their commercial fridge, brought out to the table with already lite candles and cut up the cake for all of us.  The food was really good and the service was prompt. Would definitely recommend for a large party or celebration. They really know how to treat their customers."}
{"text":"I came here not knowing what to expect. Turns out that the place is fantastic! I sat around the bar area. You also have the option to sit outside. The area is really new and clean, so it can be nice out there. As for the bar area, it was kind of crowded, but there was a sweet live band. Oh, and lots of ladies in their 40s getting crunk and getting down... It was kind of awkward for me because there were only a couple people in their 20's there, but at the same time, it was pretty interesting to see, lol.  I really only came here to eat though, and have a couple drinks before going out. Food was on point. The bread and crackers were delicious. I preferred the crackers; there was cheese on it or something. We started off with some calamari and then I had the veal marsala classico. Calamari is always good anywhere-- the pieces were pretty large too. It came with two sauce, a mayo that I thought was too rich in taste and a marinara sauce. I like to mix the two... My main dish tasted great. Not sure how to explain the sauce... I really like mushrooms too! I enjoyed how the vegetables and potatoes complemented the veal. mmmM!   Ask for Edith, she's an amazing waitress/bartender!"}
{"text":"Try out the new menu.  The food is great and changed enough to make this place fresh.  There has been a huge shift in staff and menu so if you wanted more of the same then you are out of luck.  The new entrees and drinks are better in my opinion.  No matter what you have heard or think, I recommend you revisit Brio if you are a longtime customer and try it if you haven't ever been."}
{"text":"Ambiance: 0/5 - WARNING: Beware of the table in the furthermost corner. If I've learned anything from seeing Mac & Dennis's woes at Guigino's on It's Always Sunny, it's not to sit right in front of the kitchen. Unless you enjoy (1) being slammed in the back by a heavy, mammoth of a curtain every time a server emerges from the kitchen, or (2) listening to the soothing cacophony of rattling dishes blended with the grumblings of disgruntled waitstaff, I highly recommend avoiding this area.  Food: 3/5 - For the prices, I wasn't terribly impressed with the food. The grilled pork chop and side of brussels sprouts were salty and over-seasoned.   Service: 0/5 - Our waitress was the epitome of DGAF. She was visibly pissed when we didn't order drinks. Our water glasses were never refilled. When we asked for more bread, she didn't bother to clear the table and instead stacked the second bread basket INSIDE and on-top of the first bread basket. She specialized in the art of eyerolling and radiated condescension, especially when we handed her a $10 off coupon when our check came.   As a first time visitor to this location and to this chain, I was so turned off. There are so many better restaurants in the area to choose from... avoid this place!"}
{"text":"Each and every member of the staff was polite and very friendly. David was our server as well as Anthony for a bit. They were both absolutely wonderful and made sure we were enjoying our experience. The atmosphere of the restaurant is fantastic, very open and calm. I ordered the Pasta alla Vodka, Lobster bisque cup, and peach croissant. The pasta was quite frankly the best meal I have ever had at a restaurant. The chicken was perfectly seasoned and cooked, the pasta was delicious, and the ricotta filling was absolutely stunning. Every other part of the meal was great as well. The only disappointment is that I am leaving the area tomorrow and will not be able to eat here for some time!"}
{"text":"We will return; the food was good, and the service was excellent.  I want to go back and purchase a basketful of those sourdough breads;  I normally pass on the bread, but this was warm and had wonderful flavor.  My husband and daughter happily munched on those triangular herbed toast thingys (they're almost like crackers).  My  balsamic chicken and orzo (with broccoli, tomatoes, and other good stuff in there) was nicely done (and there was plenty to share), and my daughter and husband enjoyed their dinner salads.  For dessert, we shared a lava cake with ice cream, and it was luscious!  Gia provided great service.  Except for my iced tea, we did not order drinks, and Gia kept our water glasses filled (she had a number of other tables, and she was taking good care of those folks as well).  Another staff member delivered our meals while the food was hot, and Gia stopped by to make certain that everything was to our liking.  A manager checked in as well (there were at least two who continued to make rounds through the dining room).  Our check was delivered, our payment applied promptly, and we were thanked and encouraged to come back soon.  What a pleasant end to the work week/beginning of the weekend!"}
{"text":"I've been to many locations of Brio so I had no problem suggesting my party of 4 dine there this evening. I've not been to a Brio that had a live band in the bar area. It must be a cash maker to draw folks into the bar area but personally it was too loud and they weren't that good and heavily detracted from the atmosphere I am accustomed to in the Brios I've dined at. If I want to hear All about that Bass or Rhianna I would turn on a radio not listen to a sub par cover band.   We worked our way thru the bar flies and were seated. We waited about 5 minutes before our waiter came by and introduced himself and took our drink order. We waited another 10 minutes for the waiter to actually bring the drinks and take our appetizer order. At the time the drinks came we asked for 4 glasses of water as well. Literally 15 minutes later our water arrived and our order was taken. Still haven't seen any bread for the table mind you.  Our appetizer, pepperoni, sausage and ricotta Flatbread, arrived and was quite good. Our salads and entrees arrived shortly thereafter. Everyone enjoyed their entree. Mine was spicy which I would have preferred it wasn't but I forgot to mention that when ordering. I honestly attribute that to the long wait before the waiter took our order, I just forgot to tell him because I was getting irked at the extremely slow service. .  I guess my annoyance started to get obvious because as the meal was ending the waiter came by and was apologetic stating there were several parties tonight. Now all of a sudden we were getting attention? Too little too late dude.   I do understand there might have been parties but my dining experience shouldn't have been sullied and suffered.  My dollars are as important as the people having a birthday party. If anything, management should have seen they had parties booked and realized that, along with a Friday night crowd, means bring in extra staff to ensure everyone's experience is super.   Once again, food... 3.5 to 4 stars. Service... well.....ehhh. Avg=2 stars."}
{"text":"I've dined at Brio a number of times at various locations across the nation.  I have always loved the food, atmosphere, and service.  Let me also mention that I also always ordered the same dish (Grilled Salmon Salad) on each visit.    It had been a few years since we had dined at Brio so after I received a certificate for a free entree (steak and shrimp) for my birthday, I thought it would be a great opportunity to go back.  There were 4 of us in our party (me, husband, mother, and son).  We started with drinks (Blue Moon, Sprite, Watermelon Margarita, and Peach Bellini).  The drinks were all very good.  We ordered Calamari for our appetizer and I was very disappointed.  The Calamari appeared to be made from frozen, the batter was bland, and the temperature of the dish was luke warm, at best.  Our entrees were also a let down in terms of temperature....especially since we waited a long time for our entrees.  My husband's Sausage Pomodoro was the only dish with steam coming from it, my son's Lasagna was very warm (not hot), and my Mom's Grilled pork chops were barely warm.  I ordered the Steak and Shrimp with Orzo.  The bottom of the scoop of orzo was very warm (not hot), but everything else on the plate was luke warm.  The sauce on the beef was heavily peppered and I had to remove it from the meat in order to eat it.  The Shrimp was also very peppery and I could only eat a couple of them.  When we told that waitress that the food was barely warm, she made a comment that she \"didn't make the food\".  I know that she was trying to be funny, but I really didn't think it was appropriate nor did she try to make it right.  My son and I ordered mini desserts (milk chocolate caramel and tiramisu, respectively).  When the waitress delivered them, she put a candle in mine for my birthday and then told me \"I don't sing, so don't ask\".  Again...I think she was trying to be funny, but it still seemed a bit cold and unnecessary.  On the bright side...the Tiramisu was pretty decent.  The realization of just how poor the meal really was came to light when the bill came.  I've been known to drop some serious money for a great meal and I will never complain about price as long as the meal is great.  However, to have sub-par service, luke warm food, over seasoned sauces (and under seasoned calamari), and a sassy waitress it sickened me to pay $160.00 for that meal!       Sadly, I'm quite sure that I won't be going back to Brio anytime soon.   There are too many good restaurants in South Park to go back to one where I've had a bad meal."}
{"text":"I really like the atmosphere here.  The absolute best thing I've had is their Gorgonzola-topped filet.  They have an awesome menu with great variety.  Great happy hour specials too!!"}
{"text":"Where do I start... so I am new to Cleveland and was temporarily located in the Cleveland heights area for work. I ate out everyday and tried lots of places. I must say that this was my best meal during my visit to that area. I had the lobster bisque, which was delicious, not too fishy and served with a wonderful French or sourdough (not sure) bread. My server was amazing, best service I had in any establishment while I was there. He was so amazing in fact, that It's been 3 weeks since my visit and I still remember his name \"Anthony\". For my main entree I chose the vodka pasta.... I think this was the best decision I've made in years. Seriously, that good. The pasta is shaped like a wonton square and they fill it with this amazing creamy cheese blend. The vodka sauce was perfect with just a touch of spice. The pancetta was crispy and delicious!!!! Oh man I'm hungry just thinking about it..... yum!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Guessing Brio Coaster Bar and Kitchen was somewhat more Mediterranier before it got all eastern seaboarded up? In any case it's all here now... Came in for late lunch and sat down to coffee black and iced water, MLB chose an english tea. We shared buffalo cauliflower while waiting for our entres: fish sandwich for me, the shrimp risotto combo for my lovely bride. The bread and crisps played well with the sliced and grilled cauliflowers under buffalo sauces, her salad showed up early so I got a little extra  :-) Fish sandwich came out with a harpoon through it looking like Moby Dick on a challah roll. Substantial slab of hot, crispy fish topped with an interesting slaw and dressing with a cup o' fries beside. We were well attended throughout, never left wanting for coffee, water, tea or anything."}
{"text":"Updated review:   The manager reached out to me and was so nice and friendly that we have it another shot!!!    This time, I went for a late lunch and sat on the patio.  The patio is awesome and the chairs are comfy.    We ordered Moscow mules.  There were a little sweet but still good.  The waitress brought out bread right away, this was a change from the first time.  Really nice getting our drinks promptly and having bread!  We ordered the pepperoni flatbread, calamari, and a Caesar salad.  The flatbread was really good and had a lot of pepperonis on it.  The calamari was decent, but a little soggy in the sauce it was sitting in.  The salad was very different from any salad Caesar salad I've had but I thought it was good."}
{"text":"Celebrated a family birthday here over the weekend. I would say its a great special occasion place. Not super fancy, but a little pricey for what you get. We had to wait about 40 minutes for a table on a Sunday night when they had plenty available, they must not have had enough staff on. Went to the bar to wait and had some cocktails. Our server was pretty good and everyone enjoyed their meal. It also took a really long time for the food to come out even though they were not very busy. The manager had to come over and apologize. I think everyone working must have been a little burnt out at the end of a long weekend.   The brussel sprouts were my most favorite thing. Pork chop and calamari were also a hit."}
{"text":"This was a Bar experience only. I was posted up at the bar waiting for a Yelp Elite event to start and figured I would grab a drink. They do not have any draft beer! Whaaat?! Just a list of bottled craft and ordinary beer. That was disappointing, but at least they did have some good craft choices. Ended up with a couple OMB Mecktoberfests. Bar staff was friendly.  I also happened to try their grilled shishito peppers. Holy moly! Whaaat!? So good! Grab an order of those, stat!  After my fantastic experience with the aforementioned Yelp Elite, I will be coming back!"}
{"text":"After reading all the great reviews for this place, my friends & I decided to try it out for a friend's birthday. Unfortunately we left disappointed and underwhelmed. I guess that's what happens when you've been spoiled by Zebra Restaurant!  We went on a Saturday night at 6:30. The place looks nice and there is a lot of staff on hand at this time. Our server however didn't give off a very friendly vibe. Maybe she was having a bad day or was just busy, but we all sort of felt like nuisances, and we hardly ever needed anything extra (and I've worked in the food industry--I know annoying tables very well).  I ordered off of the light menu. None of our food took very long (even though the restaurant was a little busy) which is why I'm giving three stars instead of two. The only thing is my dish wasn't very filling. I know some people think, \"Well, healthier means less satisfying.\" That's definitely not the case--if it is, you're doing healthy food wrong. It was pretty tasty, just not really enough for dinner.  We were in and out in about a half hour, which on a Saturday evening wasn't at all what we expected or even really wanted. Maybe if we had another server we wouldn't have felt like the place was an \"eat and run\" restaurant. It's a little sad when more casual restaurants have better servers than those that are supposedly \"nicer\" restaurants. I will say though that the gentlemen going around helping to refill drinks and bread baskets were very nice, and everyone else looked to be enjoying themselves. It's too bad because we'll happily spend plenty of money on great food (and more on great service).  I doubt we'll be back."}
{"text":"WOW! This was our first time here and it won't be our last. We had reservations and got sat in no time. The restaurant itself is just beautiful. It has a calm and rustic look. Our server was very friendly and gave great selections.   The bread that they serve is fresh and warm. We each started off with a salad. I got the kale caesar salad. The dressing was so good!! The toppings added a nice touch to it. My husband also liked his salad. I got the lobster and shrimp pasta. It was a pretty large portion. The shrimp and lobster was good but slightly overcooked. The sauce was good and wasn't too salty. My husband got the salmon and was pretty pleased with it. The prices are decent too.   This restaurant is great for all occasions. It's perfect for a date night!!"}
{"text":"I love the place, we go at least once a week. I have all my freinds hooked on Brio's food.  We always go for the 4-7 appettizers for 2.97 each, most are surprised when they see the portions of these apps for 2.97.  The shrimptini is out of this world, my freind is allergic to shrimp but said how tasty it looked.  The shirmp had the best flavor and cocktail sauce and I dont like cocktail sauce but this will eat.  The margarita flatbread with the goat cheese is so light and wonderful. The steak bruschettaa with balsamic reduction mmmm  we end  up with two orders every time. You have to eat in the bar or patio area for these apps. We sat outside last week and they were great to us. They inclosed it for us and turned on the lamps to keep us warm it was beautiful sitting outside looking up and we werent freezing to death.  If your on a budget this is great a few freinds share some great apps and than head over to San Antonio for the 1 margarita :)"}
{"text":"I have never once had a bad experience here. Always amazing service, great food and good energy here!"}
{"text":"Beef carpaccio was great!!!  My wife and I took are two little kids out for a nice dinner and we were very happy with the quality of our food. I asked that my grilled salmon be rare and it was spot on. The wife and six year old shared a NY strip and it was a also a perfect medium rare. The dirty martini was well made and I tried their bourbon, honey, peach cocktail. Not bad (I typically avoid drinks with fruit flavor).  As a New Yorker, I do have an issue with their pizza. Not enough sauce, way too much cheese, and the crust was too buttery/oily. Will be going back."}
{"text":"I came here for a lunch meeting. I wasn't paying for the meal so I wanted to make sure I got something fairly inexpensive and easy to eat while talking.   I decided on the lobster bisque and even though I tend to shy away from getting it at most places (it's made too rich most of the time) it was the bestttttt decision I could have made!! Lump lobster and creamy, it was perfect! Better than Ruth's Chris FYI. I would argue best in Charlotte.  You're welcome."}
{"text":"Despite being a chain, Brio is one of my favorite places for dinner. The food is always good quality, with the lamb being a particular favorite of mine. Likewise, the carpaccio is always fantastic, with just enough seasoning, but not so much that it's over powering. Their wine list is pretty good, and I actually think their house Sauvignon Blanc is on par with more expensive wines. The service is always reliably good, regardless of how busy the restaurant is. The only major draw back to Brio, in my opinion, is they don't have any draft beers or local beers - the lack of draft and locals knocks one star off the review, because that's a big let-down for my BF when we go for dinner. Otherwise, A+"}
{"text":"Today's business lunch was at Brio, and overall the food was quality but the service left a little to be desired. The food: -Calamari: crispy fried but still tender inside; nothing mind blowing but solid quality. Came with a horseradish spicy dipping sauce and marinara sauce, which were both good -Bruschetta Quattro: the bacon and ricotta bruschetta was incredible, the steak was also really good, and the other two were standard but good options. Great app to share! -Side salad: I give this a separate mention because it was HUGE; filled me up before my entree with the apps and was very tasty with fresh lettuce, tomato, onion, and cheese -Mediterranean shrimp: only 5 shrimp but they were flavorful, juicy and each were fairly large so no real complaints. The orzo was decent as were the vegetables it came with.  The service wasn't great by any means. Our waitress filled our drinks, was quick to take plates and was fairly nice, but they messed up multiple orders. One of my colleagues specifically asked for no gorgonzola on her salad but they put some on anyway. Then she didn't want to make us wait so she asked for the lobster bisque soup rather than having them cook steak for the salad over, but our waitress returned with minestrone instead. The food was also very, very slow to come out so I would avoid this location at lunch time if you're trying to get a semi-quick bite and get back to the office."}
{"text":"I ordered to go and got the shrimp/lobster risotto. There was not one single piece of lobster in the entire dish. Extremely disappointed."}
{"text":"Made reservations and they did not setup for all guests. Wait staff was unprofessional. Fish was rushed and over cooked, inedible. The waitress never came back to check on her meal after dropping it off later after everyone else got theirs. When she dropped off the check we let her know about the fish to get it comped (which very clearly went almost untouched), and her response was 'we'll see'. Not high end dining."}
{"text":"For me, I think there's only one way to do Brio: sit at the bar.  Why do I say this? Three words: Bar Plates Menu. It's only available during the week. Sorry weekenders. The BPM (why yes, I did decide to shorten it) has plates starting at $3.95, including a beef carpaccio that is delicious and a big size portion. You can't really go wrong with anything on this list for the price. I love the eggplant fries, too.  If you don't feel like sitting at the bar, Brio does have a great patio. Like Desiree F said in an earlier review, I don't go here a whole lot. There are just a lot of great places in this area. I've always had good service here. The atmosphere is nice. My last visit I talked to the manager on duty for a long time. She was really sweet. Parking is annoying for me, but that's more because I don't come here a whole lot and all the decks look the same.   Brio has a rewards program. You can get a card or download the app. After five visits, you can get $10 off your 6th."}
{"text":"Lobster bisque is pretty damn amazing! I also had the chicken club. Very tender and well seasoned. Not dry like a lot of chicken breast sandwiches you would normally eat."}
{"text":"Went there for Valentine's day and got the special; rib eye steak and shared it, it was huge! We also got the happy hour shrimp it was smothered in parmesan cheese, recommended by our waiter. The food was perfect, the rub was to die for!!! I will try to recreate it at home, I'm not a coffee drinker but bought ground coffee just to make the rub!!! We had a wonderful dinner, the drinks were ok, my mule was just so-so... I've had better, but overall we love the casual beachy decor and the servers are magnificent!!! This will definitely be a hang out for us after a movie or when we need something at the mall. I forgot our server's name but he was one of the best, well educated about their menu, a foody for sure, excited about food! Very relaxing, I like it better than the Great Maple and other restaurants at Del Amo Mall."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to celebrate our anniversary and my birthday.  My first impression was that I was underdressed.  We went on a Thursday evening in July and we thought some others would be more dressed down.  I later learned the Chamber of Commerce had a party there, which explained why there were so many suits there at 8 pm.  The restaurant was very loud and noisy, which hurts it a little.  The seating is very nice, though, and despite them being very busy I didn't feel cramped or boxed-in. I had lobster bisque for an appetizer and pan-seared tuna for my entree.  The lobster bisque was very good, and at $4.99 was a pretty good value, as well.  The tuna was expertly cooked, and was so tender it melted in my mouth.  The bread was very good, as were the salads.  My wife enjoyed her chicken and pasta dish, athough I am not sure what it was called.  We both felt it was the best meal we have had in awhile.  I ordered the house Pinot Grigiot (can't recall the brand) and it was a very subtle wine with a clean finish that was an expert pair with our meal, and only $21 per bottle.  My only service complaint is that my wine was served after my entree, when I had requested it be served with the entree.  I was eating slowly because I wanted to enjoy my wine with my tuna but didn't want the tuna to get cold, either.  All-in-all I feel this is a good restaurant to visit for Italian cuisine."}
{"text":"Quick dinner/meeting.... we call it a meeting so it can be expensed. A solid beer list, including a few local brews. I opted for the Pasta Brio and it was delicious. Our waiter was spot on, never leaving us with an empty glass or bread basket. I've eaten a few of their other locations, and each visit has been a positive experience."}
{"text":"Very extensive kids menu is the best thing going for Brio. Adult menu is rather pricey. Hubby had the lasagna bolognese, which was really tasty. My lobster bisque and chop salad were fine.  They dealt well with the large group we arrived with (boys hockey team - yikes). Thinking our team manager didn't match our group to the atmosphere too well."}
{"text":"Decided to stop here for lunch. We both ordered the fontina bacon burger with fries. We asked for the burgers to be cooked medium but they both came out well done. Despite that they were quite tasty. Bitter greens, creamy cheese, smoky bacon, and sweet tomato jam. The service was also good."}
{"text":"The food is amazing and the service is exceptional.  Went for my graduation then again for my anniversary, both times it was one of the best restaurant experiences I have had in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed sitting  outside with some ice tea and a nice steak salad. Service was a little slow"}
{"text":"Came here for a date night - it was awesome.  Good wine, good food, good conversation, gorgeous date!  Make it even more special, it was the day that the earnings came out for BBRG - only if I had bought stock in them back in April, I could've had Brio paying for my dinner based on the stock price!  Oh well.  Gotta go for the pork chops.  A co-worker of mine who hadn't dined there suggested I get the pork chops and being the malleable easy-going dude that I am, I said why not.  Pork chops were the best ever. Hands down - I don't know/care what else is on the menu, but it was, as my friends like to say, bomb diesel. :/  Truly a 4.5 - the only thing that kind of killed the 5 star potential was the desserts.  The creme brulee, a standard of any good restaurant, needs to be immaculate.  Theirs, however left much to be desired.  Thin crust and it was actually burnt a little bit - worst part was they tried to camoflauge it by putting a strawberry on top.  Sneaky, sneaky, but you won't get passed me!  Like I said, everything aside from the creme brulee was ON POINT.  I'd like to think my first date went well too because I was so funny, good-looking, smart, and of course, modest... but on balance, it was probably the restaurant that did all the legwork.  THANKS BRIO.  dmo out."}
{"text":"Nice interior and fair service but high prices and really iffy food. I firmly believe that the quality of Italian staples (i.e. spaghetti and meatballs, lasagna, etc.) are one of the absolute best ways to judge the overall worth of an Italian restaurant. If those key dishes are not on point it's all downhill from there. I ordered the lasagna at Brio this evening and truly cannot remember disliking a serving of lasagna this much in a very long time. My husband tasted the leftovers that I brought home and we both agree that it was actually pretty terrible. The noodles were way overcooked...soggy/mushy. It came in a weird white creamy Alfredo type sauce. I had to request red sauce to pour over it in an attempt to salvage it (failed attempt). Honestly, if you're going to serve bizarro white lasagna could you please put a warning label on the menu so that diners can adjust their expectations appropriately? The meat was totally lackluster, blah...verging on flavorless. Not sure what I just spent $40 on because I left feeling unfulfilled and have a vaguely unpleasant feeling in my stomach. The dish didn't sit well at all. Brio's valet was a total bust as well. I used valet to save time and that totally backfired as I came out to a long line and wasted about 15 min. waiting around while the two valet attendants took their time getting cars for an entire office holiday party who happened to walk out before I did. The whole operation was inefficient and unprofessional. Overall, a very disappointing outing at Brio...not looking to revisit any time soon."}
{"text":"Went back for the first time in a couple of months - they've changed the menu and decor a bit to be more of a coastal theme. That part was fine, but wedding soup seems to rarely be available (it's actually what we come for) - we ordered the burrata prosciutto toast to be severely disappointed - it was slathered with MAYONNAISE. (Yuck). The Burrata caprese appetizer was the smallest piece of burrata ever - they saved some grace when they split the main meal for my son & I ..... but this has sadly turned from the Brio I once adored. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Came in yesterday for a friend's birthday brunch. Our first choice was another restaurant nearby, but after a ridiculously long wait, we called Brio and found out that there was no wait so we walked right over and were amazed with the beautiful decor and the atmosphere. We waited for the rest of our party to arrive before ordering our food and I ordered the kale Caesar salad and lobster bisque, something light because I had another event to attend right after. Our service was EXCELLENT!! Our waiter was VERY friendly and professional and made sure that we were taken care of!! The food arrived and we were EXTREMELY PLEASED with the portions and quality of the food!! The kale salad was fresh and flavorful and the Caesar dressing was perfect!! The lobster bisque was AMAZING!! I'm used to getting struggly pieces of meat in my bisque but, to pull my spoon out and see a CHUNK of lobster...over and over again, was HEAVENLY!! Everything tasted delicious and you were given great-sized portions!! I would absolutely recommend that you come here!! I got a Mediterranean vibe with the decor and natural lighting. The patio area was super cute with string lights and everything!   I will ABSOLUTELY be coming back for a date night, or even just to meet up with friends!! Come in and try it! You will NOT be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere and the ability to alter the selections to my personal taste . Pasta was delicious and a large serving. Great for business meetings or a gathering with friends ."}
{"text":"Very reasonable prices for the amount of food you get. Nice quality service, delicious food (I had the salmon dish), great drinks. Everything was great, no complaints. Would recommend this restaurant for sure. Great ambiance and atmosphere. I will definitely be coming here again. They take reservations on weekends (unlike the Cheesecake Factory). We were supposed to be going there instead for my friends Birthday, but they said it was a 3 hour wait! ... Uhhhh, no! So a friend of ours recommend this place, and I am glad she did! Five star!  (Sorry for the Cheesecake rant)"}
{"text":"Simply put: I adore Brio. I tend to snag lunch from Brio at least every other week and have stopped in for happy hour several times as well. I have never had bad service and the food is top notch. Stellar patio with a cover area if you please. The steak bruschetta is the way to go for an app but I also end up back at the lobster bisque as it is stupidly good even in the summer. I usually wait until they bring the bread at the beginning and then dip it in the soup - your service will bring sourdough bread as well as crispy, thin, seasoned pieces to start off with. I have no clue what the crispy pieces are but they sure are tasty. The beer tends to be a little higher priced as $6 for a Blue Moon is more than I'm used to but hey, welcome to South Park.   Pro tip: Brio is one of many places in South Park that hosts a food happy hour. For this location, stop in between 4 and 6pm to snag discounted apps, like $5 spinach dip or $4 flatbread. Great way to try out Brio at a nice price!"}
{"text":"Came back once contacted by the manager Mark. Everything was excellent this time and Mark was kind enough to apologize for our bad experience and spend time talking to us and getting to know us. We will definitely be coming back in the future!"}
{"text":"My family and I were very disappointed with Brio a few weeks ago. It is one of the few chains I go to since you can normally count on a solid meal for a reasonable price. Wow, did that concept get blown out of the water this past trip for dinner. Everything was so salty, buttery and greasy. It was one awful experience and a total waste of money. The Chicken Parmesan (called something else) was all breading and so heavy on the grease. And all you could taste when eating the pasta was butter. This will be my last trip there, but it was a great run while it lasted."}
{"text":"I generally am a fan of Brio - fresh Italian food, very flavorful and appropriate portions. I came on a busy Saturday and it seems the front wasn't quite organized. We didn't get a warm greeting and the hostess were having intense discussions despite our reservation."}
{"text":"After having a not so great experience the first time I was contacted by the manager of the restaurant and offered for me and my family to come in so we could give them another try. It was a completely different experience! Everyone was extremely nice and the food was fabulous. I would definitely come in again! Thanks Patrick for the excellent lunch, it was a wonderful afternoon."}
{"text":"There was nothing memorable about this meal except it was below average mall food.  The waitress was nice!"}
{"text":"Brio gets 5 stars for customer service and 4 for food. After having an amazing experience here for a Yelp event, I made Brio the site for my 33rd Birthday dinner. Calling on the day of for a reservation for 22, the manager was very accommodating, waiving the requirement that all meals be on one check. She let me know that gratuity would be included and in the future, reserve the back room in advance. All VERY fair.    Brio was great getting my guest seated upon arrival. In a perfect world, everyone shows up at the same time, but that's unrealistic. Brio was so patient.   My only complaint is with the food. When I attended for a Yelp event, the salmon was to die for. You could taste the charred/smoked flavor and it was perfection. My birthday salmon wasn't quite as flavorful. I'm thinking the head chef was off duty for the night. That being said, my guest were pleased with their meals and happy to have eaten at a place where they had not yet dined. I'll be returning to Brio on a night without so many people. This was a very positive experience and I'd highly recommend Brio for a group dinner, date night, or quick bite with friends."}
{"text":"For being a chain restaurant, I have left pleasantly surprised by my experience for both lunch and dinner. From the food to the service, this location hits almost every checkbox. The location is in the heart of Legacy Village with valet parking outside, which I highly recommend using if you have already done a lap in your car and still cannot find a spot.   The decor is warm and inviting for all guests. In addition, the menu is heavily geared towards Italian cuisine with portion sizes being fulfilling, you may even be able to take home leftovers, depending on your appetite. I highly recommend the chicken parmesan, I know it's cliche, but it was to die for. Don't even get me started on the bread they serve while you are patiently waiting, either.  Along with this, they also have a full bar, but while at Brio, go for a glass of wine. Take a friend, family member or go solo dolo and check this place out!"}
{"text":"If I ever go back to Charlotte, NC I am returning to this place for many reasons. The food was delicious I had the lobster bisque, best I ever ate. Followed by the roasted garlic & spinach artichoke dip (I couldn't stop eating it), finally the Lunch crab cakes. The service was amazing, only wish I could have remembered her name. The restaurant was immaculate and so was the rest rooms. Only negatives were there was no changing station for our infant. I ordered two pomegranate martini's in which they were both made differently. However, I enjoyed the second much more."}
{"text":"The ambience here is beyond amazing and the event location is centralize around the shops boutiques and restaurants I didn't recommend anyone to eat in here if you really want to patio experience"}
{"text":"This is the first time in a while that I have went to a restaurant and have been disappointed with the service. The food was good, and that was the reason I gave the restaurant two stars, but I was disappointed in the service. Our waitress was continually forgetting the things we were ordering. I ordered a drink, and it did not come to our table until our after our appetizer had already arrived. My brother ordered ravioli, specifically without mushrooms, and our waitress thought he said, \"I only want mushrooms.\" So naturally, we had to wait for them to remake my brother's meal until we could eat. Again, when my brother ordered another beer it took an extended amount of time for his drink to arrive. I don't see myself running here again to eat any time soon. For as pricey as this restaurant is, I could now see my money could have been better spent elsewhere. After all, when you are going to a restaurant such as Brio where you know you are going to be spending a considerable amount of money, in my opinion, the service and experience are equally as important as the quality and taste of the food."}
{"text":"Visited this location last night 1/17/2015. Made a reservation for a large party and table was not ready upon arrival. Was told we could be seated once half of the party was there. More than half the party was there 5 minutes later and still had to wait for a table another 35 minutes.  After sitting, our waitress had more than one table even thought we have a party of 14. Took over an hr to get salads and appetizers.   Once food was brought to the table the portions were uneven to say the  least. Plus s few people said their good was cold!!  Used to love eating here, but after this night of embarrassment with friends and first time visitors...I dont think we will be back!!"}
{"text":"Delicious food but some if the worst wait staff I have ever encountered. My last server told me she was unaware that caffeine free meant the same thing as decaffeinated. The service was very slow and I think it is odd that the manager stops by to say hi to every table, but is unaware that you have been seated for 20 minutes and no one has taken your order."}
{"text":"This was kind of a depressing upper-end chain restaurant, exactly the sort of thing one settles on when traveling with a mixed group. The menu certainly wasn't vegetarian-friendly (let alone vegan), which I find odd given that Mediterranean cuisine (including whatever people eat in Tuscany) is usually more plant-based. Nevertheless, I settled on some mushroom ravioli and traded in appetizers, all of which was palatable but predictably overpriced.  It's a nice location, and there was live jazz on the night I was there, leading me to afford them a generous three-star rating."}
{"text":"The food here is good, the service here is HORRIBLE.  First of all, the wait was 1.75 hours long. We had actually gotten one of those electric waiting devices from an old couple who had already been waiting 1 hour already. We didn't get seated for another 45 minutes, with only a party of 3. Once we were seated....there was no waiter around.... and showed up after a good 5-10 minutes. She wasn't even smiling either... like annoyed we were there.  Nonetheless, the food was okay. I ordered the classic pasta brio-rigatoni, chicken, and mushrooms. I was saddened with the dish however, the noodles were overcooked.  Definitely too tough. My parents, however, got the lasagna, and that was GOOD. The ricotta and mozarella they use in it was great, although the Bolognese meat was a tad too salty. I switched plates with my parents near the end of the meal.  The decor is definitely cute- nice, dark, somewhat classy place to bring a date or go for a good dinner. The food and wait were a pain though. Would I return? Maybe, if a friend asked me?  I think maybe I should try the brunch menu instead...."}
{"text":"good food and good portions. good service too. just holy crap its expensive!!!"}
{"text":"Oh I LOVE this place. Very delicious and waitress was super super friendly and helpful. I really loved their flat bread. I packed them home hehe. I also got my lobster pasta, it was DELICIOUS. No explanation needed, it was just awesome. My bf got the steak and i think he liked it as well. I would recommend making a reservation though because they are usually very busy and will take a while to get you seated. I would definitely come back again when i'm feeling italian!"}
{"text":"Not only does this place have a slamming happy hour menu ($3.95 for specific apps and $5 drink specials) daily, there's also a $5 martini night on Wednesday at the bar...  I only love one thing more than good food and good drinks which is reasonably priced good food and drinks... lol  I've been to this location numerous times and the service is always top notch... My favorite dishes are the sausage and pepperoni flatbread (which is incredibly light and crisp, but still filling), the spinach artichoke dip (which comes with some absolutely awesome pita points and is also super tasty), the Brio Burger (which is pretty standard, but still delish) and the frittata al forno (which was my yummy brunch choice)...   The prices are not incredibly high during regular times, so that's good... The patio is really nice on warm days... The only thing is you should definitely go early or late for the happy hour because their bar fills up quickly!  Happy hour is from 4:00 pm until 7:00 pm and starts up again from 9:00 pm until closing..."}
{"text":"How dare I take this long to review this place.  We went here with a large group about a month ago and simply loved it.  The service, food, atmosphere was top notch.  The bruschetta was perfect and was the best starter for any meal.  I got the crab linguini and will probably never order anything else from now on.  Though, I heard the ravioli is superb and their best item.  I really love the surrounding area outside the restaurant as well.  There is a ton of other restaurants and scenic spots to wander around to.  This was such a fun and energetic spot.. Give it a shot.. Enjoy!  -Ian M."}
{"text":"The food--excellent. Especially the crab and shrimp crab-cakes. I have also tried a roasted lamb dish that was done perfectly. The interior--classy, but also provides a comfortable dining experience. Prices are reasonable $$-$$$.  Kudos to this particular location though. I actually went to Brio the last time I was in Atlanta, and while the food was good, service was very, very slow.   Not the case here. Service is great and food/drinks come out in a timely manner, even when it's busy. I have gone to a couple more expensive Tuscan/Mediterranean style restaurants downtown, only to find out, I prefer the food here. Excellent!"}
{"text":"Eaten lunch here multiple times, good not great. If you are in the area a nice place for lunch. I have not done dinner here so I do know."}
{"text":"The strangest thing about Brio is that it's setting it looks like a movie set, without any extras. A pristine street with a fountain, perfect brick streets but empty as all hell.   It was lunch, we were starving so we stumbled in. They seated us quickly, the ambiance was pleasant but not note worthy, we outside in our disturbingly quiet area and found it quite pleasant. Ladies who lunch, dripping with jewels and puffy clouds passing by, then it came down to the food.   Brio is a great place for lunch for people who have already eaten lunch because the portions are small.   I had crab and shrimp cakes that were miniature in size at best, with a side of veggies and potatoes drenched in olive oil.   As tasty as it all was, I would have needed to eat bread with two hands for an hour to fill me up.   In closing, nice and quiet during the week, good food, expensively priced but if I was in  in town again...I'd probably go back."}
{"text":"Somehow whenever my family can't make up their minds on where to eat we end up at Brio. At first it seems like a good idea. The menu is huge and everyone is sure to find something they like right? Well, I'd be happy if I don't come back. The portions are large but range from mediocre to just OK. The prices are fine but for the quality of food you're getting why settle? The service systematically starts out OK and then the server seems nowhere to be found when bread or water refills are needed."}
{"text":"The funny part about this place is that the food is not bad. But in my opinion the plating and taste are similar to what an average cook could produce. If you go here, temper expectations and that way you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"As much as I hate to give poor reviews, two stars is all I can do here. On an evening where my boyfriend and I were being indecisive and broke down and went to Brio, an Italian chain which we very rarely do, we regretted it in a fairly quick manner.   We walked into the restaurant and approached the hostess stand where there were two employees standing. Though they were nice, they stared at us like no one was sure what to do. Finally I had to say, \"just dinner for two\" to be their prompt of interaction with us. We were seated and then ordered the calamari appetizer. It was an extreme disappointment. It was all breading, we could barely taste any calamari. It was crunchy beyond belief, most likely because there was more breading than calamari and it had just became a ball of crumbs. I do like the pepperoncini idea mixed in with the calamari, but it also was overcooked and just not what it could have been. Very far from what it could have been actually.  We then quickly ordered our entrees because we were not feeling it. Not the food, not the staff, and definitely not the ambiance. I had the Pasta Alla Vodka and my boyfriend had the Crab Crusted Salmon. I have to say the Pasta Alla Vodka tasted as if someone opened a can of sauce from the grocery store, added far too much extra Italian seasoning to it and dumped it on top of the (small portion) of pasta. Therefore, unfortunately, resulting in gritty bites of pasta. I do not think the flavors they advertise on the menu came out in this dish at all causing a very subpar dining experience. My boyfriend completed his Crab Crusted Salmon though it was not on the top of his list of seafood experiences. I tasted the dish and my thought remains the same for his dish as mine, minimal flavor experience with the bonus of it being slightly dry fish.   We were not looking for five star dining here and we knowingly came into Brio aware of it being a chain. However with that being said, when you are spending $18-21 on a dish- regardless of where you are- the expectation of the food is to at least be somewhat enjoyable. No one likes feeling like bailing after the appetizer would have been a much better idea than spending $60+ (with no alcoholic beverages) on a meal that was questionable. We have eaten at many other establishments in many other cities, spent the same on the bill, and left happy and full.   Our very shy waitress then brought our check and we departed after signing for the bill with a pen that was covered in (what we hoped was) mashed potatoes. Consider this a lesson re-learned that chain Italian is just not such a great idea."}
{"text":"Loved this place when it was just called Brio. We were here this past week and ordered the salmon. It was the smallest piece of salmon I have ever seen served on a very big plate with some mashed potatoes and asparagus. It all tasted fine but nothing spectacular. The lobster bisque was good. The fork was so utterly gigantic I could not fit it into my mouth. All of their silverware is way too big. With their change in name they have many of the same dishes but for higher prices. The wait staff was very good and the atmosphere very nice. They just need to go out and buy some smaller Silverware and plates and maybe increase the portions a little."}
{"text":"Dinner at Brio on Thursday night. Has nice outdoor patio seatings! Calamari served as an appetizer. Spicy sauce and cilantro on the top. Breaded enough and crispy! For main dishes, we ordered shrimp and lobster tail risotto and balsamic chicken. The lobster tail was cooked perfectly and was so tender! Risotto was tasty. Balsamic grilled chicken was interesting. Goat cheese and balsamic sauce were a good match. A good amount of orzo and broccoli were served together. We enjoyed all of our food. The service was good as well."}
{"text":"Brio is one of our go to places, they have a very comfortable patio area.  I don't think I've ever eaten inside! This place always has music and the band playing Friday night was excellent--dance floor is way too small, but they do a great job where isn't too loud--you can try to dance if not too crowded, and you can have a conversation. The service is always excellent, and we always have a wonderful experience.  The wait staff is always friendly.   The 3 star rating, was for the food - not consistent, and this is a chain--I've been to a Brio in Orange County, CA.  The meal I had were the beef medallions with mash potatoes and asparagus.  The food was cooked well, but the flavors didn't seem the same.  The crumble they put on top of the medallions seemed tart.  My companion had the Lasagna Bolognese.  The lasagna is filled with the Bolognese but they cover the top with an Alfredo/cheese sauce.   She thought it tasted like processed cheese--she didn't finish her meal. This is probably the first time we've had food we weren't crazy about.  The wine was excellent, and they always have nice warm bread.  I almost forgot to add, we had the meatballs and polenta from the small plate menu--and I could make this a meal--the meatballs and sauce were delicious, and the polenta with a smoked Gouda,  creamy and a perfect match. Put this in a larger portion and make it an entre!!!"}
{"text":"Great bar bites and great happy hour specials, more energy was wanted from the wait staff, but over all we had a pretty good time! The Meatballs and polenta were great and the sauce on the shrimp Napoli was good but shrimp were bland. We didn't care for the nachos even though the chicken was good but those and the potato skins were our least favorites. Overall good experience and we will definitely give another try!"}
{"text":"I would say 3.5 but I'm rounding up!  I know I am late to the game on this one but I just made my way to Brio for the first time this past week!  We had our office holiday lunch at Brio and I was pretty impressed with just about everything I tried.  We had a few appetizers--Bruchetta, Spinach and Artichoke dip and the carpaccio served with a crispy flatbread.  Everything was very good.  I ordered the shrimp and crabcakes and they were pretty good.  There wasn't much filling so that was impressive.  They were served with veggies and potatoes.  My co-workers tried the eggplant parm (which was decent, not the best I have had) and a couple salads, paninis, etc.  The portions were pretty small but everything was definitely edible.  We tried a few of their \"dolchinos\" for dessert and the lava cake.  The lava cake was awesome and it was served with vanilla gelato.  The dolchinos were just okay.  The chocolate caramel was my favorite but the cheesecake just tasted like melted cream cheese and the lemon one was pukity.    All in all I enjoyed my time at Brio.  I liked the decor/atmosphere.  It was pretty cozy and cute.  It is a little pricey for what you get so I wouldn't make this a frequent stop and I wouldn't really categorize this as Italian food.  I think it is Italian inspired but it is basically an american grille/chain.  However, if in the southpark area it is worth checking out and I hear their brunch is awesome."}
{"text":"Being in the Southpark area, this is a great place to grab lunch!  Every day they have really good lunch specials and also have a lunch menu which gets you smaller portions of their dinner menu at a discounted price.  Still plenty of food as well!  One of my favorite items on the menu is the Wood Grilled Salmon Salad!  The fish is always cooked to perfection and the vegetables in the salad are so fresh!  I've also had their panini and the Lobster Bisque!  Can you say decadent?  It is so creamy and rich, you could have a bowl of bisque with a small side salad and it would fill you up!  Plus, you get a yummy basket of bread and crispy flat bread when you are seated and its yummy!"}
{"text":"You won't go wrong here, the food is good, service is good, and the people are nice. I really liked the bar. For Italian food I prefer Mangianos, but the flatbreads here keep me coming back. Try the bruschetta sampler"}
{"text":"Can't get past the highly unpleasant greeter/take out woman. Don't know her name but she has worked there a long time. She has a blonde bob haircut.   Haven't been there all summer and went in for a take out order and wow!!!  It is amazing how consistently unpleasant and unfriendly she is. Having an off day once in a while, understandable.  Seems she has a lot of bad days!  It's just so unnecessary. Get a job that doesn't involve the public. Simple."}
{"text":"NOTE: this review and rating are for the dinner main dining room experience.   For the life of me I don't understand why I keep getting really bad dinner service at this restaurant, which is unfortunate because the food and ambiance are both of decent quality.  This past Friday I went to meet up with my friends at Piedmont Row for the golf tournament after party. I suppose all the establishments were aware of the special event and thus the crowd.  After mingling and enjoying a cigar, we came over for a quick bite. The hostess was nice and prompt, but that's the end of the pleasant experience. I don't recall the waiter's name, likely because he never greeted us or introduced himself. Heck, I don't think he smiled once. I guess he was on his \"barely minimum effort\" mode.  He barely paid attention. He barely took our order and brought our food.  I had to wait until my soup was cold to get bread to soak it with. The kicker was when the only guy at our table of 4 said to him \"put the appetizer on my bill,\" he came back with the appetizer split among all of us, then looked at us like we caused this, and half heartedly offered to redo the check by his manager (as in he had no intention of redoing it). Our guy friend felt awful, and we were all pissed.  Oh, the food was good, the soup is always delicious, and the mushroom ravioli could have more sauce. But the service was so bad we couldn't really enjoy the food.   MANAGEMENT: if you are reading this, please be selective with who you hired. This is my 2nd time stuck with the most uncaring server (ironically the same booth, 2nd to the last row, 1st booth near window). If they don't want their job or tip, I am sure someone else would.   To end on a better note, they have a great happy hour menu, which restarts after 9pm. And their bar service is normally consistently decent"}
{"text":"Had great carpaccio and fonduta, although the service was pretty slow.  Bartender was very nice and because we were ;eft waiting so long, she bought a round of drinks.  Definitely will go back.  Great happy hour specials."}
{"text":"Food was poorly prepped and ingredients on my plate were not listed on the menu and service was tremendously horrible for such a fine dining restaurant. This was the worst experience that I've had at this restaurant i'll take my my business elsewhere. Our food was lacking flavor and our beverages were under filled on the table as the waitress was chatting at the host booth. Our food was overcooked and I order the Tiramisu for dessert which was soggy and poorly cut. Poor service and food quality overall."}
{"text":"I brought 10 people for a work dinner here a few weeks ago. I found the food to be good, and the actually thought the carpaccio was some of the best in town.   The problem, and it was a big problem, was the service was terrible. I know large parties can slow it down but my food was placed in front of three other people at my table and one of our guest didn't even get his entree. Of course parties of 10 still get charged the 18%, which I don't mind paying if everyone gets served their food at the same time."}
{"text":"I'm surprised seeing the bad reviews for this place; I thought it was actually pretty good. We had a big party there (25 people) and I thought considering that it was a Sat night and the place was packed, the service was pretty good. At least our waitress was very quick and efficient; that's all I can say. The food is good, but maybe not all of it. The calamari appetizer wasn't good; they were kinda chewy. But the antipasti bruschetta was very good!   For main course I had the artichoke crusted medallions, which though were cooked slightly more than I wanted were still real tender and good. Their deserts are yummy! They all look good, and I tasted a few and they tasted great as well. I liked the atmosphere too; it's elegant and relaxing. Overall a good experience and I would probably go back again."}
{"text":"I love coming here for happy hour!  It goes until 7pm on weeknights (not 6pm like most places).  They have $5 drinks (wines, martinis, mojitos and sangrias) and $3.95 appetizers (beef carpaccio, shrimp cocktail, spicy crispy shrimp, marghuerita flatbread, sausage and pepperoni flatbread, shrimp and eggplant, spinach artichoke dip and more!). I think these prices and options make it one of the better happy hours in town!  Unfortunately, the last few times I have been here, the service has been sub par. One time, they forgot one of the appetizers I ordered and took forever to receive the bill. The last two times, they messed up the bill when we split the checks. Hopefully, the service can improve because the food and happy hour specials are great!"}
{"text":"This is the second year I have used Brio to host a corporate event and experience was wonderful as always! I especially loved the new private dining area in the back. It was a great place for everyone to mingle before sitting down to an amazing meal. Robert and his team made the process of hosting very easy which is important with a busy schedule. It was a relief not having to worry about the details because I knew they had everything covered. I would recommend Brio to anyone planning an event and look forward to hosting many more there in the future!"}
{"text":"3.5 ***/* I had a business dinner here with 3 others this week. The service was a little rough.   We ordered salads, pasta and chicken entrees. We all were impressed with our selections. The salads were perfect. The house wine was very good, I did not get the name.  Good price/value but the service could have been better."}
{"text":"All I can remember about this place was the amazing raspberry ricotta cheesecake I shared with my sister.  And for that I will give it 3 stars.  Food was ok.  Nothing out of this world.  Service was good and restaurant is nice in appearance."}
{"text":"I came here not by choice and being from out of town, it was average. It was very \"cheesecake factory\" to me so I knew that I had to be careful about what I ordered. The menu screamed millions of calories and massive amounts of sodium. I did partake in the bread basket and that was well worth it. I tried the Lobster Bisque and the problem I had with this dish is that it had chunks of shrimp instead of lobster, how odd! I paired that with a house salad and took bites from my neighbors plate, sweet potato risotto. The coffee was okay, but it lacked that umph.   I wouldn't go back here for the food, but the service was very friendly and stayed on top of our rather large party. Thumbs up on service!"}
{"text":"Not impressed with service at happy Hour. We ordered wine off the wine list rather than happy hour as that appeared to be box so spending $10 a glass and ordering appetizers and ignored. What a turnoff. So that was reflected in tip sadly."}
{"text":"First time here in many years.they have updated the interior and seem to be moving to more of a coastal Italian theme. They were busy but we sat within a couple minutes.  Our service was slow and the server seemed overwhelmed.  The menu is very thin on vegan options and prices quite high  for what you get. I tried the chopped Brussel sprout and farro salad without the cheese and dressing on the side. The size of the salad is half what It should be for $11.50. I would not recommend thus restaurant."}
{"text":"Decided to end my birthday night at BRIO and what an amazing dining experience it was. We had a rather big crowd and got there around 9:30pm; even though they closed at 11pm the service was spot on and very accommodating.  We had everything from the crab and shrimp cakes, grilled salmon fresca, shrimp and eggplant app, lobster bisque, ravioli, lasagna, grilled mahi mahi, sweet potato risotto, and calamari and there was not ONE unsatisfied person. Everything was delicious including the drinks! We were way to full for dessert but this birthday girl was HAPPY!"}
{"text":"food was alright, there was a hair in the oil that they bring out with the bread and besides getting us a new thing of oil, nothing else was done about it. Kind of gross and dissuaded is from eating. Nothing special"}
{"text":"This has always been our go-to place. Normally the experience is very good, very diligent waitstaff and the manager always stops by to check on things.  So when I needed to host a dinner, I picked this place.  It was mid week, the place was totally empty, and we had the worst service ever.  While The server was very nice, she did not clear any dishes, even when she brought more bread she just stacked the old dishes on top of the new ones and left them, we had asked multiple times to clear dishes, by the end of the evening we still had appetizer dishes on the table, the table was a complete mess, and even when dessert was brought nothing was cleared away.  There was no offer of coffee or desserts. Usually they bring the tray around and entice you with something.  It was truly a disappointing experience.   Especially with the large party, we never saw any management checking on things.  Probably the worst evening at this restaurant I've had.  I don't want to write it off, as it is very convenient. But, I definitely will not be seated with this waitress. It put a big damper on my event. She definitely needs more training."}
{"text":"Quality of food and service was very disappointing. Salmon was thin and overcooked; flounder special was ok at best. Waiter started with an attitude and only became slightly more engaging before he brought the check."}
{"text":"I went here for my birthday recently for lunch. Their presentation of dishes is superb. I got the lamb and it was delicious. The atmosphere is awesome as well-great hosts. I would definitely come again to this establishment"}
{"text":"This place is a chain and the only good thing about this location, is that it has a beautiful interior and is around Legacy Village. I had the Chipotle Chicken & Bacon Panini and it wasn't bad, but I think that for the price of everything, this place was just very average.   The service wasn't exceptional either and I think that it is just another Cheesecake Factory look alike. If you are going to Legacy Village, I would go somewhere else in the area,"}
