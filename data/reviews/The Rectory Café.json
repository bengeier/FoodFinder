{"text":"I've only ever been here for drinks and appetizers on the patio, and i've got to say, you would be hard pressed to find a more beautiful and relaxing location on a nice summer day.  Service has always been very friendly, and the appetizers that i've had have been good."}
{"text":"The only cafe open on the Islands in November - there was a line for lunch.

Cosy atmosphere and could imagine relaxing weekends out on the patio in the summer.

Shame the service and food were decidedly average.
Waitresses were running around like headless chooks - their stress apparent with somewhat sharp comments to the customers. 

Calamari tender but the spice rub slightly burnt - also the dish was brought out luke warm.
Burgers - not much flavour but at least not too dry.

Coffee was awful - burnt and bitter. Even the banana chocolate torte couldn't mask the taste.

The ginger ale was good - but it came in a bottle! Apparently you can buy this from 7-eleven now.

Don't bother, bring a picnic."}
{"text":"I visited the Toronto islands with a group of friends and had lunch in the restaurant after a long walk.   We called ahead halfway there to ask for a table in the shade and when we arrived, the table for nine was all set up. We were thankful for the shady patio on a hot day.  

The server, Jessica, was cheerful and responsive, making our visit a real pleasure.
She anticipated some of our requests for hot water with lemon and had these ready before we even asked.  We shared sandwiches and she anticipated our need for extra plates. 

We had calamari and the pulled pork sandwich.  Both were very good.  The pecan tart (almost big enough for four) was the best I'd tasted in a long time - not too sweet with lots of pecan.  Overall, quality was very good but the service made it exceptional.  I'd make it a destination next time I visit the islands."}
{"text":"I have eaten here several times the location is wonderful but the quality of the food has become very disappointing.  Today we had the brisket burger for lunch. We told the waiter that it was burnt and dry. The waiter said he would tell the kitchen. We received  no feedback. Come here for a drink but eat elswhere."}
{"text":"Went here last weekend.  The menu is new and fresh.  The food was amazing.  Great vegetarian options and one of the best patios in TO.  Make it a destination."}
{"text":"We went to the island with my family when we were visiting the Islands. What a quaint little place. Hubby had been a little concerned when he looked at the menu on the Internet but got there and ordered the Blueberry Chicken. He was delighted with his choice. I was able to snag a bite and it was delicious. I ordered the chicken club and had them put it on a bagel (I don't like wheat bread) and it was excellent. Everyone seemed to be very pleased with their choices. 

We sat outside on the patio and had a great time. If we are ever visiting the islands again we would definitely go again."}
{"text":"Was starving when I got to Toronto Island so I chose to forgo The Island Cafe that's right by where the ferry drops you off since it seemed pretty busy and I've always been curious about The Rectory Cafe. We were seated promptly and given menus however we sat there for at least 30 minutes watching patrons who arrived later than us getting served and getting their food before our orders were even taken. My boyfriend and I were starting to get impatient and were trying to think of polite ways to wave somebody down. The staff made eye contact with him but did not approach us. Finally someone walked past us and we advised them we were ready to order. The hostess seemed annoyed and said our server will be with us shortly. Minutes go by, nobody. A server helping some customers that came after us noticed we seemed ready, smiled at us and said someone will be right with us. Again, minutes later and still nobody. My boyfriend remarked that there were several staff members hovering over one particular lady at her table. Then I overheard the same hostess that sat us down earlier tell some people that were walking in that the kitchen was closed. So was I just going to wait almost an hour just only to be told that I can't have the food that I came to the restaurant for? Some of the worst, most disorganized and careless service I've ever received. Frustrated, my boyfriend and I walked out and headed to The Island Cafe. Boy were we glad we went there! It was a cute little place, very warm relaxed atmosphere - we were sat, served and fed all within 15 minutes! They even had vegan options, much to my delight. 

In a way, I'm glad I had this experience here. The food seemed overpriced and judging by a lot of reviews, it is definitely not worth the high price tag. Also, we got to experience the loveliness of The Island Cafe! It's sad to see that this restaurant doesn't care to lose thousands of dollars (based on what has been said here on Yelp). I don't understand why, but that seems to be the way they want to operate. Oh well, I'm never going back so hopefully I'll never have to relive that awful afternoon."}
{"text":"The service was great today. The setting is so beautiful .
We had drinks and a yummy chocolate cake.
Prices are pretty good considering the island location and the fact everything has to transported.
Will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Loved the Rectory. While my brother played frisbee golf and my husband wandered around the island, all in the rain, I set down to a beautiful view, my laptop (free wi-fi) and 2 pots of green tea. Later, we tried an egg white omelette, cooked perfectly.

The interior is cozy, with lots of cushions and large tables, and the staff is friendly...I wiled away a couple of hours in a warm atmosphere out of the rain before we headed back on the ferry. I bet this place is buzzing during the summertime months!"}
{"text":"I have gone to the Rectory Café about three times this year. The food is decent. The location is great. But the service is horrible. There are many people working there in the summer - lots of very young people with clearly no experience - but most just stand around. We were just there on October 10 - our waitress was Danielle - she has very poor customer service skills. And doesn't understand waitressing. She brought our a pot of tea with her hands. Instead of putting it on a tray and bringing other things out. We waited for a long time and she just said blandly while I was paying \"i apologize for the delay\" - there was zero sincerity. Several patrons walked out before ordering out of frustration. I don't understand why more reviews don't address the poor service. Three times we've been there and three times it's been very poor."}
{"text":"The service was phenomenal and friendly. Nice healthy cafe food. It's the only restaurant open during the winter months on Ward's island so I'm glad it was good! We had the teriyaki quinoa bowl and the tofu scramble hash. Both were good. The portions are on the smallish side for the price but it was satisfying on a cold day in Toronto."}
{"text":"Ducked in to this charming spot to get out of the rain.  Had a wonderful homemade Poblano soup. Service was relaxed and friendly. Such a lovely setting. Thought it would feel really \"touristy\" but it didn't."}
{"text":"What a lovely island experience! The Rectory cafe is a lovely contribution to the authenticity, beauty, and relaxing environment that is already inevitable on the island. They have a large shady patio with a great vibe and the food is amazing!

I ordered the buffalo mozzarella salad with chicken- the presentation was beautiful and the taste even better. The service was also very lovely and speedy!"}
{"text":"BEAUTIFUL location, don't get me wrong - ate here a few years ago and I remember liking it. The service was great but the food was a DISASTER, the tomato soup I ordered ($7 dollars) was watery and clearly out of a can (campbell's?), and the hummus and toast had stale toast! my boyfriend liked his burger though, though he thought it needed fries. Ambiance was fantastic , but i'd go back for a glass of wine not a meal!"}
{"text":"You can't beat the location or ambience.  The large patio, surrounded by trees and overlooking the lake, is perfect. 

The rest was a bit disappointing. Service was okay but made us feel like a bit of an inconvenience.  The food is fine, but nothing to write home (or Yelp) about.  Prices are higher than the food deserves.  

I was particularly disappointed with my $20 chickpea green chili dish, which came out as a tiny portion of chili on the side of an enormous pile of white rice.  It's a chickpea and lentil dish, it costs you almost nothing, and you're charging high-end prices, so why are you skimping on the portions? 

The patio is nice enough that I might come back for drinks or coffee, but I wouldn't return for a meal."}
{"text":"Beautiful place on the Toronto Island. Food is tasty. Everything we ordered was good and came quickly."}
{"text":"OK this is the spot when you are visiting the Island. Don't bother with all the other places, choose a time (Mid afternoon) on a warm day. Sit out the back on the patio, enjoy a selection of wine or beer. Then hit the menu. Such a great setting, great food and really is the gem on the island."}
{"text":"I have been here several times, but this is my first review.  First off, the best patio I have been to in the GTA.  The menu seems to change each year,  but the food seems consistently good.  Highly recommended if visiting the islands."}
{"text":"WOW...what a find!  If you are looking for an oasis to take a break from the urban Toronto experience...check this out!  A short ferry ride from the terminal in downtown Toronto leads you to this quiet, relaxing island experience.  We had heard that this was the best patio dining in the area and they were right!  We spent a beautiful, relaxing evening sitting out in backyard cozily set amongst trees and flowers on the back shore of lake.  The food was exquisite and the service friendly and superb.  Excellent location for a laid back feast.  Atmosphere can be casual to dress casual.  It was one of the highlights of our trip to Toronto!"}
{"text":"Horrible service, we left without our lunch because it came cold and when it was returned to us the server made some cheeky 'reheated, yummy sandwich over here?'

GTFO"}
{"text":"As the first restaurant I ate at in Toronto, I am so impressed! Even though I did somewhat forget the name of my meal, it was penne with a spicy pomodoro sauce with grilled chorizo. It was surely delicious and enjoyable, maybe a tad too spicy, but it was delicious! The service was great, and the outdoor patio is so nice and enjoyable. Definitely go on a cool and perfect day to enjoy eating outside, it is surely beautiful!"}
{"text":"This is one of the most enjoyable meals I've ever had. Everything was incredibly fresh, the staff was friendly and welcoming, and the atmosphere was perfect. We ate outside with a beautiful view of the lake. My wife has celiac, and the staff was knowledgeable about what she could have. Plenty of options. Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Was there this past Saturday.  Service slow, food mediocre.
Bus girl set the table for us and handled the forks by the tines and the knife by the blade as she set the cutlery on the table. Yuck!!!!
Made a polite comment to the manager about this when we left,in hopes that the bus girl would learn from this and our comment was completely disregarded to the point that the manager was rude.
Feed back about basic sanitary issues being ignored by the manager is a real concern.
Wonder what goes on behind in the kitchen!!!!"}
{"text":"Please Please stay away from this restaurant.. I only ever put up reviews if I am extremely happy or very dissatisfied and in this case I was horrified. I've only ever had one other bad dining experience since living in Toronto but this place really takes the biscuit.

First of all I went here with my family whom were visiting from Ireland and decided to take them to Toronto island, ward island in particular. We walked around quite a bit and decided to go for a nice lunch and we seen the Rectory Cafe.

Its has a really nice patio but that's about it. There was a fuss from the very beginning because there were 9 of us. They discussed in front of us what they were going to do with us like it was a major issue.

We were seated by the rudest server I have ever met in my life. He was extremely short and impatient. Firstly my partner asked for a different bun with his burger as he doesn't like pretzel buns and wanted a basic bun but was told that if he changes one thing he would have to change it for others and it would be a major inconvenience to the kitchen... this place wasn't even half full and i am sure changing a bun isn't a big deal. I then asked for a gluten free bun and was told simply no in a short answer and left kinda sitting there... He was extremely smug.. then he continued down the table with short outbursts of rudeness until the final order came FROM my partners father....The waiter said if he was not ready to order he had other things to do and he was busy... Now when i say my partners father took literally 10 seconds to pick what he wanted that's all he took... Everyone look at him and were horrified by his rudeness... I turned to him and asked him was he being serious and told him he was extremely rude and we came to enjoy a nice lunch and he basically ruined it. He then asked if I would like another server and I replied yes...This man was also the manager and even what I have described above doesn't even describe or cover the rudeness I experienced. The next server was pretty nice and she even smiled.... but brought our drinks orders at the end of the meal but she took them from our bill which was appreciated.

Then I went to use their restroom... It was disgusting.. bins overflowing with dirty hand towels.. Dirty toilets and the flusher was also broken.. It just seemed very unclean.. As people generally say judge the cleanliness of a restaurant and kitchen on the cleanliness of their restroom and this restroom said it all.

Never go here they don't deserve the buissiness"}
{"text":"The food was fantastic. Everything cooked to the right level, greens crisp, steak rare and juicy. Wine choices orchestrated by my server perfect. Only issue orchestration.

Not far off, but the incredible calamari only got joined by the wine as an afterthought.. My server warned me about a kitchen overloaded.

It wasn't bad at any level. It is a place that promises and even delivers in a disconnected way on that promise.

This is a quibble. If you're coming here do not hesitate. There are nits to be picked, and this seems to me to be a place that pays attention.

And my server was straightforward and honest about what was going on. She helped me with my menu choices. Perfect. She picked thé wine. Perfect.

Only plaint was the orchestration.. Not horrible but a minute sideways from a great experience.

Well worth coming here. I will come back."}
{"text":"Perfect spot for a relaxing dinner and walk.  Came here with partner and dog.  Dog friendly patio made this the perfect choice.  The special appetizer were shrimp tacos which were so good we ended up ordering another.  Service is a bit slow but it had an island feel which for us was perfect.  When our waiter was there, he was charming and great to talk with around food choices and recommendations on the island.  Wine selection more limited but some good choices.  Not cheap but reasonable for what you get and the environment.  Perfect beginning to a quiet evening walk in the island park."}
{"text":"I've been to the cafe once this past summer and was pleasantly surprised by the quality and type of food they were offering on their menu.  

It's not fine dining but it's the best the island has to offer away from the them-park type of food the main attractions bring in. The rectory Cafe is tucked away in the residential area of the islands where a quiet cottage feel takes over once you head eastward from Centre Island.  The patio is a lovely space with comfortable seating and views of the lake.  

The menu offers anything from light bites like salads apps and sandwiches to brunch omlettes and hash to savoury dinner curries, steaks, pasta etc.

We shared the octopus appetizer which was delicious and tender with a perfect char on it.  The jicama salad it came with was very refreshing. We also shared a chicken sandwich which was fresh and flavourful.  

The prices are a touch steep for a cafe but still the quality is there and if you're willing to spend a nice afternoon on the island in the summer I would recommend you do it at the Rectory Cafe."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this quaint restaurant while exploring Ward Island. What a treat! This place was such a welcome surprise on a chilly rainy day. I can't wait to return!

The interior was cozy, well decorated, and somewhat upscale. We were quickly seated and waited on promptly. I ordered the crab cakes and warm goat cheese salad. Both were warm, delicious and nicely displayed. Though the lunch menu selection is not large, nearly everything on the menu looked pretty appetizing. And yes, it's pricey, but probably worth the splurge while on the island. It may also be the only restaurant on the island. 

After biking around the island for a bit, we returned and ordered coffee and dessert. I had the flourless chocolate torte and my friend had the cheesecake. Both were amazing and we would have happily ordered more. While I haven't had the pleasure of eating dinner here, I hope someday to return to do so. Definitely worth a visit if you are visiting Toronto!"}
{"text":"The Rectory is a quaint little cafe on Center Island. Apparently this will be it's last year of operations but they have really good wine pairing dinners for a set price (typically between $50 - $100). It's always full of locals and has a beautiful view of the city without the hustle and bustle."}
{"text":"Lived in Toronto my entire life, been to the island so many times and never knew this place existed. 

An amazing patio with and awesome view of the lake and Leslie Street Spit. 

Very nice menu with a good selection of food and an interesting drink menu. 

I had the arugula salad with feta , tomato and sprouts. Was a very good salad. 

Others in our group had the tandoori chicken sandwich and the pulled pork sandwich, all thoroughly enjoyed. 

I would definitely  come back and would make a special trip just to eat here 

Tell everyone about this hidden gem."}
{"text":"Amazing location, gorgeous. Delicious food. 
Flip side - overpriced and service is sloppy, indifferent and bordering on rude."}
{"text":"I love Toronto island, especially if you arrive early enough, so that you can enjoy it without crowds. Almost every time we visit the island we have lunch at the Rectory cafe, it's a lovely place with outdoor patio surrounded by tall trees. The place is quite popular, on summer weekends you have to get there early to avoid lines, best time is shortly after noon. The service may be a bit slow, but it's always very friendly. They have great beer selection and comprehensive menu. We tried different places and Rectory has the best food on the island, though it's a bit on a pricey side. Last week we came there with friends who had a dog, we were surprised to learn that they even have special tables where they allow dogs!"}
{"text":"The calamari is served with a drizzle of garlic yogurt, the lamb burger is to die for. Add the location and this is a true 10 restaurant. Stop by if you are ever on the Island"}
{"text":"I'm willing to admit that I didn't have high expectations going in, because the Rectory Cafe doesn't have much competition out there on the islands. If you don't want to eat dripping fast food while top 40 blares in the background, then it's the RC. But I was surprised. On two counts.

1) the chef has put together a limited but agreeable menu that has something for everyone, and the kitchen cares enough to present this food in its best and most appetizing arrangements. I would describe the food as unexciting, but pleasing.

But then again, maybe I would have enjoyed it more if my dining hadn't been spoiled by...

2) the worst service I have ever encountered. Our server resentfully greeted us from behind mirrored sunglasses and was annoyed by a question about the brisket burger (\"look, do you know what brisket is? - sigh - It's just your basic hamburger\"),. She then took our order and sent someone else out to deliver food we hadn't ordered. She told us, on her way past the table, that she had punched in the wrong meals and we would need to wait. No apology. Twenty minutes later when my friend asked if we could have some bread, she said \"it's only a few more minutes,\" again, without stopping and without apology. Another ten minutes passes. Note here that others are getting what we ordered, so I assume she didn't care to tell the kitchen we were waiting for an order she screwed up. Finally she brings out the meal with a \"here it is\" and walks away. And proceeds to avoid being near our table until we are finished. 

Mistakes happen. I dined out a few weeks ago at a place where the server forgot to bring us things and made an error in the order. He came over to tell us of his error and apologize. The moment we met our server at the RC, I commented to my friend that she seemed quite terse for someone working in a tourist location. I didn't guess it was going to go from terse to hostile. Maybe she's been banished to that island as some kind of sentence.

The other servers seemed better. They at least got food to the table and made eye contact. I have no doubt that other diners enjoyed their meals far more."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of this restaurant. I've eaten here three times (one lunch and two dinners). 

The only reason it gets two stars is because of the location, the lovely outdoor patio and the lack of other options.

Why such a poor review?

SERVICE: All three times the service has been horrible - once with a large group and the other two times in groups of 4 people. In the large group TWO orders were completely forgotten - one of them was mine. I ended up getting my dinner 20 minutes after everyone else. My other forgotten comrade waited another few minutes. The other times (in the small groups) it has been slow. Slow to take our order, excruciatingly slow to bring drinks and really difficult to find your waiter again. 

FOOD: I've ordered three different things from the menu and while each time the appetizers ROCKED the main courses were awful. I had risotto which was crunchy and pasta which was bland. Totally disappointing.

PRICE: The food is simply too expensive for what you get - the helpings are actually fair sized for a restaurant of this type but the quality of food is disgusting. I could barely eat the risotto when I ate it but seeing as hour I was starving by that point I sucked it up and ate it anyways.

A special note: DO NOT GO HERE WITH A LARGE GROUP. We went here with a large group, they told us they could accommodate a group of 16 on the patio with a single table. When we got there, they told us we had to eat at two separate tables. Now before you assume the worst about our group, we are a corporate group who dines together often and we immediately sat down and ordered four bottles of mid-priced wine and then most of us ordered cocktails. We are NOT the type of group who only orders water and asks for separate bills. If they can't handle a large group, they should be up front about it. 

On the upside, I had dessert each time and that has always been delicious."}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times and have always had a good experience. They offer both gluten free and lactose free options, which makes it easy for me to order off of the menu. Both times I was here I had their chickpea curry and it was fantastic!  On my second trip they even had a gluten free cracker I could eat with the dish. The curry dish was really filling and I highly recommend it.  My friends also enjoyed the dishes they purchased. 

This restaurant is also pet friendly. If you bring a furry friend, you can tie him or her on the outside of the fence and they will seat you next to him/her. It's not the best seat in the restaurant but it works :). They'll also bring out a water bowl for your pet. 

I have enjoyed all of my excursions to this cafe so I give it 5-Stars!"}
{"text":"I've walked by this place many times, and finally decided to try it today. The location is excellent in a nice little garden, with a bit of shade and no mosquitoes.

The menu is small with about 6 sandwiches and 4 mains. I choose the pulled pork which was served with a salad. The sandwich was great and the bread was very fresh. Everyone in my group was equally satisfied with their food.

The service however was OK. The waiter took our order. Came back 5 minutes later to confirm it, and then brought my friend the wrong beer. Our food arrived as ordered though. The service was also prompt."}
{"text":"Taking a walk along the lake shore and stumbled on this place.  Extremely nice wooded and shaded patio.  Wasn't hungry but helped myself to a dark and stormy, decent cocktail I had not seen before.  Recommend it for a nice way to break up the long walk along the island."}
{"text":"Great natural outdoor atmosphere just for cocktails. The food is terrible and expensive. Don't eat here."}
{"text":"This place is very cute. I like that it's open all year round because there's nearly nothing open on the island after summer. The place is a wee bit overpriced but considering it's one of two restaurants on the island and the only one open off-season, it's not so bad. 
The food is good, too. 
The service was quick, coffee came with a refill, the waiter was very pleasant and talkative. There is a great view of the lake and I didn't eat the desert but the options looked delicious. 

Definitely worth going if on the island."}
{"text":"A few friends and I finally made it down with our bicycles to spend the day touring the islands on wheels, with the highlight supposed to be an apres at the Rectory Cafe. While we passed it both around the front and the back during the ride, we saw many empty tables and looked forward to a leisurely late lunch/early dinner when we were done.

Wrong! We locked up our bikes and went in. There was no line-up, and I didn't even register that we were being turned away - there would be about an hour wait, they weren't serving in the dining room inside, and other people would be arriving for their reservations. Reservations? The entire indoor dining room empty and off limits, and dozens of tables outside sitting fallow. The few tables that were being used for service were indeed occupied, but sucks to be you if you don't book a serviced table in advance.

This is the precious cafe that threatened they would have to close during the beginning of the soggy season because people weren't still coming to the islands, even though they were open during the spring flood? They wanted a handout from the city because they're not busy enough when it suits them? This was the first long weekend since the flooding that the islands were fully open, with beautiful weather and an opportunity to make up for the dire lack of business. But, they still prefer to turn people away because they can't be bothered to service all their tables and the customers should know better, you should have booked earlier and said you'd come back.

I'd rather go to establishments where the customers are the reason they're in business, not the other way around. Keep your snot. Won't bother grovelling for another opportunity to come back."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place because it so quaint and nice and the location is incredible. I had lunch here this past Saturday and I was pretty underwhelmed by the food and service. I loved the cosy atmosphere and the view but I would have been much happier if I'd packed a picnic instead (although I was taking my parents out for their birthdays and they're not quite the picnic'ing type). I regret spending as much money here as I did, for the quality of the food and the overall experience. 

We had a reservation, and unfortunately the waiter sat the three of us at a little tiny bistro table next to a table set for a large group. It felt a little unfortunate. We were cramped and we had to deal with our group of neighbours turning out to be an excitable group of ladies hosting an engagement party. Worst luck.

[As a side note, I felt like it was pretty inconsiderate for this group of 20 or so ladies to have booked their event at this cafe because its a pretty little patio and people mostly come for the island atmosphere and the view of the lake. They showed up and quite loudly took all  the cutlery and glasses off the table and decorated it and they were noisy talkers, with organized group sharing activities and speeches. Get a room. A private party room. Or go somewhere that caters more to parties. This is also an oversight of the restaurant, who should limit the size of the groups they book if they want to promote a charming, relaxing environment.]

The servers seemed a bit over-extended by the large party, and were a bit breezy and frazzled. With only about eight choices in total on the menu, we ordered a hummous plate as a starter to share and then ordered the grilled chicken panini, grilled calamari, and the pulled pork panini for lunch.

The hummous plate cost $10 and was a very small portion of under-seasoned hummous with 'sun blushed tomato' sundried tomato oil drizzled on top and two different kinds of olives, which were nice but generic. The dish is over-priced and the hummous was slightly-too-sour tasting like old lemons were used. This dish seems like an easy money-maker and break for the kitchen. Hm...

I ordered the chicken panini, which is actually a whole, butterflied grilled chicken breast on a grilled ciabatta. At first I was really pleased that there was so much chicken, i love thick juicy sandwiches. But the chicken was dry, so dry, and there was a hellova lot of bread. And I really dislike it when restaurants try to appeal to trendy/yuppie ideas of 'classy food' by calling their sandwiches paninis - seeing that on the menu should've been a warning to me but I was blindly enthusiastic and optimistic. I quickly became apathetic about finishing or even eating my meal. Then the wilted salad on my plate made me a bit sad- such a careless oversight for a $14 lunch!

My mom loved the pulled pork panini, and I had a bite and thought it was really nice but there was something kindof grotesque about the mound of sloppy pork, charred bread, and wilted salad combo. 

Perhaps the only thing worth ordering was the calamari, which had a 14 spice blend rub on it. It was succulent and delicious. Pass on the soggy side of greens, though. 

Pass on this restaurant. The food is very mediocre, the atmosphere isn't THAT great, and it's quite over-priced. Bring a picnic instead!"}
{"text":"Unless I was on a date, I would give this place a pass especially because the other cafe \"Island Cafe\" has similar menu, and similar prices, but is a better dining experience.

The good news, great location, great view, some of the food is very nice if not great,  'Bring your own Wine' option. 

Molè Chicken Sandwich $14, the soup du jour, great

Deserts pricey all $9. http://therectorycafe.com/menus/desserts.html

I saw them but did not do it for me, might for you


Service was horrible especially compared to \"Island Cafe\"

waitress, took a long time to deliver food, but the setting, makes up, asked for sugar, never came, went inside to  it myself.

Also by diner partner, wanted to share the Molè Chicken Sandwich $14, the soup du jour, and the Mediterranean Salad $11  (Chickpeas, Israeli couscous, onion, cucumber, feta cheese, greens, oregano thyme vinaigrette)

Only problem was the Mediterranean Salad , had some blue cheese in it, waitress corrected me, (it has feta, well, I eat a lot of cheese, and if tastes like blue cheese, because perhaps the previous salad made by line cook was the \"Tomato Blue Cheese Salad \" and he did not wash out the bowl.

I complained about it and it was still on the bill, No \"sorry\", no honestly., they clean up all the plates and left my uneaten salad on the table.

A classy restaurant, with better trained wait staff would take more pride and ask or offer a remedy, as opposed to leaving a bad taste in my mouth, that lingered far too long 

Took so long to get the coffee, I thought perhaps they had to take ferry to buy more milk?

enjoyed my great cafe lait, but 20 minutes later still no bill.

They cater special groups so check their website http://therectorycafe.com/  to ensure they are not hosting a wedding"}
{"text":"What a wonderful place to eat when on the Islands! Shared a few small plates and beers with my comrades.

Grilled squid - yes, yes, YES! If you've never ventured outside of the typical fried version, I urge you to try it grilled. Rectory Café did not disappoint - nice char and cut concertina-style so the smoke penetrates the inside of the squid's body. YUM.

A fantastic soup of the day (veggies and garbanzos!) was my meal and we also split a cheese dip with olives and pita - I felt so Mediterranean!

Sadly, I did not go for any of the awesome-sounding sandwiches or main dishes (was holding out for dinner plans which would begin not too long after this meal); I surely will leave room for those items next time.

Can't be beat - highly recommended."}
{"text":"Yesterday's visit to The Rectory Café ushered in my tenth year of love for this treasure. The ferry ride alone makes for a special summer day but that's just the beginning. Take your time. Sip a cold draft or a glass of wine, order a starter. If you're alone it's okay to read but remember where you are - under tall trees with Lake Ontario in your front yard. My main yesterday was a pulled pork taco from the specials menu. Spicy,saucy and warm with chilled rails of jicama atop a slender soft taco, times three! Just go."}
{"text":"Everything that is wrong with restaurants is wrong with this one. 

Yesterday, the first nice day of spring, the owner closes the place at 5PM and has customers LINED OUT THE DOOR. Unbelievable - it was thousands of dollars turned away. 

The food is overpriced, the wait staff is beyond horrid. Not even worth getting drinks there for the contempt the owners show their customers."}
{"text":"What a great find! I was tipped off by one of the locals I met at a Blue Jays game. The food, location, and service cannot be beat anywhere on the island, and was the highlight of my trip to Toronto. I recommend renting a bike when you get to Ward's or Centre Island and riding over to The Rectory. Sit on the back patio and enjoy the woods and view of Lake Ontario."}
{"text":"This café is situated on City Centre Island, so you eat while being surrounded by Nature, which is lovely! It feels secluded and very relaxing.

I tried the sandwiches here, which had deliciously tender and flavourful meat. It did not stand out though. However, offerings on their menu were pretty standard, and I hope they can branch out and try more innovative items. 

Go here for the experience, and order a drink for yourself. It's a great way to relax from exploring the island!"}
{"text":"What a quaint little cafe tucked at the corner of Ward's Island!

5-stars for the ambience: patio, location, and sun; 4-stars for food quality; 3-stars for price/value.

Grilled Calamari - perfectly grilled, slight char, not too raw, not tough. The spice rub was tasty yet not overpowering as it added the slight saltiness, just enough to balance off the lemon (squeezed) and tenderness of the squid. This appy ($7, for one) came with some side salad - a portion enough as snack item (sorta like a 2-bite brownie), and not enough to be a lunch meal.

Note: The for 2 portion cost $13 and extra baby green salad is $9... Only if they could set up a lunch-portion combo (more calamari, more salad) of some sort that cost no more than $18 this would've definitely upped the price/value rating!

The Callebut semi-sweet brownie was fantastic. The brownie came in two triangles, whipped cream and few pieces of berries. For $7 the dessert was great value! The brownie was warm that reminded me if a molten lava cake, melt in your mouth sweetness. Definitely a must-have with tea or coffee."}
{"text":"Yesterday was an unusually warm Sunday for February so we went for a trek on center island. After a few hours we stepped into Rectory to warn up and grab something warm to drink. 

We ordered hot chocolate and hot water, with the waiter giving us a surprised look at the latter, like we didn't order enough. The drinks took a long time and when it can it was simply two small coffee mugs both of which had dirty, visible stains on the outside. To boot, my hot chocolate was barely 75% of the mug full, and tasted like powdered beverage. 

The bill came to $6.12, complete with $1 for the hot water. 

What is this, sub-par service and below quality food at overcharged price just to be a snub to patrons warming up after enjoying an afternoon on the Island?"}
{"text":"When you're on an island, you expect expensive-ass food. That's just the way it is. You literally have no other option for food unless you brought some yourself, you're willing to take the ferry back to the mainland, or you're a really good swimmer.

The Rectory Cafe is well-priced, and the quality of the food was also a pleasant surprise. I had the Beef Brisket Burger, which was juicy and flavourful. The salad that came with it (no fries here. We fancy, huh?) was zesty and complimented the burger quite nicely.

The service took a while because we picked a VERY nice day to come to the island. We sat out on the patio with the sun shining down on our faces, and had a right good time. I would definitely recommend sitting out on the patio if Mother Nature allows it.

My girlfriend had the beer-mosa. It was good. Y'all should definitely try it out!"}
{"text":"Had a light lunch here the other day while visiting the Island.  Great location, right near Ward's Island ferry.  The back patio looks out onto the lake and Leslie Street Spit.  I had two apps and a beer, with tip came to just over $30, so is a little pricey for what you get.  The sun-dried tomato hummus with olives, and the curried vegetable with goat cheese soup were excellent.  Service was a little slow but not bad.   Overall, if you are on the island and want something more than hot dogs and with great location check this place out."}
{"text":"The food is fine, but it's the patio that gets ya. You are literally tucked away in the trees with the patio feeling like a little meadow in the center albeit devoid of grass in favor of patio bricks instead. It's both charming and romantic and sets the tone for a great lunch or early evening date if you are looking for a spot to wow. Again, the food is just ok (I got the Rectory Café Salad and a pita/creamy cheese dish and was satisfied enough, but not blown away), but the service is great. A must when you are visiting Ward's Island (not that there are many other options! lol!)"}
{"text":"I set sail to the Island with eyes set on the Rectory Cafe. My mother and I both took the day off work to literally walk around the Island (and later go shopping, but that's another story!) and we were delighted to have lunch near the lake. 

This place gets 4 stars because the atmosphere felt perfect. The day was beautiful and the patio was so calming, it felt like you were in somebody's secret garden. Large trees loomed above us but didn't shadow the sun, instead creating quite a lovely parkette ambiance. It was so peaceful and quiet, I almost didn't want to leave (even when a spider fell on me! ew!). I couldn't quite see the water from my seat, but the tips of sails as they floated by were a lovely reminder. 

The place makes their own gingerale and so I took the opportunity to order a cocktail that contained said gingerale, vodka, pomegranate something and actual pieces of ginger. It was amazing! I could have drank 100 of them. My mom ordered the Sunset and it was also so, so good. The drinks were definitely better than the food. To be honest, I hated the side salad (and I am actually obsessed with salads). The dressing was salty and less than ideal. I ordered a sandwich with avocado and mozzarella and I must confess the potato bun was quite delicious, but this sammie was a mess! A tasty mess, but not quite a hot mess, which is normally my preference. My mom ordered a brisket burger and she said she liked it, but she didn't finish her meal so I'm not sure if she was telling the truth.

Service was nice, quick and friendly. I didn't have any of the problems that previous reviewers encountered. I actually felt like I got the whole Toronto Island experience and I couldn't have picked a better day to try this cafe. I'd recommend it for its peacefulness, for it's ability to offer a break from the city, and definitely for its cocktails."}
{"text":"Food was delicious.  Nice drink selection.  This is definitely a hidden gem.
The waitress seemed a little annoyed... not sure if it was because it got busy or her demeanour.  Either way we had a great time... beautiful hidden spot on the island... I can't wait to go back... :)"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed eating here. The view and ambiance is unbeatable and the waitresses are very friendly. The food options are also good and the price fair for a restaurant on a island. They have some nice Muskoka chairs on the patio and bike parking. I would love to come back with my family. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this delightful little gem on a trip to the Toronto Islands. We were there with my son and his girlfriend visiting from Los Angeles. Our lunch on the patio under the huge trees overlooking the lake was the highlight of the day. 

The service was cheerful and friendly. We were seated immediately and had a hard time choosing what we wanted from the menu. A couple of the dishes that looked interesting to try were the Tandoori pulled chicken sandwich or the maple glazed salmon.

 In the end I had the Rectory House Salad. I was intrigued by the vanilla vinaigrette and was not disappointed. It was amazing and matched beautifully with the shaved fennel, mandarin segments and candied pecans. Refreshing and so summery. And reasonably priced at $11 for a generous portion. I sipped a Tipsy Arnold Palmer, one of the fun cocktails on the list consisting of bourbon, iced tea and lemonade. Perfect for the summer. 

The Rectory Cafe is open all year but they do not accept reservations on weekends and holidays between 12:30 pm and 4:30 pm. The dining room is charming but the patio is glorious. A nice place to linger on our beautiful island. Take the Wards Island Ferry across. Worth the trip!"}
{"text":"I have only been once, but I must say it was a treasured experience. It helps that the weather was incredible. The Summer That Never Was had relented when I came to town; it was warm, sunny and perfect. Relaxing and charming, The Rectory fit in nicely. (Having terrific weather and a beautiful outdoor seating area, surrounded by grand trees, certainly helped.) The Lamb Burger was very good if a bit overpriced. The real treat was dessert: an incredible cornmeal olive oil cake -- I'd say shockingly good, but that implies it disturbed my mood. Not a chance. It did, however, tickle my taste buds and warm my soul.

Granted, I was a tourist who didn't even know there was an island in Toronto :-) but the whole experience here was idyllic."}
{"text":"Well, I am debating between 2 or 3 stars. I guess I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and give 3 stars since I visited only once.  
We visited the Island in winter and the Rectory Café was the only option if you wanted to eat anything.  Since we were spending most of the day there, we did not have any other choice.  
The place is charming, in an old house, a short walk from the ferry and with a   patio that would be a good option when the weather is warm.  Considering that it was the only place opened on the Island, I expected a wait, but no, plenty of room.  Well, when I looked at the menu and noticed the fairly expensive prices (for sandwiches and soups, basic fare), I got part of the answer.  After having lunch at the Rectory, I understood why people had brought their picnics with them.  Our overly priced bland soup seemed like it was coming straight out of a can, the coffee was fairly tasteless, but the bill quite spicy.  
Just bring your lunch with your if you visit the island in winter."}
{"text":"Nice terrace dining and upscale food

We walked around the Toronto Islands and ended up on Wards. We googled eateries and found the Rectory Cafe which is tucked behind a snack bar so you might have to be on the alert to find it. They have indoor and terrace dining and we sat on the terrace with a water view. We had the Chili Verde, a Feta Omelet, Ginger Beer, a 1/2 Blond Lager and a Toffee Blondie to share for dessert. All were quite good. The bill came to $57 CAN before tip. Other reviewers say the service can be spotty but it was adequate to our needs. We would definitely go again."}
{"text":"Rectory Cafe is often forgiven for bad food and service because it is considered a tourist spot. 

The Islands are not a tourist spot.  Yes tourists visit but so do people who live here.    The CN Tower is a tourist spot, the Toronto Islands are part of our city and regardless, shouldn't we be putting our best foot forward to those visiting us? Rant over. 

The RC has one of the best patios in the GTA, absolutely beautiful under a tree canopy with views of the water..........and they know it.  

The result: 
* indifferent and, sometimes, very rude service
* average and, sometimes, very bland food


We have had:
Their grazing plate (good)
Their omelette (terrible)
Their chicken and brie sandwich (boring)
Their pulled pork sandwich (yawn)
Their soup (pass the salt and pepper please)

Skip the food, don't be in a rush to be acknowledged by anyone and enjoy the view and being surrounded by beautiful old trees while near the heart of the city."}
{"text":"Lots of spider webs around and insects everywhere... I did not feel safe or comfortable... guess I'm not much of a nature girl

Food was average, not too bad, but nothing special. Prices are higher than I'd like. $14 for the omelette, $16 for pulled pork sandwich and $14 for burger. What I appreciate is that each entree comes with a generous portion of greens. 

Wouldn't want to come back again.. but there's not many food options around centre island so I have no choice..."}
{"text":"Another great meal!  We come here at least once a summer.  Food and service are excellent and the view is great too.  The new pico app was particularly awesome.  Great classic martinis.  Our server felt like an old friend by the end of the meal."}
{"text":"I've been to the Rectory a few times and had food ranging from mediocre to quite good but the service today left me deeply disappointed - enough to write this review. 

Came with a friend visiting from Germany for a light dinner. Chalkboard by main entrance indicated that today's soup was potato and cheddar soup, which given that it was raining seemed like a great idea - so when our waiter came, I ordered \"the soup, please\" as the menu lists \"Daily Soup\" for $7. 

I was surprised when my soup arrived to find a chilled fruit soup. I flagged down the waiter immediately and said that although I had indeed ordered \"the soup\", their sign said it was potato and cheddar. He assured me that I was mistaken and that the only soup on offer was this chilled watermelon soup. My friend and I were both confused as we'd both read the chalkboard by the door when we came in and were quite certain we had not misread \"watermelon\" as \"potato and cheddar\"...

Our waiter (to his credit) asked if I'd like to order something else, which I didn't as my friend was already eating her meal and we'd ordered soup and a salad because we were trying to catch a ferry back in only 45 minutes (as they're hourly from Ward's Island). He said he would \"go take a look at the sign\" and I assumed he would go, find that we were indeed right, and report back, presumably comping the mistaken soup. 

We didn't see him again until he brought us the cheque, featuring my soup at full price. I went to investigate and sure enough, he had located the incorrect sign and changed it to say \"Watermelon Soup (COLD)\". Given that it was raining and I was having only soup for dinner, watermelon soup was really not ideal. I've worked as a waiter for several years and I was surprised to find that my rather unsatisfying cold soup dinner had not been comped given that the error was clearly theirs. I was also surprised that the waiter did not return to confirm that I was indeed right, and apologize for accusing me of being wrong about what their own sign said. 

The watermelon soup came with, somewhat confusingly, a solitary, savoury breadstick. I think I'll give another restaurant a try next time I'm on the islands. As for my dinner tonight, I took the ferry home in the rain and made myself spaghetti."}
{"text":"My cousin is visiting Toronto so decided to show her the Toronto Islands. We made a day out of it - with lunch first and then riding our bikes around the three islands. I first came here last summer, but my friend and I just ordered a drink. This time, however, we had lunch. 

I love the décor of this place as it looks like a cozy cottage. We sat in the back where there was a beautiful view of Lake Ontario. To start, my cousin and I ordered the Toronto Island Iced Tea (sweet like juice!) and my friend ordered the Sunset Breeze (I didn't try it, but she recommends!). For our meals, we all ordered the brisket burger, which was quite delicious - it comes with the works including sautéed mushrooms and BBQ sauce. I also asked for bacon in my burger, which definitely added to it. To finish our Rectory Café experience, my cousin ordered the chocolate torte and my friend and I went halvsies on the Harmony (chocolate and blonde brownies). Both desserts were very yummy.

Good for: out-of-towners, relaxing, casual dining"}
{"text":"We went specifically to try the jalapeño corn dip, which they didn't have. We got the 5 cheese spinach dip, which was fine. Not much spinach, but still tasty. The peach cider was the highlight."}
{"text":"Sat out on the patio for a pitcher of Amsterdam brew with another guy on a Saturday afternoon. Fantastic viewpoint and with the shade it's a great place to cool off, just minutes from the beach."}
{"text":"When warm goat cheese salad costs $12, it hurts when you're broke. 

It hurts even if it's made with cooked pears and dressed with brandy and honey. It hurts even if the waiter was awesome, had a great smile and was on the ball. It hurts even if you're sitting outside on a sunny afternoon under tall trees and all you can hear are songbirds chirping and French tourists chatting. 

I'll admit, it did hit the spot though!"}
{"text":"Took he 6pm ferry and went for a walk on the island. Got hungry and found this gem.
Very nice place to have dinner with a glass
of wine. Took the 10:30 ferry back."}
{"text":"I went here last week with a friend to celebrate my birthday, which was the week before. We both ordered the special salad: mixed greens wrapped in slender slices of field cucumber, with warm goat cheese encrusted with cashews and shrimp on the side. 

We also ordered the hummus platter, no pictures for that one. Sorry everyone. It came with warm triangled flatbreads, olives, a lemon wedge and the hummus, which looked handmade because of the chunks of chickpeas in it. The hummus was okay. 

Their patio is wonderful, nice and big and spacious. Perfect for dinning solo, or paired, or with any other amount of people. The price is a bit high, but you pay for location and this location is atypical from your standard patio. 

The service was good, friendly. I overheard the server say the exact same thing to the table next to us, which is okay. No judgment, I get how repetitive working in the service industry is, it made me smile. 

I'd go back but for dessert next time."}
{"text":"Nice food, and super duper when you forget your picnic basket and have gone all skeletal.  But as others have said, this place ain't cheap for what you get.  I'm not sure if they factor-in extra costs because it's an island and requires extra transportation.  I can't imagine it costs THAT much more to ferry olives across the lake.  The patio is very nice and homey (not landscaped or dolled up, just like a regular back yard).

Basically, if you go to Wards Island and are desperate for a bite....or if you're planning to splurge, then this place is great.

Oh, and this summer I had a waitress who made me feel like coughing up more dough. She was the most delightful, theatrical, outgoing, crazy lady!!  A total hoot whom I did not mind tipping biggly."}
{"text":"it's probably no surprise that you can get better food on the mainland, but the offerings at rectory café aren't bad either. i think, however, one has to choose carefully. the menu is a bit hit-and-miss imho. the grilled calamari is great. the taco salad is not. the burger is decent. 

value is reasonable. service is friendly, a touch slow though. 

all that being said, it's the patio that's breathtaking - like an oasis within an oasis. the most idyllic place for a beer after a bike ride or to pass the afternoon with a book and some tea."}
{"text":"We came here for drinks after a day of bike ridding around the island.  Can't comment on the food but as we were waiting for a table, a couple on their way out told us their food is amazing specially the calamari. 

I ordered a cold latte while my friends ordered beers, the service was efficient and our server was very friendly. It's a great place to bring a date in my opinion. You have a great view of the lake, sitting underneath trees in a garden. Kind of romantic."}
{"text":"Summer wouldn't be complete without a few visits to the Rectory, an oasis of calm and serenity.  Friendly, relaxed and the food is always good.  Recently had their 'compressed watermelon salad' and would definitely recommend it.  And their desserts....you won't be disappointed with any that you choose.  Very fortunate that this café is just a short ferry ride from my home.  Whether you are a local or a tourist, put this on your 'to do' list."}
{"text":"Competition for good food on the island: zilch
Incentive to serve good food: very low
Quality of food: high, even compared to restaurants on the \"mainland\"

I often do bike trips or long distance runs around the island and on one balmy summer day my friend and I came across this lovely restaurant. 

The Rectory Cafe probably claims titles for the most picturesque patio in all of Toronto. Tables are situated in the garden where you dine under the shade of tall trees, chirping birds and surprisingly non-aggressive squirrels. The trees make the whole restaurant seem like it's in a middle of a dome made by Mother nature. If you are facing the entrance, you get an extraordinary view of the south side on Lake Ontario. 

As a die-hard pescatore linguini fan, I actually really liked the dish they served. I'm happy to say I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of food. Espresso was great and so was the salad. You could taste the freshness of their food and I think they did a spectacular job with the seasoning. 

The one downside of this restaurant is that it's kind of hard to find. It's located on the very South side of Toronto Island, abutting Ward's Island and the Disc Golf Course. You might have to ask some locals for directions. 

Interesting fact about the Rectory Cafe. In the 1960s, the Metropolitan Toronto government started demolishing island homes to protect residents from the periodic waves. The Rectory House is one of only TWO surviving houses on the west of the island. 

If you have a chance, check out the stucco house that is now used as the kitchen. Presumably, the engineer employed the same principles in building seawalls to build the house in response to the flooding. 

Would highly recommend this place if you are on the island!"}
{"text":"On a stroll through the Toronto Islands we stopped in for a snack and a couple of drinks. There's no real hostess desk so we just kinda stood there waiting to be helped because we couldn't really tell if it was a seat yourself deal. This is a cool place because it's under a bunch of trees that provide natural shade. It's super cute and you really do feel like you're eating at a really nice place al fresco.

We looked over the menu, but there wasn't really anything on it that looked that appealing. We ordered the special which was an Artichoke and Cheese dip that came with tortilla chips and pita bread along with a couple glasses of wine. The dip was bomb and I liked that they had some local wine options. We ordered a couple glasses of red from the Niagara region. They were ok, not anything great. What I noticed was their prices were pretty high. It wasn't fine dining, but they were certainly higher than casual dining. Almost in a way that I felt like it was overpriced. I mean, our dip was $18 and it was delicious but it definitely wasn't $18. 

Cute lil place but there are probably others on the island to check out."}
{"text":"First time visiting Wards Island & The Rectory Cafe...what a beauty!!!! Wonderful outside table service...the servers were very attentive. I had the  mountainous pulled pork sandwich, slightly on the salty side but it is a whopper!! Would visit again!!!!"}
{"text":"We sat on the patio on a nice sunny day, and the setting could not have been prettier.  The food was pretty good.  Salumi platter was pretty descent.  So was butter chicken.  Burger was a bit dry.  The prices are somewhat on the high side, which is somewhat expected, considering that you're on a island.  Service was very good."}
{"text":"Very badly disorganized. Called Rectory today, confirmed what time they were closing. We Arrived today at 3:45pm knowing the kitchen closes in 45 minutes, first massively nice day at the island this year, we got in a line for a table. We were 8th person in line. Servers told us to be patient they were cleaning tables (plenty looked available). We waited 30 minutes in line before someone actually told the whole line that they were shutting the whole kitchen down at 4:30pm and basically they would only serve 4 more people at the front of the line,  they literally didn't want to seat people who had waited in line for 30 minutes beside the fact the kitchen was open for a while.?!?! Why could no staff member have told us that while they say us waiting in line for so long? Eventually like 20 people were in line. shutting down early they turned away a ton of people.  I go to Toronto Islands all time and have never ate at the Rectory but have heard such bad reviews of bad, slow service and ridiculously overpriced food and well...now I get it to. Won't bother trying to go back."}
{"text":"I have always been skeptical of restaurants with nice views, because most of the time that means they can skimp out on the food.  In the case of the Rectory Cafe, I am unhappy to report that this is the case.  

Mind, the food is not bad, but not spectacular.  And it sure is expensive. The 3 bean dip, the salad, were nothing to write home about.  However, the garden is just so serene, the view of the lake so pleasant and peaceful that you could  just sit there all afternoon with a cup of tea and be happy as a clam.  

Come here if you want to relax from the hubbub of the city, not if you want a great meal."}
{"text":"Super chill spot on the island. Just a ferry ride away from downtown. Very cute setup, it's a good change of pace.
Staff are really friendly too! (they get more friendly, the more you drink the spiked coffee :)"}
{"text":"Beautiful patio on Toronto Island. Brisket burger was really great. Had a salad as well. Ambiance the BEST!"}
{"text":"The food was excellent and so was the outside atmosphere and the service was VG. 
Oh and the desserts..yummy."}
{"text":"This is a delightful and casual restaurant on Ward's Island. Food and desserts are delicious! Don't be fooled, you can take the ferry to Ward's Island to eat at the Rectory! Sandra Pate"}
{"text":"3* if it wasn't on an island but 4* because it is. 

We were pleasantly surprised by this quaint little restaurant/cafe on our trip to Toronto Island.  The bf looked bored (and kept making hints about how lame the island was) and was really hungry so we decided to stop for a snack.

We were seated outside on a beautiful April day, but looking back, I wish we had sat indoors because it was still a bit chilly.  We ordered a Toronto Island Ice Tea but it didn't taste quite as good as it sounded. We got the Pulled Pork Panini for $13. Yea, it's a bit steep but it's an island and there are extra costs involved with everything on an island. The waiter explained that they don't serve fries as a side because it's a hassle to dispose of oil on an island.  At the very least we knew our meal was extra healthy and lean that day.  The panini was very tasty and exceeded our expectations. 

I'm not sure if we had any alternatives to choose from but I'm very glad we stopped here."}
