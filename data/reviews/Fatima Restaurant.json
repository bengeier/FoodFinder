{"text":"Hands down the best chicken biryani I've ever had in a restaurant. This was my 2nd time eating here and tasted just as good as the first. We ordered the chicken karahi, butter chicken, kofta kabob, salad, fresh tandoor naan and the chicken biryani. Portions are huge and price is very reasonable!. Our server was the nicest man. Will be coming back!"}
{"text":"The food here is SO GOOD! There were no pics on the menu so we asked our neighbouring diners what they were having (looked so yummy) & ordered that. Meatapalooza dish (sorry don't know the name) with sides. Also lentils. Dee-lish! Would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"I never write reviews for pakistani restaurants but this place is amazing. The kebabs are the best I have tasted in my life.  It was juicy, not too hot or burnt from the edges.   The service was phenomenal, we were seated in less than 5 minutes and our food was out in less than 10. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"The delicious sister restaurant to Feisal's Kabab Hut, this location is next-door to Bombay sweet house restaurant in the Castle Ridge Plaza.   The sizzling fish tandoori plate ($13.99)melted in our mouths and I loved the garlic naan (.95 each). The samosa plate ($5.99) was chickpeas in curry with onions, yogurt and two samosas.  We thought the lassi and tea wasn't the best but overall great food and experience."}
