{"text":"Really bad food. They give you microwaved food. I ordered a palak paneer. I could not taste palak in it. It tasted really bad. Would never go back."}
{"text":"Food is not fresh, ordered the mixed tandoori platter. It was heated in a microwave and was cold by the time I reached home, the same goes for the chicken biryani cold rice."}
{"text":"Nice little spot for some quick Indian food, all the wraps I've had there are delicious! All the curries are very tasty as well.  Try the Mystik platter, awesome!"}
{"text":"Going with 3 stars for now. Its a small place with a depressing environment. The people are nice. The food does not always feel fresh but it's better than many other places. The claim to have fresh food alway but i am doubtful about this claim. 
They make naan but do not make roti. I wonder why..."}
{"text":"The most authentic, tasty East Indian cuisine you will ever have tasted that will keep your mouth watering after your first try of this food.
A must for everyone.
We have been eating here for the past three years and aren't about to stop.
Best in Toronto."}
{"text":"I went to this little take out Indian place in August 2015, and I really liked it. The quality of the food was amazing for the price. I had the palak paneer and shahi paneer with spicy chutney and it was soooo good! Especially for the price. Well seasoned, perfectly cooked and most definitely fresh. The only downside I will say is that there was quite a bit of oil so I wouldn't consider it healthy by any means. Take out isn't usually healthy but just saying. They do have daily specials on the wall. Channa masala is $3.99 on Tuesday's, which is so cheap! Anyways I recommend this cute and tasty family owned place."}
{"text":"Unfortunately what mattered the most \"the food\" wasn't good
Chicken leg was dry and tasted just bad
Kebabs were OK
Friendly service
Perhaps I didn't get what others see in this place"}
{"text":"I do not recommend this place. I feel bad because the owner was really sweet and the workers there seemed so kind, hence why I'm giving it atleast a 2. However the food was really bad. 

We got some chicken curry and lentils. Both tasted ridiculously plain and had absolutely no flavouring.thw chicken curry had maybe Max of 2 chicken pieces. The lentil curry was a weird colour and tasted too thick and milky. The naan bread was the only ok thing in the whole meal."}
{"text":"Well let's just say it's a hit and miss..I've stuck to the safe choices like Biryani and will pass on the curry in the future, especially Channa masala (way too tomato pastey) The price is pretty decent for a good portion. I hear the specials are good too.  Don't bother planning a date there cause it hardly has sitting space and looks like a dead dhaba joint. As for the food being fresh...  I won't bet my paycheck...  The raita looked kinda gross.  I still would recommend it!  Better than lots of others for the price/portion."}
{"text":"Lady at the counter was super friendly. Menu doesn't have descriptions, so those of you who aren't familiar with Indian food (like me), feel free to ask for descriptions.

Had:

Dal Makhni was flavorful. I believe it was their Wednesday special? $4.99. No butter naan included.

Tandoori chicken leg ($2.50) is small, but super flavorful. Nice and smokey. A tad dry though. Wrapped up in tin foil. Odd choice.

Sunday special is buy 3 get one free on chicken biryani. Will be back to try!"}
{"text":"Tiny place where you order up front and they go to the back to fix it for you.  We ordered the Mystik Platter and split it between the two of us.  Some of the shish kabob was quite spicy (medium). Also had the samosas and they were good."}
{"text":"Take out food- perfect for me as the Mild Version fits my taste buds. Try out the Biryani. The husband and wife believe in listening to you and making sure that you  take some good Indian food home!"}
{"text":"Food is okay, nothing special. Ordered a bunch of different dishes because their take out containers are smaller than normal. Was disappointed when they were full of mostly sauce. Biryani was literally a chicken leg and all rice."}
{"text":"I'm only giving this place two stars because the workers were friendly and informative about the food, but the food itself, as most reviews say, was very bad. I had shrimp biryani for $6.99 plus tax and the rice was not cooked properly. My friend tried it, and he's had plenty of genuine, good biryani, and he said it was very watery. The food made him so angry that he went back and complained (against my wishes) and he ended up taking the food (which we only ate two spoons of) and returning it. He didn't even want a refund, he was just so angry. I wouldn't recommend. This was my first experience with biryani and it didn't turn out well. Oh well."}
{"text":"This place is located in a plaza and its quite small - more for takeout obviously. There is one table there and a bench to wait for your food. 

There are daily specials and lunch specials so be sure to try them out, they aren't badly priced either. Everything here is quite affordable - under $10 most definitely. The lady at the counter was friendly and always willing to make suggestions if you haven't been here before.

I always get the Chicken Biryani each time I have been here. The Chicken Biryani has good flavours and spice - not too spicy but decent. No complaints. Most recently, I ordered the Veal Biryani and I regretted it instantly, the veal was dry and no flavour whatsoever. I would come back here when in the area to try the other dishes and see if its any good."}
{"text":"I am so disappointed! 
This is the first time I visited this place after over 2 years. A family member told me they're under new management, however the same owner who was there before was standing behind the counter and appears to be cooking with 2 other new gentlemen. 
The new staff were friendly and were eager to obtain feedback. However they didn't follow directions. I feel as if they listen to your requests but do not follow through. I don't believe this business can be successful until they take feedback and act upon it. 

I pleaded for mild options going forward, and both staff agreed. Upon ordering I specifically asked for milk biryani before I ordered, and of course when I got home my fox was too spicy and I was unable to enjoy it. I also asked for Veggie and Beef samosas and when I arrived home they gave me Chicken and Veggie. . I felt as if I wasted my money. 

Lastly, one thing that didn't sit well with me was the staff telling me that most of their orders come from Indian customers so they don't have many mild options. I made it clear that many people enjoy Indian food and they should cater to ALL customers!!"}
{"text":"Stopped here on a Saturday night for take-out. I thought it would be a quick grab-and-go, since it's a take-out joint, but the curries were all freshly made and require 10-15 minutes. Only samosas and spring rolls are put out pre-made.

As I was patiently waiting, I started watching the Bollywood movie that was showing on the large-screen TV. You gotta love Toronto - you're waiting for your shahih paneer and then get up-sold on the latest Bollywood movie; ripped CDs are available for $1 and the resolution/quality is decent. If they've run out of the film you've requested, it only takes another 10 minutes for a freshly-burned copy! 

The chana masala ($4) was good, but had too much oil. The mixed dahl ($4) was also nice but it looked as if someone had spilled a whole pack of curry leaves in it. What blew me away was the shahi paneer ($5) - a creamy tomato curry with cheese. Mystik uses high quality spices and doesn't skimp out. Even the vegetarian spring rolls (5 for $1) were not over-fried and were made with fresh cabbage.

Altogether, I paid $19 for 3 curries, a large box of rice and spring rolls; my sister and I shared the food but it could have easily fed a third person. 

I'll be coming back to try the rest of their vegetarian menu!

DISCOUNT: If you go over $20 before tax, you get 10% off.

4.5/5 stars"}
{"text":"I give them 0 stars. The quality of food was terrible I've never been so disgusted in my life. Ordered mateer paneer tasted like the green peas and paneer were just thrown in with a can of tomatoes. The paneer was yellow and translucent. The dish was so sour. I called the restaurant and the lady just made excuses. I hope I don't get food poisoning. Oh and let's not forget the bugs I saw only until after paying. I threw all the food in the garbage after one bite. Waste of my 22 bucks. Horrible restaurant never going back and don't recommend anyone else to either."}
{"text":"I'm sorry, I hate giving bad reviews. The service was lovely, but the most important has to be the food, right? $1.25 for 3 veggie samosas and they were honestly the worst samosas I've ever had. The flavour combination inside was not tasty and maybe I got a stale batch, but the fried wrapper was not tasty either. I couldn't finish my one samosa and regretted buying six."}
{"text":"This place has been sold by the previous owner, new place is named Wedeshi. 

The prices have changed a bit, see attached pictures. Essentially a take out place, but it had some seating. I ordered 5 piece chicken tikka chicken samosa, tikka came with salad. The food and was very flavorful, total bill was less than 10 $ can't beat that. Only complaint they did not serve any chutneys with samosa, other than that great place for some cheap and good food."}
