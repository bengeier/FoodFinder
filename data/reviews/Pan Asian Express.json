{"text":"Picture this.... it's a Monday you are thinking wow I have had crap all weekend to eat, YES let's get pan express and you get a pretty good sized bug in your food.... BUZZKILL check your food people"}
{"text":"Arrived and only one women there taking orders, cooking the omelets, and operating the register.  Obviously from my omelet its more than a one person job. My omelet obviously stayed in the pan to long because the outside was overcooked and crusty. Ate some of the middle and threw the rest away. Not going back."}
{"text":"So sad it wasn't better. I at least hoped it would be adequate to Panda Express... not even close. Don't waste your $15 on a plate here."}
{"text":"This is definitely the worst Asian food I have ever had. Everything is overcooked and it doesn't taste Asian. The shrimp tastes like fried shrimp from Costco covered in some weird sauce.  The fried rice is mushy. Panda Express is so much better in every way."}
{"text":"Well I will have to say that the food court at MGM is great, not because I work in the hotel, but because it gives me lots of options as a vegetarian.  I eat at Pan Asian at least 3-4 times a week, and the food, service, quality and standard keeps me coming back.  When you walk up and they all greet you, ask me how my day is, it just makes me feel good.  I have never had a bad lunch here, and I will continue to dine here.  If you want a healthier option for lunch, hit this place up."}
{"text":"Okay here is the scenario. I was part of the many people from the convention yesterday, we ate there around 6:30- 7:00 pm  so we're in the line waiting for our turn, then the lady wearing a glasses is serving us she said \"NEXT You Ready Ok what do you want\" and we got a little shock that's is very rude for me , but my concern is SHE IS NOT WEARING A GLOVES while serving us and other people too. The bad thing about it. Is She's the Supervisor as it shown on her Name tag and her NAME is \"NANCY\". the rest of the staff is using a gloves except her that's disgusting serving food with out gloves and she got a position she should know what's do's and dont's if she dont she is not supposed to be in there. we dont wanna get sick"}
{"text":"Small portions, overpriced, low quality food. But I guess what can I expect in downtown Las Vegas?"}
{"text":"The omelet it's really great the price is a bit higher but service is great also it's amazing. I'll be back again"}
{"text":"I LOVE Rice but this rice was nasty gross. And was deffinetly NOT worth my $15. I had to force myself to eat it after spending that much on a very small portion. I didn't even get $15 worth of food. Don't waste your money!"}
{"text":"I don't write reviews often but when I do it's epic.

I came into Vegas with my boyfriend and our group of friends for the holiday. We all had lunch at the food court and my boyfriend and I wanted Chinese food. We were so happy we found Pan Asian because the service was AMAZING. The service was the best service we've ever experienced in Vegas (and we've dined at AAA diamond restaurants). We were immediately greeted by a very cheerful young lady and everyone on staff was very pleasant and attentive. The manager was also there and he was just phenomenal with his customer service (I believe his name started with a T...I wish I could remember it, my memory is so bad). The food was worth the cost (especially with it's location on the strip) and it was so much better than a typical express Chinese food place. I the got fried rice, orange chicken and my boyfriend got the noodles with beef and broccoli; all were cooked and seasoned just right. We will definitely come back."}
{"text":"As the last year I stopped by at this place, called \"Pan Asian\" and The food was good, but the fried rice was excelent, so I came back to ask for more.

Excelent option for the people whom are searching for asian food."}
{"text":"Lame workers. Barely understands me. Why in the world I can't pay for a 2 choice and get rice as a side and orange chicken and noodles as the entree?! The broccoli looked weird, the other entrees looked old and dried up so I did not want any of it. JOHNNY ROCKET has awesome burgers!"}
{"text":"Worst chinese food ive ever had. Small portions and has no flavor. Not worth the $10."}
{"text":"Awesome customer service and good food...The food is like a better pandas express and very decent in pricing (considering its on the strip). I recommend the orange chicken and noodles. I was also impressed on the customer care this company had; everyone on staff was welcoming and sincere. It's really rare to get that nowadays."}
{"text":"Food was good but i only got 3 shrimp in my antree. 3 shrimp ??? Really? I was expecting a little bit more food."}
{"text":"I was desperate to find breakfast. I just wanted a quick omlet. I will say they are quick. That's a good thing. I realize this is a food court.  That being said i don't expect stellar food. ...but i also don't expect astronomical prices. .....Vegas or not!  My omlet was $9.95 & side of bacon was $3.00. The bacon was very thin and small. They should give you more for that price.  The actual omlet size is big but they don't put a lot of items inside for the price.  Lots of empty item bins. You can't  even tell what they are!  I skipped the potatoes that come with it. .....They looked awful and bland.  The toast was the basic bland white bread. Not even good white bread."}
{"text":"I should have looked at yelp before I went here. I was just so hungry for Asian food. Well. This was a huge mistake!  The food is not good, barely Asian and, well, just not good."}
{"text":"This place sucks.  Avoid at all costs.  Crispy shrimp was soggy and chow mein had no taste at all. Would not recommend.  Adding soy sauce did not help."}
{"text":"Went here w/ my friends before clubbing at HK and it was a lovely experience. The servers were extremely friendly and they helped us choose our entrees. The food was perfectly cooked and it super yummy. I got the pot stickers and fried rice and my friend got the orange chicken. They also sell beer! :D"}
{"text":"The broccoli beef and ginger mushroom chicken were okay. The chow mien was the worst I've ever had. Undercooked and bland. I'm a good eater and left it all on the plate."}
{"text":"Ate beaf and broccoli the first night here, it Was good, the second night, oh gosh, they mixed everything , it was impossible to get boilded rice, and when we finaly got our food it was red meat. Grose"}
{"text":"Not bad if your starving or need something cheaper on your vacation. Probably wouldn't eat here again though, since they are the only shop in the food court without a coupon on the tray liners."}
{"text":"Tiny portions and overpriced. But, then, everything else on the Strip is. $15 for a tiny plate of chow mein and two tiny entrees + bottled water."}
{"text":"I had to give a star to be able to write this review :|. Please do not waste your money here this place is disgusting!!!!!!! When I ordered I should have known bc they were low with chow main and instead of expecting a cook  to prep a new bash the cashier brought a new round out of a warmer!!!!!!!!!! wtf wow. This food is WAY TO OVER PRICED and pre cooked ( rubbery taste). I hated every taste of it that I had to throw it away :|~ STOP AND RECONSIDER WASTING YOUR MULA HERE!!!!"}
{"text":"The food was kinda stinky. We were looking for a quick bite because we had to go to the airport asap. We went through the line pretty quick and the cashier was friendly. This is just your normal food court Chinese food"}
{"text":"I wished I had read the other reviews before I dined here. Bad food, horribly overpriced. Panda Express is 10 times better at half the price."}
{"text":"Don't do it!! In a moment of weakness during Interbike I chose this ridiculous place for a quick lunch. The most disgusting food ever. The ginger chicken lacks flavor as well the chow mien and fried rice."}
{"text":"Total waste of money don't recommend to anybody. Panda Express way better than this generic version.
Small potions soggy ginger chicken noodles tasted boiled nothing is flavorful wished I check d the reviews here this business should be closed asap."}
{"text":"Don't eat here. Horrible staff and stale food. The server made sure some meat falls off the serving spoon before scooping it to my plate. Stingy portions. Also, their placemat tray has a 50% off coupon that they will not honor. The cashier says to bring it next time. They didn't give me a receipt either. Shady staff."}
{"text":"All I can say is DO NOT DO IT! Just get a burger or chicken somewhere.... Food was bland. I have nothing nice to say about it. That's what I get for having a meal in a food court lol"}
{"text":"The worst Chinese food ever. It's disgusting. It shouldn't even be called food. Ewe. Ewe. Ewe. Everything was bad. Choose something else."}
{"text":"Came yesterday and they turned me away did not having egg whites. Today I showed up up at 7AM per signs do they said they do not serve until 7AM."}
{"text":"DONT EAT HERE!!! Please!!! Save your money!! Complete RIPOFF!! Trust me. For the same price or even less you could eat at a place WAYYY better than this sh*t of a \"restaurant\" Its over priced and food is complete TRASH and SHIT!!!"}
{"text":"Terrible! The food is just plain and the serving size is so small! I should have checked on here before I ordered anything. Don't go. Seriously don't."}
{"text":"I have given this place a few of try's bc I work at MGM, and same dissatisfaction of quality. Nothing Asian here if that's what you want. Old tasting, greasy and tasteless over priced food."}
{"text":"Salty ass chow mein!!! Expensive for crap or food wish I should have read reviews before coming here  ..  stay away .. salty food


Update... wow this food really did damage I got sick in the middle of the night my body literally rejected it.. I hate being that person writing a negative review but seriously this place should be closed down ."}
{"text":"PanasianPan Asian Express is a fast food americanized Chinese food, similar to that of Panda Express and other various Asian mall/food court joints. This particular location was at the MGM Las Vegas hotel/casino food court location. Service was practical but I was disappointed in price but more so quality. Staff was nice, even offering to free samples....I don't mind price so much if it's reasonable but to pay $17.00+ for less than mediocre amount of food is ridiculous. The orange chicken was anything but chicken. It was like eating breaded crispy orange tempura with no chicken meat in it at all. The sweet and sour portion was 5 small pieces with all green and red peppers.  If there was no other choice it might be alright, but I would rather get food from the other choices around the area."}
{"text":"A semi cheap option (not sure if that is even possible on the strip) to eat if you are staying at The MGM or The Signature.  It is between the mid point walkway between the two resorts.  I got a one entree and one side meal to go for just over $10.  The side I got was supposedly spicy (kung pao). It was barely mild to say the least. The entree of fried rice was okay.  I'd liken the food to a Panda Express doppleganger. They also sell beer and wine here if I saw correctly."}
{"text":"Wonderful food. definitely hit the spot. chow mein was a little bland but the orange chicken was sweet and tangy. :)"}
{"text":"This place sucks. They should close this branch. I complain to the person serving that their fried rice is half cooked and salty instead of accommodating me he just turn back and gave me a grin talking to the other person that wears white and I assumed that he's the manager. Their customer service is zero. These employees should be fired from their job. This business needs a person that taste food before they serve it to consumers. Just a waste of money. It's ok to pay more if the food taste good.
     I will not eat at this place anymore and will tell to my friends, family and employees."}
{"text":"Pretty bad food in general. It feels like they didn't even TRY to cook chinese food.

Drunk and tired, wanted to get something to fill the stomach. Went here because it beat Johnny Rockets.

We ordered two plates, of two entree meals. Each meal was about $12 for a small plate of food. 

One plate was fried rice (bits of egg, brown rice, Lima beans), veggies (squash, baby corn, broccoli, carrots) and sweet and sour pork (deep fried pork bits with onions and peppers stir fried). The food was all flavorless, the fried rice was dry, the pork was sweet but Lots of batter, and the portions were small. 

Second plate was chow mein noodles (bland noodles with, celery) orange chicken (lots of breading but sweetness was good) and ginger chicken and mushroom ( not enough flavor and minced/shredded chicken). Not much food and very bland. 

I get they're trying to make back their money they probably invested initially... But at least TRY to make your food decent... Even compared to panda express it was bad... And I very much dislike P. E."}
{"text":"Wanted to grab quick dinner. Ordered 2 item combo with half noodles and half fried rice.  

Noodles: bland so don't forget the hot sauce...

Rice: was pretty good as is, but can be a bit on the bland side (I tend to like my food a bit bland) 

Orange chicken: I actually thought it was pretty good. Tasted very fresh.  I think one of the better fast food orange chicken.

Kung pao chicken was eh...didn't care
Much for it.  The sauce just didn't taste right.  It was bitter I thought. 

Overall, it fast food, if you don't expect gourmet meal...you will enjoy it!"}
{"text":"A very poor imitation of Panda Express. Portions are small also. They were nearly out of everything. The staff from Nathans was also running the cash register at Pan Asian. I assume they share ownership. Would not recommend this place at all based on the quality, quantity and cost. You are better off spending your money elsewhere."}
{"text":"My visit was decent and staff was friendly and food was fresh and seasoned well.  I was hungry for veggies and this hit the spot.  Other reviews issues weren't evident in my visit and I would say for Vegas the prices were reasonable.  I would eat here again based in this visit."}
{"text":"this joint is way too pricey! $11 for 2 items! and side of veggie $8..?!? would have been okay if they give good amount/portions of food. They're employee has no personality at all..!! - so not worth of my visit.!!"}
{"text":"Tasted like frozen TV dinner food.  Expensive and inedible. The only thing that tasted like Chinese food was the soy sauce.  They used chicken nuggets for Kung pao."}
{"text":"If I could give this good and service-5 stars I would. Hard overbooked meat.. breaded chicken in the king pap.. just crap.. I'd advise people to stay away. I would think the Flamingo would have better quality control in the food court.."}
{"text":"This was unequivocally the worst food I've ever eaten. The rice had no flavor, the chow mien was mushy, the orange chicken was old and soggy, and the sweet and sour pork was inedible. The food make feel feel sick for about 6 hours. I don't understand how they stay in business. Stay away!"}
{"text":"Wouldn't recommend. the food here is bland and soggy! you might as well go to panda express lol"}
{"text":"NO. Just NO. They dont even deserve 1 star.

Located in the food court inside Mandalay Bay, I went here for lunch on a tuesday after going to Shark Reef in the morning. There was a convention so the food court was packed. All the food stands had long lines while Pan Asian Express only had a couple people in it. I didnt want to wait so Chinese food it was. 

I got the 2 entree meal which came with a side. I got Orange Chicken and Sweet n Sour Pork.  The side was the fried rice.

Oh man. Where do I start. I guess there was a reason why there were only two people in line. This place sucks! The Orange Chicken tasted more like pink chicken meaning that I dont think it was cooked all the way. The tempura breading was a bit thick. Maybe thats why it didnt cook all the way. The Sweet n Sour Pork tasted more like chicken than pork. Again it had a thicker than normal tempura batter and the meat inside was tiny. The Fried Rice was way too salty. I think they put too much soy sauce or something. 

I ended up eating only a quarter of my food and just threw the rest away. I didnt even want to bother with returning it and getting a refund although I should have. Total I paid was 12 bucks and change which included a soda with no refill. The soda was the only thing that allowed me to wash down any traces of horrible crap that I ate. As im doing this review, im happy to report that I didnt get food poisioning. I wouldnt be surprised if my fortune cookie said \"That was not chicken\".

Service was decent. I got my food and paid. The lady that attended to me was nice. Its just that the food was atrocious. I hope these guys are not affiliated with the actual Pan Asian restaurant located off of Durango Dr in the Lakes area.

In closing, DO NOT EAT HERE! If you are going to pay for overpriced food, go to any of the other food stands. Im sure pizza, subs, and burgers will taste way better at those venues.

{"text":"If I compared this one to Panda Express, it's a lot worse.

It had very limited options most of which weren't so good.

The sweet and sour pork was OK."}
{"text":"Wasn't too hungry to go to a buffet with friends so I joined one friend to the food court - I wish I spent $25 at the buffet other friends went to or just opted for the $7 Subway sandwich my other friend got at the food court with me. Instead I wasted $19 on a bowl of Orange Chicken and one Blue Moon from here.

No where close to Panda Express's food - the veggies looked good as well that I had along with my white rice and orange chicken, but they were not tasty. Chicken was kind of soggy and not very flavorful as well. I didn't even finish my small, over priced bowl. Do not recommend!"}
{"text":"Service was fine, but oh my, the food was horrendous. I initially thought it would be something similar to Panda Express- but the quality here is beyond average. I should not have ordered when I saw the mixed vegetables looking not fresh. I still went ahead and ordered food. The moment I sat down on the table with my food, I couldn't stop staring at the fries rice that seemed so old that it was all clumped together. Shrimp fry batter tasted just salty, the beef and broccoli tasted salty as well as if they were trying to cover not fresh ingredients. i only finished half of my food. I wont be back here for sure."}
{"text":"I don't like leaving bad reviews, but I just hope the owners take it as constructive criticism. My orange chicken was okay. About half of my chow mien was dry, and almost crunchy like. It was not worth the $13 I payed. And I ordered food around 6pm, so I would have expected it to be more fresh. I was excited expecting good quality at least like Panda Express considering that it's in the Manalay bay but no..."}
{"text":"It should def be closed. But unfortunately, for those attending a convention, this joke of an establishment is still open. 

I am sad I just wasted $12 on a poorly copied version of Panda Express. I get it, the costs will all be expensive here in Vegas but the portions are just sad. And the meat is dry, the veggies taste depressed and who can't properly cook rice?? The rice was mushy, too much water or hadn't been cooked long enough. 

The people working could def afford a smile but probably not when they hate their job. Stingy portions. Overpriced. I hate their font choices. 

Only thing you should get here is beer."}
{"text":"Ordered a VEGETABLE spring roll & fried rice. Got up to my room, took a bite, looked inside the roll and noticed a MEATY SUBSTANCE. Thank goodness I was sober enough to realize so I could spit out the gross pink goo before I swallowed. I've been vegetarian for over 10 years. It was horrible!!! Even if I ate meat it I wouldn't recommend whatever was inside that thing- it was gooey, pink and unrecognizable. Totally gross."}
{"text":"Omelet from 7-11 is quite good though $12, making me wonder if the buffet would have been a better value.

Lunch was not so good: 2 stars; sufficient but not satisfying and I wouldn't repeat."}
{"text":"I used to eat at this place and it was the best, fresh food and quality, you'll order N they'll prepared it at the moment, so sad  is this bad now"}
{"text":"This place makes Panda Express seem like high quality fine dining. Probably the most bland, tasteless chowmein I have ever had. Even soy sauce couldn't help it. Server had to dig around to find chicken in the kung pao dish. To top it off, it was about $10 more than Panda Express would have been for the same dishes. Very disappointed, won't be back, avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"Worst food I've ever eaten!!  If I weren't so hungry I'd have returned it all and not cared about the price spent.  Cold, flavorless, dried out meat..how does this place pass a health inspection with food so cold?!?!  How is this place even in the MGM??!!  Avoid at all costs!  There's another Wok restaurant in the Casino that for only slightly more is a million times better.  How do you spell disappointed??!!  YUCK!!!  If I could give it a zero star I would?!"}
{"text":"Food is mediocre and I thought it was a cheaper dinning option but I paid $17 for a dish that's not that great. I'd choose elsewhere"}
{"text":"I'm visiting from California. And I staying at ballys casino and after a fun night out I saw there was a food court. And I came across pan Asian. And I had my self an omelette this morning. And the omelette was more then Amazing. Full of vegetables. It was perfect. Staff was friendly as well. I will be stopping by again once I visit."}
{"text":"The fried rice I thought was pretty good. The orange chicken could be more seasoned it was a little bland kind of like microwave orange chicken. But it was alright."}
{"text":"This place was horrible! Lo mein is just boiled noodles, no vegetables or flavoring. You're ordering spaghetti. Everything else is almost just as bland and waaaaaaaay over priced for such garbage. I don't understand why they're allowed business in the hotel, nevermind how they have any business at all!"}
{"text":"Disgusting food, tiny portions and rediculous prices. $30 for 2 horrible meals, are you kidding. Go find a panda do not waste your money here"}
{"text":"1 item veggie with steamed rice, $9.98 before tax. Wasn't sure if the dude was trying to rip me off. Price didn't match what was posted on the menu board. 

Too tired to argue. Broccoli was rancid. Was yellow and tasted bitter. The canned veggies which were a part of the mix, the baby corn, chestnuts, and bamboo were edible. Rice had too much water. Ate some threw out the rest. Consistent with the other reviews. Not all the orders are completely edible. Very greasy. Too much oil. They don't have enough training or consistency in the cooking process to manage this. 

Food quality not consistent. Americanized Chinese food. There isn't constant supervision here from somebody who cares or has good enough English to run the operation consistently. Some orders are good, some are inedible. Crap shoot if you have a good experience or not. Matches the overall management quality of the other restaurants in Ballys. They pay low and manage the expenses from there with accountants."}
{"text":"Places like this make me sick. They stay in business only because of their proximity to the convention center and they had the shortest line of all of the places in the food court. No wonder. They were out of steamed rice during the lunch rush. Hahaha. Crappy food. Cold, soggy and tasteless. Do not eat here."}
{"text":"WORST CHINESE FOOD EVER!  This place deserves no stars, but that's not possible.  My first sign this place was horrible should have been the lack of people in line during the noon lunch hour.  The chow mien tasted like it was just thawed and placed in the bowl being served without actually warming it up.  The orange chicken had one piece of actual chicken, the rest of it was batter nuggets with orange sauce.  There's a PANDA EXPRESS right across the street.  Take the walk, you'll be glad you did.  I'm definitely checking Yelp reviews from now on."}
{"text":"Food was disgusting. The service was good but it didn't make up for the food being gross. The spring roll was good but I couldn't even eat my entre."}
{"text":"I wouldn't say this is terrible... But overall a bit bland. Serving size isn't huge (which is ok by me). Quick and easy when you're staying at MGM and don't want to go far."}
{"text":"My friends and I came here after the day club and were starving. There were many options at the food court but once I had a delicious bite of the orange chicken sample, I knew I definitely wanted to eat here! I got the 2 entrees and 1 side combo with orange chicken, mushroom chicken and half white rice/half chow mein and danggg was I satisfied! I love Panda Express but this place topped Panda Express by twentyfold! The food tasted like authentic Chinese food, something that my grandma would cook for me. Really good food for food being served in a food court. It was also decently priced for the amount of food they gave us (around $8 for the combo) and especially because things in Vegas can be so pricy. A good place to go to satisfy your Chinese food craving :)"}
{"text":"Good food,  friendly customer service,  with decent strip prices. With all the ridiculous pricing at the strip you cant go wrong with this place. It's like a higher end panda express and everyone on staff was extremely courteous.  Definitely recommend this place to anyone who needs a quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"Pan Asian Express is the generic version of Panda Express.  Think about that for a minute.  Panda Express already provides greasy mediocre Asian inspired food.  This Pan Asian Express provides absolutely the same thing.  Somehow it manages to be worse tasting, even greasier, and staler from the heatlamps than its genuine counterpart.  I'd advise you to pass on this one."}
{"text":"Sunday, 12:00pm... nothing prepared, waited 20 minutes for my food, workers looked like they have hangovers... 

food is okay...

1 star...."}
{"text":"If I could give no stars I would!!! Run run run away!!!! They have NO variety! The meat, well Unless you want to spend your time in the bathroom after, do not even get any type of meat! It was the worst Chinese food place I have ever had!"}
{"text":"Entrees served in very small portions. Fried rice way too salty. Don't just get samples on the entrees. Make sure you try the sides too."}
{"text":"Cheap Asian food, doesn't taste original , and it was cold. It's ok if your really hungry and don't want to leave he hotel but it would be my last resource"}
{"text":"Sad!  Though fried rice was fresh, chow mein, Ginger Chicken, & Crispy \"Cashew\" Chicken were OLD and Dry!  Then, when asking about a cup of ice water, I'm told they only have soda water.  Huh?  I'm not shelling out $3.45 for a regular (read: SMALL) soda/soft drink - probably without a refill anyway!  Poor customer service, old/dated food, and attitude from the cashier!  NOT coming back here.  (Can I give 1/4 Star???)  AND, when almost done with \"Cashew\" Shrimp - that only had peanuts! - there was a half of a cooked toothpick!!!  (I HOPE it wasn't a used Sample Toothpick!)  :-(  1/4 Star is now downgraded to officially ZERO STARS!"}
{"text":"This pan asian and the food court at mgm  is the ok  and the food is good. it is the 3.0 stars pan asian."}
{"text":"This place has the best food I have had in a food court. It is also better than Panda Express. It has nice workers also great food.  This is at the Mandalay Bay food court near the Convention center which is at the end of the hotel. If you stay at the hotel you walk all the way past border grill and then walk farther than you will find it in the middle of the food court. I have been here many times I always ask for beef and broccoli or broccoli and beef. I do not like the sides so I ask for two servings of broccoli and beef. If you don't want to have asian food I would not go here but I love it. Also you get a paper on the trays for every restaurant except Subway. You will find coupons for the restaurants including Pan Asian express. Also look for the coupons in the pictures I will post. But there is none for subway. I hope you try out Pan Asian express. Also if you stay at a MGM resort you can change it to your  room."}
{"text":"Worst Food in Las Vegas! Uncle Bens Rice and over cooked noodles.

No flavor for $11.89 

Terrible Terrible Terrible"}
{"text":"Wish I could give it no stars at all, this has to be the worst place in this entire hotel area if not on the entire strip. The lady asking us what we wanted was rude, talked really quiet and aggressive, like we're just more money talking. Then the food, we went there around 5:30 pm, and most of the things was already gone, and what was left didn't appeal to us whatsoever. I got the orange chicken, other then the chicken I didn't like anything else. The rice seemed way to dry to me. My husband got broccoli beef, with mushrooms. The broccoli looked 5 days old, the mushrooms seemed like a piece of bread with some sauce over them and the meat was way to chewy, felt like gum. He thought the rice was okay, wouldn't recommend this place to anybody at all, not going here again either."}
{"text":"Stay away from this place, my husband and I thought it would be good since it looks like Panda Express!  But OMG no it tasted gross, no flavor at all, we ordered one meal no drink and it was close to $20! so expensive and not worth the price at all!! Go somewhere else. You will regret it trust me!!!"}
{"text":"Food over priced, mediocre quality, but very inconsistent with food quantity. Some plates with twice as much noodles as the next. Look elsewhere or you will likely regret spending $17-$18 for a small mediocre meal."}
{"text":"The food had too much sugar, the chow mein did not really have any taste to it, the orange chicken was okay but the garlic chicken with
mushrooms was weird.   I did not finish my food, one of things saving this place was that it did have coke there.

When I arrived the lady that served my food was too busy talking to her employees and they had to stop her for her to even acknowledge me.

Not coming back, I will probably go to McDonalds next door in the food court."}
{"text":"Two stars since I actually finished my plate. I was starving and looking for a quick greasy Americanized Chinese fast food experience and unfortunately even with the bar set appropriately low, this place still disappointed. Go to Panda Expeess by Harrah's to get your fix."}
{"text":"I typically do not give one star reviews. However Pan Asian deserves it. It was a very disappointing lunch stop at Mandalay Bay. 
We were roaming around Mandalay Bay on Christmas and Ian suddenly uttered the dreadful words \"I am hungry\". Most of the restaurants at Mandalay Bay hadn't opened yet so we proceeded to their food court before he turned cranky. We got Ian a pizza and the Mrs settled on grabbing her lunch at this place.

After placing her order (Broccoli Beef with rice) and paying close to $11, she received the smallest portion of a lunch plate ever at any restaurant. The quantity of food is probably less than half a panda express lunch. You would have to order two portions at $22 to appease your hunger.

The food itself was doused in soy sauce with minimal quantities of beef and broccoli (see for yourself in the picture). Offerings in their menu are very limited as well.

I do not recommend to rely on this restaurant for your dining needs."}
{"text":"In the food Mecca that Las Vegas is, if I pay $15 for a bowl of noodles it better be at least comparable to any establishment in the area. I only went here out of desperation but oh boy would I never again. I got the orange chicken and chow mein and both were much too salty. The chow mein was slimy, and I don't know if that was the sauce or what."}
{"text":"Doesn't even deserve one star. Health code violations like you wouldn't believe and less than enthusiastic workers."}
{"text":"Asked for the ginger chicken and wasn't paying attention when they were serving it. I got about 3 pieces of chicken for my bowl and the rest was veggies. And it tasted like shit. Don't even ask for their hot sauce cause it's not even hot. I threw it out and ordered somethings else from the food court. Save your $15 for a bowl and a bottled water for something better."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst Asian I had in past 25 years. Tasteless , rubbery chicken is what I got and the noodles were oily as hell. I got a headache after eating this garbage. Avoid at all cost. No wonder I didn't see any line on a Saturday afternoon. Disgusting waste of money."}
{"text":"Are you dying of hunger? Is the MGM Grand's food court the nearest solution to curb the growling from your starving belly?

You may step into the food court and Pan Asian Express may catch your eye. \"Wow, I could really go for some Chinese food,\" you think to yourself. The name might even remind you of something similar, say...Panda Express?

Well, if you've gotten that far, then S-T-O-P. Take a step back. And go to McDonald's instead.

This establishment is NOT worth your time, stomach space, nor money. You are paying for tiny portions of poor quality food. And while I wouldn't expect food court quality to be the greatest nor Vegas prices to be the cheapest.. this was just disappointing on a whole new level.

A single entree, single side bowl was nearly $10 and was TINY - maybe barely enough for a child. I got my bowl with mixed vegetables and broccoli and beef, and while it was edible, it was not satisfying in the least. A double entree, single side plate is much more worth the price at $11, but still definitely not worth the purchase at all. 

In short, make the short walk to somewhere else on The Strip - or else you'll very likely regret it!"}
{"text":"Grabbed a quick bite before my show for Copperfield. The food tasted as good as the show.... very mediocre and also pricey. 

Basically a knock off Panda Express but less quality than one and not as many selections and way more expensive than one. Beverages are expensive here too. There might be better options at the MGM food court."}
{"text":"Love the food here! The service is super awesome too. I came here after a long night out with some friends visiting out of town. I got a plate of fried rice and orange chicken and it was worth it, better than Panama express lol"}
{"text":"Went to PanAsian express after leaving a fancy Chinese restaurant at NYNY. Ordered a normal plate with noodles and orange chicken, the employee was nice enough to make fresh orange chicken (which tasted great, better than Panda!). The noodles were nice and hot and tasty. The employee also refilled our sodas for free. Overall I had a great experience, don't expect gourmet food, just solid Chinese fast food. 

I was very satisfied!"}
{"text":"Super Fail. 
Me No Lykee

They ran out of orange chicken. Took 20 minutes. 
No compensation either. 
Staff doesn't give a crap."}
{"text":"I don't even know how this place actually constitutes real food. Absolutely atrocious. Wasted of 15.00 for the most inedible food I have ever even attempted to eat. I'm pretty sure what I got (orange chicken and sweet and sour pork) was not even real meat. STAY AWAY."}
{"text":"I don't care how drunk you are. Avoid this place at all cost. It's gross, and expensive. 

Don't eat here. Don't eat here. Don't eat here."}
{"text":"Had the cashew shrimp with chow mein noodles. The noodles were plain and greasy. The shrimp was tiny cocktail breaded and tasteless. There were maybe three cashews. I threw it away and got a hotdog."}
{"text":"I wish I can give this Panda Express copycat a zero star...  for copying a successful chinese fast food chain they managed to get it all wrong.  Bad-tasting imitation of all the panda express dishes, constantly out of food evem during off times, double the price of panda express.  The only saving grace for them is perhaps the fortune cookie that comes with the meal.  At least that is still relatively crunchy and not stale.  Avoid if you can."}
{"text":"My friend and decided a bit hesitantly to try this out, Ya know its in a food court?!  I ordered the orange chicken with fried rice and she ordered the sweet and sour pork with chow mein.  Our meals were way better than we expected, my chicken was all good (no chewy pieces) fresh and the orange flavor was really good, the rice was also good. My friend really liked her meal as well.  We also had a coupon and USED it. and the lady who waited on us was very nice. 

Im not sure what other people are complaining about?? Especially the price, it says it RIGHT there in FRONT of you BEFORE you order! LOL - like they are getting a surprise, yes if you order A LOT its going to cost A LOT!!!   Its VEGAS! and HELLO they give you coupons EVERY time you eat in the food court right ON the trays! they are Buy One get the other 1/2 OFF. - USE THEM. really not sure why folks are thinking they are getting GOURMET Asian food, in a FOOD COURT, in LAS VEGAS???   WTF back at y'all. 

Glad I didn't read the reviews before we ate here, it was one of the better things we ate, and the complainers would have turned me off.  

Looking at the reviews they all seem really outdated so maybe that's it and they have changed for the better???  plus one guy was reviewing the wrong location!!"}
{"text":"Came here to grab a quick bite and was sorely disgusted.

Pan Asian Express is no Panda Express. The food quality is WAY OFF.

We had the orange chicken and mushroom chicken. For both, I couldnt tell if the meat I was eating was fish, chicken, pork, or flour. Yes, it was that bland, and bad.

The fried rice was tasteless and hard. 

Also, service was terribe. We were overcharged by $10 for a $30 bill (not to mention overpriced), and thankfully we checked the receipt and requested for a refund.

Did not finish my food. Definitely not coming back."}
{"text":"In 5 years since ive been back here they have improve. Probably new ingredients and spices in their Chinese food cos it tasted very good. Most of their option are fried like spicy pao chicken they add the same chicken as for orange chicken. I noticed their kitchen is back of the pizza place maybe flamingo casino own the whole food court. 
Plus you don't have to add extra 1$ for shrimps like Panda Express. Portion isn't bad too. And nice to go box. The chow mein noodles is very good but a bit oily."}
{"text":"Not a bad lunch option, get 1, 2 or 3 entrees with a side of either fried rice or LoMein - Think Panda Express. This is straight  up a Panda Express type establishment.  We grabbed a quick lunch while at a conference in the MGM Grand.  It's not a bad option in the food court.  If you're hungry, you should get at least two items.  I got the beef broccoli and Tso Chicken.  You can also get the fried rice and Low Mein noodle if you want a taste of the two sides.  They serve beers too, if you want to treat yourself.  It did the job and for a lot less than the formal restaurants."}
{"text":"Disappointed. Came late around 7:30pm and they didn't have anything. Only 5 entree to choose from. Food has been there for awhile.. Don't recommend it"}
{"text":"The food is flavorless and the portions were average at best. It's like a knock off Panda Express."}
{"text":"You guys should be disappointed in yourselves. Pan Asian express should be named bland Asian express."}
{"text":"Hot ciao, and plenty of it at a reasonable price. It's a food court you get what you pay for it's fast and they're friendly."}
{"text":"If you're staying at the MGM and want real breakfast food, this is the place! For $10 you get an omelet with any additions to it. They offer broccoli, spinach, onions, sun dried tomatoes, regular tomatoes, cheese, bacon, etc.. I added a water bottle and it all came out to $11. Can't beat that in Vegas!"}
{"text":"One of the grossest food court items I've ever got anywhere. Even my husband wouldn't eat it, and he doesn't refuse food often.
Service was good. But our Beef and Broccoli  and Orange Chicken was like eating balls of deep fried paste dipped in the most bland sauce you can find. I tried to force it down because I hadn't eaten in a while but it was impossible. $10  2 item combo in the garbage. Even the egg roll got tossed after a bite from both of us."}
{"text":"Overpriced crap Asian food. Noodles had wayyyy too much garlic and the entrees weren't that great either. Better off eating McDonald's nearby."}
{"text":"I love they're costumer service! They're really amazing the lady who serves us (melody) she's really friendly. Love the orange chicken better than Panda Express."}
{"text":"Considering how much time I was set to spend here for my conference, it was a given that I'd end up trying a few of the eateries/restaurants MGM Grand has to offer.  However, I can't say I figured that would include two of their food courts offerings (review for Nathan's to come).  I have no one to blame but myself though - what was I thinking, bracketing my lunch break with sessions?  Hard to wander off when there's not much time to go very far...ugh.

Located inside MGM Grand's food court, Pan Asian Express is nothing special, to be entirely honest.  Essentially a nicer looking Panda Express, but more generic and without as wide of a variety to choose from.  That being said, what they do have (including Orange Chicken!) doesn't look too shabby.  What's more, the prices aren't egregious, which is nice since I didn't have a ton of alternatives...

After choosing the Vegetable Chow Mein as the \"base\" for my TWO ITEM COMBO (they also have plain rice, as well as fried rice), I opted to go with their Ginger Chicken with Vegetables and their Orange Chicken (of course, I had to!) over options like Vegetable Stir Fry, Chicken & Mushrooms, Sweet & Sour Pork, Egg Rolls, and Crab Rangoon.

All in all, while the food clearly didn't impress, it actually wasn't as bad as I had feared (which isn't saying much).  On the one hand, the Orange Chicken was meaty with a nice, citric flavor and the Ginger Chicken was a fried (though repetitive) surprise.  Yet, there were more minuses than pluses - the chow mein was gummy and bland, the Orange Chicken's batter was thick and soggy, and the Ginger Chicken was a bit salty.

Considering it's comparably priced to a regular mall food court (in SF, anyways), Pan Asian Express isn't awful if you want to save a few bucks without leaving the hotel.  However, I'd rather use the $16 I paid for my meal ($10.98) and a bottle of water ($3.48) on something more unique or Shake Shack across the street.  Unless you're virtually tethered to the conference center like how I was...ugh.

TWO AND A HALF STARS, but rounded down."}
{"text":"I made the mistake of not checking yelp before I ate here. I don't know what this is, but it's not good. I will not be eating here again. Even their soda wasn't good. Disappointed."}
{"text":"I've only had their breakfast, but it is so good!!! They have an omelet station. I get whole eggs with jalapeños, tomatoes, bacon and feta cheese. Yum! If you like spicy things you must try their omelets with their special red hot sauce, it is to die for! Enjoy :)"}
{"text":"This is a typical Chinese restaurant in Flamingo's food court that I happened to eat at when staying in the Flamingo's as I was too lazy to walk to the Panda Express on the strip. Price is pretty cheap with a two item combo a tad below $10. Food was very average but still very eatable. Giving it the food court handicap A-Ok should sum this place up."}
{"text":"Getting a quick bite to eat before the KA show here at MGM. Was not expecting anything great. Palatable, that was about it. It was not as bad as some of the reviews make it out to be."}
{"text":"Save your money, or give your $ but don't eat/take their food.

I won't feed this garbage to people.

Fried rice was so salty and over cook. Broccoli beef was burned and bitter, salty.

I was so hungry and I couldn't even eat this garbage"}
{"text":"Inside the Bally's food court.

Poor mans Panda Express (but double the price).

Portions are small and a two entree plate is $11.

Nothing special with the taste."}
{"text":"The food was not served hot and it had very little flavor. It might be the worst Chinese food I have ever had. There's nothing else to say."}
{"text":"11.95 for omelet with anything in it yet they still charge the same for plain scrambled eggs! It was terrible! I ordered bacon and got 2 for $3. I wouldn't be so picky about the pricing if it tasted half decent!"}
{"text":"This is soooooo Expensive and too small for a serving; 6 pcs shrimp and may be 200 grams of noodles. It is a clear rip off"}
{"text":"Decent Chinese fast food that is similar to Panda Express.  About what you would expect at a food court.  

The prices for the food entrees was a bit high.  The price for a bottle of beer was way too expensive.  Just get your alcohol at the casino while playing.

Good place for a quick meal.  I would stop by again.  I just would not buy beer."}
