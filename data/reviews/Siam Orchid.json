{"text":"My boyfriend introduced me to this place, and whenever we get a craving for Thai food we'll go here. 

It's a small, cute and clean restaurant and the service is polite. The food is so good. We always order the spring rolls as an appetizer and these things are like little fried packages of crack. The accompanying dipping sauce is to die for as well.

As far as entrees go, I haven't been disappointed with anything I've tried, which includes the \"mussaman curry,\" \"pahd woon sen\" (shrimp, chicken, mushroom, green onion and tomatoes w/ vermicelli noodles) and the \"pahd thai.\" My boyfriend always gets the chicken cashew which is also delicious. 

My favorite thing about their dishes is everything I've had tastes fresh, light and amazingly seasoned. We'll definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"Best Thai food I've found in Arizona. Everything that I've ordered there was good, but their Green Thai Curry is spectacular. They make it with the leaves of a citrus tree that gives it this very subtle, yet divine flavor I've not had before. Definitely recommend checking it out any time of day."}
{"text":"Truly enjoyed the amazing food at Siam Orchid! I was craving Thai Food and we drove over 20 miles to get here. The menu selections were very well written - and to our pleasure the appearance of each dish and the taste exceeded our expectations. A great place for authentic Thai."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Thai food restaurants. They serve this dish called Mussaman and it is great if you like chicken, potatoes, and coconut curry absolutely delicious! It is owned by a cute little older couple and they are so nice. They are the only one's that work there. The actual restaurant isn't extremely nice...light pink walls, fake flowers, buda...but the food and the people that own it are great. The first time I ate there I went back 7 days in a row because I liked it so much. The lady even gave me free coconut ice cream with sweet rice to try and that is by far the yummiest dessert ever! You will have to try this restaurant out."}
{"text":"In many ways it's a typical Thai restaurant.  The service was decent, although, we were the only ones in the restaurant so it was hard to have poor service.  For me the main issue was the price for the serving size.  If I wanted the chicken/shrimp pad thai it's the same price as another menu item, the vegetarian pad thai.  The tofu was pretty hard and I know it can't be the same price for tofu as chicken and shrimp are.  It was 10.95 and the serving size was about a third less than what I have come to expect from other Thai restaurants in Gilbert, Tempe, and Phoenix.  Another site said 5 stars.  This place is just ok -- not spectacular; and, it's a bit pricey."}
{"text":"After dining at many Thai food restaurants throughout the valley, my boyfriend and I decided to try out this small eatery  that was close to home.  We tried some of our favorites; green curry and pad thai, which was ordinary at best (the chicken was dry and the dishes were overall tasteless)!  After dinner, we chatted for a few minutes, only to find the owner or manager (whoever he was) standing by the front door announcing that they were closing.  It was 10 minutes before 9pm.  That was strange since the hours posted said they were open until 9.  Translation: get the hell out; we were appalled!  Needless to say, we won't be back, but still wondering why they were playing music fit for a mexican restaurant, not thai?"}
{"text":"Love the personal service and attention. The soups are outstanding, Yum Neu salad is hot and awesome. 10+ from me."}
{"text":"Our family loves this place- it's home style cooking, and home style service.  The family that owns the establishment is very, very friendly, and are the type that remember your name, your favorite food, and your kids.  

Don't expect super-fast service- expect a place that gets to know you.  

The veggie egg rolls, nam sod, and yum nuea are our favorites.  They even have made special child-friendly soups and dishes for our toddler.  It's not  a fancy place, but if you want good food, friendly service, and a place to relax and stay a bit, go here.  Their take-out is good too- just give a good 20 minutes before you go to pick up."}
{"text":"This restaurant is CLOSED!! In fact, the entire mall strip is a ghost town."}
{"text":"Tonight we tried Siam Orchid for the first time, take out.  It was good. Not fantastic, but good quality ingredients. 

The Yellow curry dish was good, but not enough coconut milk in the sauce- which makes it so rich & yummy. Mango Sticky Rice is always my fav! Their Mango had a couple darker brown spots : / Coconut Sticky rice was delightful!

Being that the ingredients were good quality, I will give them another try."}
{"text":"Support small business and try this Thai restaurant. BEST ribs and crying tiger steak...actually everything we've tried there is great!!! Very friendly owners, love every dining experience we've had here!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. I have Pad Thai most times I go, but their Cashew Chicken is also tasty. Always finish it off with sticky rice."}
{"text":"We have tried several thai places over the years but none come anywhere to the quality of food you'll get here.  They have the best egg rolls known to man. If you are a fan of any type of white fish the number 52 is by far the most tasting and satisfying entrée you will ever try.  Ah who am I kidding? I have never tried something that I do not like. I would recommend this place to anyone and everyone that is the least bit curious about thai food. Oh I almost forgot desert. There isn't that many choices but quality over quantity any day. The mango and sweet rice is simple yet amazing! The owner and his wife are the only 2 employees and they are some of the most inviting and pleasant people you will ever meet! All - in - all this is one of my favorite restaurants of all time."}
{"text":"More traditional/authentic than most other area Thai restaurants, this neat establishment pleased our respective palates. She had the gaeng kraw-ree and I the char steak on bed of greens. Both were delectable and the service was welcoming and pleasant. Given that it is run by a spousal team, the pace was relaxed, but acceptable (we don't care to rush through meals). Ingredients were fresh, authentic and very tasty. Each of us opted for the additional \"combination plate\",which for just a dollar was a wonderful appetizer. Recommended."}
{"text":"I just recently tried Siam Orchid for lunch...I had been craving Thai and was going to go to Yupha's, but wanted to support a local business.  I went there for lunch during the week and there just a couple of other people in there.  The service was speedy.  They were super nice and I really, really, really wanted to love it and I was so excited to try this place!  I had read reviews prior to going.  I ordered a beef dish with mint (cilantro), onions and lime.  Within a couple of minutes it arrived.  The portion was teeny compared to the triple portion of rice that arrived with it (read:  3/4 plate rice, 1/4 of place beef on bed of lettuce).  I thought that was strange as most asian restaurants only serve about a cup of rice with their meals and if you want more, you need to ask for it.  Well, the beef was cold. Not quite lukewarm.  It was tough and leathery and almost difficult to chew.  The spices were Eh.  The overall flavor was fine, but nothing exciting.  I didn't even feel that it was freshly cooked, maybe just warmed up.  I really wanted to like them and so asked for a green curry to go so that I could try it at home (and so that they could redeem themselves).  They left the kitchen door open and so my suspicions were confirmed as I watched from my seat as my curry was warmed in the microwave.  I am UBER disappointed.  Just tried the curry and it is also Eh.  The chicken is not moist and flavorful and is almost a bit tough - prob from the microwave.  I say, give it a try if you must or to support your local business, but there are better Thai restaurants out there. Sorry!"}
{"text":"I am a Thai food novice, having discovered its delights only a few short years ago.  I cannot, therefore, make grand pronouncements about the authenticity of the food at Siam Orchid nor can I make a convincing case comparing the food here to other Thai restaurants.  Instead, I have to speak to what I know; the food here is fantastic!

Let's start with appetizers.  My first inclination is to try the crab puffs since they are reminiscent of so many much more familiar Chinese restaurants.  They are good -- better than most -- but not stellar.  The next time, I try the Satay and discover that, well, I apparently don't like Satay.  The next time, I finally hit solid gold.  Their thai egg rolls are perfection in tiny packages and the sweet sauce that accompanies it is likely the best sauce I've ever had in any dish, anywhere.  You could eat these as dessert, they are so good.  I'll admit that I was very surprised since I've never been a fan of any kind of rolls at any Chinese restaurant.  These are in their own league.

Then we move to the entrées.  I tried quite a few of their dishes and they were all good, but in the end, I keep coming back to their Mussaman Curry.  Simply put, it's fantastic.  That simple dish has earned a solid place in my list of five best dishes, in any cuisine, that I've ever had in my life.  I'm drooling just thinking about it.  It's also surprisingly good re-heated the next day.  I just mix it with rice and pop it in the microwave until it's hot and that's all it needs.  Notably, it's spicier the next day.  Maybe because some of the water has evaporated off, leaving a more concentrated sauce?

Random note: another review mentions mixing the curry with rice as if it was a shameful act.  Is that not how you are are supposed to eat curry?  It works for me.

Finally, let's talk about the service.  This is not a place to go for a quick bite.  If you have movie plans for after dinner, then make sure you allocate twice as much time as you'd think you would need.  Meals at Siam Orchid happen at a leisurely pace.

I'm the type of guy that would give a restaurant 1 star just because of slow service but I'm perfectly okay with it here.  Why?  Think of it this way; at most restaurants with slow service, the reason can be traced to some high school or college aged kid who just doesn't care, one way or another.  At Siam Orchid, the service is slow because they take their time to make sure everything is right.  Plus, stopping to chat with the many (many) regulars takes even more time.  Sit back, relax, and enjoy the delicious food.  Just make sure to get it as take-out if you are in a hurry."}
{"text":"Still one of my favorite places to eat in the Valley.

I enjoy Siam Orchid slightly more than Wild Thaiger, which is also excellent.

Try Siam Orchid.....you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I've driven by for years and just never been in. Today we decided to try Siam. I really liked it. The atmosphere is cheerful and homey in a genuine sort of way. We each had a lunch special and liked them both. While we were there a man came in and knew exactly what he wanted. I'll try that next time, duck curry and mint lemonade. I had the yellow veg curry. Very fresh, a little spice and flavorful. Even at pm this place has regulars."}
{"text":"Had the crispy duck with curry sauce.  Asked if they could kick it up with some peppers.  They were only too happy to oblige.  The duck was excellent and prepared on site.  The fat had been rendered out in the cooking process making it a lot lighter than the typical Chinese duck you get in some Chinese restaurants after the duck was probably originially prepared in Asia Foods, Park and Shop or the other Chinese grocery on Payne/E 30th.  The sticky rice and mango were also quite good.  And they have a decent slection of beers including Singha.  The people working there could not have been any nice."}
{"text":"Owners couldn't be nicer and more attentive. I ordered for takeout the Tohm Kah Guy soup and it was one of the best I've ever had. The restaurant wasn't very busy for a Saturday night but is clean, quiet and easy to find.  I witnessed several 'regulars' with the staff and it was nice to see the banter between them. It seemed like a heartfelt exchange.

Only words to the wise are:
-order ahead if doing takeout. Took almost 45 mins when I did a walk-in order.
-I like spicy and thier 'medium' spicy has a major kick. You've been warned."}
{"text":"Place was pretty dead, only 2 other parties of people. Excellent service, but aside from the appetizer of spring rolls(which were delicious), food was very mediocre. The pad thai was a big pile of barely spicy noodles, chicken and shrimp- no bean sprouts or vegetables. Hubby got a basil chicken dish which he said was ok, but left him still hungry. Neither of our dishes came with rice. We just weren't impressed with the food, but our go-to Thai place, Siam Thai, is run by a family from thailand, so we are a bit spoiled."}
{"text":"I love Thai, this is a small place with delicious authentic Thai food, visited again today for an excellent lunch of drunken noodle.  I'd recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for amazing Thai food in Gilbert!  The gentleman that owns it is always very kind. I will be back again!"}
{"text":"This place is totally awesome.  The food is good and very traditional.  It's a mom and pop and the owners are very nice and the service is great.  I was tempted to them 4 stars because of their extremely high prices, but I guess I will just give you a warning on that.
I've only been once, my wife had pad thai and I had the grilled steak meal (if I remember correctly crying steak or something similar).  I will definitely end up going back.  I have actually been to Thailand so I can vouch for their authenticity. The flavors are not tamed down too much for Americans.  I would recommend trying this place out, if your wallet can handle it."}
{"text":"Siam Orchid makes some of the best Thai food I've had, and I'll definitely return for more.  Fresh, delicious food and great service.  

Tried the Thai Style Basil (Chicken), Pataya Spaghetti and the Fisherman's Feast, and each was delicious.  Both the spice and the flavorful sauces made each dish unique and tasty.

The Siam Rolls were also crispy and full of veggie flavor, and the chili sauce was a nice compliment.

I highly recommend Siam Orchid. See photos for the dishes."}
{"text":"This is a hidden jewel.  The food is great and the Thai curry dishes are incredible, but the best this about this place is the Coconut Ice cream and the mango and sticky rice. This place is a great place to eat."}
{"text":"Had the massaman curry with chicken and it was excellent!! I highly recommend this place - some of the best Thai I've had in Cleveland. Extensive menu with lots of delicious-sounding options; it was hard to choose. I will definitely be back for more. Service was great, as well. It's unfortunate that the location is kind of obscure at the back of a shopping plaza, but it's a great hidden treasure if you find it!"}
{"text":"My family and I seated ourselves once we entered the restaurant. It was open but there was no one around. Until a man came out from the kitchen. I think he was the owner and the only cook today. So he did everything from memorizing our orders without writing it down, like I wouldn't be able to memorize 14 orders (included drinks) lol

It took 30 mins to have our first order which was #11 - Tom Yum Seafood Soup. Hey it was worth the wait. The soup was spicy but delicious.

Then followed by the orders of rice, steak, #3 bbq chicken with peanut sauce, chicken, thai jerky and pad thai.

Everything was so good!

Especially the 2 orders of dessert of Sticky Mango Rice"}
{"text":"For a simple restaurant in a strip mall this place is very good. We ate there last night, I had a very good curry, my wife had a shrimp plate she did not offer to share. My son loved the chicken satay and my daughter was happy with shrimp in a blanket. Definitely worth a return visit."}
{"text":"The owners are indeed a mom and dad operation, and at one point their daughter was a server/cashier nearly 5 years ago, the last time I was there.  The decor is lovely, with a very light pink coloring on the walls, and some bolder Thai decorations in the center rear of the restaurant.  I bring up the 5 years because after I ordered my favorite roast duck curry incarnation, pin poy brought out her husband ( sorry, name escapes me ) and said I knew he was going to order this dish!  We shared some nice laughs, caught up, she explained about the only change I noticed, which is that the eastern wall is covered with drawings from the children of her customers.  With anyone that oozed a hint of smarmy character it wouldn't work, but these two are so genuine that it's very endearing.

I wrote all that because I do think that a rating reflects your overall experience including service vs reasonable expectations.  I had the everlastingly popular and delicious roast duck curry, which had a good portion of sliced duck, cherry tomatoes, pineapple, grape in a red curry sauce garnished with mint on top.  I've eaten probably at a dozen thai restaurants in the valley and about the same in SoCal- in terms of authenticity, flavor, and even presentation, Siam Orchid is your standard bearer.  If I could give it 6 stars I would."}
{"text":"So... We moved to the area & really wanted to like this, our closest Thai restaurant. We tried it because of the awesome reviews, but honestly - I'm not really sure where they came from. We ordered curries for takeout and the food looked *nothing* like it does on the website -- online photos boast a variety of vegetables in delicious-looking traditional curry. The green curry I received looked like split pea soup, tasted okay at best, and the veg were crunchy, undercooked, and there was little variety (the only veg were cauliflower - which I've never even seen in Thai curry - some cabbage, and carrots. Online pics show red pepper, broccoli, etc.). Disappointing."}
{"text":"The best Thai food I have ever had hands down. Everything tastes so fresh! I rarely write reviews, but this place deserves it. I am very picky with my food. I have also tried most Thai restaurants in the Chandler, Gilbert, Mesa area. This places tops them all. And the service is very friendly. I order from here about once a week. Try the veggie spring rolls, these are not your average spring rolls!"}
{"text":"My wife and I absolutely love this restaurant.  We always leave with a contentment that one rarely finds in a western style restaurant.  The owners are Thai immigrants and know what Thai food is supposed to taste like.  Then the two dishes that I can't recommend more are the Siam Toast and the Mango Sweet Rice dessert.   Absolutely marvelous.

I forgot to mention that we drive 12 miles past other Asian restaurants, specifically to eat here."}
{"text":"Service is a little slow sometimes but very relaxed.  Food is very good and the combo for lunch is very creative and tasty.  My wife and I like a lot of their dishes but I have to go back each time and have their Yellow Curry Chicken.  It's great!
If you need a quick/fast food place then go to the burger joint.  I do recommend this place for their food."}
{"text":"It started out as a 4 star due to the dining room being a bit warm. However, Our server quickly adjusted the temperature to our comfort level! ^_^ Khap Khun Ka

Food was delish!

Service was prompt, friendly, and attentive.

Music was proper volume. We appreciated the fact we were able to have a conversation without yelling to be heard. 

A mum and pop shoppe near old town Gilbert.

Sure! The decor is not swanky or mod. But the quality of food, portion of food, the price you are charged, and warm service... I'll take that anytime over a really awesome decor with mediocre service, and over priced dishes! :)

We'll be returning soon!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times and have been quite content with the food.  Nothing out of this world special, but always consistent and tasty.  The service is always prompt and friendly and the prices are about average.  What Siam Orchid needs to work on is their takeout.  It is almost like they have one quality of food for dine-in customers, and a completely different quality for take out.  We placed a simple order last night for two Pad Thai dishes and an order Bangkok fried rice on the way home from work.  We were quoted 15 minutes for it to be ready, which was perfect because we were just getting off of 480 in N. Olmstead when we called.  The food was waiting for us when we got there (approx 12 minutes later) which seemed like a good sign because we didn't have to wait.  But when we got to my Mom's house a mere 2 minutes away, we were very disappointed in what we pulled out of that brown bag.  Each dish was so completely underwhelming I couldn't believe it.  Everything was dry, dry, dry.  The Pad Thai looked like plain noodles with some chicken and shrimp tossed in it.  There was hardly any sauce or flavor and the noodles were clumped together in chunks.  It seriously looked like it had been sitting in that bag for over an hour.  The fried rice was the same.  The rice appeared to be reheated and the chicken was so shriveled it looked like jerky.  Just not good people.  When I first started going to Siam Orchid I was worried that the lack of business would start to hinder the quality of food.  It appears I was right in this assumption."}
{"text":"I love Thai food, and one of my favorite places to eat on the East Side is Mint Cafe. After a co-worker suggested Siam Orchid, I thought I'd check the place out, and imagine my joy when I discovered that this wonderful restaurant was also owned by the same family. The food here is wonderful, healthy and fresh. The service was great and the place is really clean and spacious (I dare say you could have a party of ten to fifteen and still have plenty of room.) I was very pleased and I even got to try a new dessert they're trying out (the Taro is tasty:) Their prices won't break your bank, and their food will titillate your taste buds; a winning combo. 

The Orchid is tucked away next to Mezzo in the Kensington Square complex on Center Ridge, and their signage is a bit hidden, but you won't be sorry if you look.

As a fan of this family's culinary skill, I heartily recommend this fine establishment. At this writing, it's only been their three weeks, but I really hope they'll be there for a long time to come bringing great Thai food to another part of N.E. Ohio."}
{"text":"Amazing shrimp and chicken fried rice, curry and drunken noodle. Sweet people! We drive 15 mins to go here when there are many Thai places closer."}
{"text":"Hubby and I tried this for lunch after the place we wanted to go was closed that day.  Did not like the Tom Kha soup or the Massuman Curry we ordered.  Something \"odd\" to our taste buds - can't describe it.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"I lived in Bangkok for 4 years. My wife is Thai. We both agree that this place is the most legit Thai food we have had in Phoenix and possibly State side. 

The poor review by Phil N. that states you cannot choose your heat level is not correct.  We order extra hot for us and no spice for our children. Real Thai places don't have  a 1-10 scale. Just let them know how you prefer it and it will be done. Also, what Phil N calls \"some old guy\" is the owner and chef and he personally handles all orders. It's hard to find service like that these days."}
{"text":"These are the nicest people and the best Thai food around. We take our family and friends there at least once a month. I highly recommend any of the curry dishes. There is more flavor there per square inch than any other food on the planet!"}
{"text":"Another $27 wasted trying to find a decent Thai restaurant around here. I have found two in the area that are good but this is not one of them. The dinner portions were tiny, the taste of the food was bland. One of the things we ordered was Pad See Ew which is one of our standards to order when we try a new Thai place. I have had this dish at many Thai restaurants so I don't know what this place was serving but it was not Pad See Ew. They also gave put the chili sauce spice on the side. Who does that? That is a huge part of the reason that it was tasteless. The other dish we ordered was beef with broccoli. The beef was tough. The food was also extremely salty. All around it was a horrible experience.

(Just realized when I went to post this that I actually did a review for this place in 2013. I gave it one star then, too. I wish I would have remembered so that I didn't waste more money here. The sad part is it hasn't improved any in four years.)"}
{"text":"Siam Orchid is tucked away in an obscure plaza in Westlake, and in all honesty had it not been for Yelp I never would have known it was even in existence.  Apparently, most of the rest of Westlake doesn't either as I was just there to pick up a take out order and there was only 1 table seated....on a Friday @ 7:00pm.  I was a bit nervous about that, but after having gotten home and tried the food I am confident in saying that the lack of customers isn't for a lack of quality to the food.  It was simply amazing.  Again - this time in capital letters - AMAZING!!!

I ordered 3 things:  the first being the garlic string beans, and I will now be craving the special house sauce for many other food stuffs in the future.  It was like a tangy garlic flavor hoisin sauce.

The second item was tom khar gai.  It was the first time I ever had it, so I have nothing to compare it to.  But based off of its own merits I have to say that I really liked it.  The chicken was tender.  The coconut milk broth was savory, and there was an ample amount of mushrooms and scallions floating around to make this soup a bit more filling then I anticipated.  This will definitely be something I order again when I return.

The third item I ordered was the larb gai.  I was hell bent on ordering an entree that they had listed as one their \"signature dishes\" and ended up settling for the larb gai after a bit of terpidation based on the description, but the adventerous eater in me won.  Thankfully, I was not in the least bit disappointed by my selection.  It had that wonderful balance of spicy, sweet, and sour that is supposed to be there in traditional Thai cuisine.

My only hope is that others end up finding out about this place and put butt's in their seats before they end up going out of business.  Maybe I'm way off base with that assessment, but again I was there at a prime time (Fri @ 7pm) and only 1 table was sat.  One other sign that worried me was that the bar area wasn't very well stocked, and that in my experience shows a place isn't making the money to do so.

It has a more upscale feel to it, and is in no way a typical take-out place.  Nice woodwork, and very bright atmosphere."}
{"text":"Came in on a Sunday night, there was one guy working so it was lucky for us he took us in but as the night went on he had to turn others away due to call in and delivery orders. It was unfortunate because the food was delicious and the man was kind. I would give three and a half however this app doesn't allow for that."}
{"text":"You've got to be kidding me with these 5-star positive reviews! (Yahoo locals has 9 of them!) The only thing I can agree with is friendliness.

The whole experience was like a scene from a bad horror movie, which only gets worse with each passing minute: Sunday night, 2 hungry people, takeout, empty restaurant, friendly woman at the counter... We didn't have a maniac chasing after us with a chainsaw, but by midnight I had to run outside of our house to throw this food in the trash can just to get rid of that annoying smell.

We ordered Sa-tay as an appetizer (#3), and my husband said that the chicken smelled like old socks. Well, it was a pretty strong statement, but I had to agree with him on that one. It indeed was horrible. It didn't even looked like it was recently prepared.

Mussaman Curry (#29) was the only dish we partially ate. We left out all chicken because it was just too tasteless... Actually, it looked like they pulled those chunky pieces of chicken from the fridge & nuked them for 2 minutes. We had to mix rice with their curry sauce, which was somewhat decent. Am I proud of this? The answer is no, but in our defense we were so hungry! Chicken Cashew (#32)  was just as tasteless as #29, and Stir Fried Shrimp (#47) is not worth mentioning about.

I feel bad writing such a harsh review, especially when the woman at the counter was very nice & friendly, but at the same time I cannot believe anybody would give this place 5 stars! I had better food at super cheap Chinese restaurants in NYC. Places where you prefer to order vegetable dishes because you don't know what kind of meat they may use when they sell the whole meal for $4.99 plus manage to make a profit.

Now I think that some of those enthusiastic yahoo reviews were fake. It is always suspicious when a person writes only 1 glowing review and nothing else."}
{"text":"The quality of our dinner was excellent. We had Tom Kha Ga soup that was very tasty. If you're not familiar with it - try it! FYI- not all of the roughage inside the soup is meant to be eaten, just to flavor. Cashew chicken and pad se ew were both very good an authentic. The mango sticky rice is always wonderful and a wonderful treat. 

I will say that if you like super saucy Americanized Thai, you might be disappointed."}
{"text":"I love Thai and this place has excellent food.  Had the Tom Yum soup and my mom had the green curry, both were delicious.  Friendly service, just be prepared for the possibility of a wait, as sometimes there's just one person doing the cooking and serving."}
{"text":"Ugh!  I'm a huge Thai fan and this place was completely icky.  What I love about Thai food is that it is flavorful.  

I ordered my usual that I get from every Thai restaurant I go to...just see my Yelp profile.  Their pad won sen was flavorless and had some of the weirdest ingredients.  I didn't want to finish it or take it home because it was so lackluster.  My friend ordered their garlic chicken which was just okay.  The amount of garlic they put in it should have been shared with my dish.  Yikes!

It was merely a place we chose randomly and I don't ever want to eat there again.  There are too many tasty Thai places in the valley to waste my time here again."}
{"text":"My husband and I both love eating here. Whenever we go the service is very good, the people are friendly and the food is delicious. We love their soups and entrees. You cannot go wrong. If you need less spice, tell them when you order."}
{"text":"Had a bowl of curry, very good curry but very small portion (small bowl) for $11 with a smaller bowl of white rice. I've given up on finding a good Asian restaurant (good food for reasonable price)."}
{"text":"I came in today with my little brother .. It was kinda of dirty.. Plates and food left on empty tables.. It seemed slow being we were the only ones there. And when we came we sat ourselves because no one was there to be found.. Moments later some old guy came out asked us to move tables because that table isn't prepped. So we did. I ordered drunken noodles(dinner item I guess) and my brother got a lunch special beef and broccoli. When they food came out they were the same portion because they were both on the same kind of plate. Except mine was double the price of my brothers.   unlike other Thai places you don't get to pick your spice level nor do you get to choose your meat. No one ever came back out besides when we first came in and paying. Our drinks were never refilled. Sad to say probably will never come back."}
{"text":"Not fancy, but very clean restaurant! very friendly owner, the food was really good. Spicy is really spicy so I would suggest to order accordingly to your preferences.
Enjoy!"}
{"text":"We went here for the first time this evening for dinner. The restaurant was open for Labor Day! We had the drunken noodles and massaman curry. Both were very flavorful and cooked to perfection! The service was quick and excellent as well. I'd recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for amazing Thai food in Gilbert!"}
{"text":"I had the basil chicken with plain rice, amazing flavor!! And the chicken coconut mushroom soup sooo tasty I could really taste the lime leaves and it had pieces of galangal root in there as well! And the drunken noodle was really the star of the show. I walked home after pickup and the food was still nice and hot. The owner is super friendly as well."}
{"text":"I've been going here for years and wish I didn't have to drive so far otherwise I may go more often. The food is delicious but definitely spicy. They don't ask you the spice level you prefer so if you want your food milder you'll need to remember to ask. The drunken noodles are amazing and so is the green curry. I also love the fish cakes and papaya salad however they were out of both tonight."}
{"text":"The food is good and the prices are reasonable. The staff is very friendly, but the service was a little slow. We were the only ones in the restaurant and the food took a little longer than I expected."}
{"text":"This is our \"go to\"when I don't want to cook. The food is consistent and the soup is the best ever. My husband and I have tried them all and there isn't a bad one. We really like the food from central Thailand-not too spicy and not too bland. The mango and sticky rice is the perfect end to a delightful dinner. This is a family owned and the owners are always on site."}
{"text":"Super tasty food, friendly service, and definitely worth a try! My fellow Yelpers did great In recommending it!"}
{"text":"Went to Siam Orchid for lunch because I had a Groupon.  It was fantastic.  We had the vegetable tempura - included sweet potatoes - just terrific, light and not greasy.  My friend had the mushroom soup and loved it.  I had the vegetable curry and ordered it spicy (extra spicy is also a choice).  It was perfect.  Thanks to Groupon I will be back."}
{"text":"Small mom and pop place with excellent food"}
{"text":"We come here quite a bit for lunch with my coworkers.  Their soups are to die for - I especially love the Tom Ka Gai (?? sp).  It's light and awesome and full of lemongrass goodness.  I enjoy several other dishes, the spicier the better, but unfortunately I have no idea what they are called - I just point at the menu (embarrassing!).

Everything is made to order and they have made several dishes not on the menu for others.  It's run by a lovely lady and her husband who does all the cooking so it can be pretty slow at times.  But if you're looking for fresh, authentic Thai it's definitely worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Perfection.

This place is small, impeccably clean, and there are cute drawings all over the walls of kids who have drawn a picture for the owner, Pinporn.

She is really personable, and the food is super fresh and nutritious.  (No heavy sauces, thank you!!)

I will be back for the homemade coconut ice cream.  ^^"}
{"text":"Siam Orchid is a hidden jewel. Wonderful, fresh Thai food served in a surprisingly upscale location. The Green Papaya Salad is wonderful and the Pad Thai the best I've had in Phoenix! The owners are natives of Thailand and the 60+ dishes on their menu come straight from family recipes. We have eaten at the Siam Orchid several times and have yet to try something we didn't love. Who says the east Valley doesn't know good ethnic foods?"}
{"text":"Don't understand all the positive reviews which is the reason I came. Poor old man working all by himself. The place was empty. The food was barely edible. Lucky for him I was starving. Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Great food! Authenic flavors. We have been coming here as a family for years. The kids always ask to come."}
{"text":"Got take out... It had been a while since I was here & wanted Yum Woon Sen & coconut soup... The yum is supposed to have ground pork & chicken pieces.  There was absolutely NO pork.  The coconut soup was just mediocre at best.  I really wanted to like it, as the older gentleman that runs it is very nice, but I won't be back."}
{"text":"For starters I should say that I travel all around the US and make an effort to eat Thai food in every city I visit and Siam Orchid is by far the best, best, best Thai restaurant I've been too.

It's not glam or glitz, it's more like if you had a Thai aunt that could run into the kitchen and cook you up some that tastes amazing.  The staff (a family owned business) is incredibly friendly and personable.  I've never seen more customers come in and get hugs.  Ask a couple of questions about Thailand and you'll be the next hug recipient when you come in.

The food, off the charts good.  It isn't often that you take a bite of something and wonder how they manage to make it taste so good.  Recipes, as described above, are a family secret that the owner Pimpom isn't sharing with anyone.

So if you're in the greater Phoenix area and looking for a Thai place I would recommend that you look no further, pop in and give Siam Orchid a try and you won't be disappointed.

Lastly, the review below is a shockingly different story from any experience I have had .. and I've eaten there more than 50 times."}
{"text":"So I actually have been to Thailand. 
Which I'm not sure Nicole G. can actually say she has.

I left my soul, tummy, and 2nd home there at Chiang Mai's Southern Gate. 

The Southern Gate, which is 1/4 the City of Chiang Mai, is the outdoor food market which sells the  farmer's daily harvests and houses the best  street food vendors in Northern Thailand. I had the honor of eating, Thai style, with some of the kindest smiling faces on Earth every day for 2 months.

I also toured the city with my  welcoming and accommodating friends  such places as the STRICTLY Thai neighborhoods, \"Farang\" party corridor, humble villages, and the Westernized utopia. I ate at a Thai BBQ w/ hotpot which was one of the most memorable eats of my life. I ate that whole city!

And I have to say,  the way that Siam Orchid reminds me of Thailand most is the FACT that there is no true  \"THAI FLAVOR\". In Thailand there are a myriad of tastes and flavors depending on where you go and who they market to. Perhaps most importantly, in Thailand you had Thai Chefs wanting to feature new and bold recipes to make themselves stand out from their competitors. Thai food was the fact that you ate it in Thailand with Thai ingredients.

What you get in the states is AMERICAN Thai food. You couldn't even get a major ingredient Kaffir limes here until recently. Really, who would want to eat frog and pumpkin soup or raw beef with spices anyway (other than me because they're both delicious!).

The owners of Siam Orchid are proof of the culinary creativity of the Thais. Their food is clean tasting with refined recipes featuring the flavors of traditional Thai spices such as ginger, tumeric, lemongrass,chili, and basil. They utilize their traditionally Thai ingredients to create you a Thai dish from Thais and they do a wonderful job of it!!! 

So 5 years from my last meal in Thailand, I can still experience a little of that place I miss so much, and it's in the smiles of Pimporn, her husband, and their delicious family recipes.


Our favorite dishes, try the: (7) Tord Mun Plah (appetizer fish cake) Panang w/ beef (spicy curry), Pad See Ewe w/Chicken (gravy noodle dish), Pahd Ga-Prao (chicken & basil- a Thai favorite), Thai omelet & Thai fried fish (can't get any more traditional than these two) and can't skip dessert- mango & sticky rice with homemade coconut ice cream on top!"}
{"text":"Always good food and quick service. Their Thai fried rice is so good. Must end the meal with the coconut ice cream.  Omg it's amazing!!!!  I always take my visitors here for consistently delicious Thai food. I highly recommend everyone to check this place out."}
{"text":"Best Vegetable Curry I've ever had! I opted for the yellow curry and was really impressed by how much flavor it had and just the right level of spicy. I wouldn't say it's the least expensive spot but worth a couple extra bucks in my opinion. Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"This place was great! I don't know what some people are griping about. I ordered carry out for lunch today and it was done for me right when I got there. The guy up front was really friendly. 

When I ordered on the phone I asked for Beef Panang, he made me aware that that wasn't on the lunch special menu and wanted to know if I wanted something that was on the lunch special menu. I had my heart set on this dish so I said that was fine. 

I picked it up, paid - reasonable price, and ate it at my office - so delicious!! Everyone around me said it smelled so good and wanted taste samples.

I had a little trouble identifying where this place was but other than that, I thought it was great - btw, NE corner of Gilbert and Guadalupe in the strip mall. 

I will be returning to try the Pad Thai and I can't wait!"}
{"text":"Let me first start off saying when it comes to Thai food I am very picky being half Thai I know what to expect...I came here for two reasons 1 it is close to where I was visiting 2 it was voted best Thai...I had the Pad Thai and portion size was good had Chicken and Shrimp in it however it DID NOT taste like any i have had before and not in a good way.  It was way to vinegary or something and it was a red hue not brown.  It just didn't taste like my moms or any Thai resturants in my hometown.  I also tried the coconut ice cream..it was good homeade coconut ice cream rolled in peanuts on a bed of sweet coconut rice.  All in all to say that I was disappointed is an understatement.  I will not be back."}
{"text":"I like Thai food, and I have to admit that what they serve is very good. My complaint is that they are also at least a dollar more than other Thai restaurants in the area and their portions are smaller. The last few times I ordered the Pad Kee Mao I swear I was getting the lunch portion. The atmosphere is great and so are the owners, but if you are going to charge higher prices than your competition, make sure you aren't skimping on the product!"}
{"text":"We've been going to Siam Orchid for a long time and consider it our favorite Thai restaurant in Phoenix. The couple that own the restaurant are always friendly and gracious. They prepare the food to order and are willing to spice the dishes to your liking."}
{"text":"All of the food is medium spicy. U should ask to less spicy if u can't handle it

The place is quite n nice. The tom yung gong taste is more like spicy shrimp broth soup, not sour at all. Basil with pork meat was amazing!"}
{"text":"I came here with my daughter, who said \"I am a young, pale white girl and they actually listened to me when I asked for them to make my dish spicy\". So thumbs up."}
{"text":"Siam Orchid is the best Thai food I've ever
tasted!! It is made to order, so whether you have
the taste for hot or mild, you can find it here. The
service was great!"}
{"text":"Siam Orchid serves delicious food, including some tempting specialties (Lady in a Green Dress - salmon wrapped in spinach with curry sauce) I haven't seen on other restaurant menus.  It was a hard decision, but we chose Wild Boar Basil and Shrimp Fried Rice, with a green bean appetizer - everything was beautifully cooked, with crisp vegetables and perfectly done shrimp.  If I had one hesitation it might be that the dish I ordered was marked as spicy on the menu (2 out of 3 stars), and I made sure to tell the waiter \"spicy\" - I ended up with something with a little lingering heat, but it was by no means hot - it was so good, though, that I stopped caring after a few bites.  

Having eaten at Thai Spice, I might give the edge to Siam Orchid.  If you live in the area, it's definitely worth trying the new place in town - I'd happily go back."}

Pros:
When they say something is spicy they mean it.
Incredibly friendly staff
Quality ingredients

Cons:
Little slow
Little pricey

I've been here twice with my gf. She used to stop here almost daily for lunch when she worked in the area. The lady is so incredibly nice here, we had some great conversation along with some great food. They were very accommodating, even after showing up just a few minutes before they closed(sorry). The portion sizes are decent and the quality of everything was great. They are not the quickest.. but that's not a bad thing.. that generally means everything is cooked to order and I believe that's the case.

Onto the food:

Tom Ka Guy:
Oh heavenly soup... This was the first dish that got me hooked on Thai food. Their version is excellent with large fresh mushrooms, and they are not shy with the sour aspect of the dish.

Massaman Curry:
One of the things the girlie and I like about this place is the curry's actually taste different. Some places the curry taste very sweet and the only difference between them is the color. This one is a rich sauce with the essence of peanuts which is what its all about. Large fresh white meat chicken chunks, massaman curry, potato, and roasted peanuts mmmmm.

Drunken Noodle:
This was a good version and heavy on the Thai basil which I liked.

Thai Jerky:
Little pieces of deep fried pork and a sweet chili dipping sauce. I have no idea if this is actually Thai but it was delicious in that heavy fried pork unhealthy way ;)"}
{"text":"For a small local eatery it is very fresh and very good.  The only reason it is not getting a five is their is only one cook for the most part.  And if there is only one server it can be really slow.  But we have been there a ton and we continue to go back because it's so good!  Worth the little bit of a wait at times."}
{"text":"This is probably the definition of a hole-in-the-wall mom-and-pop restaurant. The walls are plastered in crayon pictures addressed to the lady owner, and the dining area is lightly decorated and filled with soft and appropriate music. I love it for its quaintness and neatness, I love it for its owners, several dishes are excellent, but the portion sizes tend to run small for the price and often times the dishes are bland.

I think every time we have come here it has been very, very dead. There is usually one, maybe two other parties dining in, and sometimes a customers or two comes in to pick up a take-out order. That probably explains the portion sizes. However, if you come here for a quiet atmosphere and pretty authentic Thai food, then it's just the place.

The mini Thai egg rolls are probably one of the better appetizers, as are the soups; very flavorful and full of herbs. The curries here are amazing and definitely my favorite (mussaman is the way to go). Some of the noodle dishes do stand out as well. You need to specify if you want something more spicy or more mild as they do not ask. Main dishes are very light, meaning they are not drenched in sauce which is refreshing compared to some heavier Thai cuisines in the area. I would however recommend asking for extra sauce or a little extra spice to bring the plate to life.

They try to keep the ingredient combinations as authentic as possible, so if you ask for any substitutions they are happy to oblige but you may receive a weird look in return. No salt, pepper, or soy sauce at the table, but if you ask they will bring out whatever you need. The husband is not as talkative as the wife, but they are both very kind, very hard workers, and are constantly running back and forth to the kitchen.

I come here for the quiet dining experience rather than exceptional Thai food. It is close and convenient, but if you want more variety or are wanting to experience Thai food for the first time, I'd recommend sampling some other places first as you may not be blown away here."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have enjoyed Mint Thai and Jasmine Thai but decided to try a new place.  Bad move.  

We ordered Tom Ka Gai soup, Green Curry Chicken, and Cashew Chicken.  The soup was pretty good, not the best I've tried but met our requirements.  Plenty of chicken and mushrooms.  We ordered the chicken dishes at 3 stars - our usual for a new place and we were assured that 4 stars would be Thai Hot.  Both chicken dishes were completely bland and tasteless and definitely not 3 stars, I think 1 star would be a stretch.  The cashew chicken was oily but otherwise lacking in sauce, bland, and had no vegetables as we have come to expect at other restaurants.  The portion was small for $10 but we weren't really interested in eating it anyway.  The curry was better, salt helped, but still not spicy.  Looking forward to a spicy Thai dinner and was totally disappointed.

To be fair, it was takeout.  But I don't think that made any difference.  We picked up our order and ate it right away.  Bland is just bland whether it sits in my car for 10 minutes on the way home or not.  2 stars for the soup, but I would definitely not try any of the other entrees.  If you like spicy food, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I'm addicted! New to Thai food, I asked the owner if there was a dish with lots if vegetables and some chicken. He suggested the vegetable curry with chicken added. I've been back now three times and can't bring myself to order anything else. It is that good! What I found so unique is the way the vegetables are cooked where they are still crunchy but not undercooked at all. They were very generous with all of the veggies and chicken too. I have never seen any employees there - only the owner couple. They couldn't be nicer and trust me, the small staff doesn't take away from the service. They were quick and attentive. This is a tiny restaurant to you need to look closely or you will miss it, but it is far from a whole in the wall. Impeccably clean!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Small place with delicious authentic Thai food and peaceful atmosphere. Perfect place for a date night and close to downtown gilbert.  We'll go back again and again. Order the coconut icecream for dessert!"}
{"text":"Omg when we walked in we thought the place was so cute and small. We were the only people for lunch at the time. Great little Thai place to eat. Will comeback soon. 5 stars"}
{"text":"So....I guess I can see what the negative reviews were talking about. I went here today with a couple of friends for lunch. Although the woman who was working there was friendly enough, we waited about 30 minutes for lunch with only 2 other tables occupied....pretty unheard of for Thai food (I've had plenty of Thai food made fresh in about 5-10 minutes...at busy restaurants). My friend said her pad see ewe was the worst she had ever had...and not that it was so bad, but just bland. My other friend got pad thai and thought it was fine.... I got the chicken noodle soup and it was also a little bland, but good enough after I added a bunch of hot chili sauce. I guess this place just brings the hot sauce on the side instead of asking how spicy you want your food (?) I thought that was ok...but I prefer to have the spice cooked into the food. Anyway, the soup was ok, a pretty small bowl, and fairly devoid of any veggies or anything, but not bad. I wouldn't make a special trip to come here, especially with having higher quality Thai food in Phoenix or Tempe."}
{"text":"We have tried a few Thai restaurants around the East Valley and for my money Sian Orchid wins top prize.

I had a perfectly spiced Massaman curry and my wife had a Yello curry. Both were super tasty and we agreed that Siam Orchid had just become our 'goto' Thai restaurant. 

The service was warm and friendly and the location just a little north of downtown Gilbert is excellent.

Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I am wondering if the people reviewing this place, positively, have had actual authentic Thai food.

I got a green curry which had cabbage (wtf) snow peas (wtf) no basil (double wtf). It's green curry which is SO Basic - Eggplant, green bell peppers, carrots and basil. Simple.

This, to me, was Chinese food masquerading as Thai. 

I looked through the reviews...it seems like things are hit or miss. What should one order when they come here, I wonder? 

So I guess if you want Authentic Thai Food, go elsewhere. If you're suburban and haven't a clue...enjoy?

Fail."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch with a few co-works. There was only 2 other people in the restaurant. The food and service were great. I got the pahd-see-ewe combo and it was simply delicious.  I will have to come back to try other dishes."}
