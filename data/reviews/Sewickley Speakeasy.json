{"text":"We had a small family gathering here last weekend, and it was a wonderful choice. The menu has great variety, but like many have commented most of us tried the (now) $16.95 price fix five course meal. What an exceptional value! The food was excellent and although the portions are smaller than a la carte, by the time you get through five courses you are pleasantly full - not overstuffed and sitting there with a foam carton in your hands. There are some unique items here - I had a haluski (regional cabbage & noodles favorite) appetizer, and steak Zurich (steak topped with Gruyere bordelaise onion & Buerer blanc). While there's no substitutions on the prix fixe, the appetizer and soup specials are available choices, and a wide variety of entrees are available as well. We might have liked more adventurous wine selections, but they also do carafes which fit the size of our party well."}
{"text":"Have always enjoyed the Speakeasy, until Saturday night.  Being met by a surly unkempt valet did not start the evening off well.  I would much rather park my own car than have someone that looks dirty park it for me.  

Friends in town for annual visit and Speakeasy is always on the agenda for Oysters Speakeasy, \"sorry we are out of oysters Speakeasy\".  Granddaughter ordered filet tips over linguine, \"this tastes like Swiss Steak, the sauce is bad\".  The cajun oysters were nothing to brag about, too much breading, the filet mignon was good as usual.  

We won't be back, sorry."}
{"text":"Bad service and bad food.  We picked three wines from the wine list, and they didn't have any of them.  Chef's choice appetizer was fried mushrooms, we were served store bought frozen mushrooms, which were still frozen in the middle. One person in our group was served a salad if a fly in it. Entrees were not any better.  Chicken parmigiana was nothing special. Liver and onions were under cooked. We never saw the manager or chef after having all these problems. 

DÃ©cor was very dated and the accessible entrance is through a storage room.  There isn't an accessible parking spot and parking is limited."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Sewickley Speakeasy and the food was delicious and very well priced for the amount served. I was kind of thrown off by the valet when we pulled up the hill, though. The attendant was wearing jeans and a hoodie and did not give us a ticket or anything when we handed him the keys. He was very friendly though. I wasn't anticipating the building to be a house so that was surprising as well. The decor is outdated and the lighting wasn't the best but the fireplace in the dining room made it a little more cozier. I will definitely be back for the clam chowder!"}
{"text":"Surprised there aren't more 5-star reviews, so will post my first for this clean, cozy atmosphere serving a nice selection of 5 course meals for only $15.95!  We enjoyed spicy seafood soup, 2 meatballs in marinara, a salad with just right Italian dressing then our entrees choices of grilled salmon and lamp chops followed by fudge cake and fried frozen cheesecake all served by Harper providing friendly and efficient service to our table overlooking the Ohio River.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I had such high expectations for this place being in such a beautiful part of pittsburgh. Everything in sewickley is so well kept and charming. My husband and i thought it was definitely odd to have valet with parking so small, and the Valet driver looked like someone off the street, not dressed as part of staff at all, altho he was nice. We didnt know how to tip someone who literally walked 10 feet to get our car.
Walking in, i immediately was uncomfortable. Just a regular old house that has definitely not been taken care of at all. The staff was semi okay. We didnt get a wine menu to look at. We both got Delmonico Steaks and Shrimp cocktail. My steak had so much fat in it i couldnt finish it. (My dog had a great dinner). I originally asked about the stuffed shrimp and if the crabmeat was fresh, waitress looked at me like i was crazy and said its out of a can. How can you charge so much for food I could've purchased at store and made at home. The desserts were frozen in middle and definitely heated by microwave, you could get a spongey taste from choc cake.
I was so upset because i expected so much more from the start, wish we wouldve turned around from the moment we walked in."}
{"text":"First off there is valet parking.  Found it kind of odd since the lot is right there next to the bldg.  My husband thought maybe they have it since the size of the lot isn't very big and this way it can be controlled when it was busy.  We happened to have a very early dinner so it I'm not sure how busy it does get.

Decor definitely needs updated. Seems like it may have been a residence at one time. 

Dinner was very good.  I had the 6 oz filet and for an upcharge had it prepared w/ as gorgonzola crusted and served with a roasted garlic demi glaze. Very good and served medium as requested. Husband had the surf & turf and enjoyed it,   Both of us liked the soup as well.   Only complaint was the creme brulee. As this is usually our favorite dessert we were very disappointed with it.  The normally hard 'crust' of sugar on the top was soft.  Not sure it it had anything to do with the large amount of whipped cream on it or not.  Plus it had an odd taste.

Server was very attentive. With one soda beverage meal was only $70 plus tip."}
{"text":"My fiance and I dined here doing our tasty research for rehearsal venues for our wedding.  Hands down, we know this is where we want to have our food.  

I had driven by this place for years and never really thought that this kind of food would come from this building.  After reading yelp reviews, we decided to give it a try because it's perfect distance between our church and hotel for our guests.  We were met at the top of the hill by a gentleman for valet parking.  He was nice and polite.  Inside, we were met by a hostess who basically let us have any seat we wanted since we got there right after the doors opened.  

Our waitress was very personable and knowledgeable about the food.  I also appreciated that she recognized I was cold and turned on the fireplace and turned up the heat for me.  I'm used to being cold in restaurants (because I'm cold everywhere) so it wasn't a requirement for me or any bearing on the temperature of the building in general, but I can absolutely appreciate the wait staff recognizing this.

They have a \"value\" menu for a five course meal which we were set to try; however, the features that night sounded too good to pass up.  I'm glad we didn't.  I tried the pan seared duck with a cherry sauce.  My fiance had cod and crab.  He raved about the crab and the duck was probably one of the best restaurant meals I've had.  I'm still salivating for it days later.  We also tried the bacon artichoke dip which was phenomenal.

I think the building itself is interesting since its a converted house that overlooks the river.  The inside is decorated like an antique house.  While some may find that \"old\", I think it makes it interesting.  I do agree with other reviewers that near the fireplace, you do smell the gas.  So I recommend sitting away from it.  But really, this was my only complaint.  And since we sat across the room, we had no issue with this.

Absolutely recommend to anybody looking for a different night out and look forward to our return.  (I also just finished my leftovers while writing this... and am pretty sad I have no more duck.)"}
{"text":"We enjoyed our meal at the Speakeasy, I was sceptical based on the overall Yelp rating, but after reading the reviews I took a chance and it turned out to be a good find. 
I had the surf and turf, my family had the lamb and NY steak. All the food was well prepared and good value. I thought Yelp reviews were supposed to be about the food, many that reviewed this place were so critical of the decor, lighting and temperature. Really!!
I would say that it's an interesting step back in time, they have some eccentric people working there, our waitresses was very pleasant and tried really hard to address our needs, they really bring it with the quality of food preparation. 
Not sure what the purposes of the valet, when the parking lot is just outside the front doors? A special touch I guess."}
{"text":"Don't delude yourself into thinking this is fine dining at its glorious best - or anywhere in the same zip code.  For both food and ambiance, this place is about as overrated as the Titanic's unsinkability.  

The positives: the \"speakeasy\" decor is pleasing and somehow comforting.  It could probably use some better accent lighting to really develop the mood and highlight some of the wall art - but overall it's nice when you can see it in the ambient daylight.

Also, the window seats afford a nice vantage point over the Ohio River (woo...), except the trains going by below actually interfere with conversation (unless you enjoy talking over locomotives in a restaurant... LOL!).  Thicker drywall and better windows would really improve the mood.
 
So, dinner started off with Oysters on the Half Shell ($8.95) - one of my favorite appetizers when it's done right.  (Yes, raw oysters are delish!)  Except, you know that taste that oysters have when they're just on the edge of turning?  That was about half of them here.  Obviously not fresh - something I expect unequivocally not just at a fancy place like this but ANY place that dares to offer raw oysters for consumption.  For me this is a BIG NEGATIVE since it doesn't require any cooking - it speaks only to the quality of the kitchen!

Three of us ordered off the light fare (price fixe) menu ($16.95) while I ordered from the regular dinner choices. 

The Haluska appetizer as part of the price fixe menu was tasty, but the portion size was barely enough to fill a petri dish.

One of us had the Frog - feedback was that it was decent. \"Tastes like chicken,\" was the comment, just as expected...

Another had the Chicken Romano - feedback was that it nothing spectacular and lacked seasoning.

A third had the Pot Pie - same feedback as above.  Biggest complaint was that the chicken pieces were chewy (overcooked) and the actual comment given to me was that, \"Giant Eagle makes better pot pies.\"

As for me, I had their Alfredo ($16.95) - a dish simple enough.  Unfortunately, the pasta had way, way, way too much cream, not enough cheese, and not enough flavor.

Sorry, some may feel this place is the fancy or sheik place to go for this area but when I think of Sewickley Speakeasy I hear that big \"you-overpaid-horn\" from Price is Right and Drew Carey telling me I can't have the new set of lawn furniture from Blammo.  For the prices asked and the level of culinary prowess they try to portray, the experience just isn't worth the money."}
{"text":"Big fan of this charming restaurant. Friendly staff. Took me some time to pick from a great menu. Decided on the steak Zurich. Great choice. Perfectly cooked, wonderful flavors. I had my meal at the bar and chatted with the wait staff. I was by myself  but never felt like I was alone. I was talked into fried cheesecake for dessert. The inventor of fried cheesecake should be in the hall of fame!  If you're staying near the Pittsburgh airport, take the trip over the river and have a wonderful meal and this warm and inviting place. And try the fried cheese cake."}
{"text":"I had such high expectations for my experience at this place as it seemed to come highly recommended and the reviews really made me think it would be an awesome experience.  The $300 it was for 4 people (plus tip so more like $360) was not money well spent to say the least.

We had the frog legs (nothing to write home about according to the rest of my table), the French onion soup (which was pretty good), basic salads, and filets.  Just nothing to write home about unfortunately.  If I wanted the same dÃ©cor, and food, I could easily go elsewhere.  

The staff was great and friendly, but for the most part, that only counts for a few portions of a rating.  I was truly disappointed given the spectacular reviews that I have seen on here."}
{"text":"If I could rate Sewickley Speakeasy on how nice the staff is, they'd get four stars, but unfortunately, there's more to reviewing a restaurant.

The vibe when entering is very unflattering. It feels like you're walking into someone's house...and not in a cozy, welcoming kind-of-way. The dated decor needs a major overhaul, and it really just doesn't FEEL as semi-fancy as the prices, staff attire, and menu would suggest.

We initially sat at the bar while we waiting for the rest of our group to arrive, and the initial experience was okay. Decent whisky selection, and my wife's wine was pretty good. The bartender, who was also our waitress, was really nice, but we found it odd that her and one of the waitresses started getting a little argumentative in front of us. It felt about as awkward as the old kitchen-turned waitress station that you had to walk through to get to our table.

As for the food? A few hits, but mostly misses. We started with the frog legs, artichoke bacon dip, and the baked five onion soup. The frog legs were really bland, and drenched in plain garlic, wine, and butter sauce and battered. They sounded much better on paper than they tastes. Too much butter, not enough flavor. The artichoke bacon dip, on the other hand, was pretty good. The bacon adding a nice salty taste to what otherwise is a pretty common artichoke dip. Definitely our favorite of the three apps. The five onion soup was decent, but I probably wouldn't order it again. The cream-based onion soup would've been just as tasty and healthier without the cream. The creaminess really didn't add anything to the soup for me.

For the main course, I got the 8 oz. filet with a side of smashed potatoes. The filet was done perfectly to my liking, and was basic. Not over seasoned or anything. Just a well-cooked, medium temperature steak. The smashed potatoes were good, too, but definitely a bit too rich with butter. The side salad was basic, and I didn't even touch the bread that they gave us. That's probably a testament to the amount of food they give you, which IS quite a bit. Or maybe it's because we ordered too many apps. Either way, for the price, the amount of food they give you is good...too bad the flavor couldn't stand up to the price.

The waitress was attentive (even though she poured me the wrong Scotch), and even allowed us to move to the bar to watch the Penguins game after our meal (easy since she was working both our table and the bar). At the bar for the 2nd time, I decided to order dessert. Again, hit-and-miss. The creme brÃ»lÃ©e? Awesome. The apple puff pastry? Awful. Essentially over sweetened, but uncooked and crisp apples, with thin pieces of pastry dough on top. That's one dessert that I hope to never come across again. It sounds harsh, but it really was that disappointing.

Overall, I really, REALLY wanted to like the Sewickley Speakeasy, but when it was all said and done, there was simply nothing memorable about the experience or the food. For $28, you can get a good filet and decent smashed potatoes at a lot of restaurants, and nothing surrounding the main entrÃ©e was good enough to make us eager to return. I feel bad saying that, but it's an honest review."}
{"text":"We decided  to go here last Friday night at the last minute  and boy am glad we did. It's a cute place tucked away in Sewickley.  They have a huge  menu  and wine list . They offer a light menu which consists  of half cup soup half salad half entree and desert we both went for that. Husband had Shepard  pie and I had the Primavera  risotto  every thing from the app/soup to entree was simply great. We are definitely going to be  going back soon"}
{"text":"This place is outstanding. By far the best meal I have ever gotten at a restaurant and I eat out a lot. The staff was super friendly and prompt. The atmosphere took you back. I just honestly can not say enough good things"}
{"text":"Old building of I79 w good service and a good variety. Seafood special was exceptional, chicken Romano done very well.  A decent stop on our wandering west"}
{"text":"Very good food and servers are friendly. Great place for families including menu items even your grandmother would love."}
{"text":"We ( 4 people) went on a Saturday night and it's valet only which was weird because the parking lot was small but nice for the older generation because parking was on a hill. We started with drinks and got them right away. The waitress was good she was very attentive. We then got oysters Rockefeller, baked Brie, and oysters on the half.l for an appetizer. The oysters and Brie were good and we would all get them again. 
We got the salads right away with bread and it was delicious! For dinner we had veal Zurich, scallops, and veal oscar. The veal Zurich was very good and I would get it again. The veal oscar was very lemony but mashed potatoes were good. My father said the scallops were good and he would get them again.
Long story short, everything was great except the veal oscar."}
{"text":"We went to the Sewickley Speakeasy for the annual Clam Bake.  It's an all you can eat and drink event that they host every year.  This is the second year that we have attended.  Although the weather was a little hot, the outside patio is surrounded by trees, and just beautiful.  They had filet, chicken kabobs, ribs, cod, mussels, oysters, soft shelled crablegs, whole lobsters, shrimp, scallops, corn on the cob, macaroni salad, and potato salad.  I didn't hear a complaint from everyone.  I am not a big seafood eater, so I can speak for the non seafood.  My steak was tender and very tasty, the chicken was moist, the ribs had an amazing sauce on them (and I don't like sauce), and the shrimp.....well let's say that I am taking a hiatus from shrimp until I go to the beach next weekend.  I ate way too many.   But when you are tired of meat and seafood, you can take a dip in the chocolate fountain.  The strawberries dipped in the chocolate were beyond heavenly.  I ate way too many of those too. 
 
Besides, the annual Clam Bake, the Speakeasy serves it up.  The staff is friendly and the food doesn't disappoint."}
{"text":"When to this charming restaurant for my anniversary. The food was very good, the staff was friendly and for apps, meals, wine, dessert, and tip we came in at about $120

The only complaint is the dÃ©cor. It is clean and cozy but not beautiful."}
{"text":"I had dinner here last night and was much more pleased than the first time I went here.  This is a good spot for groups because of the private dining rooms upstairs, which makes it feel like you are having dinner at an old friends' house.  I believe this is a house dating back to the 1700s that was converted into this comfortable restaurant.  It's located off of Ohio River Blvd up a windy road.  They have complimentary valet parking, which I find interesting because the lot is only a few feet from the entrance and the few times I've been there it has never been packed.  You enter from a door that probably resembles the same in your home.  Their is a small bar with about seating for eight and a small tv in the corner.  The bathrooms are very nice in this place, because they resemble bathrooms in a nice old house and not the type with metal doors that you see in an airport for example.  We had a relatively early dinner seating at 6:30.  There were 12 of us and we dined on the top floor in a private room with a fireplace and an old radio with a selection of cd's for us to choose our own mood music.  The server was nice and I think her name was Christine.  There were a few of us who had some drinks and she put up with our antics pretty well.  The prices I found to be quite reasonable, with no entree I noticed over $30 and all entrees' including side and salad/soup.  We started with a large selection of appetizers which we all shared.  I'd call this menu classic american with a few more interesting options.  I'd guess this menu would have worked not only today, but 100 years ago.  I ordered the warm brie, which was served perfectly warmed with a nice berry glace and a few pieces of crusty french bread.  Grant ordered the stuffed mushrooms, which were average I'd say lacking much flavor in the breading.  Anna ordered the escargot, which was very good served with plenty of garlicky butter and not served in the shell, which made it easier to eat.  I also sampled the bruschetta which was super tasty with lots of chucnky tomatoes and basil, olive oil, and good aged vinegar.  There were a few other options, but I can't recall all right now.  They had a pretty big menu with several veal options.  I think they must \"specialize\" in Veal and seafood.  I ordered the rack of lamb, which was a huge portion served encrusted in some type of almond or nut breading.  The flavor was pretty good, however I asked for medium and it was closer to well, so much of the flavor was lost due to this overcooking.  I also ordered a \"lobster\" tail for $12, it was more like a langostino.  I'd guess about a 3 oz. serving.  It was cooked perfectly and I was very glad I added this option.  Oh yeah, the soup I ordered was new england clam chowder, which was very rich and delicious.  The wine selection was not that great, but the prices were reasonable.  Overall good traditional menu, decent service, and a fun unique out of the way place to go.  I'd say you'll have the most fun if you go in a group."}
