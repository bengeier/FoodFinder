{"text":"If I was rating on food alone, this would absolutely be 5 stars. 

We split the tofu tod for an appetizer. Panko coated and fried tofu with a crazy good sweet/spice dipping sauce. The tofu was well seasoned (its easy for fried things to go bland and this didn't) and had great texture. 

I had chicken pad thai. For $13 it was a generous portion. It came out piping hot and with a perfect level of spice (I requested on the mild side of medium, which isn't easy to nail).

I also tried my husband's massaman curry with chicken, sweet potato, and peanut. It was phenomenal, really rich from coconut milk with great flavor and heat. 

The service here wasn't bad, but they're definitely still learning. Our waitress mentioned that her brother opened the restaurant with his wife, and I'm happy to support a family business while they sort out the kinks. 

I think this is a great addition to the neighborhood and will routinely be slammed. Glad they offer take out!"}
{"text":"The food here is excellent! We had the fresh rolls, the pad Thai, fried rice, and a coconut curry soup. All were perfect. 

I removed one star due to a rude encounter with our hostess. When we arrived she looked me up and down, which I really did not appreciate. Yes, I was wearing distressed jeans and Birkenstocks but come on. Then she did not want to seat us at one of the tables with full-back chairs (as opposed to stools), because she wasn't sure how busy they would get. I wanted to go somewhere else but my partner insisted and finally she agreed to seat us at one of the tables with proper chairs, but it was not without an eye roll and a snarky comment.
Once we were seated everything turned around for the better. Our server was excellent. Food was delightfully fragrant and flavorful. Nice generous portions. 
Prices are fair when measured against the high quality of the dishes. 

Thai is my favourite and this did not disappoint."}
{"text":"We decided on this restaurant because the website clearly states they can work with allergens and dietary restrictions if mentioned upfront.

When we arrived, they weren't that busy and we requested a table furthest from the door. The person seating us said we couldn't have that table because the music would be too loud and they wanted to group the patrons to save the servers from walking too much. Umm..okay? It's really not that big of a place and the music wasn't that loud. Fine. The next couple that came through got the table we asked about. Strike number one.

While ordering we specifically mentioned we're vegan and gluten free. The waitress serving us was lovely and understood. The wait was acceptable. 

The fresh rolls were the best thing we had. 

I got the Pad Thai, which tasted very much like an elevated version of the store bought A Taste of Thai (peanut sauce). The portion was huge and the tofu was seriously tiny, cut into cubes smaller than the width of a TTC token. The vegetables were also used sparingly. 

My husband ordered the Panang Curry and was disappointed that the dish was all tofu and a pittance of vegetables. The taste was spot on though.

I shared a portion with my husband and after the third bite we noticed there was egg in the dish. Strike number two. 

Not only was this the wrong dish, to which the waitress confirmed it was an error, but panic set in about the gluten aspect. Strike number three.

After apologizing sincerely, I waited for another dish to be made and we found out it was indeed gluten free. Apparently the chefs don't understand what it means to be vegan.

After three strikes that's enough for us. We won't be returning."}
{"text":"Love the food here!  The most authentic Thai food we have found in the city. Highly suggest trying this place out!!"}
{"text":"Great addition to the neighbourhood. Dined in and ordered take out a few times. Red curry chicken was good. Pad Si Ew with beef is my favourite dish."}
{"text":"Such a great experience at Isaan Der. We went for an early birthday celebration and it happened to be Wine Wednesday ($3 off any glass of wine). Bless your heart. We snatched up some of the limited quantity golden bags, along with spring rolls and panang chicken curry and everything was fresh with perfect spice. Service felt a bit rushed even though there wasn't anyone waiting for our table--the mains came out when we were still devouring our apps and we were still eating when handed the bill. BUT all of our cares melted away when the sweetest chef came out to ask us if we enjoyed our meals and told us a bit about her life. This is a woman with a lot of passion and dedication to not only authentic quality but overall dining experience, and it shows. Neighbourhood gem. See you very soon, and not just on Wednesdays!"}
{"text":"I had such a great experience here! Amazing cold rolls, and pannang curry. Staff were very helpful and welcomed modification to the curry to make it gluten free. The atmosphere is great- bright and colourful. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Food was good but the service here was pretty awful. The servers use iPads that are clunky and draw out ordering to a painfully slow pace. There's no consistency in staff - we were waited on by 4 different people throughout the night. The owner seems very anxious and nervous, which made me feel the same way throughout the meal. When we were finally done, we waited and waited for the bill to come. We tried to flag down one of the servers that helped us but she ignored us. When she finally came over, she admitted that the iPads were down and she couldn't print a bill. Not the server or computer or internet or debit machines - just the iPads. We'd only ordered two mains and an appetizer and our plates were still on the table, so it's not like we had a complicated order that would be hard to recall. She would not write up a bill by hand so we could leave. So we sat there. For another 15-20 mins. There was a line at the door of people glaring us down, and our mood was effectively spoiled. I expected them to comp our appetizers or offer dessert on the house or at least apologize, but nothing like that occurred. It was awkward. I sympathize with needing to work out the kinks of a new business but this felt unnecessarily unpleasant."}
{"text":"Great service. Ordered the rolls and the Penang curry. Both were very well made. Good blend of spices in the curry , just the right creaminess. Awesome to have such great Thai in the Junction! Better interior decor and open space than other Thai spots in town"}
{"text":"this is simply just so good and authentic( I'm Chinese) the coconut rice is sooooo good!!!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful Thai meal! I came here during a visit to my sister's neighbourhood, and what a treat to dive into one of her favourite Junction spots.

An all star appetizer is the \"Golden Bags\". Don't be turned off by the name. These bags are SURELY filled with gold-level flavour, as they are a deep fried pastry, filled with water chestnuts, carrots and mushrooms & chili sauce. Other dishes were up to snuff too, like a Thai take on fried calamari and all the expected curry + noodle dishes are present. 

Service was very courteous and we found the place to be bumpin' on a random weekday night. But still, they had a table for three of us right away. The decor is very modern and funky. 

Eat here!"}
{"text":"I went there for lunch today with a friend of mine.  Since we were on a tight schedule we ordered our food to go.  The service was excellent. We didn't have to wait too long for our food to be ready.  We both ordered Pad Thai, one with chicken and one with tofu. Both meals were delicious  and came with a free spring roll! The Pad Thai came from their lunch menu and was only $9. I will definitely go back to try out other things on their menu."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Thai restaurant in Toronto!
 I haven't had this authentic Thai food since I visited Thailand back in 2015. Ever since then I've been looking for something that reminds me of the great experience I had in that country. And what luck, Isaan Der exists!
It was Friday night, me and couple of friends were looking to trying something new and my buddy had this look on his face like he knew just the place to go. He told me about this little Thai restaurant on Dundas West that's been getting a lot of praise lately. So we  headed there on the bus and we could see from the outside window how PACKED they were (I mean yeah, it's Friday). But sure enough it didn't took us long to get ourselves a seat. The vibe was pretty nice, the place was really well decorated (they got stuff that really fits the theme of the place), and man the waiter was so polite and funny:) I can really tell this is fine dining. As for the food, I ordered Pad Thai (which is a favorite of mine amongst many many delicious Thai food) and my friends got a Pad Kee Mao and Pad Gra Pao (we thought it was funny if we all got a dish that starts with Pad). Despite how busy the restaurant was, we got our food served in a decent amount of time. The food looked and smelled really awesome! The aroma just hit your nose and not gonna lie it made me drooled a bit. And when I dig in to the food, it just hit the spot. Like, it really filled the void in my stomach for a great authentic Thai food. I have had many Thai food in Toronto before but not like this...not like this. All the other were really \"Canadia-ize\", meaning the foods were modified to suit Canadian's taste buds. In a way, the food then loses it's authenticity. But Isaan Der's food is on another level. It was really comforting and so authentic like the ones I had in on the streets of Thailand. The service was so nice that it reminded me of the friendly people I met there. It just WOW! It got that certain... Je ne sais quoi.  Since then I've been back several times and I can definitely say that their food have never failed to impress me each time I come.
 I will definitely come back. For the food AND the service."}
{"text":"Move aside all you Thai restaurants that aren't actually Thai! 

This place is the BOMB! There is just no other way to put it, my friend recommended we try it out one evening because she looooves it and hence we made our way there on a Friday night. We had reservations and we seated sharp at 8. So here goes;

Shrimp Rolls: I know.. how good could these possibly taste? Damn good is the answer. The coating was fresh and didn't taste like sawdust that you find at most other restaurants. 

Papaya Salad: To die for.. so fresh and refreshing! I was so upset I didnt' know of this place in the summer.

Chicken Satay: I'm not that big a fan of it but Mr. H is, it was soft and delicious.

Panang Curry with Fish: OMG! I wanted to shove my face in it! My friend described it best, she said \"You can taste every ingredient in it! You can just tell it was made from scratch.\" Amen!

Massaman Curry: Equally good, a little on the sweeter side though because of the sweet potato.

PAD THAI: I hate Pad Thai! I can't stand it. It tastes weird, dry and clumpy and makes me feel bloated after. THIS PLACE HOWEVER HAS THE BEST PAD THAI EVER!!!!! Fun fact: Did you know Pad Thai is not supposed to be red in colour? It's supposed to be made in tamarind sauce! This place gets it right! They have converted me into a Pad Thai lover! 

I also tried their Tamarind Sour drink and loved it! 

I can't wait to go back there! The food takes a little while but I don't mind if it tastes that good! The service is also great."}
{"text":"It's amazing to find a Thai restaurant that isn't part of the Chef Nuit chain. Don't get me wrong, Chef Nuit and team produces great and fantastic Thai food but it's nice to try something different.

The Golden bags are something you must try, it's very similar to deep fried wonton but with a different interior texture - sweet mashed potatoes with mushrooms. At the table we ordered the panang, green curry, pad grapao, and laab salad. 

The panang was very flavourful and my friend being lactose, she was able to get it made with dairy free. The green curry was loaded with bamboo shoots which was a plus for me. The pad gradpao wasn't over salty like other Thai restaurants which was great. The laab salad was something new I tried. I was expecting a bed of salad tossed with some pork but that wasn't the case. I was surprised by the large portion of meat and the very few strips of lettuce. It was a confusing dish to consume and the sticky rice didn't really compliment the pork. Other than this salad I thought everything was great and would definitely return when I'm on the west end."}
{"text":"Wonderful experience - the staff was friendly and attentive. The owner came out to chat with us at the end of the meal to ask about us and what we enjoyed. The tom yum goong soup and beef pad grapao was especially delicious, perfect amount of the flavours Thai food balances. We'll definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Shared 3 starters and 2 soups with the missus this evening and holy crap this place is awesome. Get the golden bags. They're insane y'all. Super crispy skin and a crazy dipping sauce with a syrupy consistency that's not to sweet. Had the soup which I cannot remember the name of but it's the last one on the list of their soup section. It's phenomenal. The broth is rich and flavourful. It's unlike anything I've had from a Thai restaurant in the city. 

The owner spent 15 years in Thailand and met his wife there, she runs the kitchen btw. They're both super nice and really focused on the experience. Just great people with a great approach. Can't wait to go back and eat everything."}
{"text":"I'm addicted to their spring rolls - so deelish and the dipping sauce is homemade sweet chili. Major yum!"}
{"text":"Good food + cozy atmosphere + friendly owner. I live west end and this is a very good thai option for me. I recommend this place and am a returning customer.

The owner mentioned they make vegan dishes too and that is something I will give it a try next time around."}
{"text":"The food was ok, but the service was slow and they mixed up our order multiple times.  Maybe still working out he bugs, but I'll probably wait until I hear good reviews from someone else before trying again"}
{"text":"I heard that this is a place in Toronto that is considered authentic even with Thai community and the chef is from Thailand. So I decided to give it a try. 

First impression is it has a quite modern decor. We ordered the famous deep fried golden bad as appetizer. It is quite good. The Thai milk tea was tasty too. We had two two other dishes but I couldn't remember the names and they didn't leave too much of an impression. One of them the server mentioned it's a southern thai (or northern thai I forgot) food and it's pretty rare to see it on the menu in Toronto, which I ordered. To be honest, it's OK. It also reminds me of a type of Chinese dish (I'm Chinese)."}
{"text":"Isaan Der is located in the Junction in Toronto. The design of the restaurant is modern.  The service is friendly. The food is delicious. Isaan Der serves some of the best thai food in Toronto. The combination of coconut, curries, chilli peppers made for an irresistible meal. 

To start, we had the spring rolls. The spring rolls here were very fresh - crunchy on the outside and exploding with fresh ingredients inside. 

The meal continued with pad thai. The pad thai was savoury and slightly sweet, using the traditional combination of garlic, shallots and honey to create flavour, rice noodles topped with bean sprouts, tofu, coriander, chives and lime with beef.

I would highly recommend Isaan Der."}
{"text":"Expertly done shrimp spring rolls, wrapped with a ribbon ( a ribbon is the sign of a well trained chef, or so I've heard on tv shows)and to my surprise the roll was one big piece of shrimp as opposed to little chunks of shrimp along with veggies as a filler, pro tip- get two if you are extra hungry this appetizer although inexpensive isn't the most filling. But alas it is not the main event. My main event this evening was the Penang curry chicken. I got it Spicy. Although I didn't sweat I will write this off to my high tolerance from eating Alota' curry. The rice while plentiful wasn't enough, I'd recommend waiting till the end to see if you want extra rice. The ambiance is very trendy, and the staff friendly and efficient. I tipped my highest amount which I rarely ever do.the food was at the table within minutes of my order. I think the efficiency can be credited to their use of iPads for taking orders."}
{"text":"Ordered the lunch special for takeout.. I got chicken pad Thai for $9 plus it came with a spring roll! It was amazing! It is now on my list of top 5 pad thai's in Toronto. I am extremely picky with meat and was pleasantly surprised by the chicken they put in the pad Thai! Very happy customer."}
{"text":"Great vibe. Soup was forgettable but everything else was wonderful and my family left stuffed. I have already been back twice."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery - got Phad Thai for one dinner and the Panang curry for my dinner the next night.  Both were delicious and pretty authentic to what I've had in Thailand.  Which is a rarity in Toronto.  It's a bit more expensive that your usual local Thai spot but worth the dough.  The portions are pretty decent too.  Oh man......it makes me want to order some right now!"}
{"text":"Thanks for your response, Donald. Though you've been misinformed and I see aren't willing to take any ownership of this review. I'm sharing my legitimate experiences in an attempt to help you improve your weaknesses and prosper, while informing potential customers about my experience. 

Whether or not you'd like to believe this really happened, is quite irrelevant.

My husband and I most definitely were told you were running out of food, half way through Friday and Saturday nights. TWICE. Yes, you're a busy restaurant and have an understandably long wait on popular evenings. Doesn't change that your staff TOLD us to come back another time.

I was on hold for this order mentioned, for 12 minutes. Waiting. Right there waiting for your staff to return. No one did. I called again, to both your listed phone numbers. Both went straight to a recorded message. Yes, I found out that you don't have voice mail. Which is fine. Didn't want to leave a message...just wanted to order our dinner.

Your ordering system clearly shows when the kitchen is \"processing\" the order and when it's been sent to the delivery team. The processing part was the long part. Busy night - we get it. In and of itself, a longer than usual wait time isn't a big deal.

We've heard the credentials of the chef before - We've also had authentic Thai food elsewhere. Your version of Phad Thai wasn't to our liking. I described what we received. Authentic or not, it wasn't delicious. At all.

Hopefully you'll take this feedback as intended and know that this customer is not making stuff up - Why would we do that? This is a REAL experience, and if you expect to create customer loyalty and satisfaction, you'll accept feedback and address it professionally. Your response here demonstrates you're not interested in that."}
{"text":"Ok so I went there again, and I am very happy to see Isaan Der has pulled itself together.
The management was much better this time, and the servers were more attentive.

My girlfriend thinks their Pad Thai is the best(better than Pai and KSR). It may or may not be the best but it's definitely very tasty and has a unique touch to it.

They Also have something like Khao Soi but its under noodles and called something else, it was also very tasty.

We have found ourselves a new good Thai place and will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"I've had the (I think) yellow curry (the one with squash)twice now and was impressed both times.  Not my fave thai in Toronto but certainly the best in my general area.  Authenticity comes through in the rich varied broth. 

Golden bags were a very nice appetizer too.  But the cold spring rolls lacked a little something I'll call \"flavour\" - they were just a few crispy veg in a soft wrap.  

Excellent service both for my takeout and eat-in experiences."}
{"text":"Phenomenal new Thai restaurant. The fish dish is terrific. The service is poor as the front of house is run by the chef's husband. A great guy who knows nothing about running a restaurant. Hopefully he will learn quickly and we can all be patient while he does. The food is special"}
{"text":"The food is rock star at this location but when they get too busy their staff members do not know how to handle the volume. Time and time I have called for take away and the last time was enough. A gentleman picked up the phone and rudely said \"WE ARE BUSY, YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE TO WAIT.\". I agreed and waited 10 minutes on the line. I understand your restaurant gets busy but there is a way to talk to customers when the restaurant is slammed. I work in the service industry and would never EVER talk to my customer like that because for all I know, they could be a life time client, not customer.

Disgusted."}
{"text":"We came here on a Friday night and was able to get seated immediately. The restaurant was almost full, so we got incredibly lucky. In the beginning, we couldn't decide what to order from the menu. We weren't sure what shrimp chips were so we asked the sever and he brought us some try. The shrimp chips were not bad but we didn't find it extra ordinary. We decided to opt for the golden bags, panang chicken curry, and a shrimp fried rice. Everything but the shrimp fried rice was beyond standards. We found that the shrimp fried rice was underwhelming and tasted mostly like fish sauce. The rice was also a bit moist. Traditionally fried rice should be dry (using day old rice.) The golden bags were very interesting and new. It was fried vegetables, presented very nicely in some type of wrap. While the Panang Curry had a good amount of taste. I would definitely go again. Maybe, try some type of fried noodle instead of fried rice."}
{"text":"This is a great spot for dinner. While I enjoyed it thoroughly, I was encouraged that my Thai dinner companion loved it as well and found it to be authentic.

Here are a few things to note:

1. The food is delicious. The fried fish here is perfect. Chicken satay- great. There is a great mix of heavier curries and pork items, along with lighter fare such as papaya salad and vegetable fresh rolls.
2. If you want your food spicy, tell them. They can crank up the heat on anything. 
3. Prices are very reasonable. Two people can eat well for 50$ before alcohol and tip.
4. Surprise, surprise. There may be a wait on a busy weekend or later-in-the-week night here in one of Toronto's hottest neighbourhoods. Plan on this, and then take a short stroll during the wait time. 
5. They serve a nice beer- High Park Beer, in cans. It is worth a try.
6. Service is good. My server has been attentive and helpful on both visits.
7. This is a great starting point for an evening out in the Junction."}
{"text":"Golden bags and Calamari are fine.

Tom Sap Isaan and Spicy Corn Salad are tasteless. (We ordered medium spicy)

Ping Kai with sticky rice is good.
However, the menu and the server didn't tell us that the Ping Kai+Sticky Rice already come with corn salad, which we already order separately.

Overall we are not happy with the taste. Can't believe how come this restaurant has so many good reviews. We both are disappointed.

(We are Thai.)"}
{"text":"YUMMY! A great addition to the Junction. A step up from the other Thai takeout options in the area. 

The Golden Bags are a must! They're crispy with a light curry flavour.  

I had the ground chicken Pad Grapao which was a huge serving and left me enough for lunch the next day. 

The wait staff was friendly and welcoming. I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"New fav Thai place in the west end! 

The place is adorable inside. Great date place, a little small-ish but still okay for a small group. 

Recommend the Massaman Curry, it was delicious. Pad Thai was decent. Panang was fantastic. (Dang, now I want to order Thai food for breakfast... as I write this at 8am!)

Be sure to try their wet & dry chilies. Yum. 

Very friendly and personable staff. They are very allergy friendly. So nice to see! Will definitely be ordering again soon."}
{"text":"I had dinner at Isaan Der the other night with 4 other friends and we had a great time! My friend Olga suggested this new restaurant and so glad we all decided on this one!

It's a small but charming restaurant with cute details like metallic decals on one wall and woven circular plates on the opposite wall. I liked how the lights were dimmed for dinner and the room was lit up by several decorative candles on the tables. 

In terms of reservations, it's hard to get a hold of someone over the phone for a larger group but just come a bit earlier like some of my friends did and get your name down. The wait time for a table isn't bad at all considering it's a smaller place.

The five of us were attended to by the owner Donald throughout the night who was also taking orders, serving and chatting with customers at each table. We enjoyed the friendly service and it was great to hear about some of Donald's experiences during his 15 years in Thailand. We even met his wife Chef Chatsuda who cooked the great meal we had and she does it from scratch for each order!

Because of the good company (among us friends and Donald), we didn't mind the wait for our food but it definitely wasn't as long as other places that can take up to an hour to serve food. Just don't come here hangry and expecting food to come out right away since they do put time and care in making their food.

The food was great - flavourful, good portions and good prices to match! I think everything was $13 and under. I ordered the panang curry with chicken and my husband ordered the chicken pad thai. Staff were great with doing their best to make sure his dish was peanut free. My other friends ordered the bbq pork with sticky rice, pad gra prow (ground pork and egg on rice) and panang curry with tofu and beef. Everyone enjoyed their food overall despite a slight mix up with ingredients on the two curry dishes but it wasn't a big deal and didn't affect how good the food tasted anyway. We were also given a free dish to try which was noodles with curry - also good! Just a heads up though that the food here tastes slightly different from Pai and Khao San Road - not that we minded at all! We also got the Thai iced tea which was delicious!

The presentation of all dishes was also nice. Fun fact: some items like the little woven basket that held the sticky rice, woven plate trays and some of the utensils were brought from Thailand according to the owner! 

Thanks for a great experience here Donald and Chef Chatsuda!!! Wishing you both much success at this new restaurant. We'll definitely be back and recommend this place to all!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was another Thai restaurant before it was renovated and made into its current form as Isaan Der. The Thai restaurant that was in its place previously was really good, but rarely if ever had any customers inside. 

When Isaan Der opened, my partner and I were unsure if it would live up to its former place. We walked by and always said things like, \"We will have to go there sometime.\" On Friday, we threw caution to the wind and decided to go for it. 

The dining room was bustling and packed, but the service was attentive and kind. The dining room is a bit dark, but nothing that makes visibility an issue. The menu is great for vegetarians, which my partner just recently switched over to.  We ordered spring rolls, which were fresh and had a delicious peanut sauce to pair alongside it. 

For our mains, we ordered the tofu pad thai which was creamy and delicious. The portion size for the $15 price point was also quite substantial. We also ordered one of their curries, the Gaeng Massaman ($15) which is a peanut and tamarind curry with sweet potatoes, cardamom, and deep fried onions. Paired alongside an order of jasmine rice, it was rich and intensely flavored. 

We went home with our bellies fully and both so impressed with everything they had on the menu. We will totally be back to visit and this could absolutely complete with Chef Nuit Regular's own thai restaurants. LOOK OUT!"}
{"text":"It was my first time trying Thai food. The experience was totally worth it. Food, kindly and fairly recommended by the waiter, was very delicious. As far as I know, they don't have any room to store their food so they buy fresh food daily. I think this is one of the reasons of why it's so good. As a bonus, the interior is incredibly stylish and washrooms are very clean (that matters a lot to me). Definitely will return to this restaurant again. Maybe next time I will skip the dessert though but will try all other stuff for sure."}
{"text":"3.5 star

I've been on a Thai food tasting adventure throughout Toronto trying out all the popular Thai spots ever since I had my first Thai meal from the popular Pai in downtown, and fell in love with Thai food, ESPECIALLY Thai green/red curries. If there's red/green curry on the menu, I will order it.

Came here on a Saturday evening for really late lunch/really early dinner (around 530), they had a couple tables, but was mostly empty, but it quickly filled up and had a full house within moments.

Service: friendly service, BUT they were a bit understaffed for dinner time, and it was a bit difficult to get their attention if we needed something

Food:
- We started with the fresh spring rolls with shrimp ($10) that came with peanut sauce for appetiser, and it tasted fresh and nice with peanut sauce, a good choice for a light snack since it's not greasy and heavy

- We ordered the Red Curry with tofu, and Green Curry with chicken as our mains (rice included): both taste great! I'd consider them as one of my top favourites. The only down side is I wish they put some more content in the curry, as they felt 70% curry sauce 30% food

Thumbs down: their curries were not cheap ($15) but still charges extra $3 for rice?! hate when restaurants give you a child portion size of rice and charge extra when you ask for more, like thanks for reminding me to watch my weight but I AINT GONNA BE FULL DRINKING CURRY SAUCE"}
{"text":"This place is delicious. Located  in the Junction; perfect for my partner & I. We arrived around 8:45pm and waited 20 mins for a seat.  The servers were really friendly.  

We order the shrimp rolls, tom yum soup, curry noodles (delish!) and pork laab salad (authentic!). For drinks, we ordered the Thai Iced tea.  I will post the pictures but the lightning isn't that great. They dim the lights after 9:30pm?   My partner really enjoy the pork laab salad. I really like the creaminess of the curry and the noodles. It hit the spot! 

Near the end of the meal the owner (chef) had approached us and asked how the food was. She was very friendly. It was nice to have a one on one conversation with her. 

I would def come back. The best time  to come would be after 8:30pm as we were advised by the owner/chef. :) Happy Thai Eatin'!"}
{"text":"Isaan Der is not your typical 'cookie cutter ' Thai restaurant. In fact it's probably unlike any Thai restaurant you have ever experienced before. If you have ever been to Northeast Thailand you will know exactly what I am talking about, and if you haven't you really have to come here.  A beautiful inviting decor with dark rich colors, attentive service, and most importantly an incredible menu with freshly made flavorful dishes that you probably won't find anywhere else, unless of course you can make it to Northeast Thailand. Every main dish is priced at $13 and under with starters at $8 and under. My favorite?  Guayjup, a soup made with a thick flavorful broth made with  potato noodles, pork sausage, white turnip and onions. The location is fantastic with lots of street parking and a Green P lot just seconds away.  The restaurant itself is exceptionally clean, the service is great and most importantly the food is fresh, flavorful and unique. If you are the type of person that loves trying something different and something new, you really have to come here"}
{"text":"So having just moved from downtown to The Junction, I was bad buzzing about not having my favourite Thai restaurants at my disposal like Pai and Khao San Road. This was until I discovered this local Thai joint. The food is fantastic and authentic and trumps those two other places in my opinion. Today I ordered via Foodora and the wrong item was delivered to me. When I called the restaurant directly I spoke to both the owners (husband/wife) and they the nicest people ever. They were so kind and offered to personally deliver the correct dish to me and it arrived in 15 minutes! Now that is service! Check this place out, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Really tasty Thai food at fair prices. Had the Cashew Chicken and the Panang Curry with fish. Everything was so good. Would recommend this place and those dishes for sure! Can't wait to go back and sample more of the menu. Service was very good too! Only hitch was the presentation. Everything was plated on white dishes, except for the appetizers which were served on a trendy wooden plate! The food and the overall atmosphere is very colourful, the plates should be too!"}
{"text":"\"There was an identity crisis when it came to presentation and plating. Thai food is not pretentious. It's rustic. It aims to please with its combination of sweet and sour flavours. The vibrant orange Panang curry, which I thoroughly enjoyed (and, quite frankly, wanted more of) was plated in a shallow white bowl that would be commonplace in a chain restaurant--not a casual Thai spot. When I compare this to my other Thai standouts in the city, such as Pai, curry is appropriately served in a coconut shell.\""}
{"text":"The space is nicely decorated and colorful. Guayjup Isaan was waaay too salty, didn't enjoy it. Pad Thai was pretty good. However, they only had 2 waitress and one cook, there was a mix up with the order, so we got a Pad Thai on the house. Because of the short staffing, we waited for a long time for the food, and to pay.
