{"text":"Love the food here.  Onion rings are awesome and so is the chili.  Sandwiches and burgers are good size.  Tip- The staff does not recommend the fried curds (frozen)."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to have down to earth, hearty food.  My favorite?  Lunch time!  The burgers are wonderful, the service is fantastic.  It is a beautiful building with lots of history...You can see old articles and photos in the front by the cashier.  I like to take my out of town visitors down for breakfast in the morning on a weekend day before venturing off to the world."}
{"text":"Excellent Hand breaded fish with homemade Cole  slaw that was delicious. They even offered homemade applesauce."}
{"text":"I cannot say enough GOOD ABOUT THIS LITTLE HOLE IN THE WALL! OMG!  The food is SO reasonably priced and GOOOOD!  Had the VERY BEST BEET STEW I HAD EVER HAD IN MY LIFE!  (Sorry mom & dad...it is what it is!)  AND...go figure...state of the art technology for handling orders!  Service was great too, friendly and down to earth.  A MUST STOP when in STOUGHTON, WISCONSIN"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped here on our way out of Madison and I'm so glad we did! I glanced at a few reviews and figured it was worth a stop, it is. I had a traditional breakfast with eggs, hashbrowns, bacon, and toast (coffee lovers rejoice, they leave a carafe of coffee on the table for you!) and Mr. H had a waffle with the best sausage he's ever had. It was quite possibly the best breakfast we had on our week long trip!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is the perfect Diner in my eyes.  I found this amazing place on a random trip to Stoughton a few years back, and regularly visit it from Madison.  The combination of atmosphere, staff, and well priced decent quality food has earned my respect for their consistency each time we visit.  If you are looking for an amazing fulfilling meal, particularly breakfast, in a casual diner atmosphere, this is the place.  One note-it can be difficult to get a seat (a positive indication that I am not the only admirer), and the locals tend to occupy their tables and booths to chat long after the meal is over, but I assure you it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"We moved to Stoughton last year and the Koffee Kup was the most talked about restaurant by far. We love the decor, its fun and diner like. My kids and I love to sit at the counter \" like the old days\". Great food for great price."}
{"text":"This is our place for breakfast! My wife and I moved to Stoughton in Jun '15 and The Koffee Kup was suggested by our neighbor. We are very glad she suggested it as we've lived here for just over a month and been to the Kup 5 times now. The wait staff is quick and attentive and the menu has lots of options for breakfast. The omelets are good and the pancakes are huge, \"plate size\" per their menu. They have numerous bakery items available too as well as a limited bar. Our only complaint is there is literally no place to wait for a table unless you stand outside, but the turnaround on tables is usually pretty quick."}
{"text":"Cheap! Cheap! Cheap! And good! Diner food. Stoughton locals know. Then stop at Fosdel's Bakery just down the street for awesome donuts!"}
{"text":"This is our go to breakfast spot in Stoughton. Servers are so friendly, and have always given us great service. Food is well done, comes out quickly and my goodness the prices are good. Great bang for your buck! Usually in and out quickly even when the place is packed!"}
{"text":"The Koffee Kup is one of those restaurants that just has great food. It is not a chain restaurant, so you have that personal service you get from a locally owned restaurant. The owner is normally there. Many of the waitresses have been there for some time. If you go often, they will know you and what you like. It is like going home for a meal.  The Koffee Kup is not a large restaurant. It has some counter seating and a mix of tables and booth seating. There is no smoking in the restaurant so there is no worry of second hand smoke. Parking is on the street and along one side, but normally there is plenty in front on the street.   If you are going to try the Koffee Kup for the first time, try the Friday Fish Fry. There are many places in and around Stoughton (or Madison) that serve up a pretty good fish fry. The Koffee Kup's Friday Fish Fry is one of the best and could be the best for your money. They offer cod, perch and walleye. Any of the fish can get deep fried, grilled or broiled. Any of the selections are under $10 and come with coleslaw and the potato of your choice. For a little extra you can get any number of soups. The clam chowder is great for Friday night. But the shrimp chowder is out of this world. A little spicy, but nothing even a wimp could not handle. It is a soup that you would expect to find in one of the best seafood restaurants on either coast. Order a bowl right off, a cup is not enough.  All the deserts are home made and are worth saving room for if you can. They have a large selection of pies. Their strawberry shortcake is really good. It is made with homemade biscuits and your choice of whipped cream or ice cream. If you are lucky enough to be there a night they have bread pudding, try it. Even if you are not a fan of bread pudding it is worth a bite or two.  Breakfast and lunch are also good and with a large selection. Coffee is under a dollar for a bottomless cup. One of the few places left that serve such good coffee for so cheap. If you are going for dinner, go early, they generally close at 8 pm.   Overall this is a great restaurant for breakfast, lunch or dinner. It is a great value and serves up great food."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Took mama-Chy here and for three people who ate like the royal court, the total bill was $35 with tip!  We ordered Kitchen Omelet add bacon, with Multi-Grain bread and American Fries, Meat Eater Omelet with Pancakes, and Hashbrowns, and Eggs Benedict. Also, three coffees.  They make their own bread, the multi-grain is a heartier, thicker (think Texas toast), yet soft and chewy. Their pancakes are billed as 'Plate-Sized' and it's not a false advertisement, they are as big as the plate, in fact it was even hanging over the plate a bit. The omelets were huge! Bigger than the two eggs it states it's made with, perhaps it's all the generous fillings of vegetables and meats that make this a stand-out both in portion and flavor. Sometimes, the bacon is under cooked, or chewy in an omelet, not here, they are crispy!  I'd recommend the American Fries, the quartered potatoes have a flavorful crunch and the insides were not mushy nor dry.  The staff here never miss a beat, I don't believe our koffee kups were ever beyond half empty.  Get here early, as it does fill up and the tiny parking lot is a zoo on weekends and most morning.  We've been here for dinner as well and really enjoyed their burgers!  I love the small, cozy feel to this diner . They even have a board of specials, fresh pies, and soups!"}
{"text":"Delicious Food, breakfast, lunch, or dinner. Quite popular with locals and tourists alike, but tables almost always available with fast service. Real home cooked food for very reasonable prices. If you happen to be near Stoughton give it a try."}
{"text":"THis food is pretty darn good!  The staff, let's say they can be unpredictable, but they work hard.  We just ate there today and I'd say it is a good place to go for a hot meal (I had the \"mess\").  Just don't look for a smiling staff person, I am not sure they have them..."}
{"text":"Used to love this place but have had two terrible, disastrous experiences.  Bad experience #1 was during the sweet 16 and we were invisible to the server. Second bad experience was for breakfast a few weeks back and the server was way over worked during a busy time. She was busting her tail while the owner chatted away with a few people. My service was slow and the food was beyond bad. The owner didn't apologize when I called him. His explanation was \"It gets like that when we are busy\" We won't be back soon."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here for breakfast after a weekend getaway at Crown Pointe Resort.   We were immediately greeted by the friendly staff. Our waitress was extremely nice and energetic. She had a very welcoming feel, she told me even tho I was a bears fan she still liked me LOL.   The atmosphere was very inviting and cozy. It had an old school feel with a hint of modern day decor. They took orders on a tablet which was very neat.   Lastly, the food was phenomenal at a very reasonable price. Anyone visiting this area should come here for breakfast. You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Ordered the cheese omelet skillet and it was delicious.  Very affordable two omelet meals was $12.72.  Was very busy, but the service was quick.  Only waited roughly ten minutes for meal once order placed."}
{"text":"We have eaten here many times when visiting.  For what Stoughton has to offer, I would say it's one of their better restaurants. Good food and great high desserts.  Today a young girl by the name Missy was serving us and she had the worst attitude I've ever experienced at a restaurant. Whats strange is she wasn't even hiding it. Then when she walked off she was slamming cups, being very aggressive, etc... It was beyond uncomfortable.  This young lady is a loose canon!"}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast spot of all time. The food is just perfection. The prices are crazy low. You leave full and happy. The interior is bright and welcoming and clean. The multi grain pancake was great with a hint of cinnamon. The omelette was cooked perfectly. Also, to top my breakfast off right I had a chocolate malt that was sooo good!   This place is a must and worth a drive for."}
{"text":"Pros: Great service, friendly staff, awesome food, fast. We had breakfast for lunch- perfectly cooked eggs and a pancake. Our server was very friendly and overall the experience was perfect.   Cons: none- we will be back!"}
{"text":"Old SKool diner- Yes, I spelled it with a K, kause Koffee Kup spells everything else with a K. Saturday morning here was packed.  All generations were crammed into this tiny restaurant eyeing for spot to have breakfast, a K-rafe of Koffee and some good old charm from the waitress. Food arrived quickly, attentive staff, and delicious and klassic food.   Omelettes, hashbrowns, toast, and even a grilled cheese were gone in just a few minutes after our early morning sporty activities. This is an institution on main street in Stoughton, must stop while you are shopping at the other charming shops in town."}
{"text":"I recommend this place to everyone that passes through Stoughton.  Delicious food.  Friendly service.  You can't go wrong with anything you order here.  Servers are hip to the 21st century and use tablets that beam your order to the back."}
{"text":"Good place for an inexpensive, reliable breakfast.  The Koffee Kup is small, but cozy.  The breakfast is super cheap--$1.95 for a huge pancake!  Also, the coffee is under a buck!  yeah!  Next time I'll have to go for pie!!!"}
{"text":"I'm an Indian guy and vegetarian. I've moved to stoughton,WI recently for my new job. Asked around about restaurants and was recommended koffee kup. The name of the restaurant fits well coz their coffee is the best in town. I'm a huge Starbucks fan, so I rank this next to Starbucks. Coming to entrees, like I said as I'm veggie, I like to have a 3egg veggie omelette with whole wheat toast and hashbrowns! Not the least, a kup of koffee!   The best breakfast/lunch/dinner to make my day! I'm so in love with this place. The staff and ambience is so like home and they greet you so well and offer you the best service in town.   I'd recommend everyone visiting or moving to Stoughton, WI to check out this heavenly place! If you're passing through atleast 10-15miles from this place, please drive those extra few miles for an amazing experience! Trust me you'll love it!!!"}
{"text":"I love the Koffee Kup. While I have mostly been there for breakfast, its good for lunch and dinner too. Food is good, staff is very friendly, and the prices are very reasonable. There is a reason why many restaurants have come and gone but Koffee Kup stands. Any of the omelets are good, and they are available all day.   Stoughton is lucky to have a place like Koffee Kup. I want there as a kid, and now I bring my kids there. Its part of the personality of the town."}
{"text":"Not fancy, but good old home cooking! Clean, with friendly fast service.  Their wireless order entry is 21st. century and gets your order to the kitchen fast and the food back to you fasssst. My wife and I do a lot of traveling, and anytime we get in the southern WI area, the Koffee Kup is a must stop.  If you are in the Madison area, do yourself a favor and stop at the Koffee Kup for some old fashioned food.  You won't be disappointed.  And if you are there for breakfast, you just have to try \"The Mess\"!  Breakfast better than Mom used to make."}
{"text":"The food here is delicious!! The servers are friendly and it's a cozy little restaurant. The only reason why I gave it 4/5 stars is because I'm not a fan of the street parking. It's too hard to maneuver with the kids and whatnot. Otherwise - this place is great!"}
{"text":"Great place for an old fashioned traditional breakfast of classics and basics. Do not come here expecting some 4-5 star service and food, its not meant to be that kind of place and never was or will be. Its means for locals to come and become regulars and enjoy a basic breakfast and a great price. Yes its small and a little cramped but oh well, your not here for the night, just a meal, live with it.   I came here with my parents as my final breakfast in the state of WI for many months as I leave for Seattle tomorrow for my new job out that way. My folks had been here before but this was my first.   I got the steak omelet with hashbrowns and toast. Portions were good, food was tasty and the price was right. The servers are friendly and kind and they keep up very well for a busy place during breakfast hours. Coffee here is really good as well! The pies and desserts here looked to die for by the way so please do me a favor and get a slice for me since I will be some 2000 miles west of this little place."}
{"text":"If you are not eating breakfast here, you are doing something wrong with your life.  This place has the lowest prices of any sit-down restaurant I have ever been to. You might think that would mean they skimp on quality and service, but you'd be dead wrong. Portions are MASSIVE (to a point where I might argue they give you too much, but who's going to complain about extra food?) and the quality is excellent. I have been there several times, but the most recent outing I got three strawberry pancakes for something like 5 dollars, and they were bigger than my dinner plate, and about as sweet and fluffy as could be.  Coffee is something like 75 cents for a cup + unlimited refills, which is unheard of anyplace else and fills me with absolute ecstasy.  The staff is always super friendly, and they always are around to check up on you and refill your drinks.  My only complaint is that it is not closer. I would eat here every day of my life if it was located in Madison."}
{"text":"This is the best little, small-town restaurant! They are best at breakfast (but everyone knows this, so it's always busy on a Saturday or Sunday morning). Seriously though, the prices are amazing, the whole wheat waffle and eggs is the bomb.com and the service is always top notch! Keep it up, Koffee Kup!"}
{"text":"We stopped there on our way back to Chicago and really liked it. Nice small town feel, breakfast food quality you expect, very efficient (not terribly friendly but they were very busy) and cute atmosphere. It felt like a lot of locals patronized the place which is always a great sign. We had eggs, omelette and french toast for our toddler and everything was good. Coffee was terribly weak but very typical of these breakfast places so no complains. I would recommend it, better than any chain and nice to think that we are supporting local businesses."}
{"text":"Best place to get breakfast in Stoughton! It can be crowded on Sunday mornings when Church lets out. Just work around that and you can usually get in within a couple minutes."}
{"text":"I live in Stoughton and this is where I go out to eat 99% of the time. Reasonable prices, food is great, service fantastic, and I usually have food leftover for another meal. This is locally owned and a family restaurant. I forgot they have great home made desserts. Best pies!!!  My friends love to go there when they visit me from out of town."}
{"text":"If you want your food hot, quick, and tasty, you need to go to Koffee Kup! 5 stars for service AND food, this place is so awesome we ate there 2 days in a row while in town for a hockey tournament! (And the prices were very nice, someone else said \"1990's pricing\" and I think they might be right)  It's small and stays busy, so getting a table can take a few mins, but it's definitely worth the awkward feeling you might get while standing in the small amount of space available.   When we ordered on our first visit we told our waitress that we would have a limited amount of time because of the game schedule, she was very considerate of our time and brought the check with the food but still checked back and refilled our drinks as necessary. She was our waitress the second day too and remembered special requests we made the day before, which is pretty impressive considering how many tables she must serve every day!  They have the best sausage links I have ever tasted, and while we didn't order complicated food, everything tasted so great! I had sausage links and French toast the first day, which is available by the slice, I was full after one slice; the French toast isn't as sweet as many places tend to make it, which was actually a welcomed treat.   The second day I had eggs, meat, and potatoes; eggs came out perfectly over-medium, the hash browns were perfectly cooked with the perfect amount of crispy; I added cheddar cheese and onions and the onions were cooked just enough to add excellent flavor but not be mushy.  The picky eater at our table (he's 8) actually ate all of his French toast and 2 sausage links, even though he insisted he, \"Wasn't hungry\"!"}
{"text":"Quality food at a fair price, Ken and his crew know what to do they will save you money too."}
{"text":"This place has Great food! They also have fast and friendly service! Up to date they use I pads to put in your order so your food can get started faster!"}
{"text":"Simple diner food, very friendly, fast service and the price is right.  It is seat yourself so walk in and grab a table, it can get busy during lunch and there isn't much room to stand around and wait. Soups of the day and specials are on the chalkboard wall."}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time in 10 plus years. I was born in Stoughton so for me this place is very nostalgic for me."}
{"text":"I am here visiting my friend and me and my boyfriend stopped in to the restaurant. It is heavenly! The biscuits and gravy are so good! And they come on a huge plate! Definitely a place you need to try! Amazing service!"}
{"text":"Great homey diner. Reasonable prices, homemade food. Good for breakfast, lunch, & dinner. Our home away from home. Always busy, always good!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is an update on the Greasy Spoon. Food seems fresh, original. Sometimes service can be lackluster at best. Best place for original Breakfast in Stoughton!"}
{"text":"I eat here a couple times a week... it's that good.  Perfect diner combination of great home-cooked food, great pricing, and friendly service."}
{"text":"Typical diner food in a typical hometown Stoughton atmosphere. Great breakfast, great soups, great pies. Always a good value. Service is usually great, with the occasional grumpy server. But I think that just adds to the ambiance. :)"}
{"text":"What a delightfully perfect small town cafe.. great eats.. fantastic service.. great prices..  I truly don't think I could come up with a single negative."}
{"text":"I was going to give this place a 5 star rating;  except for that stupid baby!  I'll get to that later.  We stopped here on our way to wild cat mountain state park.  First the town is aaaaaamazing!!!!!!  It still has many small businesses you don't see that much anymore!    The restaurant is small but we were able to get the last table without any wait at 9am on a Saturday!!!!! Awesome!  We ordered our food and it was fresh, and super tasty!  We tried the ham and cheese omelet, it was delicious and the ham was huge!!!!! It was just what I like huge meat! I got 2 eggs potatoes and side bacon!  Bacon, 3 prices, long, thick, juicy.... It was great! All for 13 bucks... That included the coffee which was under a dollar.. it was not some cheap swirl... It was good stuff!  My only complaint was the crying baby!  Get that nancy some baby benedril so we can enjoy our meal... And Or leave it at home unsupervised to care for itself.  Food excellent, coffee great, town amazing, baby you suck, everyone else your cool!"}
{"text":"This place has fast service, great food, cheap prices, big portions, and a good location, right on the main street of Stoughton."}
{"text":"I have eaten here 3 times. They have good food. I've had the party melt, burger, fries, eggs and bacon. All were very good."}
{"text":"I like little spots to snag coffee while I work or find a quiet breakfast. I also like places that serve ginormous pancakes at 2pm, converse with me only when I look like I want to be chatted up, and are owner-operated. They meet all of these marks.   I might see a few too many Sysco boxes, but the quality of the house-made pies show that they're still doing scratch production.   I do have to say though, that the ladies who work here might have to go a little crazy when it gets busy, but it serves to show how much business this place deservedly brings in."}
{"text":"love this place for breakfast! it's like dining in mayberry - so cute!  servers are so friendly and glad you are there. the food is hometown/home cooking with prices you can't beat with a stick!"}
{"text":"Wow! Amazing prices and super friendly service. It's tight quarters when busy but still comfortable. I had the whole grain pancake with strawberries and was very impressed. The strawberries were not fresh but it was freshly whipped cream. Delicious. I will be trying this out for lunch and dinner soon too."}
{"text":"Great place to stop if you're biking through the area! Given that most small town businesses are closed on Sunday, it was great to find this place open and at such an early time. Simple and good selection of food, and getting your own carafe of coffee is much appreciated and makes you feel welcome to stay a while."}
{"text":"Had to try this place after reading the reviews.  This is a new favorite!!! 10 am on a Saturday and very little wait time. The food was great and the service was nice. I can see why so many compliment the coffee... delicious!  Inexpensive prices and stellar food!"}
{"text":"Not my cup of tea. I didn't like that the waitstaff all shared tables and that they all seemed  to just be going through the motions. Too many tables crammed in a too small place. Felt dirty, mediocre food, took forever to pay.  I really wanted to like this place and to have a cute little diner in our hometown for Sunday breakfast. Not so, won't be back."}
{"text":"The food is amazing, service is meh.  I have never eaten a bad breakfast at the Koffee Kup. The food is always amazing, and the biscuits are to die for.  The only complaint I have is; occasionally you turn invisible to the wait staff. Usually after your food arrives. Other wise, the wait staff is friendly and fast."}
{"text":"I just feel like I need to write a review of one of my favorite diners.  I lived in Stoughton for about 10 plus years. We ate at the Koffee Kup frequently and have NEVER had a bad meal.  They have always been busy. They really need to expand.    Anyways, my kids and I happened to be in Stoughton a few weeks back and ate at the Koffee Kup.  My daughter had never had a burger here and tried it and loved it.  I usually always get the omelette and hashbrowns which I got. My only complaint (and the reason for only 4 stars) was that I ordered a cheese omelette but she had typed in a cheese and mushroom omelette.  I hate mushrooms otherwise I would have eaten it. So she took it back and I got a new yummy cheese omelette.  The waitstaff is busy and not much smiling, but not unfriendly.  And you are jammed packed in there. We were sitting closest to the door. I overhead a man who brought his friend here that the food is really good but they need to expand. He is right.  But again, the locals frequent it all the time. The food is very good.  So take a chance and try it out!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Good food, friendly people, quaint.... Helped us decide that Stoughton will soon be our home. Ken, the owner, is terrific. Can't wait to get to know the town better.  Other foods tried by our table were plate sized pancake, eggs Benedict, and whold wheat waffle. All were delicious and priced low. Don't miss this place--if you need to wait a bit for a table, it's totally worth it!"}
{"text":"Great food. Their garbage omelet was off the charts delicious. Great fast service. Their hot chocolate tasted homemade and slow cooked and I really want to come back and try the pie. Just a great place with really good prices."}
{"text":"At 1PM on St. Patrick's Day, the corned beef and cabbage were disgusting. Dry was an understatement. I thought it was thick cut bacon. Or jerky. And to think the person who wanted to take us and show us our FIRST St. Pat's corned beef? The cabbage was mush. The only good thing we're the boiled potatoes. Although, we didn't have any butter and our waitress was too busy to check. Next time anybody's restaurant tries to get away with serving me dog food, I will send it back. I couldn't even hardly eat any of my plate."}
{"text":"Best small town breakfast place ever!    We moved to Stoughton about a year ago and were finally able to venture out to the Koffee Kup, and I'm sad that we've been missing it all year!  Depending on the time you go, you may have to wait for a table, but the wait is worth it!  I had the eggs benedict with hashbrowns and of course coffee - YUM.  Their hollandaise sauce was so creamy and tasty!  My husband got the plate size pancake and cornbeef and hash.  Both were really good!  They put vanilla in the pancakes and they taste like dessert!  No syrup needed!  We'll definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner and breakfast recently.  I was surprised at how tasty it was.  For dinner my pork loin was solid and at a very good price.  The only complaint was the canned peas.  For breakfast, the omelettes are good and they give you a lot of American fries (home fries).  The service was very friendly too.  They let you linger.  Exactly what I want out of my diner."}
{"text":"I love this place. Good food at a great price. Hard to go wrong here any time of day."}
{"text":"Definitely worth going out of your way to eat here.  Stoughton is about 30 minutes outside of Madison, WI.   Make the trip!  All food is served hot, fast and delicious.  Imagine a restaurant with honest home cooked food and this is your place.  Order your meal but make sure you leave room for your desert - pie!  They can get busy, so expect there might be a short wait, but it moves pretty fast.  Can't beat it."}
{"text":"Under a friends request to give \"small towns\" a chance, I ventured to Stoughton to explore with her.  Our first stop was the Koffee Kup.  A bustling little spot on the main street (which was quite charming in itself) we only had to wait about 5 minutes for a table to open up.  We were lucky to get a table by the window and were quickly offered menus with a friendly smile.  I cracked open the list of offerings and looked for beverages...and was immediately excited...a bottomless cup of coffee was only $.95!  Yes...that is under one dollar!  Holy buckets.  After perusing the menu and nearly gawking at the unbelievable cheap prices our waitress returned and took our order on her ipad mini (quite an oxymoron it seemed!).  I made a substitution without issue and had my broccoli and cheddar omelet on the table in mere minutes!  The portions were great...not too big to stuff yourself but enough to feel satisfied and justify the extremely reasonable prices.  Our coffee stayed full and our service was great and when we were finished there was still a steady wait of people in the vestibule.    Quaint spot, quick service, great food, insanely reasonable prices...a great start to \"small town\" exploration!"}
