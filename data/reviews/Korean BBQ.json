{"text":"Oh yes, this is real Korean BBQ. One whiff and I was transported back to my Galbee and soju-drenched Berkeley days...aah memories.   If you've never experienced Korean BBQ - please go now! For beginners you really can't go wrong with Galbee...thinly sliced beef with a slightly sweet marinade that makes me wish I had the birthright to know its composition.      The oh-so-polite servers will help you cook whatever you order at your table should you don the \"I can't do this with chopsticks!\" look - so fear not, K-BBQ neophytes.   There's also a sofa with a bigscreen and karaoke machine should you drink SO MUCH soju you feel compelled to make a complete ass of yourself (we did).   Oh, and for pete's sake, please do not waste a trip to Korean BBQ by ordering a rice dish. Korean BBQ is all about the MEATS!"}
{"text":"Bad experience!  The waitress let me know from the beginning that she would not have too much time to serve me because she had a big party to tend to so she rushed me to place my order. Than I asked for a glass of wine and she said I would need to buy the bottle. Problem with that is I'm driving so...yeah. Than they bring out the bulgogi and for $17.00 bucks I got a few bites of meat are you kidding me!!. The meat is good, the sides are ok, service not good and the price for the amount of meat is terrible!"}
{"text":"This place needs to get their act in gear before they lose all business.  The poor waitress was completely overworked at 9pm on a Saturday night, serving the entire restaurant (of six total people); she was on the verge of tears, it seemed.  The food wasn't bad, but the service was really terrible."}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch and I can't wait to go back for dinner.  Our waitress sensed our lack of experience made 2 recommendations from the lunch menu.  We had bulgogi and a chicken bulgogi.  Both were fantastic and came with rice, sauce and 7 small side dishes.     For lunch they do not cook at the table, but for the evening meal, each table had a cooking surface.  Such a great experience."}
{"text":"Finding good Korean food is really difficult in AZ, however Korean BBQ is consistently good. The interior certainly isn't fancy, but I care more about the food than the ambiance on an average night. The Kimchi and other side dishes are very tasty, (the kimchi's spiciness isn't dialed down for American taste buds) the Jap Chae is absolutely delicious, and I have never been let down by their Gal Bi. They have Soju that is worth drinking as well as a couple Korean beers and you can always ask the extremely friendly waitress or owners for a recommendation. I have been to Korean BBQ many times in the past and intend to return in the future."}
{"text":"Stopped by on a Monday around 1:15 pm and there wasn't anyone in the place other than the waitress. Since there were 3 of us and we wanted our meal cooked on the grill table side, we were told at first that the food would be made in the kitchen. We asked if we ordered from the dinner menu would it be possible for the table side grill and we were told yes.  The food was good and the sides were alright, nothing spectacular but not bad.  The bill came out to $70 with an appetizer and 2 grilled meats. A little pricey for lunch, but we wanted to have our food grilled in front of us. Service was good and very accommadating to our request. We will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Just went here for dinner and was told in an empty restaurant we need to wait 20 minutes because only one server is available. Close your doors for good if you can't service people!"}
{"text":"We split our time between California and Colorado, and eat a ton of Korean BBQ in both places. We were driving through Arizona and had a big appetite, decided to look for some KBBQ. It was excellent! The selection of banchan wasn't as varied as we are used to, but every dish was excellent, the lotus root was particularly good, and the kimchi was on point. Sam gyup sal was also worth a specific shoutout, and all of the food was worth coming back for. We will absolutely be coming back next time we are in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"Worst service I have experienced for a very long time. We were met with a hostile attitude and asked to wait for one of the three tables yet to be cleaned. She chose one and waited about 30 minutes to clean it. After we were sat, we waited another 15 minutes to even be acknowledged (she breezed by and mumbled something). Another 20 minutes to get a drink order in and so on, and so on... All the while watching the two other tables ( Korean parties ) get the experience I was trying to give my family. This was their first time and I have always loved the Korean BBQ experience. This was the first time I have tried it outside of Los Angeles and I was extremely dissatisfied. The food was sub-par and we were charged an arm and a leg, plus automatic gratuity for the worst RESTAURANT experience I have yet to have in AZ. THIS PLACE IS A HUGE WASTE OF YOUR TIME AND MONEY!!"}
{"text":"Unclean, children yelling in back, just had a skeevy vibe. Left without ordering, mostly due to the aforementioned reasons, but also because we never were able to get a waitress to bring us anything past water. I do fear that she might have been kidnapped before we had a chance to order.   Apparently Yelp wants me to go into more detail, so I invite them to go into this place and see if they have anything to add."}
{"text":"Food was good don't get me wrong they do it right here, but $80?! Really?! I was in LA where the food is usually more expensive than Mesa, AZ and had all you can eat Korean bbq for $20 this pricing is horseshit in a chef salad! But again the food was good just priced WAY too high!"}
{"text":"It's good. Eat here. You'll come back. Bring friends or a date and have a good time.  The staff will take care of you and even mind your grill. If you have questions about what you're eating, how you eat it, or how to pronounce it, just ask."}
{"text":"If this restaurant was located in California or any other state with adequate Korean BBQ selection/competition, it would surely struggle to stay in business.  However, I gave it 3 stars because it is the only Korean BBQ place within a reasonable distance from my house.  It is clear from the restaurant logo to the menu descriptions and prices that this place is geared towards non-Korean clientele.   Pros: - excellent banchan - decent service   Cons: - $14 per bottle of soju (side note: on my last visit they ran out of chum churum brand after our first bottle and had to substitute with an off-brand for the subsequent bottles...at the same $14 price) - considering both quantity and quality, the meat is over priced  - poor atmosphere and environment   Bottom line: if you need a Korean BBQ fix, this will likely satisfy your craving...but otherwise, it leaves much to be desired."}
{"text":"First, let me say that I came here expecting it to be like the Korean BBQ in Los Angeles. It was not... They cook it for you and it wasn't that great. The staff was nice. It just wasn't the experience I was hoping for."}
{"text":"So....This review is hard to write. First and foremost the reason I keep going back is the waitress. I dont know her name but she is super nice! The place itself is shockingly tacky. Every time I go one more letter of the neon sign out front has burned out. It is down to only the K and the O.  I always think of Bar rescue when Im there. This place has so much potential that is wasted. I feel sorry for the waitress..she will have like 8 tables before the owner lady finally comes to help her. Sad.  Yes...and they do always have pluming issues.  This place is a like a puppy that is so ugly that it is cute. I cant explain my affection for it. Food is good by the way..the Kimchi pancakes are awesome!!!!"}
{"text":"They were very respectful and great food and walked us through the process of how to enjoy it correctly"}
{"text":"The food was ok and grilling at the table was easy. It was dead at 6:00pm on a Friday, a bit expensive and will not go out of my way to go again."}
{"text":"Are Koreans really giving this a half decent review? NO. Because it kinda blows.  On Service-food and beverage is not a natural skill, but it would be good if they trained their staff to be more attentive (and friendly)  The food: Poor representation of real Korean food.what Korean place doesn't have kimbab outside of the lunch menu? When I went here it was considered only on the lunch menu and way overpriced and wasn't even that good. Wtf??? Their panjan is not fresh. Not to mention that they are stingy with it. The deji bulgogi (spicy pork) was not at all good and their kalbi was very fatty.  I honestly think this place is good for people who think they know Korean food (who really don't) because their friend's friend was Korean or something but most Korean loving hungry souls will go straight to Takamatsu."}
{"text":"We decided to try somewhere new for dinner tonight. Between the fact that this place is on the list for Dividend Miles dining (US Airways miles) and mostly positive reviews here, I figured we'd get some tasty food.  Now, let me begin by saying the first (and only, until tonight) Korean BBQ place I ate at was (goes to dig up the name of the place) Shilla Restaurant near Denny Park (apparently there are a few different restaurants with the same name). I'm pretty sure we got the bulgogi (marinated beef) and the chicken (marinated, too). The side dishes were all very good, seemed fresh and well prepared. Overall, a good place that we plan to return to sometime in the vaguely near future.  So, back to Phoenix, and Korean BBQ.  We get there, and maybe about a quarter of the tables are occupied. The decor is somewhat lacking, but nothing bad. One thing I did notice, that seemed a little odd, was a cleaning cart was just kind of sitting there in the middle of the dining room floor.  But hey, I'd just walked in, who knows what was going on before I got there.  After a few minutes, we were seated. After only a short time, we were asked for our drink orders. My husband ordered a Coke, and I got hot tea and water. My hot tea came in the same kind of glass tumbler as my water did. Strange. As well as the odd presentation, it really wasn't very good tea.  After a little time, we placed our order for the same beef and chicken dishes we'd had in Seattle. Seemed like a safe option. Shortly after, the side dishes came out, as well as some lightly dressed romaine salad and three large romaine leaves for \"wraps\". After setting these on the table, the waitress lit the grill and left it to warm. Before leaving, the waitress dumped a small dish of sliced raw garlic and jalepeno on the heating grill.    About five minutes later, our raw meat arrives. And this is where I start to get uncomfortable. You see, some years ago, I had to take a food safety class. I know all about cross-contamination, how it's bad juju, and what you need to do to avoid it. I'm guessing at least our waitress ... well, let's say she's never been close to a food safety class. Not even in the same city. Anyway, I digress. So, with a pair of tongs, she places two large pieces of thinly sliced chicken breast on the grill, which takes up half of the grill. Then she takes the -same- raw-chicken-goo-covered tongs and picks up the pieces of barely cooked garlic and jalepeno off the grill and puts them back into the same small dish they began in (ostensibly ready to eat). And _then_ she puts the beef on the grill with the same tongs. She basically dumps the contents of the beef plate (beef and raw sliced onion, same as the chicken).    At this point, the entire grill is covered in a thick layer of meat. So much so, in fact, that the grill top has cooled down so much that nothing's really cooking. Just stewing in its own juices, which to me, isn't really bbq.  It's, well, stewing. She sets down the gooey tongs next to a pair of scissors and leaves.    A few minutes pass, and I take up the tongs (eew) and turn over the chicken. I take a look at the beef, but it's still a damp mess with no room to spread out on the grill. The waitress comes over, physically takes the tongs from me and starts messing with the meat herself.  Okaaay. Then she takes the scissors and starts cutting the meat up. The still raw chicken meat. Cuts the large pieces into smaller bite size pieces and leaves it to cook on the grill. Then, and I really shouldn't be surprised by this at this point, she picks up the beef with the tongs and slices a few pieces of it into smaller pieces with the _same_ scissors what just snipped up the half-raw chicken. A few more times pass where I go to flip the meat, and she comes over and takes the tongs away from me, and does it herself.  And some more meat snippage.  Finally, we get to eat. It's not bad, but really not very good. None of it, sadly. It's not -bad-, but definitely nothing I'd repeat. Not once during our meal did anyone come by to see if we were doing okay, ask us if we needed anything, refill drinks or anything.    Oh well. On the plus side, we got to try a new restaurant that wasn't completely horrible. On the downside, I'm now at home with an upset stomach and preoccupied with cross-contamination nightmares."}
{"text":"Sad to say it's been WAAAAYY too long since I\"ve been here. A buddy from back at home (Seatle) was craving some spicy Korean pork so we all went here for dinner last night. I'm ALWAYS a fan of Korean BBQ, and this place does not disappoint. We ordered the Kalbi, marinated short ribs. We also went with the Spicy Pork in Red Pepper Paste (Dwaeji Bul Gogi, it's not as spicy as it sounds but very good). The last meat dish we ordered marinated chicken, Dalk Gui. We started with an order of the potstickers and they serve this killer lightly dressed salad with a touch of white vinegar, sesame oil and salt and pepper. In typical Korean BBQ, the bring out an array of small side dishes to complement your BBQ. Some are spicy (different types of kimchee), some are salty, some are hot (last night, one dish they had was this awesome tofu that had to have been cooked on the flat top) served with this good sauce, boiled eggs in soy sauce and a sesame sprout salad. This is one of my favorite parts of the experience, you get all these cool little side dishes to eat with your rice and BBQ. On to my favorite reason to come to Korean BBQ. There's a grill in the middle of your table and a hood above your table. They bring out your meat already marinated, and you just grill it up as you like it and as you're hungry. The marinades are out of this world and the food is simply great.  Now that's just an option, you can have the cook it up on your table or in the back in your a weenie. Overall, for 4 of us the tab was around 115, but that was for 3 meat dishes, an appetizer, all the sides, rice, few big bottles of OB Korean Beer and two small sakes. If you're looking for something new and a tad bit adventurous, this is it"}
{"text":"It was a Monday night and I was craving Korean food. I arrived to the restaurant 30 minutes to closing, but they still welcomed me warmly. I really wanted Sol Long Tang, but they said it wasn't available. I got a Kalbi Tang instead wanting some sort of brothy meal.   My server who is also part owner chatted with me and was so kind to make sure everything was okay with the food. When the owners really show that they care about their customers, it makes such a big difference.   The ban chan was very tasty with 6 different little dishes and a few Korean pancakes. My kalbi tang was extremely flavorful and satisfying. I ordered a bibimbap to go and it was equally as delicious eaten the next day."}
{"text":"I ordered a beef noodle soup here and was greatly let down. There were a few pieces of disgustingly old beef and the noodles were over-cooked to the point of falling apart with a single touch. Not to mention, the broth was obviously prepared from a great amount of chicken broth and laden with MSG as I was super thirsty after. The banchan was horrible and inauthentically prepared - it lacked depth and there was no aroma of sesame oil. The saving grace of this review was my mom's gamjatang, which came with 4 to 5 pork bones, filled to the brim (not pictured). She loved and praised it a lot!"}
{"text":"A little below average. Any food joint that operates inside of a food court is given the same level of expectations as I would for any standalone restaurant - because regardless, they are still considered as an established business in the food industry.   The prices are cheap, but the food almost always has no flavour and seem to be effortlessly made (ex. I've had instances where my soup would be lukewarm) The pork bone soup came out warm and didn't came with much soup. Most of the bowl was covered with a huge bone barely covered in meat.   Regardless, the lady (assuming the owner) is really friendly and I wouldn't mind coming back just to help her out. I've tried the kimbap which was made fast, but it was not as delicious as other kimbap I've had before. The rice was a little cold and hard and the ingredients that they put into the roll did not seem as fresh."}
{"text":"Purchased a Groupon and thought it was a great deal. ( $40 worth of food for $20.) So my husband and I were craving Korean BBQ and headed out here on a week night.  We walked in and there were only 4 other people inside at the time. And they were non-Koreans which was surprising to see. The waitress was Korean and sat us down at a table. We decided to order my favorite meat (Chal Doel Begee) but she said they didn't get the delivery today so they were out. We then selected our 2nd choice which was Galbi and then she said they were out as well.   We were definitely disappointed and we should have just walked out but we were too hungry.  She said the pork belly is their specialty and they had it in stock so we went ahead with that. Typically pork belly is a cheaper meat at Korean restaurants so I usually try and avoid ordering it. But had no choice.   Growing up in LA, I've used to great side dishes at a Korean BBQ restaurant. They brought out 4-5. They also include green-onion mix(par-ree chae) as well as lettuce and garlic.  The total came out to $48 so we used our Groupon and in the end paid $28 including tip.   It seemed like there was only one waitress working and one bus boy at the time. Since it wasn't busy, we didn't wait that long for food but I could see it being a long wait if there were bigger crowds.  It looked like they had a full bar but didn't see a bartender.  I'm not sure this is the standard of Korean dining in Arizona but if it is, i'm going to have to drive home to LA for Korean food in the future.  The only bright spot is they offer Karaoke and have separate rooms for that. Not sure how much that costs."}
{"text":"What kind of business doesn't hire enough people to be able to properly service a half empty restaurant? Today we sat at a table for 40 minutes and didn't get even get to put in an order before we decided to just leave. Last time I was here the cook had to come out to help us because the one waitress who works there was so overwhelmed. It's a shame this place is so understaffed because I've been here before and the food is decent.   Unless they hire more people I wouldn't recommend coming here. They can only handle two parties in the restaurant at a time."}
{"text":"My family and I come here when we crave Korean BBQ and our budget allows.  The servers are always friendly.  My glass is always re-filled in a timely manner and it's pretty easy to catch the waitress' attention if I need anything.  The food is really good.  As with all restaurants like this, if you're a crappy cook, or if you for some reason not good at flipping meat over a grill, then by all means, ask them to cook your entree in the kitchen.  The side dishes are excellent.  They give you a good variety.  If you happen to run out of a particular one, just ask for more.  I've been dining here for about 7 years now, and I look forward to more years of their delicious food and good service."}
{"text":"Had a hankering for food from my people so Jon brought us here.  LOVE Korean restaurants that allow you to grill at your table. We had the beef and spicy pork. Both were excellent.  The small dishes of goodies were all excellent - not a piece of anything left over.  Service was a little slow but we weren't in a hurry.  Clean, just kind of an old look."}
{"text":"In terms of food I give this place 3.5 Stars.  If you are looking for great Korean food try Takamatsu.  That said, their kalbi and bulgogi were satisfactory.  They really lack in service - mainly courtesy.  Before I discovered that Gameworks had Karaoke, my friends and I went here to sing Japanese songs because it was the only game in town.  At first we would show up randomly with large parties, which I could tell they were a bit annoyed with.  Later, we got into the habit of reserving their Karaoke room.  Every time we go nowadays, we're given then \"Oh it's you\" look.  I'm not exactly sure why, as our group pays the bill for the room, orders food and drinks and pays the added gratuity - shouldn't they be at least a little nicer about the business?  It's gotten to the point where I don't even recommend the place anymore."}
{"text":"We came here in a group on Saturday from LA. The food is good but the service sucked. I give three stars for the food. I won't go into details about the fly in the water... The chicken Katsu and beef bulgogi was tasty. The side dish of the veggie pancakes was nice too.There was only one server working with a useless manager not to be found till the end. We asked for multiple things and were left waiting. I'm told that the sides were refillable but we only got one dish replaced. We're aware that there must not be many options in Phoenix for Korean bbq like there is in LA. This wouldn't be good enough in LA service wise but the food is good!"}
{"text":"Upon first entering the establishment my boyfriend and I noticed it had a rather run down interior that probably wouldn't meet health code with the visible water damage on the ceiling. The only thing to keep us company aside from Asian pop-music videos was the sweltering heat! We got our food to go, only to find out that most of it was too fatty to be edible. Needless to say $45 dollars later we were left with greasy fingers and empty tummies! Never going back!!"}
{"text":"There was nine in our party when we visited for dinner on a Friday night. There was one more table with a big group and then another table with a couple dining. We stood at the entrance for about 5 minutes until we were finally acknowledged.   Our waitress sat us down and then ran to the back. She then came back out and took our drink orders. She then proceeded to the other tables and kept running around some more I'm not sure doing what.. She brought out our drinks and we told her we were ready to order. So we ordered.  There were more then a couple of dishes that we wanted that unfortunately she said they didn't have or that they ran out.. um ok. She then lets us know that she is the only one working so that it's going to take some time.. um  ok. So to make it short, service was bad, food was not great, and the bill was expensive. Skip this place. There are other Korean restaurants around town that are BETTER.   Oh and then she runs out the restaurant saying we took the wrong receipt... (we had left it in the table)"}
{"text":"Was not very happy with my experience here at all. The service was horrible, we received no drink refills the entire visit. There was one server for the entire restaurant so service was insanely slow. We asked for forks twice and never received them during the visit. The grill/bbq went out half way through cooking the pork, we were able to finally get the attention of the server and tell her we needed it to be lit again... Then waited 15+ minutes with the half raw pork just sitting there before the waitress bought a lighter over and lit the BBQ again. This meant that 2 of us had food and were pretty much finished eating before the 3rd of us even got to cook his food.   The food was not good enough to excuse the long frustrating meal. This will be the last time we go here."}
{"text":"We got lazy and desperate for Korean food.   We initially drove to Fmp for Korean express after reading all the great Yelp reviews.   Alas, they were closed....   So we settled for Korean BBQ.     Pros: we were lazy and it was next to our bbt joint.     Cons: we asked for extra spice.  Seeing as we are Asian, the Korean owner perhaps thought we couldn't handle it and made it mildly spice.   Even the Kimchi they served as the mini app was spicier.   I got the Kimchi soup.   It was full of..... Tofu, some Kimchi and some mixed leftover meat pieces.   It was not Spicy, and pretty bland to be honest.   After I finished all I wanted was more water because of all the salt I just finished.  The rice was just regular, not that amazing soft and slightly sticky Korean rice.   The husband got the Gamjatang.   At least he had adequate protein.     I know, keep your standards low at a food court.   But for the price we paid $8 for gamjatang and Kimchi soup..... I'm going to complain, just a little.   Thank goodness they didn't serve us with those challenging Korean chopsticks.    Unsatisfying, Korean food that will need to be washed down with another serving of bbt!"}
{"text":"I guess the saving grace of this restaurant is the flavor of the food. The ban chan dishes were pretty standard but tasty. The bulgogi was good and the spicy pork was marinated in a sauce that had both me and my friend rhapsodizing over the flavor. But then, there's the service. I arrived at 1 pm on a Saturday and my friend arrived 10 minutes after I did. we placed our orders shortly after he arrived and it took a while before the server lit up the table grill's burner; I was glad when she did because since I arrived I had been smelling gas coming from underneath the burners and was getting a bit nauseous. Then we waited and waited ... and after a long while the heat had  mostly dried up the cooking oil coating the surface of the grill, and the meats still haven't arrived. Eventually, a full hour after we placed our order, the meats for grilling arrived, and they stuck to the now-dry grill surface during cooking. Nevertheless, the flavors, especially of the pork, were very good. It's just too bad that it took so long to get our food - there were only 4 tables (including ours) with customers. There was only one server and we wondered half-seriously if she was also the only staff member in the restaurant at that time.  So ... we certainly liked the food, but the very long wait made us decide that we would not be making the long drive to this place any time soon."}
{"text":"If you're expecting an upscale atmosphere to go along with the $17.00 entrée prices, then you're going to the wrong place. This restaurant is nothing short of a hole in the wall with an interior to match. But if you want authentic, absolutely yummy Korean dishes served just the way you like it (since you cook it yourself), you've found your spot. The service depends on how busy they are; expect only 2 or 3 waitresses for the entire restaurant even during busy times. During peak hours and days, you can plan on having an empty drink glass for awhile. But if you're lucky enough to be there during a non-rush, you won't be disappointed. The short ribs are nothing short of amazing and the side dishes are ample and fresh. I love bringing my kids and cooking our own meat over the tabletop grill, and they love trying new things. Plan on walking out with a $50 tab for two and a full tummy. This place won't disappoint."}
{"text":"First time coming here, highly recommend the Bul Gogi. Thinly sliced meat you cook at your table, the sauce they bring you to dip it in is so so good. The sides that came with the meal were just ok. But it was a fun place to try! The restaurant is pretty plain and wasn't very busy on a Saturday night but we would come back!"}
{"text":"It has great reviews but I am really confused why. Maybe I have just been spoiled by great Korean until now? The place is fairly large and really old and worn looking inside. The food was mediocre at best. We got the ribs and beef and two bimbi bop. They were all mediocre (at best) and prices were pretty high. Service was decent. I will most likely never return."}
{"text":"I love K BBQ as I found some hit spots in Vegas and K town in LA.  When I walked into this place with my buddy at 5 I found nobody.  Typically I turn right back around and say screw it but I decided to take a seat and try it out.  The meat tasted good like it's supposed 2.  We ordered bulgogi n thin beef.. Chad o wak....  Or something.      Forgot what it was called.  The girl serving us could crack a couple jokes and keep us interested while cooking.  What I didn't like was the sides.  Kinda half assed and not much flavor.  Also there were 3 other people workin there but nobody else could say hi.  For a place that doesn't get much biz It all makes sense.  They price their menu like a standard KBBQ place n they would get so much more biz if they came down from where they were at."}
{"text":"Decided to try this for my first time after reading Rick W. review. Service was wonderful. Polite and attentive waitress who answered all my questions. Went in the evening and size of the  beef bulgogi I ordered was enough for two. I counted ten items total brought to my table. Enjoyed them all except the cabbage dish as I'm not a fan of cabbage. There was a glazed crispy item I was eating like a cookie that was very tasty. Waitress told me it was a lotus blossom root. Hope I have that right. Will definitely go back to try other items."}
{"text":"\"Ignorance is bliss\" is often quoted to imply that what you don't know won't hurt you.  If you agree with this statement, DO NOT READ ON.  What you are about to read will open your mind and perhaps your horizons leading you to become an enlightened individual and possibly, even the next Buddha.  Ok, I'm pushing it I know! ;-)  You have been warned.    Perhaps you don't have any Korean friends, or Korean influences in your life.  Perhaps you never visited Asia and learned that the cuisines of China, Japan and Korea are distinct and unique from each other, EVEN when they are the same.  Example: fried rice made by a Chinese, Japanese and Korean chef will be totally different from each other.    Perhaps you can't understand the differences between Chinese, Japanese and Koreans - as a people and as a culture.  Asia is a large continent, as is Europe.  French cuisine is not the same as Italian cuisine.  Spanish cuisine is totally different than English cuisine.  In the same regard, Korean cuisine is different than Chinese cuisine.  This restaurant calls itself a Korean BBQ establishment, but if you take a person of Korean descent here they will tell you the cuisine at Korean BBQ is nothing more than the Chinese interpretation of what they BELIEVE to be Korean BBQ.  The management and execution of the Korean BBQ concept is most definitely Chinese.  Nothing here is authentic.   This is most definitely NOT Korean bbq.  Yes, that's what it's called, but with Chinese management and execution, the purity of the cuisine is no longer intact.  What does this mean, exactly?  It means, a Chinese run Korean joint may not even give you \"pa mu chim\", fresh \"sang chu\", the \"ssam jang\", the authentic homemade \"ban chan\"...I'll stop there.  When I went here, I was given none of these.     My Chinese friends used to go to this joint with their families.  They actually thought it was Korean food.  When I heard this I took them to one of the many Korean establishments in the North York area for real Korean BBQ - as real as it can get in Toronto, anyway.  They were blown away.  Why?  Because they ate Korean BBQ they way it was meant to be eaten.  With 1) Ssam jang = slightly spicy miso paste; 2)Sang chu = Korean lettuce (for wrapping); 3) pa mu chim = a \"salad' of green onions, tons of garlic and bits of lettuce used to put in the wrap;  4) an array of authentic ban chan = small sides served with the meal;  5) Korean rice - two choices of white or red bean.  Oh, and yes, we had SOJU with our meal!!!!  Without it, how can it be Korean BBQ? ;-)  Someone once said:  \"The mind is a curious thing, once in a while, new ideas are introduced and the mind expands; and once done, it can never shrink to its previous size.\"  Ever since this outing, they [my Chinese friends] NEVER frequent this Chinese run Korean BBQ joint.  In fact, they live in Markham but drive all the way to Yonge and Finch when they feel for real Korean BBQ.  Let me be absolutely clear:  there is nothing wrong with eating here if this is what you like.  I ate here because, at that time, in my youth, I was on a budget and couldn't refuse the all-you-can eat aspect of it.  I knew it was not authentic but I was happy to eat as much meat as possible.  If you are aware that what you eat here is the Chinese interpretation of Korean BBQ and it falls pitifully short of the real deal;  more power to you!  Enjoy your meal.    However, if you care that you eat the real-deal and don't want to be mislead, go elsewhere.  Or, should you choose to remain - for whatever reason - enjoy the food and remain blissful in your present state."}
{"text":"A better name would have been Korean BBQ and Child Care Center.  :-( Loud children running from room to room make for a tense meal. The waitress was very nice, but did seem overworked.  There was another woman working, but she chatted behind the bar and didn't seem to be very helpful.  The food was good but not spicy at all. Asking for Sriracha was like pulling teeth. It wasn't bad but Chodang is waaay better."}
{"text":"If I eat food from different cultures, I always prefer that the ones preparing my food, serving me food, and patron eating the food are all from that culture. It tells me, \"THIS PLACE IS AUTHENTIC.\" And that is what Korean BBQ is. The servers barely know English and I LOOOOVE that. The patrons near me....same thing! There are karoake rooms, etc. This place is awesome. I have yet to find any other korean bbq place that lets you cook your OWN meal on your OWN table on your OWN, just like Los Angeles.   I take dates and family here all the time!!"}
{"text":"Very friendly and helpful. The food was very good made me feel like I was back in Korea. It was clean restaurant the bathrooms where nice."}
{"text":"To be honest, I didn't expect such poor reviews of this place because I used to come here often and didn't mind it. The place is situated in the corner of First Markham Place's food court and offers a selection of Korean food.  Food: 4/5 First off, it's nothing fancy. It's food court food and it's not going to be 100% authentic; most of the time. Do not have high expectations for any of the food you try in a food court.  I almost always get the Bibimbap set. The set comes with a bowl of bibimbap (carrots, zucchini, bean sprouts, shitake mushrooms, beef, lettuce, and a fried egg with raw egg yolk), a side of banchan (korean side dishes), and some type of instant miso soup. They give you the option to spice up your food with gochujang (hot pepper paste) sauce as well (trust me, you want this stuff). Mixing the bowl up all together and eating it with your spoon is the best way to eat it.   The food is seasoned well, the veggies are stir-fried/pickled well, and the portions are generous. The banchan (kimchi, cold stir-fried glass noodles, and pickled bean sprouts) is standard stuff, nothing unique or special; just there to fill the rest of your stomach.  Decor: It's the food court, good for a quick fix.  Is it worth it? Yes and no. The food is great, but I can't say anything about the other dishes as I was never tempted to try them. The bibimbap set tastes good if you're craving a quick Korean fix. This used to be the cheapest option (around $6 after tax), but they gradually kept raising the price (it's currently $9 after tax) and now I have to say I'm quite disappointed. The quality of the food stayed the same, but the price now matches other Korean food chains; which makes me feel like finding a tastier/cheaper alternative is the better option. For that, I'll have to rate this place three out of five."}
{"text":"We came in last minute and my friend and I are probably the most indecisive people but the waitress was extremely nice and helped us out asked about what we like and how we felt about cooking about ourselves. When the food finally came out there were so many side dishes and she even cooked the meat for us at the table cut it served it told us what would go good together etc. the food was very good and inexpensive compared to other Korean places I've gone I'll definitely be coming back !!"}
{"text":"Dwaeji bulgogi was very good, a tad fatty but flavorful. The pan fried dumplings were much better in the sauce but were still kinda meh. Granted, we were there at lunch time and weren't able to get the full-on BBQ-at-your-table experience. The extras they give definitely gave you a tour of Korean cuisine, though I have to say their kimchi was kind of flavorless and didn't have any heat whatsoever.   The large TV playing afternoon sitcom reruns did lower the class value of the place, considering I didn't see any kids running around, I'm not sure who all they had it on for."}
{"text":"I had udon soup from here and it was awesome! It was the first place I tried boiled octopus and I fell in love. Its pretty cool in there too. You even have the option of cooking your own food on the small teppanyaki grills on the tables. I don't know too much about Korean cuisine but it seems pretty authentic to me. The staff is very nice, and the portions are enough to fill you and then some. If you're craving high quality Asian, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"This is a really good restaurant!  A must try for people who like Korean food!  Favorites: Bulgogi with lettuce wraps and chap chae  I really want to go back to try the karaoke here."}
{"text":"Food is great. Services is always The same. The lady there... the only lady there. Is Neutral not very good but not bad. I love That this place is never crowded when I come.  The Ban Chan is always good. Bulgogi is my favorite.   A little pricey for a lunch special. Came out to about 50 something which what I normally pay when I order dinner. Feeling a little ripped off.  I got less portions and paid same price as dinner during lunch.     Oh well. Gen was Packed at Tempe so this was my last resort to get my korean Food fix"}
{"text":"Super good good!! You can cook the meat in front of yourself so that you know it is cooked to perfection and a great experience!! They offer many different sides and are extremely personable!"}
{"text":"Selected this place for midweek dinner with family.  The waitress was friendly, efficient and served us well.  But her English was just enough to communicate.  The food was OK.  The kimchi condiments were mediocre. The meats - we had beef ribs, sliced beef & chicken - were well marinated. Overall experience = Average."}
{"text":"My Girlfriend and I were craving a good Korean BBQ place and remember this place across from the Angry Crab.  When you walk in, it feels like this was a dance studio that had some tables placed through out. The decor is pretty bad and the Korean owner sat at one table and glared at us. We were the only customers in the restaurant.  After a couple of minutes, a hostess seated us at a BBQ table and took our drink order. We received out drinks (a coke and diet Coke) about 10 minutes later when she finally checked up on us.  The food came out in normal amount of time and the fire pit was lit promptly.  The food was pretty bland and not memorable. I am Korean, born in Korea and know Korean food. this was pretty tasteless and every thing we tried seemed to follow suit. the appearance was very attractive, but missing flavor.  My girlfriend and I drank our cokes and put them near the table edge to indicate that it needed refills. She noticed the glasses and said she would give us refills. That took about 26 minutes. That is not an exaggeration. We never got the sauces we asked for and she spilled some of the BulGoGi sauce on the table the taste there for about 15-20 minutes before she brought 2 napkins to clean it up. It was still on the table after she cleaned up.  When we were finished with our food, she came back with our drinks. We told her that we need the check and she quickly left. She came back, not with the check, but to ask if we needed boxes. She then came back about 10 minutes later with our check. We were the only ones in the restaurant.  The food was not terrible, but horribly plain. the service was unnecessarily slow, and the owner kept staring at us while we ate. Definitely not a place to to go back to.  If you are looking for great Korean food, it is worth making the trip to Hidori, or Takamatsu (if you want BBQ).  I hope this helps."}
{"text":"Please bear in mind that I try new things as they come. Korean has always mystified me.. I never even knew anything about it until one day me and the mister were cruising around (speedo shopping for our trip to Puerto Vallarta, j/k!) and happened upon this place.  Okay I have to say I was blown away! This place is awesome! The service was pleasant and they completely demystified Korean BBQ for us.. my tummy is happy we went! Had the beef with mushrooms as well as the pork slices in chile paste. The server cooked the food in front of us on the tabletop grill which was very cool.. the food was fresh and just delish! The panchan was fresh and many, I think about 8 in all.. Oh the dressing on the cabbage salad, just amazing!  If anyone ever wants to go out for Korean, Im so there!"}
{"text":"This place is so good, the meat is very fresh & the kimchi is best taste in Arizona also side  dish is so delicious every single items. I'm so glad enjoyed lunch & dinner at Korean Bbq.  I'm highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch and was surprised to find myself as the only person in the restaurant.  One of the humerous things that I found as I walked in was a sign that advertised karoke all day every day.  I'm not a huge karoke fan, but my wife is, so this will have to be another dinner visit another time.  The service was extremely friendly and timely, unlike some others have reported, so that was a pleasant surprise.  I ordered the beef bulgogi for lunch. As one would expect a host of side dishes arrived before the main dish.  Most were the type of vegetable sides that would be expected, although there were a few surprises.  The kimchi (two different types) were a little more mild than I normally prefer, but still tasty. One of the surprises that was a new thing to me was a brown, firm, starchy sort of thing that looked like a symetrical cross section of a sea sponge.  It was tasty, although a little odd to look at.  The beef bulgogi arrived in short order and was quite good and ample for a lunch price and portion, especially with the large cup of rice that accompanied it.  No major surpises in terms of flavors for typical Korean BBQ.  I was invited to come back for dinner and was promised that the table-top BBQ units are in use and the menu consists of cook at your table selections of meats.  I'll definitely return to try dinner and for another run at lunch to try some of the other menu items."}
{"text":"Korean BBQ -- Warning while attending and eating Korean BBQ please dress appropriately!  After effects may include - full belly, the need to use a toothpick, flush face (especially when you're Asian), and YOU SMELL LIKE YOU JUST ATE SOME KOREAN BBQ comments!  I should have known, but I enjoy putting on a nice blazer -- that now needs to go to the cleaners.  Moving on, Korean BBQ is a small mom-pop shop.  The name of the restaurant got to the point and no beating around the bushes here.  You get what you order.  Grill your beef strips and pork fat yourself!  Hmm ain't nothin' like some pork fat over some Hite & OB beer -- Soju doesn't hurt either, but make sure you can handle yourself after a few rounds.  Overall, the food was pretty good and authentic here. Service was lovely and our waitress started the grilling for me and showed me the tools and tricks. Yes, my friends I'm not much of a cook even in front of a grill.  As I said early Korean BBQ is a small shop with some basic decor.  They have a full bar, but I didn't take advantage of it since I was busy trying to grill haha! They seem to have a karaoke room that was empty.  Not sure if they have karaoke nights, but let me know and I'll bust out my Bruno Mars impression! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"So this was a very bad experience for my husband and I. We came in and it was empty, dark and gloomy feeling. The waitress placed us at a table in the dark! I could barely see my food! All that aside, its a bit pricey. We asked if the 20 something worth had a good decent amount of meat, she said its quite a lot. She brought out the meat and it had only 4 pieces. The rice was really soggy. The table was real sticky. I was just expecting way more out of this place i guess. I think it could of been better if they just clean it up a little bit more, make sure that they give more meet if we are paying 20+... i know meat isn't cheap but wow 4 sorry pieces.. sad sad sad.   Overall i mean, the people seemed nice but it just was not a good experience overall. Hope they can make some adjustments to make it better. It has potential."}
{"text":"Went there after a long hike at Flat Iron.  3 miles one way with 2,500 feet elevation change- 6 miles total!  Took us 6 hours and we were ready for some fine Korean BBQ afterwards! Interior looked a little shabby.  Loved the side dishes, goog pork with spicy red pepper, bul go gi, and I had the beef with cabbage spicy soup.  All good~ not excellent.  Friendly service."}
{"text":"This was awful. I mean awful. The server was rude,and for some reason refused to speak to either me or my roommate, but instead would only speak to my wife which made the situation uncomfortable. The server became upset when I asked for a fork,instead of chopsticks,even after we explained I had a disability that prevents the use of them. We ordered dinner plates and we're served lunch size at the dinner price.  We had to request my soda several times, it was only brought after my wife asked for it. when our bill came it did not match the menu prices, when that was pointed out we were told they would fix it. the fix was to charge us more than the original bill. Ridiculous. We will never eat there again nor recommend it."}
{"text":"Found in the food court in first markham place highway 7 and woodbine. The employees were very friendly and if you were to look for a Korean place to eat here definitely pick the pork bone soup which is the most popular dish here.   With tax, the pork bone soup is $9.00 and it comes with a side. Portion size is very filling and it's enough to fill one person, pork bones have generous amounts of meat worth the price."}
{"text":"I don't know why there is all the hate, the food here was great and at a reasonable price! The server was nice, so I have no idea why people are complaining about it. It is true that the place looks a little shabby and we were the only ones there for quite a while until some other parties came in, but there are little to no cook-yourself-kbbq places in AZ and this place is awesome. We went on a Friday night and I was surprised it was completely empty when we first came there, but definitely give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Had a kimbap craving yesterday and went to Korean BBQ in First Markham Place.   Ordered Kimbap, Tteokboki, jajangmyeon.  Kimbap - while it didn't exactly taste bad it wasn't delicious, just bland.  The rice was dry Tteokboki - a little too sweet, I couldn't finish JaJang - pretty tasty  Nice people working there."}
{"text":"Everyone, step back and look at where this place is: The food court of First Markham Place. If you're seriously expecting top-of-the-notch Korean food and authenticity, you've most certainly are expecting too much and should be looking at places such as Mi Hyang nearby or places along the Korean strip on Yonge or Koreatown in Toronto.  This place, while obviously not the best Korean place I've ever eaten, satisfied me considering the price for the food here. Ramyun doesn't even cost more than $5, and a pork plate only costs $6.50! Obviously with the prices you're paying you wouldn't be expecting five-star quality from the food.  Would I come here if I'm looking for actual Korean food? Definitely not. Would I come here for something that's on a budget and is edible to the point there's actually taste? Certainly!"}
{"text":"It not a flashy restaurant. Little run down looking but it has always been consistently good food and service.  One of my favorite places to go."}
{"text":"Dont be fooled by the unoriginal name \"Korean BBQ\", this place is pretty good.  The interior is a little dated and worn, but its otherwise clean and tidy.  The place is spacious enough for big groups and they do make special accomidations for your big parties.   One of their specialties is Korean BBQ cooked right in front of you and KARAOKE!  yes a wierd mix but it works for me.  We had a small get together for my bday party and decided to get some korean bbq.  So this place came to mind.  If you request to get the food cooked in front of you, then you'll sit a special table with a built in grill.  4 ppl per grill and 2 girlls at a table.  They say that the meat portions serve 1.5 ppl.  So you're party of 4 will most likely need atleast 3 entrees to fill everyone up.  And they're right, the portions are a little small for the price.  So you might need to go 1 meat entree per person if you're a big eater.  However the food is very good.  We shared 3 entrees per grill, the kalbi, bulgogi and the chicken.  Only the chicken entree was lacking in flavor, everything else was very very good and perfectly marinated.  As for the sides, i know they change from time to time so its hard to rate them, but they were good.  The service was good also, could have been that we were the only party there but she was very attentative.  After a few ginormous shots, it was time for some karaoke.  The set up is fairly decent and the seperate room is actually big, can accomodate atleast 20 ppl.  And more importantly, there is a door to shut in the music and singing.  The selection is ok, mostly older song and mostly korean, but they have english and even vietnamese songs if you were so inclined so.  So in review, this place has good korean food with ok prices along with 2 karaoke rooms.  A good local place for korean bbq.  and even to bring a large group.  Pros: - great kalbi! and other korean meats - you're choice of cooking it yourself or have them do it. - they have a full bar with great drink prices - 2 private karoake rooms  Cons - not a knowledgable bartender - smallish proportions if you're a big eater"}
{"text":"The food here was okay, nothing bad, nothing great.    Best thing of the night was the grilled beef tongue.  Thinly sliced and nicely marinated.  The service is a bit on the slow side, but friendly.  I will say that that the prices are high for the portion size.  There were only a few banchan dishes, I'm used to Korean eateries where the banchan covers the entire table.   I live in Southern CA, where there is a plethora of Korean eatery options, so the prices tend to be lower and the quality better.  Not a bad option for the area."}
{"text":"The Korean BBQ is okay here, but the side dishes lack flavor. One of them was a bowl of pepperoncini, like the kind that comes with pizza. We were literally the only ones in the entire restaurant. I prefer Takamatsu."}
{"text":"Dirty....bathrooms smell like sewer gas.....no one in there....expensive....tired looking.....food average.....NO!"}
{"text":"I've been going to this place for at least 10 years now.. They've always had the same waitress and I call her older sis in Korean. She's very nice but she doesn't have a great memory. You'd have to remind her your drinks or the extra garlics sometime.. lol  Food is pretty good here and they're always kinda slow.  After all I like this place and I give a 4 stars."}
{"text":"Hidden gem in the heart of the city. Good portion sizes and it was fun to learn the right technique to make the best bagogi"}
{"text":"Food was OK. Service was slow and the restaurant itself is really dated and not as clean as I would like. My son got very ill after eating here?? Coincidence? I don't know..."}
{"text":"This is a pretty decent korean bbq place in AZ.. considering that I am starved from the good stuff in So Cal.  The lady was really friendly and even offered to help us cook.. I know most people like that but I'm a big of a control freak so it made me uncomfotable when she was cooking and telling us what to do.  Just let us do our thing without us being pressured to stuff our face with the meat you cooked.  The pan chan was decent, no potato salad, decent radish kim chi.  The brisket was chewy.. I'm just really missing So Cal korean bbq but this holds me over till I visit home."}
{"text":"Kalbi is very good. My kids love the Kim bap but they only have it available half the time. The panjan never disappoints. Service isn't the friendliest, but I challenge anyone to find me a friendly Korean joint."}
{"text":"I don't get the low rating for Korean BBQ. Yes, the interior is a bit shabby and a bit too empty ... but the food was seriously the best Korean I've had here in AZ. Plus, the pricing was a bit decent in comparison to other Korean establishments I looked up prior to dining here.  Incredibly empty, there was one party of about 8 people dining here and a family of four on a weekday night. The interior is fairly large, drab interior and empty.  Ordered the Pork Belly (Samgyupsal) and Bulgogi for Korean BBQ which came with a Green Onion Salad, Lettuce, Pajeon and Kimchijeon and side dishes (Ban Chan).  The pork belly is frozen, but still good. Bulgogi had a good marinade and tender. Intrigued they gave Pajeon and Kimchijeon, although the latter was not as good. These fried little pancakes with veg are delicious and filling. The side dishes were okay, but lacking. Kimchi, pickled cucumbers, braised lotus root and fish cake were served. Glad they gave us Green Onion Salad, Lettuce with the little helping of garlic and Jalapeno to eat with the pork belly.  The service was actually really nice, we were checked up on often and the lovely lady even made sure ask if we knew how to cook everything (which we did)- but thoughtful! Price was decent as previously mentioned it was about $13-$17 per plate of meat. Good portion and side dishes were refilled when asked.  For the price, the food and service was good. Yes, you will smell like KBBQ but that's pretty inevitable especially with overhead smoke extractors."}
{"text":"Food was really good here! Just wish there was more of it for the price. We all left full, but I'm just used to bigger portions when we go out for KBBQ.   I understand what the other people were saying about the service, but it didn't bother me that much. The waitress was really nice and I just let her know whenever we needed help because she was doing like so many other things...   Definitely planning to come back here!!"}
{"text":"Every time I go to first Markham place, I always eat at the food court. I was craving Korean food and decided to go with this place. It was my first time getting something other than bubble tea or food from yan can cook (another stall within fmp) I didn't expect too much from it as it is inside a food court and the prices were slightly cheaper than outside restaurants. The food was great, nothing too fancy, I found that it was on the sweeter side instead of savoury.  It also came with side dishes and miso soup which was nice, I love Korean side dishes!  The lady at the front was also very friendly.  Overall, it was okay, it was a little below average if I were to compare it to other Korean restaurants I've been too."}
{"text":"worst restaurant ever!!never come here!!wait hour for food , said all you can eat blah blah...not at all !!!!waitress never come after first order wait for other 30 minutes my soup never come ,ask them alot of times until we decided to leave and they charge us with bottle soju we never order and they did the same thing to the table next to us !!becareful!!!"}
{"text":"First thing's first. My dad is addicted to Gyu Kaku (Chicago location). Like seriously, he is. So when we were in town, he really wanted to go to a place similar to it. My brother and sister-in-law had heard of this place through word of mouth and decided to venture out of their comfort zone with us in tow.   The place looked like it wasn't open or was in the beginning stages. It almost looked like it had been a small town college bar at one time. Our servers were nice and put up with our questions and requests (like refills). It's a little on the pricy side, but we did get more sides than expected."}
{"text":"It was fun to cook at the table and my son really likes this place. Not sure how good the quality of meat is as it was fair to me. Seasoning is good and I would try again. Everyone at my table liked their meal more then me. I would try again."}
{"text":"KBBQ YOU CAN GRILL AT YOUR TABLE!   As everyone has mentioned before, the restaurant is a little unappealing to the eye. Kind of dark, kind of dull and boring, but at least it seems clean! There are a few tvs which play korean music videos on the wall which kind of help the bare orange walls.   The waitress is very nice and attentive. She always checks on the table, refills water, and refills all the unlimited side dishes too.   I was a little disappointed that half of the things we tried to ordered \"ran out\" when we had come in on a Monday afternoon. We ended up getting bulgulgi and spicy pork to grill at our table. Nothing too crazy but good enough to statisfied our craving. I wish there were some dipping sauces which came with the meal. Our meats came with some tasty korean side dishes, salad, rice, and yummy asian pancakes (?)   Overall, I'll probably come back because the food wasn't horrible, price was pretty standard, korean side dishes were good, and I do love cooking my own korean bbq at the table.   Environment: 3/5 Food: 3/5 Price: 3/5 Service: 5/5"}
{"text":"Passable for a korean bbq place. Had the usual ribs, bibimbap, bulgogi was good as usual. However the dumplings were not as great as it should be. The kimchi was ok and so were the sides.This is as good as gets in Arizona I suppose so I cannot be too spoiled coming from Portland with great BBQ places. I still ate and finished as much as I good, so of course it is not a 4 star. It was disappointing that they did not have the seafood pancake...as much as the waitress tried apologizing...she seems to be apologizing all the time. I feel bad as I am sure she wants the business to succeed  How to improve? Easy...make sure the service that everything is right the first time...all sides and rice given in a timely manner and inform guests of what is out on the menu. They should procure better better quality meat as I can see the meat was not as red as it should have being."}
{"text":"Wow this place is amazing!! It deserves more stars than it has. The service was awesome and the food was super good. Its a little pricey but totally worth it despite what some other reviews say. Definitely will come back!"}
{"text":"It has been a while since I've been back but you really have lost a star in my eye due to cutting your portion in the BBQ at least 25% and I have received the smallest portion I ever seen in any restaurant  for the Squid Salad for $9.  I just wondered am I being punished to be place in the darkest corner of the restaurant as well.  That said, I still love your Dook Mandu Gook.  You are still friendly to both us but I know other customers may not be so forgiving."}
{"text":"Side dishes are great but wasn't a traditional korean sides. What it appears to be a vegetable patty was a little too oily as if it was deep fried. Server wasn't as welcoming & never came by too see if everything was okay or refill of water. I ordered yookkejang & it had a lot of meat & vegetables but little bland & oily. I personally like what it appears to be a home made kimchee. It was delicious!!! Not sure if I would recommend as korean retaurant."}
{"text":"Even though I still have 4-days of Vegas places to review, I -had- to review this first.  So my mister and me came here tonight for dinner.  We live pretty close so we always see this when we're running errands.  Tonight was the night we were gonna eat eat eat!  Since the place was so busy, service, of course, was lacking.  The menu itself was odd.  Siu mai and tempura, Chinese and Japanese flair, at a Korean restaurant?  How odd.  Anyways, we ended up getting Jap-chae, Bulgogi with mushrooms, and pork belly.  As I sit here now at 3:49am eating leftover jap-chae, one conclusion comes to mind:  Eh, I've had better.  Here's the breakdown:  Jap-chae:  Standard, saucy, and oily!  I'm not talking about a little oil.  I'm Asian.  Such things don't bother me.  But there is A LOT of oil.  It's kind of a put off since I ordered a noodle dish and not a box full of oil.  Bulgogi with mushroom:  Very flavorful, juicy, and yummy.  They give you three types of mushrooms.  With such a signature Korean dish, I doubt they could mess it up.  Pork Belly:  It came to our table frozen and was the most disappointed with this dish.  It ended up being super tough!  Overall, I don't think we'd be coming back.  The waitresses were really nice though so don't be frightened away!"}
{"text":"The K BBQ here I've found to be quite tasty but the service has been pretty hit-or-miss. I think I've been 4 times and 2 of those times the service was pretty darn rude.   The last time my date and I just ordered one thing because in the past we totally over ordered. Our server gave us that snide look that implied, \"That's *all* you're getting?\" That's how both of us interpreted it anyway and she didn't pay us much attention the rest of our meal, even though there was only 2 other tables of people in the entire restaurant.   Also, our meat has burned on 2 occasions because the waitress waited too long to come and flip the meat. I wish I would have just flipped it myself so I didn't get those little badly charred bits in my Korean BBQ. The food is pretty good but I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"This restaurant was probably the most uncomfortable dining experience I think that I have ever had in my life... My boyfriend and I looooove korean bbq and we were looking for a good one in Arizona.  First of all, we were the only customers in the restaurant for dinner.  Whoever owns the place probably lives there in the back room; his/her friends and family were there and kids were running around like it was day care, there were toys and homework on the ground.    The worst part of the experience was the service.  The waitress was very nice, but she stood right at our table the entire time we looked at the menu, hovering until we decided.  When I tried to tell her I wanted the bibimbap she tried to tell me that I wanted something else and that I would like it better, and I insisted that I wanted bibimbap, but she kept insisting that I get other things that were more expensive than what I was choosing.  She seemed very pushy and did not understand the concept of a menu and ordering things.  The food itself tasted good but was completely overpriced.  You also do not get to cook the kbbq yourself, they bring it to you already cooked.  Maybe I am just spoiled living in southern california where Korean BBQ plates are about $15 for all you can eat, or even less, but we got a korean bbq plate for about $25, and it was only one plate, not even all you can eat, which was absolutely ridiculous.    If you are expecting AYCE KBBQ that you cook yourself, or decent prices then this is not the place for you."}
{"text":"Great 1st time experience w/ my family! We got a bunch of different dishes & just shared everything. The kimchi here is great. I would say that if you're not familiar w/ Korean food to start by trying the kalbi or bulgogi (beef) with rice or bi bim bap (mixed rice, beef, vegetables w/ a spicy sauce). During happy hour they gave us 'buy 1 get 1 free' beer which was awesome. I'll definitely be back here"}
{"text":"I love Korean food....but I honestly don't think I can ever come back here again.   First, the restaurant is so dark that I could barely see the menu. The tables are so greasy to the point that I didn't even want to put my arms on it. I thought to myself that it is normal since the tables have BBQ grills on them. As long as the food is good, it doesn't matter to me. We orderd a Kalbai and bulgogi (BBQ ribs and beef) so that we would cook it ourselves. We also ordered a side of dumplings.   When the waitress started up thr grill, i immediately notice that the top of the grill was bend and broken (Really?). Dumplings were completely burnt. Kalbai and Bulgogi were so oily that I could barely finish them. They do offer many different types of kimchi. However, half of them were so soar that we could even eat them. To make our experience here even worse was the horrible ventilation system. The idiots behind us clearly didn't know how to cook their own food. They messed it up so bad that it smoked up the entire place. Their vent just didn't do a good job of taking care of situation such as this. I basically walked out of that place smelling like BBQ for hours!  The only reason I still give this place a 2 star is because of the waitress. Service wasn't great but that was only because the restaurant is short staff. Not her fault at all. I saw the owners walking around doing their own thing, but would not lift a finger to help her. She was the only waitress sitting the guests, cleaning tables, serving food, and checking people out. That is just wrong!  Ill never come back here again"}
{"text":"I love this place. The bbq is amazing. If you order from the BBQ menu, get number 3 (ribs) and number 5 (beef with mushrooms). I've been here three times and have never been disappointed.   The korean pancake is goood, however, it's a little thicker then the ones I've had in New York, and sometimes the seafood is a little chewy. I wish they had the plain scallion pancake, I like it better than the seafood one. And no, they don't give as many condiments as other places I've been....but, considering they are not exactly close to any Korea town, I think it's authentic enough for the location (Mesa, Az!).   The place itself isn't much to look at, but the flavorful food more then makes up for it. Every time I go, it's the same waitress, and based on what I've read from other reviews, I'm thinking she IS the only one. We went there this evening, and almost every table was full and yet she was the only one serving. So, serivce was needless to say, a little slow (hence the dock off one star)  Other then that, I'm a fan of this place. I'm glad it's just around the corner from us!"}
