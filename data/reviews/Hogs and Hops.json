{"text":"Best BBQ in town!!! Gotta try the beef ribs and the brisket!! Definitely killed the craving and will be coming back!! This Joey maggorie is one hell of a chef!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I were looking forward to a good RIB dinner.  I enjoyed my combo chicken and ribs. Both were moist and flavorful. However, my wife ordered a half slab of dry rubbed baby back ribs and found them to be overly salted and dry. I agreed. Could only eat two ribs before she couldn't eat any more.  Server was polite and asked my wife if she wanted something else.  Service was excellent and dinning area clean.  PS. I make the best BBQ ribs.  My first review. Can I brag?"}
{"text":"The clan and I walked in off the street in search of a dinner spot, we happened to be served by a lovely waitress by the name of Sarah. She sat us down and began to explain her story. As waitress/preschool teacher/pathologist her excitement radiates onto the eaters and allows them to feel the most welcome. During our stay at the slaughterhouse, we had a joyful match of duck duck goose, of course with cheerful preschool teacher Sarah. I am definitely not the only one who walked out thinking the experience was filled with benevolence. Great food."}
{"text":"I have no clue how this has such good ratings. This place was not good. The service was horrible. We didn't even get offered refills the whole time we were there. AND ITS LIKE 100* i was so thirsty!. The waitress hardly even looks at us or talked to us. And shoved the bill at us rather than even asking if we we were done or wanted dessert or anything. And the food itself is nothing to crave for. The sauce is like from a bottle. Sweet baby rays is better. The fries tasted like they were from a frozen bag. The hush puppies were sick. And the Brisket I ordered was all chopped and gross. My husband didn't care for his pulled pork either. Lucille's in Tempe or Bobby Q's are wayyyy better!!!! Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Great bbq!  Have had the ribs and pulled pork, both were great. Wide selection of craft beers. Very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Looking for a spot to eat for lunch in Gainey Ranch and happened to come across this place.  OMG delicious!! I ordered a combo platter with 1/4 rack of ribs and 1/4 chicken.  The side I chose was the baked beans and also got the charred corn on the cob.  The platter was only $12 and let me just tell you, you DEFINITELY get your money's worth.  I ate everything on my plate.  The chicken was tender, the ribs were very meaty.  The baked beans were outstanding.  Looked like 3 different beans they use and a good portion in a bowl on the side.  The bbq sauce it was all cooked in was very tasty.  I asked for more on the side and they brought it out right away.    I wish I got the names of the staff, I didn't :( But the service was friendly and prompt and it looks like they all help each other out.  The owner or chef also came out to ask how everything was, which I thought was a nice touch.  I am pretty stoked we have a BBQ place of this caliber in this area, as I don't really know of any in the immediate area.  I really hope to see this place succeed and bring in some big business.  Amazing, will for sure be back!!!"}
{"text":"FANtastic! Brisket was perfect, ribs were flavorful and cooked to perfection. If you appreciate well flavored and well cooked BBQ, stiff cocktails, good beer and larger than life jalape√±o poppers, welcome home. BOOM."}
{"text":"My second visit. 2 stars because the Suh-sweet sauce is amazing, ribs not great but the sauce makes up for it. Unfortunately, the best part of my meal was the Texas toast, which was burnt to a crisp. Please see the picture I added. I can't believe they let it be served out of the kitchen. Where is the quality control?  Disappointed. I live in the neighborhood, love Bbq and gave this place another chance long after it's initial opening."}
{"text":"5 star for the onion rings, 2.5 star for the ribs (bony and dry) & 3.5 brisket (a little dry), 4 star for $6 kids meals (food only - not incl. drink)  and 1 star for a $2.75 kids milk.  They had about 20+ beers on tap though I did not try any.  No outdoor seating but great service with our waitress."}
{"text":"This establishment is all over the board, so hard to rate. We tried it four times before reviewing.    The positive:  great beer selection we have enjoyed our selections each time. The BBQ meats are good..we hv tried all except the chicken.  Nice to see beef ribs on the menu but they are a bit skimpy on the meat and the silver skin on the back of the ribs make them difficult to enjoy, so will probably not order those again.  We felt the brisket was the best, and it is a nice serving size. The side dishes are all good, the grilled corn especially yummy and our favorite.   The price point is good and it is one of the few BBQ restaurants in No Scottsdale so that is a nice addition.  The negative:  corn bread and the deserts all need some serious work.  Corn bread is a no brainier and I'm not sure how you can mess that up.  It was pale in color, bland and doughy.  We tried the pecan pie, and after the disappointing corn bread we specifically asked if it was \"made in house\", and told yes.  However.....the crust was stamped, a la a frozen pie shell, no hand crimping was the first indication that this was not housemade, the serving size was a mere sliver not even sure how you could actually cut a piece of pie that small.  They were generous with the pecans so that was a plus, but maybe only a teaspoon of filling at the most.  Like the corn bread, just a strange, below average, interpretation of a simple classic item that just needed good execution.   Meals are all served on a quarter tin baking sheet covered with a sheet of paper...a cute idea for a sandwich, but for a meal where meat is the standard entree and  you need a knife to cut it, you will end up picking off bits of paper  through out your meal, not pleasant.  So over all on the big stuff, like the meats and side dishes it was above average.  Just ask for the corn bread to be left off (trust me on this) and don't order dessert.  stick to their great beers, meats and yummy grilled corn and you will have a good experience...oh and remove the paper lining before you shred it with your knife of fork...your dining companions will also appreciate that you aren't fishing  paper out of your mouth while trying to eat.     a finale note... no wipes or hand towels provided napkins are a roll of paper towels, so you will leave with sticky fingers if you hv the ribs or wings."}
{"text":"It has been a long time since i have had bbq this good. The ribs were perfect the brisket sandwich was mouth watering and service was fantastic. Waitress kharissa was friendly and went out of way to make us feel welcomed. On a sunday business was kind of slow so everyone needs to support this great bbq restaurant. I am from southern arizona but anytime in scottsdale will definitely return."}
{"text":"Went there at 4:00 p.m. on 9/30/15, a Wednesday, and the restaurant was already out of sliced brisket. Additionally,we ordered a salad with a barbecue item and were given a small metal container of salad dressing and barbecue sauce. When we asked for  more, we were not informed there would be an additional charge.  It is not the cost factor, which is minimal,  it is wrong to be charged for items when not notified that there would beadditional charges, particularly when you are given a small amiunt to begin with. Barbecue restaurants generally have an abundance of barbecue sauces at no additional charge and give you more than you want or need. Further, while the server was pleasant, service was extremely slow when the restaurant and bar was not busy. The food items we ate were tasty and of good quality but overall the experience was less than satisfying."}
{"text":"Really really good food. My husband says best brisket ever and he eats out all over the country.  Not your typical BBQ place.  Everything was great!"}
{"text":"Being from Kansas City I've been looking for a good BbQ place since moving here 3 years ago and i think I've found it!"}
{"text":"The best beef ribs ever!  Very knowledgeable, helpful staff, too.  Surprisingly affordable, considering the tony Scottsdale location.  Hope they do well, we can walk there, which is a real asset, with the 9% beer available!  Is now on our \"whenever I don't want to cook\" list."}
{"text":"great food, from the burgers to the pulled pork, brisket and chicken, awesome beer selections and excellent customer service...highly recommend!!! will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Finger licking good food! Great service, and atmosphere!!! Food came very fast and they have a great selection of beers on tap!"}
{"text":"Disappointed based on the many rave reviews here.  We had a half rack of sweet ribs and a half rack of dry rub ribs.  Both were tough and the meat had to be ripped off the bone, definitely not fall off the bone as I was expecting.  The meat lacked depth of flavour and needed BBQ sauce to combat the dryness.  The baked beans were nothing special, stewed in an overly sweet sauce, again no depth of flavour or smokiness.  Also ordered the Cobb salad and it was probably the best part of the meal... which isn't saying much when salad is the best part of a BBQ dinner.  We won't be returning."}
{"text":"I was just in St Lois 2 weeks ago and had some of the best ribs I have had in a long time and I've been craving it ever since. I finally found this place and I love it. Ribs,  slaw , and cornbread, I could eat those food groups everyday.  Our server told us to come back for their new breakfast place right around the corner.Over all, super cool place, great beers, service, and they definitely know how to cook!!"}
{"text":"This place misses as a good BBQ restaurant.  Service was fine but the food lacked smoke flavor and and tenderness that is normally associated with a good BBQ joint.  Most BBQ joints you smell the smoke when you walk in the door.  That is not the case here.   I recommend Don and Charlie's instead."}
{"text":"We were really looking forward to this place.  The person that sat us was great.  After that, the service was almost non existent.  Food was below average."}
{"text":"This is by far one of the most legendary upper end barbecue places I have ever been. Don't be fooled by the classic Decour or modern/country music - this place is all about the food and satisfying your hunger.   We went in on a Wednesday and it was relatively quiet. Like most, we assumed that we were misled by other reviewers but since we already drove to the place we decided to try it out. I'm really happy we did so.   We got the chicken wings, ribs, brisket, fries, beans, and, most importantly, the potato salad. The food was totally on point. The meat fell off the bone, was very savory and left you wanting to more. With the size of their portions, luckily we had more. But we just couldn't eat it.   The staff were very friendly and we were greeted by the general manager who was an absolute sweetheart. She took the time to explain to us how everything is cooked and prepared and why there establishment was different than others.   I'm sad to be writing this review because I do not want you guys to go to this spot. If more people found out how good it was then we probably would never get a table. But then again, I would never want this place to not be in business. So if you're ever in the area, or even if you're not, and want some well done, properly prepared barbecue food I highly recommend you check this place out. Odds are you'll end up writing a review that is longer than most as well. Cheers"}
{"text":"Definitely had better bbq.  Just not very good overly fatty brisket and dry chicken.  Pulled pork was good but nothing makes this place stand out to the other amazing bbq places like Bobby qs or little miss bbq"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, great food and beer. Should consider making mac and cheese an optional side."}
{"text":"Owner contacted me and was very concerned about my bad experience. Offered to buy us lunch and give them another try. It took me over a month before I felt ok to go back. Briget was our waitress and was so nice. I did not mention my last experience untill after the meal so I could give an honest review. We were greated right away and told to sit anywhere. Water was brought right away. Service was great five stars. Food was good. Nothing special but hot, good portion. Tasted good. So I feel they deserve four stars."}
{"text":"Wonderful find! We tried the pulled pork platter, brisket platter, chicken platter, and the rib platter. We sampled each other's food and no one had a complaint about anything. Service was wonderful, and Hannah was so nice and helpful!"}
{"text":"They're starting out great! Once they have an idea of how much they need to prep for service, they'll really shine. I say that because my family and I went in one evening and they were out of a lot of things that we were planning to try. Even though we didn't get our first choices, we were very happy with our second ones. BBQ restaurants can be tricky because a lot of the menu items take time to make and once you're out, you're out. Definitely coming back though, earlier in the evening this time!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for lunch today, almost drove by because it looked closed - so glad I stopped.  Service was fast, food was good and a fair price.  I was by myself so I didn't try any of the beer selections but they had many great beers on tap so I will be back.  I had the half chicken and I want to try the wings."}
{"text":"Ahhhhh-mazing! My burger was perfection. Brisket was crazy good along with the beef ribs! Staff was fun and super friendly. In love with the decor!!!"}
{"text":"The beer list was impressive. Ambiance was ok. The BBQ left a lot to be desired (I had the pulled pork and chopped brisket as they were out of sliced). The sauce was mediocre. Not sure if i would return. May give it one more chance"}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite neighborhood spots. The brisket is outstanding. The Caesar salad is the best I've ever had. They have a great selection of beer and the whoopie pies for desert are delectable!"}
{"text":"We had a little staycation in Scottsdale and this place was recommended by yelp reviews.  They did not disappoint!  I was so greatful for the vegetarian options (specially for a bbq place) I had a quinoa burger which had cheese and Avocado on it.  Loaded with flavor! ( I'll order it without the bun next time. ..too much of the same textures)  The fries were good (soggy since we ordered take out,  but good) my husband stated all the meats he tried were delicious. (Pulled pork, chicken,  and beef) the kids and hubby loved the baked beans. They said they had a sweet start and finished fresh making you feel like they really put love into making them."}
{"text":"I was invited out by my fiancee's parents to eat at Hogs and Hops and for once, I purposefully didn't look anything up on here or anywhere else so I could go into it with a fresh mind and I was a bit disappointed.  Their old fashioned on tap rootbeer was delicious but they served it in a glass with ice which should not be the case, especially if it's from the tap and it's cold already. You wouldn't put ice in your beer would you?  Our table ordered the hush puppies and onion rings as appetizers. The hush puppies were the best part of the meal, it was mixed with a little jalepeno and melted in my mouth. Before this I thought I didn't like hush puppies and now I stand corrected. The onion rings were either well under-cooked or the onions inside were just too thick. The batter was flavorless though covered in seasoning salt (which I enjoyed) and the thick, crunchy onion inside wasn't what I usually expect when it comes to a well-prepared onion ring. It was as if they were opposite onion rings with a crunchy center and soft outside.  My dinner was the slider trio with a side of baked beans. The sliders bun bottoms and tops were attached together with piles of meat on top. Isn't the point of a slider plate to be able to enjoy three separate sandwiches? It was difficult breaking them apart, keeping the meat on the sandwich and at the same time trying to separate the pork from the chicken and the chicken from the brisket. The baked beans tasted like they added kidney beans and a small amount of other spices to a can of Busch's and they were so hot (temperature) the entire meal that I could barely eat them.  Overall the meat was good but there are definitely better places to get BBQ in the valley (see my other reviews). I was also surprised to see nobody in the restaurant at 6:30 on a weekday. There were maybe 3 or 4 people at the bar and the other party in the seating area knew a few people associated with the restaurant.  The service was excellent, they were very friendly and well-attentive. I'm also wondering if their location is what's hurting the business. They used to be Notorious Burger (an item they still have on the menu) but The Shops at Gainey Ranch isn't really a culinary hotspot in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Wow what a great new spot! Coming from the south I have been waiting for a good BBQ place to open.  Well that place has arrived! Amazing brisket, hush puppies, wide array of beer selections.  I can't wait to get back and try the ribs.  Service was great.  Definitely worth checking out if you crave good BBQ!"}
{"text":"Went back to try the food again after Joey sent me an email offering me a $40 credit. When we arrived, we found out that they had made changes to food and staff since we were last dining there four months ago. One of the best changes was the addition of Linda,the manager, who was friendly and guided us through our meal. Everything was great and much improved.  Hushpuppies - flecked with jalapeno, it has a sneaky heat. Dippping sauce cools. Ribs - more tender, improved, but bigger than baby backs  Mac salad - top notch loaded with veggies Burger - well cooked patty with bacon and cheddar and fries were ok. Lots of beers also and my porter was quite good as well."}
{"text":"I'm pretty darn picky about my bar-b-que.  I haven't really found a good place yet.  Bravo to Hogs and Hops.  We ordered the slider samples and the onion rings.  The onion rings were lightly breaded and large - served with a nice sauce (I would have kicked it up a notch but that's me).  The meat on the sandwiches was incredibly tender - plenty of it and the rolls were the perfect size.  The presentation was well thought on both items.  My only comment would be that the cole slaw was so-so - it needed a little more sauce and maybe a dash of spice.  The servers were very friendly.  I will say that we went at lunch and it took over 25 minutes to get the sandwiches - too long for a standard lunch break. Perhaps I should have said up front that I had limited time.  I can't wait to go back for the Hops!!  And to try all the other menu items that we didn't get this time."}
{"text":"Hands down the best bbq spot in az! Brisket was amazing. Wings were so good we had to get another order. Beef ribs were so tender and cooked to perfection. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"To be honest, was expecting better barbecue from a place that goes all out to give you a western country feel. I've been there twice hoping to get beef ribs but they don't seem to have them anymore. Brisket was okay and chicken was on the bland side. Also, only one dipping sauce was a little disappointing. A lot of potential, hope they can pull it together."}
{"text":"I decided to get takeout from here before heading to work seeing as how Hogs & Hops is one of the newest additions to the Gainey Shops which has a nice collection of restaurants. Overall it was a bit of a letdown compared to what I expected. I ordered the BBQ chicken sandwich with fries which in retrospect I probably should have got the BBQ pulled pork but it doesn't matter too much either way. While the BBQ sauce they used is quite good and the meat seemed to be of good quality, the bread that they use for sandwich was terrible and did not hold well together with the BBQ meat which was very disappointing. Also the fries that I got as the side item was lackluster.  There are much better BBQ places elsewhere and I really don't see myself coming back here again."}
{"text":"The food is good...we ordered the family pack that feeds 7-8 people....the only think that i didn't like much is their corn bread... its kinda dry. but so far its a good experience."}
{"text":"It seems like they can't decide what kind of restaurant to try here. First it was Notorious Burgers, then Notorious Kitchen (which was basically the same as the burger place), and now it's Hog and Hops (some of the burgers remain, but now there's BBQ).  I really don't know what other people have been reviewing. I got the platter with brisket and pulled pork. The pulled pork was average, but the brisket was damn near inedible. No flavor, and incredibly dry. Without sauce, it's like eating a napkin. If you need sauce on your brisket, you're doing it wrong.  Really, it was possibly the worst brisket I have had. I should've known, since there's obviously not an outdoor smoker near the premises.  If the burgers are unchanged from the previous iteration, that's a fine meal right there. But they need to learn to cook barbecue before they try to start selling barbecue."}
{"text":"A friend was in town and we went because it was close to her hotel. I really enjoyed the ambiance and the food."}
{"text":"one word - AMAZING. My husband was craving barbecue and we came across this place on yelp. The reviews were great so we thought we would give it a try! It was the best barbecue we've ever had! To say we were happy customers is an understatement. We even decided to come back the next night (our last night in town) because it was just that good!   The service was also great!  Our food came out quick & the staff was very nice & welcoming! HIGHLY recommend!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick lunch and beer. They had a very nice draft selection. We spilt the Notorious BIG burger, it was highly recommended by our server. It was very tasty and commented my Chimay nicely. We ordered a side of onion rings and there was an issue with the batter. Our server promptly took care of it and even mentioned to the cook. We will be back when we're in the area."}
{"text":"This was our first time at Hogs and Hops and we really enjoyed it. Bridget, our server, was great. She not only knew all the beers but also had a great knowledge of the menu and gave us excellent recommendations. food and beer were terrific and Bridget is an asset to this restaurant."}
{"text":"We were surprised and thrilled to see a new BBQ spot at Gainey Ranch and tried it for lunch today.  BBQ is our passion and have sampled it in two dozen states and countless restaurants.  Hogs and Hops will compete with the best!  I had the pork plate and my wife had the brisket. Both were well prepared; but the brisket had a tenderness and tasty bark like the best in Texas.  They use an electric smoker, which provides rich flavor, without the metallic or petroleum flavors that some gas smokers use.  There were large portions of both meats, served on paper the way BBQ should be.  The sauce was a nice, smooth mild blend that everyone should like. The sides were excellent, especially the cole slaw.  We has pecan pie and gelato for dessert and would recommend both.  The brew selection is outstanding and a great looking bar holds promise  Prices were about right for good BBQ, especially with beef prices today. Portions were ample, and the decor is perfect.  We had a chance to meet Simone and Joey, the chef.  Both convinced me that Hogs and Hops will become a Scottsdale favorite."}
{"text":"I too came to this location with a group for lunch expecting Notorious Burger but found Hogs and Hops.  In fairness, we were all in a burger mood.  I'll have to stop back to see how the barbecue compares and update this. The burgers were good... buns a bit dry... overall nothing to rave about. The $10 wings were just OK.  A nice casual atmosphere, good service and a good selection of beers in the $5-7 range. Ice tea and sodas are $3. Overall the pricing was very reasonable for this area."}
{"text":"Tasty BBQ with Super Service and a Good Beer (and whiskey) Selection  Celebrated my birthday here with good friends. It was our first time but it won't be our last. This place should be packed with patrons.  The beer selection was nicely varied. I liked the Hoppy Bitch but there was a good selection from darks to lights. The whiskey (scotch and bourbon) selection is also good.  I typically don't eat many breaded foods but H&H knows how to do the appetizers. The onion rings were excellent while  the hush puppies had a bit of a kick and the fried pickle was a unique and delectable Southern offering.  I had the ribs which were meaty, moist and smoky without a hint of toughness. The whole table enjoyed a variety of pulled pork, brisket and chicken. Everyone was happy. Choose from three BBQ sauces.  The servers were delightful despite our large group of 12.  Thanks much for bringing Hogs and Hops to our area. It was a wonderful place to celebrate."}
{"text":"Finally! Real BBQ has arrived to the neighborhood! It's hard to find beef ribs in town, and this place has the best I've tasted in awhile so this is the real deal. I did not try the drinks, but I noticed they have an impressive selection. Wings, BBQ, and a good beer seems like a no brainer for happy hour. It was my first time here but Sarah, and Linda the manager made me feel like I've been going there for years. Ask for Sarah. She has a smile ear to ear... She'll make you feel at home. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"What a great spot for delicious BBQ! From the pulled pork and beef brisket to the potato salad and corn bread everything was outstanding and served quickly! Great beer selection with something for everyone. Friendly and knowledgable staff along with welcoming fun decor I will be back often!"}
{"text":"Never written yelp restaurant review before but felt a duty to forewarn other people thinking of making same mistake I did. I would give zero stars if possible. My husband did not want to go here bc of recent bad reviews yet I said \"How bad could it really be, it's bbq meat\". Well..It was BAD so bad I almost didn't feed it to my dogs (I did they didn't complain so maybe this is meant for dogs?). DO NOT GO here expecting edible food.   1. This is the same owners, in this same location, from the failed Notorious Burgers, then the Notorious Kitchen, and now 4months in it's still HopsnHogs. Different names but with similarly poor quality, inedible food. 2. Smelled delicious aroma when we walked in but literally one other table of patrons. Friendly and quick service. we took food to go it was ready literally within 5 mins. 3. I was starving and ready to eat cardboard but unfortunately for me when I opened the to go boxes what I found was completely inedible. The brisket was so greasy, chopped, hash-like (never in my life seen brisket this way) it was inedible looking and the taste was worse. The grease soaked through the \"local baked\" claimed buns (by local they must mean grocery store bought bc they were not freshly made and tasted terribly). The pulled chicken looked bad but tasted worse - it looked like they put the chicken into a vitamix then set it out in Arizona sun for few hours before serving it. I ONLY tasted it so I could confirm its in-edibility and then write this review. The french fries very obviously packed, frozen and then barely cooked -really gross soggy stuck together tasteless mush. 4. The BBQ sauce this is an important one to list separately as it is a BBQ joint. The food was terrible but i was starving so I figured I could smother it in BBQ sauce so I could eat it -BBQ sauce will cover up the horrifying meat. Wrong again. The BBQ was a bizarre mixture of sweet, tangy, and spicy and just awful mixture of tastes. 5. Price and menu seemed great before seeing actual food."}
{"text":"Wow, this is a fantastic new restaurant.  We ordered pulled chicken, brisket, beans, fries, and corn.  Each item was high quality and delicious.  Plus, they have 22 craft beers on tap.  The food was all reasonably priced, including a $5.99 kids meal.  The decor was nice and not pretentious. Service was great.  We will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Originally chose to go here because of the great reviews I saw and the Groupon. I'm from California and BBQ places are a big thing in my family.   LOCATION: Great location in Scottsdale. About 6 miles from the freeway exit, but no traffic from Phoenix.   FOOD: Food was delicious. The wings were on point, the brisket was tender, and the baby back ribs were great with the \"SUH-WEE\" sauce. The sweet potato fries came with this sweet sauce that made it taste better. The coleslaw was rather good as well. We ordered a corn on the cob as another side, but got nothing instead.  SERVICE: Horrible. Right when we walked in, the waitress just stared at us as if she didn't know what to do. One waitress was on her phone while she was walking around. They altogether forgot to bring the corn after asking two different waiters. Water was not refilled at all, and it was as if the waitresses were trying to avoid us.   OVERALL: I'd go back for the food, but not the service. Can't believe we came from California for that. 4 stars for the food (wish we got the full experience), but the waiters just killed my vibe. Truth."}
{"text":"So disappointed after reading a lot of Yelp reviews raving about the BBQ here.  When I read about beef ribs using words like Flintstone and dinosaur, or brontosaurus, it gets my attention.  So, where to go on my next trip to Scottsdale?  Easy choice.    Tuesday night, just after 7 pm.  The main dining rush is over and folks are just starting to empty their tables.  I got a menu and an IPA promptly, and tried the chicken wings.  They were fall off the bone tender, but sometimes that's too far gone.  Some were overcooked or held at higher temps too long where they got dried out.  No worries, I've got a cold beer and I'm moving on to the beef ribs.  Simple.  3 bones and slaw.  No mas.  What I got was disappointing to say the least. Two ribs had virtually no meat at all.  What meat they had was burned, dry and shriveled back from the bone into a dry black ball at the base.  Not appetizing or good BBQ.  My server was great and offered to replace them.  Soon the manager arrives to say no can do.  Those pathetic bones must have been the very last they had, but the kitchen still sent them out.  Want anything else?  Nope.  He took the ribs off the bill which was fine.  They handled the problem appropriately, so no complaints there.    I can't remember when I've had to complain about a meal, and I really don't want to be quality control for the kitchen and have to ask for changes or send something back.  In the age of social media, who sends out food like this out of the kitchen?  2 stars for servers efforts and manager adjusting the bill but that's it.    Unfortunate but I don't think I'll be back.  This could have been the kind of place I can like."}
{"text":"Went in on a Saturday night and was seated immediately! This place was surprisingly not busy at all. We were greeted and served super fast!   We started with the hush puppies that came out in a cute little basket. They could have been fried a tad bit longer as they were still a little mushy/mealy on the inside, but overall good. Then we ordered the sliders! Again they came out super fast!! This is a good choice is you want to try multiple meats at a relatively reasonable price.   Lastly we got the Texas Rib and the grilled corn on the cob! The BBQ sauce and the meat were amazing. Very good flavor. The corn was boiled just a tad too long and a bit mushy, but still editable.   The service was fast and friendly. We also pressed a couple of the drinks. The shandy and a mule! No complaints here! Posted several photos and enjoyed the food!"}
{"text":"Last Friday I came into town to visit my daughters and was planning to go to Notorious burgers in Scottsdale. Came to find that the fine burger establishment had changed to a BBQ restaurant Hogs and Hops. Slightly disappointed, was looking foreword to Notorious, only to find a great BBQ place. The brisket was outstanding. The service was still outstanding. And the decor was cool. Decorated in country theme but without going overboard ( straw or peanuts on the floor). The many beers and ales was still there and if I so wanted they still served the famous Notorious Burger. I think the owners really have something here with the BBQ theme. I hadn't notice any other BBQ restaurants anywhere in the area. It is a nice change. I'll probably miss Notorious, but when visiting AZ, I have another great place to eat. Great job !!"}
{"text":"Went there on Friday evening and there was hardly anyone in the restaurant. My husband was served the wrong beer but they did correct that. The chicken was a bit dry. The food was not that warm and both the chicken and ribs were clearly pre cooked with barbecue sauce poured over right before serving. Service was okay. We probably not return."}
{"text":"We were really looking forward to trying this place. After a friend had warned me about the sub par service and food, we went to try their \"safe bets\"; we got the baby back ribs and a salad with brisket.  The ribs were tasty but they were not tender so that the meat would just fall from the rib; the salad was missing the avocado and the corn... Our server offered to have it redone and we obliged, only to have it back now missing the beans and with onion that, per the menu, shouldn't be there.  He was right about the sub par service and food; we're back to Famous Dave's."}
{"text":"The service was good. The wings are great! The beans are good.The ribs are just okay but not fall off the bone good. The brisket was very fatty and the yam was bitter. I may have expected more from a $50 BBQ meal for 2 but we ordered 2 apps, 2 full dinners, and an extra side but the food is mediocre. We still tipped 20% because the waitress did a solid job!"}
{"text":"Place was completely empty at 5:30. The food was good but nothing special. Reasonable price."}
{"text":"We came here on a whim the day after thanksgiving to get a break from cooking. It was a great experience and a very pleasant surprise. My fianc√© got the trio of pulled sandwiches and I got the pepper and spicy sausage sandwich. Both were excellent! The beer selection is also varied and has some beers I've never heard of, which is surprising because I bartended for years. You can tell a lot of effort went into both the food and beer development. The service was amazingly friendly, prompt and helpful the entire night from the time we walked in the door till the minute we left.   Overall: Great food, great beer selection and excellent friendly service. Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Holy cow! Holy pork! Lol... You can smell the delicious smoked meats when you get out of your car in the parking lot. I don't know about you, but that got my mouth watering right away thinking about what yummy BBQ I was about to eat!  Went by chance on opening night and it was packed, but we were seated pretty quick at a bar tall table. Great vibe in this joint!   Feels like a BBQ place should,  bustling and laughter, all over and the smell! - everything smelled soooo good!  We sampled a bunch of dishes and brought some leftovers home since it was just the two of us. THE BEST beef ribs I have EVER had. Sides were awesome. Now, you may say cole slaw is cole slaw, but theirs was friggin delicious! Especially when I put some on top of my pulled pork sammich!   Decor was cool, big logo in chalk with flames when you walk in. Staff was super friendly and they all helped out. Shout out to our server Hannah and our bartender Simone who both kick ass at their jobs. Hostess was smiley and friendly.   This place will definitely be in our regular rotation, we enjoyed all the food. A must try. Photos to come, I have to get them off my wife's phone, I ran out of memory. Too many pics of the kids!"}
{"text":"Walked in on a Sunday afternoon while trying to kill some time before our flight for our return home.   Nice and close to our hotel and found a groupon so figured how could we go wrong.   It was about 4 PM and only about 2 tables were taken.   Surprising considering they have a Happy Hour every day that looks pretty decent. $4 small plates and tap beers and wine. I'm always about a good happy hour :)  We tried the cheese curds and the wings off of the happy hour menu.   Wings were very tasty although the the sauce was not spicy as advertised on the menu. It was tasty BBQ sauce though.  I have to say that the cheese curds weren't very good.  Maybe because I'm a Wisconsinite and we take our fried cheese curds very seriously. Not quite sure if they were overcooked or undercooked, but they were filled with water that took away from the taste of the cheese.  The sauce on the side, maybe a chipotle ranch?, was tasty though and I kept that to dip my fries into.  The boyfriend ordered a 1/2 slab of the baby back ribs which he said were very good but did mention that he wished there was a little more meat on them.  My brisket was tasty as well and fell apart with my fork.  A little fatty but flavorful.    The service was good.  We sat at the bar and the servers we very attentive and made sure to get us what we needed.  2 big TVs in case you want to catch a game.  It's very nicely decorated     A turn off was the way the food was served.  It's served on a tray with wax paper on the bottom.   This tend to tear and I kept finding myself looking to make sure I wasn't getting paper in food.   Overall, a good place to come and try and close to many of the Scottsdale hotels and resorts.  Solid 3.5 stars!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I finally went here a few nights ago to use a groupon that we had purchased a while back.    Upon entering, we noticed it was very quiet for it being dinner hour and there was no host/hostess to be found or even a sign stating to seat yourself.  After awkwardly standing there for a hot minute, a gentleman finally came to greet and seat us.  While being seated he stated they had a 'rush' today, everyone was trying to use their groupon before it expired so they were out of all chicken and brisket items on the menu.  This was a huge disappointment.    We were left with pulled pork, ribs, or salad.  My boyfriend got the ribs and I decided to go with the pulled pork.  Both were a little dry and under seasoned; however, their BBQ sauce was decent.    Overall their food was nothing id go running back for, but I did appreciate the nice craft beer list they had."}
{"text":"Excellent!  The service was good, friendly atmosphere, clean.  Linda the manager was gracious and lovely.   Our server was super!!! Good pricing and fantastic beer choices!!"}
{"text":"Terrific BBQ. The longhorn ribs are too die for! They are absolutely delicious. The smoked wings appetizer are tremendous. Everything here has lots of flavor. The longhorn ribs are nice and big with lots of meat. This the second best bbq I've ever had- pappas bbq in Houston is the only place better."}
{"text":"I'm so happy it came to Scottsdale! It's been hard to fine good bbq restaurant here.  The restaurant atmosphere is very low key and staffs are nice. They have good amount of craft beer list which is great!  Our co-workers recommended smoke bbq wings here. It was absolutely delicious!! Smoky, lots of meat, juicy and good sauce!  We also had half of baby back rib with corn together. It was really really good rib! I definitely will go back here again in the future soon!"}
{"text":"The BBQ was very good. A couple of things though....the bread should come with it. $14 for a BBQ plate should include bread AND a side, not a choice of one. Don't reuse kids crayons. The dirty cup of crayon stubs was tacky and certainly not health department approved. On that note, always give the kids an activity(thank you for the gesture)...If there is an upcharge to get corn instead of fries, please disclose this when ordering. Corn is so cheap! Why charge extra? For these reasons we won't be back. The BBQ itself is good, but the other things are important too."}
{"text":"Totally excited about the new Hogs & Hops in Gainey Village. A GREAT selection of craft beers complements the delicious ribs, chicken and other pork dishes.   I went in on a Thursday night in late April. The servers helped suggest some great beers (Sculpin!) and some delicious ribs and chicken in the Smoking Combo ($12). Sauces were tangy and spicy and full of flavor.   Definitely a good thing going on at Hogs & Hops./ Looking forward to my return visit soon!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went about 4 wks ago,the ribs, chicken,hush puppies and cocktails  were amazing,loved the ambience too,definitely going back."}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant on a slow Tuesday night. We were seated immediately at a fun round booth. The waitress came over promptly and took our order, and our food came out in a timely manner. However, from then on, the service was unreliable. There were no knives on the table and after waiting a few minutes, we had to get up and go to the wait station to get our own utensils. Also, even though there was only one other party in the restaurant, our server was in attentive.   The food however, was delicious. We got the 1/2 slab of baby back ribs with Texas toast and cole slaw. All were tasty. The Texas toast was fresh with just the right amount of garlic and butter. The Cole slaw was way above average, and the ribs were tender. We had them cooked in the spicy barbecue sauce, and it wasn't really spicy, but was definitely delicious."}
{"text":"Visited from So. Cal for spring training.  We always look for great places to eat and hang out.  This one is a true winner.   We tried the brisket, baby back ribs and pulled pork.  All very tender and flavorful.   The pit master knows his stuff.    Also don't miss out on the Jalape√±o poppers stuffed with brisket.   Fantastic!  Our bartender was personable and attentive.    A must visit again when in town.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Service is amazingly friendly and this place has the best happy hour deal in town. All beers even hi end expensive beers are all the same price during hh. I come for their wings and they are very filling and the BBQ sauce is fantastic."}
{"text":"I have been here once!! And I need to go back because the meat was so dang delicious. Great Flavors in everything we had. The staff were attentive and cared about explaining how the restaurant originated, they also explained how the meats are prepared. I was impressed! I'll be back."}
{"text":"Not BBQ.  I doubt they have a smoker.  Had brisket and pulled pork.  Tastes like something your mom makes in the crockpot.  No bark...at all.  I was going to order ribs and decided not too. Burgers and beers maybe good, but if you are expecting a niece barky and fatty piece of brisket head to lil miss or Rudys."}
{"text":"Happen to find Hogs and Hops by chance and was more than pleased with the ribs, brisket and pulled pork!  I BBQ myself and always sample BBQ wherever I go.  Hogs and Hops has some of the best BBQ that I've enjoyed and their hops are equally enjoyable.  Well worth visiting the value is there if you love BBQ"}
{"text":"When I walked in I noticed that there was no smell of smoked meat. My first thought was that the meat was either not cooked today or cooked somewhere else. I had the pulled pork sandwich which tasted fine, but far from the best I've had. For a side I chose macaroni salad which was good. We also got an order of onion rings. They were okay, but needed seasoning. Service was great!"}
{"text":"I went over the weekend and the service was awful. Granted, there was a private party in the back, but we stood at the front waiting for a hostess for 10 minutes or so. Then spent another 5 minutes trying to get the bartenders attention regarding seat yourself vs. hostess seating  Already we were off on the wrong foot. We ended up sitting at the bar, since there were no seats. The beer list had a glare and was hard to read. They had no menu or list for their beers other than the board.   Our waiter/bartender was friendly, but coughed a lot. Not something you'd like if someone's coughing all over your beer glass.  I had brisket and pulled pork with cornbread. The brisket was called \"Texas style\" but was far from it. I grew up in Texas, I know what that brisket tastes and looks like. This was still good brisket, but didn't have the char or pink ring like a true Texas brisket.   The pulled pork was flavorful and not dry-I really liked that. The barbecue sauce and style is more like Kansas City or Tennessee sweet barbecue-miles away from Texas. Not bad, just different.   The cornbread was a teeny little muffin that was spongey, like a cake, and had a floral flavor. Not the crumbly good cornbread I expected. I wish there were more side options like green beans, fried okra, or corn casserole.   I'm not sure whether we'll be back. Over all, it was okay food, just very sweet."}
{"text":"I really liked the food here. The meats were moist and flavorful as was the breads used too. The place was clean and sort of fun feeling inside. What's more to say about a BBQ Joint?"}
{"text":"Rare Rating!  Food - 5/5 - I had the Chopped Brisket with the a baked Yam & Corn Bread (More like corn cake! MmmMmm!) It was delicious! Brisket was PERFECT & the sauce was even better!  Service - 5/5 - Fantastic... Staff was a cohesive unit. They worked together beautifully!  Ambiance - 5/5 - Love it! It is as a BBQ joint should be! Chalk Board upon entry, pub style tables at the bar & dinning tables/ booths everywhere else! Clean & classy!  Prices? Reasonable!   Would I recommend to friends? Um, hells yeah!   Bottomline... Easily 5 Stars... All day long!"}
{"text":"We saw the new sign over the old Notorious Burgers and were curious to check out the new concept.  Checked the menu on the website and decided to try their Happy Hour offerings.  We were met by a welcoming hostess who seated us in the bar.  The joint was jumping!  There was a senior social group who made a large & amusing presence.  We enjoyed the free entertainment with some couples dancing to a pretty decent musical duo.    The wait staff was taxed by the crowd but trying to do their best to handle the demand and were very apologetic for a lengthy wait.  We ordered a sampling of $4 deals including wings, ribs and BBQ sliders.  Everything was very good, my personal favorite was the pork sliders - moist and perfectly stringy with a tangy sweet sauce.    Now that they've passed the HH test, we'll come back for dinner.    One disappointment - there is only ONE restroom and it's unisex.  Ugh.  For an establishment this size and especially one that features a bar, it doesn't make sense to me.  On a happy note, atleast it was clean upon my visit."}
{"text":"Wow, for $33 we had 2 meals and 2 beers. That's not  something we're used to in Scottsdale...especially the beer! The service was also perfect. They aren't busy on a Thursday, but the bartender walked right over and asked for our drink order...and she's a real bartender, not just a server behind the bar.  With that said, they are in a bad location. There's nothing but old rich people in this area. Literally everyone in here but us is over 50.  Food was good, it was super cheap, and they will bend over backwards of you don't like something. Trust me, someone said they cut the brisket wrong, and the waitress comped the meal and was willing to bring them a new plate!  I'd come back just for the service."}
{"text":"It's never busy because of poor location in my opinion but the food was so amazing!! The baby back ribs are the best in town! And are a great price! Yum!! my boyfriend and I ordered 1 full slab of ribs and it comes with 2 sides and Texas toast or corn bread and we both left super full and satisfied for only $26!!!"}
{"text":"Maybe they just need to get their act together and, once they do, it will be better. The brisket was pretty good...very fatty, but a nice flavor; the onion rings were over battered and not done and we sent them back...and they came back cold; the beans were very good and the corn on the cob, was a major disappointment.  It wasn't done, it was cold (in fact, everything came out barely warm )  They have a cute way of serving it with the husks on the end like a handle; however, that was soaking wet!!  Our server was extremely nice and was very disappointed, that we were disappointed.   She said the owner was in the kitchen telling the kitchen about the onion rings and how they came out.  Quite frankly, I think he should have come out to apologize and not put that upon our server.  He should have known better....he has several restaurants in town.  We'll give it another try....once it has been opened longer.  Oh, and what Jason Q had to say about \"nothing but old rich people in this area\" maybe he should go somewhere else where he doesn't feel out of place!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great place and great atmosphere! By far most comfortable bar I've been too. Stools were very comfortable and the bar was at good height with foot bar. Food was delicious and great beers on tap. Only issues was that a shot of Crown Royal Maple was $11! That's way to much!! Won't do that again there, but everything else was good. Excellent staff too!"}
{"text":"Ok, The place is brand new so some improvement may come in time. My biggest issue is the prices, even for Scottsdale they are a few dollars more than other bbq places, $10 for wings??? Come on now.  Service was friendly and they had a nice selection of imports and out of state beers, sadly they only had one local beer which is a major let down.  Food was good but not great but that may be improved with time."}
{"text":"I visited here last Saturday.  Great customer service. I had the BBQ platter. I wished they would've given me more sauce.  However, the food was great."}
{"text":"Solid. No complains. Great Service at the bar, friendly bartender who needs to experience the Phoenix Open for herself!  The Farm burger. Silly. Absolutely one of the best burgers I've had in awhile. Fries were meh. Should have taken the servers suggestion for a different side. Next time.   Hush puppies were solid.   The brisket on the salad was also solid.   We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Beef barbecue ribs with the spicy sauce were excellent. The sliders were a great choice so you could try the pulled pork, pulled chicken and beef brisket. Hush puppies were cooked to perfection. Service was friendly and efficient. We will be back again!"}
{"text":"I first found out about Hog & Hops from purchasing a Groupon. The baby back ribs were the best I've had! I've been back for more, and have not been disappointed. Both times were take out, and the service was great. The order was ready in 10 minutes as promised,and the staff was very helpful. This is the best kept secret BBQ place in Phoenix. Guy Fiere should try this place and include it on his show Diners, Drive ins & Dives."}
{"text":"Brand new place and they're already on their \"A\" game. Started with the fried pickles and a cold pale ale. Enjoyed both. BBQ bacon burger was cooked as I ordered and was very tasty and filing, very good, thick bacon. My son is a huge BBQ fan so he ordered the brisket platter. He loved it so I tasted. It was very tender, perfectly seasoned and served with fantastic BBQ sauce. We will be back."}
{"text":"Pulled pork sandwich was dry. Good customer service and the beer selection saves this place really. Much better BBQ around"}
{"text":"We went here with a Groupon.  WOW!!!!  The service was quick and outstanding as was the food.  We had an order of hush puppies and two pulled pork sandwiches.  The sandwiches had enough pork in each that you could have made another sandwich out of it!  The sauce was a perfect blend of tangy and sweet.  The cole slaw and fries complimented the sandwiches perfectly.  The only improvement that could have been made was to use a bun with a little more substance so that the meat and sauce didn't make it so hard to hold.  Friendly employees and delicious food....what more could you ask.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Somewhat disappointing Cobb salad, pulled pork + chicken tasty but appeared old + cold on wilted package lettuce, would suggest cold crisp romaine, warm the protein, top with egg + blue cheese crumble. Sweet potato was cold over cooked or microwave?  Service warm + friendly-"}
{"text":"Great new place for BBQ. Fantastic corn on cob and beans in support of excellent dry rubbed ribs. Sliders very good. Half slab of ribs a bit small but tasty.   Only one side instead of two. Decent beer selection albeit in small glasses. Outstanding Service by an attentive wait staff and personable manager, Linda.  We be back."}
{"text":"Stuck between a 2-3, but I still feel like I will try to make it back.  Fried pickles are forgettable.  The beef ribs were excellent.  Sauce was good. Sweet potato fries were average. Corn bread needs to be completely revamped.  The brisket salad was by far the biggest disappointment and deserving of 1 star (if you had to give 1). Let's start with that it might not even be brisket.  More like dry shavings of a 5 day old chuck steak.  Waitress was nice, but really took a hit when she told us that the brisket salad was really good/popular.    Also, a first for us, Pizza Hut made a delivery at the hostess stand for a hungry employee that came out from the kitchen.  Not a good sign for the patrons.  Even worse, remains that the delivery guy seemed to get the attention of the staff quicker than the hungry cowboy that came in and waited for a solid 5 min before he decided to just grab the menu from the stand and seat himself."}
{"text":"So excited to have a delicious BBQ spot nearby! Went in tonight for their Grand Opening and experienced great service, delicious BBQ, and an awesome selection of beer. Can't wait to go back for more!"}
{"text":"I really like to patronize local businesses so I gave it a try.  It was very quiet inside, could've used a little bit louder music.  My friends and i sat at the bar and tried our best to engage the bartender.  Honestly she seemed a bit put out that we were asking for suggestions on the beer selection.  The happy hour sliders were good and worth ordering again, but the atmosphere and staff need improvement.  I sincerely hope the restaurant succeeds but needs some personality."}
{"text":"Went there Sunday and the door was locked. Was looking forward to barbecue. Ended up at Pei Wei in the same shopping center. Oh well."}
{"text":"This place catered our wedding and it was fantastic! On-time (EARLY actually) and fresh! They have outstanding ribs, sliders, and chicken. But my favorite thing about them is their potato salad. Most likely the best in AZ. And in case you're wondering whether or not my opinion matters, I'm from St. Louis."}
{"text":"OK Scottsdale, you have a gem in your midst and she's shining bright. I grew up in Alabama, been in Texas for 25 years and married a girl from Memphis. I know BBQ. My epicurious passion is BBQ. Hogs and Hops BBQ is the real deal. If you get a hankering for really great BBQ and an extensive beer list, stop in and give them a try. If your disappointed you can flog me with their wonderful baby back ribs. I won't mind. Wait staff is great especially Simone whom will take care of you like you deserve."}
{"text":"I noticed this in a restaurant search today, took a look at a few of their reviews, and decided to give it a try.  Wanting to sample several meats, I decided on the sliders since I got to try the chicken, the pulled pork, and the brisket. I ordered the sauce on the side so that I could experience the taste of the meats. As my side, I ordered the potato salad, and decided to pay a bit extra to try the corn on the cob since it isn't offered as a standard side dish to the meals/sandwiches.   Brisket is usually my test for a BBQ place, so I had the brisket slider first. The brisket was unfortunately chopped to the point of being hash like, and was oily and nearly crisp. I couldn't get a sense of the real flavor or texture of the brisket, although it was better without the sauce than with it since the sauce was so extremely sweet. I honestly couldn't tell the difference in flavor between the pork and the chicken. The only thing that gave me any indication was the texture. Both the pork and the chicken were pretty unexceptional. None of the meat tasted the least bit smokey. I suppose that the terribly sweet sauce was supposed to carry the day. The sliders were a complete let down, and not a good recommendation for any of the meat.  The potato salad was bland to the extreme. I'm guessing that it was dressed with a combination of sour cream and mayonnaise and nothing else, not even salt. There was not a hint of onion or anything else at all. I set it aside and ignored it. It did nothing to compliment the meat.  The corn, which I paid extra for, was grilled, but was either overcooked or had been sitting for some time. The corn kernels were all puckered up rather than plump and juicy, and it wasn't particularly tasty. It wasn't buttered, nor was butter served with it. I gave up on it after a few bites.  My lunch was disappointing overall, and I see no reason to return. It also turns out that they have dropped the Texas Beef Ribs from the menu. This was pretty disappointing, and not worth revisiting."}
{"text":"This place was an excellent choice. I was in Scottsdale for business and found a place with Beef Ribs, had to try it out. Immediately the waitress was very attentive and made recommendations on what to try. After eating the ribs, I thought I was back in Houston. The ribs were nice and plump, good flavor and tender. I definitely recommend if your in town."}
{"text":"The other night we decided on BBQ for dinner and found Hogs and Hops which was not far away.  The restaurant is in a nice location with plenty of parking and offered a decent amount of seating compared to other BBQ joints I have been to.  After reviewing the menu, we decided on the Baby Back Ribs and the Three Meat Combo (brisket, pork & hot link).  Happy to see that they offered sweet potato fries for those of us on the paleo diet.  The food was served quickly after ordering and was exactly as we ordered.  So first let me start with the ribs, they were tender, juicy and easily pulled off the bones (which were very HOT).  As for the three meat combo, the brisket was tender and moist, easy to cut with a fork and had a nice lite bark on the outside.  The pulled pork was likely tender and moist with good flavor.  The hot link was delicious, but unfortunately it was not hot or spicy as a hot link should be.  As for sauces, they offer the sweet mild or the hot & spicy which was more tangy from the vinegar than hot.  Overall the food was good and reasonably priced compared to other BBQ joints I have been to.  Now the crowning jewel would be the craft brews .... and yes, I saved the best for last.  They have a large chalk board up with a list of the current brews on tap which fortunately did not include any products from the craft brewers owned by the Big 3 Macro Breweries (who ruin the brands once they purchase them).  They have up to 24 varieties available which for me was great since it closely resembles what was offered by one of my favorites brew pubs up in the Seattle area.  So, overall if you are looking for a great selection of craft brews to enjoy and possibly some decent BBQ, Hogs & Hops is certainly a good destination to consider."}
{"text":"Don't put money into a permanent sign. You're not gonna need it in 30 days!  Food was average at best. Table service was extremely slow! Servers didn't seem to know who had which table.  Manager reached out.  Gonna give them a second chance. Could have been honest server mistake on placing food order."}
