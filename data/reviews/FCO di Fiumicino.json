{"text":"On of the best authentic Italian pizza in town, if your in downtown it is a must to visit even if your in Montreal worth the drive. If your looking for real Italian pizza and not American"}
{"text":"De la pizza légère et goûteuse une ambiance jeune et dynamique j'ai pas encore goûté au gelato mais ça s'en vient"}
{"text":"I'm not sure how you can mess up pizza, but the food here left much to be desired. If you're in the mood for pizza, you'd be better off with Dominoes."}
{"text":"Super bonnes pizza pour dîner c'est idéal. Il faut par contre demander les sortes au cuisinier car rien n'est identifié. Ils ont aussi un bon choix de Gellato pour dessert !

Il y a environ 6 tables à 4 personnes en haut et le reste c'est un long comptoir avec des chaises. Ils font des boîtes pour emporter au besoin. Qualité prix c'est très bien 2 pointes avec un jus environ 14$ pour ma part. On est allé entre collègues un dîner et tout le monde était satisfaits."}
{"text":"Very authentic-feeling spot, conveniently located on Viger, right off Victoria Square's northern side, which offers pizza and gelato. 

My review is for the Limone Gelato, which left me a bit disappointed: I found it to be slightly too sweet for my taste... sweet enough for it to overshadow the lemony taste. The resulting weak lemon taste also disappointed. The texture and consistence of the gelato was good though. 

This somewhat negative experience does not, however, mean I do not plan on going back to try other gelato flavours or their pizza, which looks and smells fantastic."}
{"text":"I will crave this pizza and come from the West Island to get a slice anytime , this is the real deal folks , freshest ingredients, undoubtedly high quality Italian style pizza . Thin crust , crispy with well done spots , fresh tomato sauce , big pieces of basil , pure pleasure.
This pizza was the bright spot in my day, you should definitely try it , I know I'll be back"}
{"text":"This is the best Gelato north of Caffe Paradiso in Boston. The pizza looked great, but there was sweet corn on one of them.......hmmmmm. I'm not sure about this. Good coffee in the am as well. If you're staying at the W it's worth the block walk."}
{"text":"This has got to be one of my new favourite lunch places.  The lineups are long at lunch but totally worth it..  It's a pizza place but they don't do your usual greasy pizza.  Here they make it Roman style (al taglio) meaning the crust is thin and crisp and the entire pizza is long and rectangular.  It is cut up into smaller pieces to serve .  They also keep the toppings simple like they do in Italy.  I tried the pizza with mushrooms and sausage and the margherita.  Both were really good although I have to say that the margherita wins out as my favourite.

This place is also has a gelato counter and if it's your first time it's definitely worth treating yourself to one.  It can be a little pricey but once in a while it's totally worth the splurge.  They usually have a handful of flavours.  I tried the cheesecake one and ricotta and cannoli.  They were delicious!"}
{"text":"Great lunch spot. The variety is good. Fresh food served at a counter. Traditional italian lunches with a modern touch on most. Never disappointed. Owner is a hard working man deserving of lots of respect for his work. A little out of my way but worth the trip every time."}
{"text":"pretty good pizza. Lots of choices and every slice is 5.50 tax incl.
i took the margherita pizza, i found the sauce a little but too sour tasting and lack a bit on the amount of cheese.
The mushroom and sausage was descent and tasty. The size of the slices were on the small side,but it's a good snack.

I would rate this place above average pizza, i will try other pizzas and gelatos next time"}
{"text":"You can often measure a pizza place from its most simplistic offerings. As such, I got a marghareita pizza from this place to go. Dough was tasty, albeit a little dense. Marinara sauce was flavourful enough, but I've certainly had better. They also quite stingy with the mozzarella, and the basil was mysteriously burnt - aren't you supposed to put it on after? On top of this, they toppings were also falling off the pie upon opening the box - sloppy presentation. Service was also snappy and curt, as if my patronage was annoying the person taking orders. All in all, for the price point, I was expecting more, though I guess it was the Old Port."}
{"text":"Super bonne la qualité de la bouffe, délicieux. Il n'y a pas beaucoup de choix dans le menu mais tout est très bon. Le service aussi est très bon et l'ambiance agréable. En plus, ce n'est pas du tout cher."}
{"text":"Best thin crust sliced pizza. A taste of Italy in the old port. The arugula and mushroom are my ultimate favourite"}
