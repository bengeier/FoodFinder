{"text":"The overall setting of the restaurant is really nice and the Service is good but the food is just ok. The shabu shabu is not authentic. Had high expectation after reading all the good reviews but the food just disappointed me especially given the price they charge."}
{"text":"A recently opened restaurant. The food quality and taste are amazing. I personally recommend the scallop, wagging striplion and Berkshire pork belly. Normally I don't even eat fats, but their pork belly are rich flavored with compressed pear and hint of ume plum jam to balance the dish. It's worth to try."}
{"text":"A little too complicated. Not enough flavor in the broth. It's fun at first but the novelty wears off. The staff was great though. The food not so much."}
{"text":"I love this place! What impressed me the most is their awesome service. Staffs are friendly and polite. We did not make reservation so we wait for table for a while but the staffs are so kind, they offered us the appetizer (ginger salmon)and soju. 
Food is great. Nothing is better than a hot pot in the winter cold night. The ambiance is very nice, the wooden wall adds a Japanese feel to it."}
{"text":"For someone who had eaten mostly Asian cuisine in their lifetime, giving this restaurant 4 stars is a lot. However, because this is Cleveland and there is no other restaurant like this, I give it one extra star. I would recommend this restaurant to people who are looking to try shabu shabu for the first time.  It was a good and fun experience.  I personally will never come back to Usabu since I can recreate my meal here for cheaper and tastier but the ambience and service was nice.  I would not recommend getting the omakase appetizer. It was over priced and boring. It should also have not been called an \"omakase\" because it was literally a few thin strips of salmon sashimi with nori and some drops of sauce (which didn't even add any additional flavor).  There main course was good. We ordered the ginger chicken broth with Ohio wagyu beef and the togarashi miso broth with the tsukiji fish market omakase.  Everything tastes good but nothing special. I've had better shabu shabu at home and other restaurants. Overall, it was a nice meal and experience for Cleveland but for the price we were expecting more."}
{"text":"Great spot with amazing food. Spicy shabu broth is the best. Went two weekends in a row."}
{"text":"What a gem! Chic, cozy interior, knowledgable and friendly service and, most importantly, delicious food. 

Came here with a friend on Saturday night and sat at the bar vs. one of the communal tables. We ordered two small plates (pork belly and salmon) and both were unique and delicious. We shared the waygu/lamb hot pot and it was also great. It's BYOB for now, so bring your own bottle of wine - they're happy to cork and supply the glasses.

Earlier reviews suggested a few operational hiccups, but it seems as though they've been entirely resolved, at least from our experience. A great addition to the neighborhood - will be back!"}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in during their opening week and left with mixed feelings.  There aren't too many places in Cleveland to get good shabu shabu (and this is definitely good shabu shabu), but there were a few problems with execution.

The ambiance was very very nice. From the decor to the music it was a beautiful classy place... except for the industrial meat slicer in the window right as you walk in the front door...

It's a small place, and having a meat slicer share a space with the bar and the host stand is a little off putting, not to mention noisey.  The concept I'm sure works on paper:  High quality meats (japanese A5 beef!) sliced thin right in front of you when you order so you know it's fresh!  The problem is, it's an electric meat slicer not a sushi chef.  It's incredibly noisy and has to be disassembled and cleaned between orders.  Even with the nice music playing, if you close your eyes you feel like you're in line at the deli.  Added to that is the fact that the gentleman running it hadn't been taught how to use it.  He turned the meet a dozen different ways before finding a way it would cut properly, and wasn't sure how to put it back together once he cleaned it.

Which leads me to the service... it was nonexistent.  It's a good bet most people who walk through the door don't know what shabu shabu is or how to eat it.  The waitress asked for our drink order, asked for our food order, and when the food was delivered, turned to walk away before asking over her shoulder with a terrified look, \"Good?\"    We asked for a lesson in how to eat our hot pots the right way, and the only advice we were given was \"It's basically a build your own soup. Put the hard vegetables in first.\"

That's it... that's all we were told.  First of all,  it's not in any way a build your own soup.  That's an insult to the food and an insult to your restaurant.  People aren't paying $25+ for build your own soup and just because a broth is involved doesn't make it soup.  

Over all the food and the concept were excellent and we will absolutely  be back once the kinks are worked out.

Move the noisy kitchen appliances to the kitchen and have trained staff operate it.  Hire front of house staff that is proud of your food and willing to take the time to teach new guests about it.  (And speaking of staff, the cook/ chef who kept walking out behind the bar in a filthy ballcap and jacket to check his phone is a major turn off in a nice restaurant)"}
{"text":"Beware. This is not a two$ place. Perhaps we are country folks? We had 6 appetizers, one tea and one 300ml sake (2nd cheapest on the menu). Total bill w/o tip = 147$. Sushi was good but did not justify the price. Just had significantly better sushi in east Bay Area(SF) for significantly less and better quality. Perhaps screening the fish from Lake Erie demands more labor and thus the higher cost?"}
{"text":"Love this place! Came in last week and ordered the wagyu beef paired with a nice bottle of sake. It was simply delicious. Both the service and presentation were great. I would definitely recommend and will be back for more!"}
{"text":"I've dined here twice. The staff was very sweet. The atmosphere was incredibly relaxing (their music selection is wonderful). I saw a reviewer mention that the meat slicing machine was a distraction, but honestly you really couldn't hear it. One of the chefs asked me if I didn't like my sesame ice cream (I was taking a noticeably long time to eat it) and told me he could get something else for me. I told him I actually loved it so much that I was taking my time finishing it. It was very kind of him to ask. I'd HIGHLY recommend their ice creams and scallop dish. I'm looking forward to returning here as often as I can."}
{"text":"Michael, the general manager was in charge the night we came in.  He was very knowledgeable, helpful and nice.  We never felt rushed.  Cooking the shabu was fun and the food was super fresh.  The bottle of saki my husband and I shared was terrific as well."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in Cleveland and now with their new sushi menu - best sushi place in Cleveland.
I love high quality ingredients, creative menus and excellent service. Meanie changes often, which makes it fun. Shabu shabu selections are not that pricy and the final bill ends up being not shocking at all. Regardless, the food and experience are worth the money they are asking for it. Some fish for sushi is being cured and is served with special sauce on top, which I have not tried before. Delightful! Highly recommend to everyone."}
{"text":"What a great local business in the Tremont area! Tucked away on Professor Avenue, Ushabu offers up delicious (albeit a tad pricey) Japanese cuisine, including their take on the popular hotpot. The restaurant has a very intimate feel since it only seats about 20 people, possibly less. I went with the vegetarian hotpot (for fellow vegetarians, the miso broth contains chicken, so make sure to ask them for the vegan broth, which is delicious!). The food took a while to come out, but when it did, it was fresh and heavenly! The hotpot also came with a side of dipping sauces. The only suggestion I would have is to introduce something spicier, ie a chili oil broth that only gets spicier as it reduces. The chili oil side helps, but could definitely be incorporated into the broth for true thrill seekers. 

The service is phenomenal, as the waiter took his time to explain the origin of each dish and the fact the Ushabu rotates regional dishes. He was also very friendly and took care of our every request. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Loved!!! Lovely restaurant, small space but cozy and well decorated. 

We tried all three broths.  The ginger chicken was my favorite.   Spicy miso had a kick to it and the kombu was the least flavorful.  They don't have a ton of flavor until you start cooking up your veggies and meats.  

I ordered the Ohio wagyu and found that the broth became very rich and delicious after cooking about 1/4 of my meat. 

Other reviewers indicated that you don't get much food but we found that it was more than enough food and lots of fun.  

Skip the five spice chicken appetizer though."}
{"text":"I have visited Ushabu twice within the past year for hotpot. The food is phenomenal - the veggies are always fresh and beautiful, the meat melts in your mouth, and the sake list is unbeatable. It is one of the only upscale Japanese restaurants in the area, which is very refreshing and makes the trip to Tremont worth it. Normally, hot pot is a homestyle experience that you enjoy with your family over a well-loved pot and an all-you-can-eat plate of ingredients in a loud restaurant; it isn't really a trendy or even remotely fancy meal. Ushabu, however, really tries to make it a crazy culinary experience. I think the hype and the carefully manufactured culture works for those who haven't experienced traditional hot pot, but the affluent presentation just doesn't make sense for others. 

The wagyu is very good - as mentioned above, it is wonderfully tender and delicious. My favorite stock is the chicken ginger, which adds a nice zing to the veggies. I'm a really big vegetable fan, and the vegetable quality/selection at Ushabu is one of my favorite things. The mushrooms are incredible, and the squash is a really nice addition. They all have great color and look beautiful as well! The sake is expensive (like everything else) but if you have a favorite sake that you can't find anywhere else in Ohio, then it's worth spending your paycheck. 

The staff here is really wonderful to round out the upscale ambiance. Our server had almost an ASMR-voice, which was somehow very relaxing and zen. She knew a lot about the menu and drinks, which is something I always look for in a quality restaurant! Service can disappear for a while, with my friend waiting 15 minutes once for a drink, but when they are around they are very attentive. 

I don't think I'll return for a good spell, but I will always recommend it to people who are intimidated by the foatmosphere of traditional hotpot."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Japanese hot pot and all my friends said I should try Ushabu, so here I am. 5/5 for service, 5/5 for dinning environment, maybe 4.5/5 for food. This ain't the most traditional kind of Japanese hot pot, cuz the chef modified the ingredients a little bit to makes them more \"western\", and I'm fine with that. The meat and vegetables are all pretty fresh and tasty. I would strongly recommend you guys to give it a try."}
{"text":"I caught them on a bad day - they were serving Okinawan which is mostly pork.  Better luck next time."}
{"text":"Place is amazing. The staff is great and the concept  is truly something new to the neighborhood, which is badly needed."}
{"text":"Ushabu is a small but well-decorated modern space with only 4 booths and bar seating. I was here earlier in the evening and was able to get a seat without a reservation. 

I wasn't too enthused by the food itself. Ushabu is a Japanese fusion hot pot, not the shanghainese/Mongolian hot pot with the standard broths, sauces, various noodle options, gigantic shareable portions. The vegetables included arugula which was a bit odd. I wished that they had given a larger portion of mushrooms (only 2-3 pieces of oyster mushroom in the bowl) and udon noodles (4 short strands of noodle). I had the miso broth with the Ohio wagyu. The portion of wagyu was on the smaller side. 

Overall, the soup was ok, not impressive. Worth paying about twice as much as for normal hot pot? I'd say no."}
{"text":"Came here last night for a quasi celebration, but reall, we just wanted to try out a Japanese Shabu restaurant in Cleveland. It was a new dining experience for me, but old hat for the wife.

We were seated at the bar, which holds a total of six people and offered drinks. No beer or booze, unfurtunately. They have soda, tea, some Japanese libations... nothing too interesting. The server went over some basic instructions and took our small plate order. He was a bit hard to understand, not because he was foreign, but because he spoke in that mumbly, hipster way that I'm not versed in very well.  I must say, I wasn't a fan of the stained bar top and very tight quarters... I get anxious in crowds. 

Small plates arrved - pork belly and salmon. Pork was really good and so was the salmon, even if that's not my favorite fish. By the time we finished, our main courses arrived and our pre selected broth was boiling(I apologize for not getting detailed with the ordering process, but don't want to write a book at this time). I ordered the Ohio Wagyu beef and my wife ordered the seafood; both came with an assortment of veggies, noodles and rice. We also had to try the Japanese A5 wagyu, so grabbed a couple ounces of that as well. All in all the food was good, but I think I would like to try the wagyu in a more traditional steak style. While the meat was very tender and rich, I feel the broth imparted too much flavor to the thin cuts of beef. We ended with a sorbet from Mason's Creamery and that was superp and quite refreshing.

To wrap, we liked this place, but I personally don't think a return trip is needed. The food was good, but I find the dining style clumsy and not really up my alley. One thing I was happy about was getting to try authentic wagyu, finally. I passed on it in japan, not really knowing what it was at the time, and always regretted that decision."}
{"text":"The layout for the tables is a bit awkward in that you are ultimately paired with another couple. We didn't get much of a chance to talk, nor did the other couple, though we did have a very pleasant conversation throughput the meal with them. I would definitely not go here as a first date, but if you are looking for something different from pretty much everywhere else, this is a fun place. 

Seafood option provides the best bang for your buck but waygu beef is the ultimate. No liquor license but they will uncork and provide glassware if you bring your own."}
{"text":"Perfect experience!!! First hot pot restaurant in CLE, and definitely will be the best choice in frozen winter. 

Environment and foods are good!!! It's hard to have fresh seafoods like they have here in CLE. However, I will suggest them to hire more servers, and ready to be a popular spot."}
{"text":"Really wishing I took a pic while I was there.
I ate here ~3 weeks ago.

I grew up with hotpot, whether it be Korean, Chinese, or Japanese style hotpot.
I was REALLY glad to find a place in Cleveland that actually specialized in it.

The place itself is tucked away and is relatively small, but extremely cozy. 
I think I had the spicy miso broth, and it was excellent!
It wasn't the best hotpot I've ever had, but it still evoked pleasant memories and the same great mouth feel as hotpots I've had in yesteryears. 

The workers were really very nice.
The manager was incredibly friendly.

And really, NOTHING warms the insides like hotpot.
The dipping sauces here were REALLY good, especially the ponzu.

My one complaint:

1) Hotpots here are meant to be personal, I think. Usually, the places I frequent have a HUGE pot meant for 2 or more people, but these pots are small, and you get a lot of veggies, but not much beef. This made me a little sad because I'm so used to eating it family style; shared saliva, shared love, you know?

The menu is pretty simple and straightforward, and last I checked, it was BYOB ;)
Though I hope to see more menu items in the future, for what it's worth, Ushabu is already pretty bomb. Will definitely revisit when I get the chance :)"}
{"text":"Hot pot is not nearly popular enough in the US. While lots of other Asian dishes are everywhere - sushi, stir fry, curry - most Americans have no idea there is such a thing as cooking a meal tableside in hot broth, but it's quite popular all over Asia. It's also a good way to eat a lot of food relatively healthfully, and if you're vegetarian or eating a low-carb diet, it works well. In other words, we're due for a hot pot explosion.

The Japanese version is called shabu-shabu, which translates to \"swish swish,\" which is how you cook the items, by holding them in the broth for just a few seconds before extracting and eating with great gusto. DLW and I did so on a recent trip to Tremont.

She remembers this neighborhood from its days as a low rent section of town, and hadn't seen it for some time, so the gentrification going on now was pretty wondrous. It's a small place with maybe 25 seats, all of which are equipped with wells for the pots, including the bar where we sat. Our service was impeccable, and even the bartender was quite knowledgeable about the menu. They bill the cuisine as \"Japanese fondue,\" maybe to make it more approachable?

They proudly tell you that they source locally and seasonally where possible, although they offer a choice of real Japanese wagyu beef or a domestic version for much less. DLW went with the domestic version, and I chose a smoked pork belly. Three standard broths are offered, and we picked dashi for hers and spicy miso for mine. You get vegetables, tofu, rice and noodles on the side, plus three dipping sauces. The portions were on the small side, but everything was fresh and tasty, and we both went away full. Once the meat and veg are disposed of, you drop the noodles in and enjoy the residual flavors as a soup, which may actually be the best part.

If hot pot isn't your thing, they have other options, but why you would come here in that case is beyond me. It's also not cheap, but the quality of the ingredients is worth it."}
{"text":"I absolutely adore Ushabu. Ever since I first dined there about 4 months ago, I've been back no less than 6 times. It is a truly unique experience from start to finish, whether you're in Cleveland or overseas in Japan. Shabu Shabu is a term for \"swish swish\". This is what the restaurant specializes in. Think deli think slices of raw meet being swished into a boiling flavored broth. Cooks in seconds and eaten alongside a combination of vegetables, rice, noodles, and dipping sauces. Love the Ohio Wagyu Beef as well as the Pork Shoulder. Menu changes seasonally, so the duck we loved is no longer available. Beer/Wine/Sake/occasional Japanese Whisky available for purchase. No cocktail menu. Book your reservation ahead as it is a small intimate restaurant. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"We went there last night for a bday. We have been there before and couldn't wait to go back. Something happened with our order and it delayed our friends meal from coming out. The waitress and head chef went above and beyond to correct. No joke. They have the gold standard for service. This establishment is lucky to have such people working there. Thanks again. We will definitely be back"}
{"text":"I feel so luck to find such a cozy place to dine in . Normally I don't recommend any restaurant unless it is amazingly good! The appetizers are awesome, seriously ! I think you should try all of them. In terms so the base soup, I recommend the spicy one . Just come and try out. Again, I am so glad we have such a great place in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Nice experience overall. Good portion size and high quality ingredients. Warm environment. Good service for the most part. Could benefit from a little more proactive explanation of the menu and options, but responsive to questions. I had seafood in the kombu broth. The broth definitely grew on me but my husband's spicy miso was the better option. Glad to have this option in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"This is a cute little restaurant near Fat Cats that could easily be missed. If you like Japanese food, it is definitely worth checking out!

The decor inside is cozy and modern. The restaurant is small, with only a few booths in it in addition to a bar area. I commented to my friends that even the technology in the women's bathroom seemed impressive (the toilet has a device that flushes when you wave your hand over it and there is a Dyson airblade faucet!). 

We ordered appetizers, which seemed small (though they were tasty - the Five Spice Chicken one was our favorite), though it all evened out after we finished our hotpots (which were quite filling). 

Each of us ordered our own hotpots; an individual hotpot seemed to be a sufficient amount of food for one person (none of us had leftover food). I ordered the Kombu broth, which is a pretty standard soup broth. I also tried a taste of the spicy miso broth, which was pretty spicy.

The ice cream at the end of the meal was yummy too. I ordered the black sesame, which was very creamy. My friends ordered the green tea ice cream, which was also good. 

Helpful tip: make reservations the day before you go. You can do this through their website or the Reso app. 

One other thing to point out is that finding parking can be annoying, as it is anywhere else in this area in Tremont. It's street parking only, as far as I know."}
{"text":"BYOB!

Ok now that's out of the way, let's talk food. The small plates really are small... literally a couple bites each. We got the tofu and egg custard clam small plate. Both were OK. Nothing to write home about.

The shabu shabu (spicy miso) itself is great. My date and I weren't that hungry so we shared one pot; it really was the perfect amount of food. IF you roll with this approach I highly suggest getting extra udon. 

They have masons creamery ice cream for dessert and both the sesame and green tea flavors are bomb. 

Our service was excellent. Shout out to Anna!

Make a reservation. It's a tiny place."}
{"text":"We ended up here by accident and it was a fun experience.  We ended up sharing the table with another couple who we had so much in common with and closed down the place b/c we were talking for a long time.  It was a different experience much like melting pot b/c you cook your own food in broth.  It takes a long time and it was decent but not amazing (maybe b/c I'm a vegetarian). But my boyfriend agreed and he is not a vegetarian. It was okay.  Didn't blow me away but definitely something to try-maybe for a special occasion.  It's a little pricey for what it is but definitely a lot of food.  I did think the dessert was AMAZING and would go back for that.  It's a small restaurant and the service was good but not amazing.  Overall, the experience was fun but the food and service was just okay.  All 4 of us at the table decided it was good but we were not jumping to come back like some other restaurants we have tried and loved.  From what I remember it was pretty healthy.  I say 3.5 stars but that is not an option.  Give it a go and see for yourself."}
{"text":"A true gem to Tremont. The food was great and the shabu experience was defiantly worth it. What I was most impressed by was the service. The staff was very attentive and genuinely  friendly. I got the seafood miso and I will most definitely be back. Small intimate groups would be better for this place. Also byob"}
{"text":"Went here on a date. What fun! You cook your own. Nothing we had was bad. Everything was fresh and looked great. We talked a lot, cooked and ate. We never felt rushed. I didn't think I would like green tea ice cream. It was yummy. 

Definitely need to make a reservation. 

BYO and they happily accommodate your bottle of wine. Though we heard they will have a license in a few weeks. BYO is a bargain. 

You have to check out the bathrooms. Yep! The bathrooms. I want one like that in my house."}
{"text":"Website did not indicate reservation only, we arrived around 5:30 pm, party of 3, the restaurant was totally empty, they told us that next availability was 2 hours later!! I even mentioned that we came from California took Lift to get there!! We had to look for another restaurant by walking around the neighborhood.... terrible experience first time visiting Cleveland Ohio!!"}
{"text":"Great food. Unique experience. Ended up dropping 250$ for 2 people which is why it doesn't get 5 stars. Service was great."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to Ushabu for a date night. Prior to the reservation, we received a call from the restaurant asking if it would be okay to have communal seating. My past experiences with communal seating have been one long table, where you're mostly able to section off with your party and enjoy a semi-private dinner together.

When we got to the restaurant, we were brought over to a booth--where another party of 2 was sitting on the same side of the booth, and we were to sit on the other. You're pretty much forced to talk to the other patrons throughout dinner, lest you awkwardly look at each other otherwise. While this ended up being a pleasant experience, it was less of a date night than anticipated.

We started off with Peneemo as an appetizer. It was strikingly similar to hashbrowns with honey and butter. 

I got the Shabu Shabu with Togarashi Miso and Wagyu. The broth was flavorful with an appropriate amount of heat, and they provided us with a medley of vegetables and tofu to add to it. The udon noodles at the bottom were sparse, and I wish they would have had more since they're my favorite part. The meat was nicely marbled, and went well with the ponzu and miso dipping sauces. 

Overall, the food was fine and decently filling, but a bit overpriced for hot pot."}
{"text":"Delicious food, friendly service, warm atmosphere. A great addition to the thriving Tremont cuisine culture"}
{"text":"If you are looking for the perfect first date restaurant or just a new place for you and your friends to try, Ushabu is the place! Its small, chic and cozy. I never tried Shabu Shabu but it was a great experience. I loved the hands- on interaction with the food with the  raw meats, broth and vegetables. (Think fondue mixed with Mongolian grill mixed with hibachi). We got to talk with the owner and the employees and they were very nice and knowledgeable. The atmosphere is not loud which was great. They currently dont have a liquor license, so bring your own bottle of wine and enjoy a great shabu experience."}
{"text":"I've had shabu shabu plenty of times in other cities and was glad a well-reviewed one opened up in Cleveland. I've been here a couple of times because the meat and veggies are pretty fresh and the broth selections are tasty. Veggies that come with the meal are somewhat limited and not as plentiful as other shabu places I've been to. They started carrying mochi shipped from New York, and I do have to say it's probably some of the best mochi I've had. 

The place is a bit small and seating is limited. Parking in Tremont sucks as usual. Price is definitely too high and is the only thing keeping me from coming me on a regular basis."}
{"text":"This is by far the best meal I've ever had in my life! It was phenomenal. 
My friend and I went in for an early 5:30 reservation. It was smaller than I expected it to be but it was very cozy while still maintaining it's classy-ness. 
The staff was incredibly friendly and very knowledgeable. Seeing as it was my first time in a place like this, I had a lot of questions! 
Now the food! It was melt in my mouth delicious. The salmon Ruibe appetizer was out of this world. 
The beef hot pot entree was to die for, I've been raving about it all weekend
And the marimo desert, in my opinion was just ok. It's very traditional, so I had to give it a try.  
I don't have a single bad thing to say about this place! I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing here. The togarashi miso broth was delicious and just the right amount of spicy. The pork was cut perfectly and some of the best pork I have had at a restaurant. The vegetables were fresh and really good. We also got the panna cotta, which was light and had a unique combination of flavors that mixed together really well. The servers were extremely helpful in explaining the menu and the process of how to do hot pot. My only suggestion is to make a reservation if you want to eat there on the weekend. The restaurant is on the smaller cozier side and fills up quickly."}
{"text":"a jewel of a restaurant in cleveland. we ordered every starter and they were all pretty much home runs. the shabu shabu was also excellent. the overall vibe is wonderful. can't wait to go back! keep on doing inspired food! we will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Such a gem!  So glad we were able to find it.  We went early because of having the kids with us and it was a real treat!"}
{"text":"This is a long overdue review but well deserved.

I'm originally from southern California, Orange County to be exact, where shabu joints are everywhere.

I love me some shabu on a gloomy day and when I saw one was opening up near me it was on my must try list. 

Well with a baby its hard to get out but I was really craving shabu so I decided to go and take the baby with me. That was a bad idea. She was fussy and didnt want to sit in her high chair. She even broke one of their spoons. Sorry!

The chef came out and talked to us saying he had a little girl himself and he made a makeshift rattle out of a bottle and rice to keep my baby entertained. She then threw our meat on the floor. Well he made us a new plate. I totally did not expect this.

Finally we got to eat and the broth was delicious the meat was nice and thin with a good amount of marbling. But the GOMA sauce...Hit the spot for me. Very authentic. The food was as good as the presentation and service. Its not cheap but I'll come back because of the service alone."}
{"text":"Service was supreme, our waitress was fresh into the service industry but she was so thoughtful, knowledgable, kind and informative.  The sincerity of service combined with the quality and presentation of the fare made for one of the best dining experiences I have had in Cleveland.  So happy that my friend and I chose to celebrate my birthday here!  Perfect pork belly, fresh lamb and wagyu beef.  The highlights - byob and a surprise matcha tea ice cream garnished with an edible wasabi flower and a lit candle.  Adorable and refined!"}
{"text":"Saw the \"new\" notification and saw some good reviews and potentially tasty food.

When we walked in, no one really greeted us, there were only 3 or 4 booths and someone finally came up to us as we stood awkwardly in this very small and tight place.

She said \"Do you have a reservation?\"
We said no, she almost rolled her eyes and then a man came over and asked them same thing

She quickly shooed us out! 

Beware!"}
{"text":"With an upcoming birthday dinner approaching, I looked around town for any new restaurants we could give a try given the special occasion and  we came across this place on yelp. To this point I heard nothing but good things about this place and I must say it's true after enjoying a fantastic dinner.

The place itself isn't that large. Reminds you of a spot you'd find in NYC or Tokyo itself but luckily enough it's right here in Cleveland. The interior is very well designed and each table is equipped with its own burner for the hot pot. The selection of food items isn't that large(which is good) however it covers all the main important areas of appetizer, main course and dessert.  We started off with a tropical namsu which was very refreshing. For main course we ordered the shabu shabu with seafood and a Ohio Wagu a la carte. The seafood and one a la carte item made for a fantastic amount of food to be shared between 2 people. The food came with 3 dipping sauces and rice along with noodles and veggies. The dessert although rather small was pretty good as well. Lastly one great thing about this restaurant is that the menu changes or updates with new items every season(roughly every 3 months) so it only adds to the motivation to continue to come back."}
{"text":"One of my favorite things to eat is shabu shabu and having lived in Los Angeles for a large majority of my life, and have lived in Sawtelle Japantown, I've had it innumerable times. 

The ambience of Ushabu and the service were amazing. 

However, the shabu shabu was less than impressive. There was not the usual plentiful quantity of veggies and this left me incredibly hungry and for a price tag of $27 it was definitely not worth it. I got the beef and the quality of the meat was not good; there was fibrous connnective tissue in the meat that was unpleasant to chew. The sauces were in tiny bowls which was difficult to dip the food in and they didn't have the usual additional options that go along with the sauces (minced daikon, chopped green onions, minced garlic, hot drops, etc...some restaurants have sauce stations with even more options). 

I have only been there once and have not tried any of the other dishes.  They seem to have a very cool menu with very unique fusion foods so I may venture there again but definitely not for shabu shabu."}
{"text":"I have had two wildly different experiences at this restaurant. As a vegan it's really nice to have a more formal restaurant which consistently offers vegan options. My first experience at Ushabu was great: amazing service, very knowledgeable and considerable waitstaff, and delicious vegan shabu-shabu with decent portion size for the cost. I happily returned and was shocked with my second visit. I ordered the five course vegan special (a $50 entree) and was astounded at how inadequate the meal was. Instead of the turkey entree I was given THREE shiitake mushrooms. Instead of rice w pork belly and 7-minute egg I was given a modest portion of rice with maybe 1/8c of greens which were delicious. Paying $50 for three mushrooms, a bowl of rice, and some soup broth was a disgrace and will likely keep me from returning. The food I ate was delicious and impeccably cooked but to charge the same amount for a vegan meal that is smaller than the regular 5-course entree and markedly cheaper to prepare makes no sense. Moreover, my server the second time I visited seemed extremely annoyed by my table in spite of the fact that we ordered 6+ entrees and two bottles of wine. 5 stars for the first experience, 1 star for the second=3 stars this time. Ushabu, please either provide more food or charge less for your vegan special dinner."}
{"text":"Oh baby baby how was I supposed to know? That hot pot is deliciousssss. 

Cute place in tremont with an intimate feel and just a 20-ish person capacity. It's a unique dining experience because the hot pot although there are also normal entrees and apps which sound creative as well. But you gotta get the hot pot, believe me. You pick your broth, protein and then let the magic begin. Pro tip: if you like spicy, ask for the house chile sauce and drop a spoon of it into the broth - as the broth reduces down, it will get spicier and spicier!

I got the wagyu beef and the smoked pork shoulder. All hot pot dishes come with a bowl of fresh veggies, three dipping sauces and bowl of rice. Great variety of flavors, fresh and tasty meats, fun and interactive way to eat. 

The service was excellent as the waiter took time to explain all the dishes on the menu and their link to traditional Japanese cuisine. The menu rotates every few months to focus on specialties from different city in Japan so creativity is embedded in the culture of the restaurant. Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Was super excited for Usabu to finally open! We made sure to make reservations far enough in advance, as the place is pretty small, so you NEED reservations (we made one about 1 week in advance). Ushabu is also BYOB which would be super nice, if we had known though! I wish they do a better job of publicizing that, but now you know! We went as a date night and sat at the bar, which was perfect for us. The waitress explained the concept to us right away and helped us with recommendations. 

We got the ginger salmon as an app and it was very tasty. We both did spicy miso broth, then I got the Waygu Beef with extra shrimp and my boyfriend got the Waygu and Lamb. Once all the ingredients came out and the waitress explained what to do, she sort of left us on our own to do our own thing. The meat and fish was super fresh and portion sizes were good and we were certainly stuffed at the end of it!

This isnt your relaxing dinner place, as you do all the work, but it is certainly a nice experience! The price can creep it up especially considering there arent any drinks, so if you are willing to get to work and cook your own food (while having a cool new experience), this is a great place to do so!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend came in for a great romantic night this week. This was by far the most fun I have had eating food out in Cleveland since I was a kid at Benihana. The experience is truly dynamic! I got the seafood shabu shabu with the kombu broth; my boyfriend did a pork beef combo and spicy miso. we also split the ginger salmon app and finished with some matcha ice cream from Masons. The food was incredible-- the raw salmon was tender and the accompanying wasabi cream sauce to DIE for. I had never had shabu shabu before and as a raw seafood lover I found each seafood piece an absolute joy to pair with the kombu broth. This place is obviously working out the normal \"just opened\" kinks-- they need to be better at explaining the concept for new comers- but it is well worth the price and the experience. I am so excited that we are starting to get more dynamic choices for Japanese in Cleveland. Definitely recommend making a reservation. I will be back ASAP!"}
{"text":"Ushabu! On my and Dee's 4th of July Ohio adventure, I came across a Hot Pot restaurant in my research. I'm into the whole Korean BBQ \"cook-your-own-food\" thing, so I thought, why not give shabu shabu a try! 

I actually remember as a kid, growing up crowded around the pot on orange vinyl chairs, my dad dipping beef into the broth to cook and then dipping it into raw egg. I hadn't had it in forever, so I was excited to try Ushabu's concept!

We made a reservation, and arrived on time (though parking was only on the street and tough to find). The restaurant is small but cozy, and I liked the asian inspired style. We got our own booth in the back, complete with electric burners inset into the table for the soup pots.

Browsing the menu, we chose a few appetizers, based on the server's explanation of the dishes. He was helpful, which was nice since many of the ingredients sounded complex. Unfortunately I had had my heart set on a few items from their menu that were just recently removed since they switched to their new \"osaka-inspired\" menu, which focuses more on cooked dishes.

We decided on the Beni Imo Chips and the Popo, a crepe fillied with a porkfat buttercream. Ushabu just recently started serving beer and wine, so Dee and I split a sake (canned). It might be nice to see their sake menu expanded a bit to include Nigori or sparkling sake.

The Beni Imo Chips were about a cup's worth of smoked purple sweet potato chips. They were a bit too crunchy in my opinion, and would've benefited from a bigger portion size and perhaps a dip of some kind (a sesame / miso sauce perhaps?)

The Popo was definitely like nothing I've ever had. A soft thin crepe filled with a sweet and savory pork buttercream \"frosting\". It almost bordered on too sugary, but it was creamy and intense. Though the serving was a bit small the richness of the dish made it feel more substantial.

Finally, onto the main event! For my broth I chose a spicy miso base, and for protein I had the seafood. Dee's broth was ginger chicken, and he decided on smoked pork. We also got a side of Ohio Waygu, recommended by the server.

After a bit of time, our broth came out, and our server instructed us on setting the burner temp for optimal cooking. Two bowls of mixed veggies, tofu and noodles were placed before us, to add to the broth to cook and enrich the flavor, along with three dipping sauces. I loved the fresh Ohio tofu, diakon radish and kambocha squash the best, though unfortunately the enoki and greens were sad and wilty from sitting out too long before being served. (We noticed the bowls just sitting out on the bar, probably assembed and sitting for an hour before being served). The ponzu was my favorite to dip in, and helped cool down the food. I might have liked sesame oil with salt, which would have been great especially for the beef.

Wowie though, my broth was spicy! Other yelpers here must have a high tolerance for heat! I loved the deep earthy umami flavor it imparted to the veggies, though maybe it could have been a tad less spicy. (It would be cool if they allowed you to adjust your level of prefered spicy!) Dee's broth was gingery without being overwheming, and quite good as well.

Our protein arrived for the main event, and our server instructed us on cooking times for swishing the meat in the pot. The seafood was salmon, red shrimp, fish cake and squid - the squid being my favorite by far. The portion was a tad on the small side - only 2 pieces of each protein. I actually left the salmon and shrimp in the pot quite a bit longer, to help it infuse flavor. Dee's smoked pork was tasty, though some fatty parts were too chewy for him. We both agreed though that the thinly slided wagyu was the winner. Meaty and robust, not gamey or chewy at all. It was so delicious! If I go again, that and the tofu would be my protein of choice!

The last step was to place the noodles in, and slurp them up! Thankfully I could easily adjust the temp and turn it down if needed. I actually was surprised that with the level of steam there were no overhead vents, or even fans. It got quite warm at times! 

For dessert, we definitely needed something cooling. I can't quite recall the name of the dish, but it included a cherry blossom sorbet. The dish came out very modern and beautiful with a lot of interesting flavors and textures...but, I didn't care for it. It reminded me of eating some potpourri or those tiny scented soaps everyone's grandma keeps in the bathroom. I admire the chef's ingenuity and originality, but the dessert wasn't sweet enough. It might be nice to see more casual options like homemade green tea ice cream or creme brulee, especially after eating such a hot meal!

All in all it was a fun and tasty experience, and I'd definitely come back if I lived in the area. I really hope hotpot catches on and we see more places like Ushabu!

{"text":"I normally am not a fan of hot pot, but this place impressed me. For a decent price, you get A LOT of food. I opted for the seafood hot pot with the chicken/ginger broth, and it was delicious. All of the seafood was fresh and the waitress made sure we knew how long to cook everything for. The vegetables tasted fresh as well! I enjoyed the broth so much that I asked to take it home, and they happily boxed it up for me. I was so full at the end of my meal, and I would definitely come back if I wanted to take someone out for a fancier meal. Great, attentive service and fresh, delicious food; what more could you want?"}
{"text":"Ushabu is a pretty small restaurant residing in Tremont. Very quaint and intimate. There was a wait when I got there, but luckily I was flying solo and got seated at the end of the bar meant for handicapped. Lol oh joy. I started by order a bottle of the sparkling \"mio\" sake. It reminds me a lot of drinking moscato but not AS sweet. Still good and easy to drink though. I began my meal with the Lobster Yaki Suba. Although it was tasty, it's totally not worth the $17. I got maybe 4-5 noodles in it, a total of possibly 3 pieces of lobster, and the rest of it was made up of bean sprouts, which I happen to hate. Womp womp womp. I moved onto my main attraction - the shabu shabu. I went with the wagyu round. Good quality meat. The wagyu was perfectly marbled and tender. I went with the togarashi soup base because I like it spicy! I liked the selection of veggies and the udon to finish. My first time having legit shabu shabu, and I wasn't disappointed."}
{"text":"very good food and nice ppl. it was good that it was byob. the food was a little pricey for what it was, but i had never had shabu-shabu (sp) before and it was a fun night. 

overall, good make it yourself soup, and nice it was byob."}
{"text":"Holy shabu shabu batman! This place is not just a restaurant, it's a hands-on experience. You can create, customize, and cook your own shabu bowl with your choice of three different broths, either lamb, wagu beef, pork, seafood .. served with a wide range of veggies and rice and nice thick udon! During which you somewhat get a broth facial with all the steam... BUT it's totally worth it. The place smells amazing from the moment you walk in. Any combination of different meats and broths and sauces was just divine. Our serve was friendly, knowledgable and very welcoming of our naivety of the shabu ways.
Make reservations though, the place is small, but MIGHTY!"}
{"text":"Had a great time. Service is good, food is dope, great vibe. Thank you for introducing Japanese shabu To Cleveland."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I always have an incredible evening at Ushabu. The atmosphere is intimate yet inviting. When you are seated your waiter will take you through the thoughtful inspiration behind the menu's current offerings that are in addition to the staple Shabu-Shabu. The story behind the food elevates Ushabu from the standard dining to a fully immersive and thought-provoking experience. They also offer an extensive Sake list with knowledgeable staff to help anyone identify a Sake they would enjoy. 

All of the food we have ordered has been fun and imaginative and the Shabu-Shabu is delicious. The service is absolutely phenomenal and you are treated as a friend from the first time you walk in. I cannot recommend this place enough. 5++++ Stars"}
{"text":"Great service. Great food. Different but lovely atmosphere. 10/10 recommend. I'd like to see a slightly more expansive drink menu. Other than that, phenomenal."}
{"text":"The shabushabu is good especially for the Ohio wagyu and the soup. The rice is just awful. I didn't expect  to have this kind of half cooked rice in a Japanese restaurant. I am quite picky on rice so it's probably just me, I don't know."}
{"text":"ingredients very fresh and price was on the high end. I came in with my boyfriend as a walk in, they put our names down.They said they will text us and they didnt,after having a beer down the road we were wondering if they had open spots because we didn't hear anything from them in 2 hours. They did, 4 seats at the shabu shabu bar was cleared and 1 table when we came back without their notification.We are young and they thought were  weren't serious about eating there.Just because I'm young looking doesn't mean I pay for good food.It was very sub par.We got the Miso based with veggies and meat. This place was a Americanized japanese place."}
{"text":"Second time back. Now have alcohol. Excellent meal, excellent service. Nice to have a shabu shabu restaurant in Cleveland. Would have given 5 stars but wine prices are high . Don't recall seeing a glass for less than $17 but wouldn't keep me from going back.  Overall excellent."}
{"text":"Sexy, sophisticated and bold accurately reflects Ushabu from the moment we walked through the door to leaving feeling full. For a party of 6, we were kindly greeted and seated promptly at our  reservation time. For such a small venue, please make a reservation or plan on sitting at the bar.

The menu is diverse, eclectic and seasonally changing based on a specific region and year in Japan, but do not fear, your knowledgeable server will take care of you and explain all sections prior to you making your selections. We ate from the Okinawa 1984 driven menu, to say the least, it was devine and positively memorable.

From Zensai, we selected the Kimuchi & Kyuri, which was a small portion, but dominant enough in flavor and appearance that I couldn't ask for more. It had a little bite at the end of each mouthful that left me craving for one more bite. Likewise, we took our waiters suggestion and ordered the Takoraisu from the Ozara section and I literally was scraping the bottom to try and  eat all that was in the pan, you normally only see this with your grandmother's cooking. The food was astounding and I cannot wait to come back.

In addition, the level 2 Sommelier helped us select the perfect red wine, Stand Out. He gave specific insights on all wine options and answered our questions with in-depth and precise knowledge, this wine is now in my top 5. Even better, we were able to meet the man himself who created the brand from Napa that we drank by coincidence.

To the extremely friendly and attentive staff of Ushamu, you killed it. I will be back for more and will recommend to all. And people, my friends boyfriend made his own cake to surprise our friend with, which they let him bring in early and then brought it to our table after dinner with a candle, way to go Zach!! Not every restaurant will do and execute what you will experience here!"}
{"text":"Had my first shabu-shabu here! Basically you have your own pot of broth and boil meat, vegetables, noodles in it at the table. We got the oshizushi, kombu dashi with pacific seafood omakase and togarashi (spicy) miso with Masami ranch chuck roll. I loved the togarashi miso broth, but I'd say the serving sizes are not big enough. Very nice atmosphere, cute restrooms. Huge fan of the restrooms tbh. Very good service. Came around 8pm on a Sunday night without a reservation."}
{"text":"Well this is a first for Cleveland. A restaurant dedicated to hotpot that offers not just hotpot and tasty appetizers but meats that you just can't buy at the local Whole Foods. I'm talking about Wagyu and more importantly A5 steak! Its a cozy little restaurant which makes a perfect date place. It helps to reserve a table as it seems they get booked pretty quickly on the weekends. All in all will go again."}
{"text":"Cool, quiet, cozy restaurant- yet fitting the style of Tremont.

We've been waiting for this restaurant to open for the longest time- and when it finally opened, we were ecstatic to try it out!

The restaurant is quite small, with their largest table seating about 6 people. It's probably best to call in and make a reservation (as the nights we tried to just stop in, they really did not have any availability), just because the restaurant is smaller.

It's quite a beautiful restaurant- classy, new, and has the individualized hot pot stations for you. We were seated at the bar- and ordered some food right away. 

He got the kombu broth and I got the spicy miso. As my spice tolerance isn't very high (I'm constantly sweating with Szechuan or Korean food), I asked the waitress to define \"how spicy is spicy miso.\" She suggested that they could just put a scoop of the ginger chicken in the spicy miso. And it actually turned out to be a good choice- the spice level was mild, and it still was flavorful. His kombu broth was also very good- what I particularly enjoyed about the broths- was that it wasn't oily. It was a solid broth- and it was healthy at the same time.

We both ordered a \"combo\" - he got the Wagyu beef + seafood, and I got the Wagyu beef + lamb. The seafood.... would probably have been good just raw by itself- we probably will just stick with the meat next time. The Wagyu beef was okay in our opinion (and that really could be just because of the cut at that time), but the lamb was really good. They also give you a bowl of an assortment of items you can add in as well- bok choy leaves, napa cabbage leaves, corn, kabocha, udon noodles, enoki mushrooms, etc etc. They do present it quite nicely as well. There's also a few sauces to dip in as well- soy sauce, ponzu, and sesame. 

Overall, I thought it was a nice experience- and makes for a nice date. I don't think they have their liquor license quite yet (as I noticed couples were bringing in their own bottles of wine), but I'm sure they'll have it soon. It makes for a nice meal though- we weren't stuffed but we weren't hungry- it was just the right amount.

If you're looking for a nice date location and something warm to eat on a cold winter date, I highly suggest Ushabu."}
{"text":"This place is an amazing new addition to the growing food scene in Cleveland! The atmosphere was perfect, intimate and lively. When it comes to the service, I was not disappointed. Our server was polite, personable and on top of things. The food was amazing! The meat was top quality and the veggies were fresh! The only complaint I would add is that there needs to be more vegetables available to the customers. I loved the quality of the meat, but I felt cheated on the vegetable portion. Besides that, it was a very positive experience! I would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I don't usually write reviews but, this establishment always wows me every time we go. 

A small place, seats about 25~ people, but the quality of service and food makes you thankful it is that way. The staff is able to give you a very personable experience because of it, and on top of it, one you'll never really be ready to let go after you leave.

I grew up in a really authentic Laotian household, and we did \"hot pot\" all the time. I'm extremely picky of the quality of ingredients that go into it because of the quality my family use to put into ours. I've never been disappointed going to Ushabu, and honestly I wish it was closer to where I live (probably would go WAY more often).

In detail, I loved the Ginger Chicken broth, and my SO - the spicy Togarashi Miso. I personally like the Fish Marker Omakase since the fish that comes with it change almost every time I go; however, it's always fresh and absolutely tasty. My SO on the other hand loves the Ohio Wagyu - it's always very tender and full of flavor. I'm lucky there's ever any to spare for me to try (though we do order extra a la carte meats every time). 

Best of all, they finally serve sake and wine now so all my cravings have been met. 

If you're looking for a Shabu restaurant with excellent quality of food, staff, and service, you won't find it anywhere else in CLE. I'm in love with this place and I know you will too if you give it a try."}
{"text":"I arrived to Cleveland to get my sommelier certification and in all honesty, I didn't think much of this visit. During a very small break from my studying, I did a little research and this little absolutely adorable Japanese place caught my eye!!!

Wow wow wow! Michael Flaherty truly stepped up to the plate and stole the culinary part of my heart! Last minute they found me a table and when I got confused about the wine, Michael did not just suggest what I should have, he took the time to explain everything to me! I actually walked away with some knowledge and future cooking projects:) 

The chef is absolutely genius and the wait staff is out of this world. The food is outstanding and truly exotic!!! I had a seaweed salad that had at least 6 visible components ( absolutely fabulous! ) followed by pork cheek with all thee sauces ... and then risotto... Asian risotto cooked to perfection! Fabulous, one of the most unique Japanese venues I have ever experienced!"}
{"text":"5 for service. But I have to say it's still just fondue. Great surroundings an quality ingredients. But still, it's just fondue"}
{"text":"This place is built around Shabu-Shabu which I was told means swish-swish representing how you cook your own meat. That's right. You cook your own meal. 

This can be a really simple experience. There are appetizers if you want, but if not all you had to do is pick one of three meats (or vegetarian) and one of three broth bases. The waiter did a great job explaining the process and options and the differences between the broths.  

I chose the spicy miso broth which wasn't super hot, but did have a heat that had built up by the end - enough to make the ice cream and sorbet dessert menu look appealing. (The sorbet flavor was good, though it could have been creamier).

The server brought out the broth, turned on the burner and soon it was boiling. I added the veg assortment and noodles that comes with all broth and meat selections and let those soften up. Then swish-swish. I dunked the thinly sliced Wagyu beef into the broth and it browed up quickly. 

For eating there are a couple options. You can make a soup if you want, or eat the food with rice. For the latter method three sauces were provided all of which I liked. 

For my first time in I was pleased. I left full, but not unpleasantly stuffed. I left feeling like I ate something moderately healthy. And I had a fun time. I will definitely stop back again. The experience doesn't take as long as one might think so it is a good anytime option and not really a special occasion place like perhaps hibachi or fondue places are considered. The place is very small though, so reservations are probably advised. Do note, even with reservations, owing to the design of the place, you will probably be seated at the bar counter if you are a party of two."}
{"text":"Very cool place to check out.  The menu changes throughout the year but the shabu stays the same.  This restaurant is very hipster and small.  Nice assortment of Japanese Beer.  The ribs we had were superb.  The theme for the menu was Okinawa.  I would've preferred more meat in some of our dishes.  

Service was wonderful.  At one point the head chef actually talked to us about their menu selection and food quality and sourcing."}
{"text":"This place is very small and chic. It's new and really popular so take my advice and book wayyyyy in advance if you want to try this place out. The food if good and the service is great. It's a little pricey too but on a winter day and if you want to enjoy a good old shabu shabu experience, you'll like this place. Oh ya... it's good for dates too."}
{"text":"This place is just incredible. The service is spot on, the food is beautiful, and the experience is just fun...having a leisurely meal while dropping all of the lush ingredients into your steaming hot cauldron of broth. You can byob, for now, with no corking fee, which is also a plus. This is the perfect dinner destination for cold, snowy winter nights in Cleveland! HIGHLY RECOMMEND.  If you haven't been to USHABU yet....USHOULD!"}
{"text":"We ate there with two friends on December 3rd and had a phenomenal experience. Excellent food, knowledgeable and attentive staff, comfortable surroundings. I highly recommend it. This place is a great addition to the Cleveland food scene. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Wow.  Really really good.  I think 5 star reviews are overused on Yelp but Ushabu DEFINITELY deserves.   As a Yelp user and contributor I believe 5 stars should be saved for the absolute best on the block....Ushabu is doing Shabu Shabu better than anyone in Cleveland right now.  
We started with the 5.Spice Chicken and the Pork Belly apps.  Both were awesome.  The Pork Belly was cooked perfectly and the chicken had so many different and complimentary flavors...and super crisp!
I moved on to a Spicy Miso Broth and Wagyu Beef and Lamb....the meat quality is high....both were beautifully marbled and cooked in seconds. The vegetables that came out first were gorgeously colored - especially for December in Cleveland!  Leaving those in for a while made for such a delicious broth to later pour over my noodles when all the meat was gone.....superb 
I'm looking forward to trying again soon!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Excellent food and service. Great atmosphere for a date night or a night out with friends. You honestly can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Give it a try and see for yourself!"}
{"text":"Ushabu reminds me of a small little chic NYC spot. The whole concept is very interactive and fun, and the food turns out amazing. From my experiences the waitresses are kind of awkward. I've been twice and both time they are hesitant to be assertive and don't do a great job at explaining the menu/cooking process. I feel like I'm pulling teeth of the them to explain to me what to do!! 
I do however love the environment and love the food. I always have a blast there and I love the byob situation. I feel like they need to do a better job of explaining a) that it only accommodates 25 people b) that it's byob c) the menu and what to do."}
{"text":"I can't remember the last time I actually used Yelp for anything, but their treatment of your fine establishment has inspired me to show my support. I'd give more than 5 stars if I could just to make up for that A$$hole that gave a bogus review. 

This aggression will not stand, Man.

My girlfriend and I visited a few weeks back and had a wonderful meal - we ordered a bunch of stuff - Five Spice Chicken was bomb, Clams, Ginger Salmon all on point. We also ordered a Combo Meat Shabu-Shabu with Ohio Wagyu Beef and Australian Lamb and shared it... which our waiter kindly allowed us to do, even tho that is not the norm. 

Only thing better than our meal was the service, each person we interacted with was clearly well trained and passionate about making our regular Tuesday a memorable. 

Ushabu is a great addition to our food scene and should be supported! The design aesthetic is a very clean/modern take on what I would imagine could be found in Japan. Even their bathroom was well thought out and they have the coolest sinks in CLE... don't believe me? 

Go check for yourself!

Cheers and good luck to the Ushabu team - we'll be back soon!

{"text":"I kept seeing stellar reviews of this restaurant so I decided to make it a night. The restaurant is very small but beautifully designed. I was greeted promptly and taken to my seat. I need to stress that you HAVE to have reservations because the seating is so limited!

The bar where I sat had a little inset cooktop to boil the broth (SO COOL!) and was set with two spoons and a set of chopsticks. I couldn't decide because everything on the menu looked delicious! I settled on the scallop appetizer and a combo of wagyu and lamb with the ginger chicken broth. The scallop was PERFECT! Hard seared on the outside and insanely tender on the inside. It was served with melt-in-your-mouth pork belly, quail egg, tobiko, and a citrus sauce. My broth arrived quickly after and began to bubble on the burner. I was given a bowl stuffed with carrots, sweet potato, noodles, mushrooms, locally made tofu, bokchoy, and greens as well as a bowl of seasoned rice. Then the meat arrived and I was stunned by how beautiful and obviously good quality it was!! Cooked in the flavorful broth, the meat just melted! Topped the meal off with a pot of green tea! Also, do note that at this time they don't have a bar and it is BYOB.

Overall, the experience was very fun! I always enjoy meals that are hands on! For the price, the quality and the portion size CAN'T be beat! The service is prompt and very friendly, the atmosphere is cozy and warm, AND you walk out having had a really neat experience. I will definitely be back! And bring friends!"}
{"text":"This place is one of a kind and especially in Cleveland. The owner and chef, Matt, did a great job and you can tell he really put a lot of time into his restaurant. 

We got to try the Ramen which was brand new. And let me tell you, It was the best ramen I've ever had. The mushroom appetizer was good along with the halibut sashimi. We also ordered the wagu and the stew for it was great. They even had 3 sauces where you can mix it together and It turns out even better. 

Overall, very impressed with this charming restaurant."}
{"text":"As far as Hot pot goes... it's average. Did not think the broth was that special and the variety of food isn't the best. The plate of veggies and meats was a small amount and not very diverse. There also wasn't the traditional spread of dipping sauces and additional toppings.

This is expensive shabu shabu for first timers looking for a new experience with ambiance"}
{"text":"I'd been wanting to try this place for a while and decided our Valentine's Day date was a good time. We never go out to eat on Feb 14, but usually choose a random date during the month of Feb to celebrate the \"holiday\". I'm glad we chose a different date and made a reservation because I didn't realize how small this place is! Everything went well with our reservation, seated very quickly exactly as expected. The smallness of the place is actually really nice but it means you need to plan ahead and have a reservation. They suggested getting a reservation a week in advance if you want to come on a weekend. 

Each seat has a hot pot built in to the area in front of it. You get a bowl of broth and you are to cook you veggies in there and then cook your chosen meat in it. Really fun! Kind if like fondue but better. I really liked the experience of the meal, just really fun and something different than the usual. 

After doing this once, I recommend to dump all the veggies into the broth at once and let those cook because they really flavor the broth as they cook. When you've cooked them a bit, then start cooking the meat. As we found out, the broth gets more flavorful as the meal goes on so you want your meat to get all the flavor from those veggies as you can. 
The portion sizes are perfect. I had the seafood and my hubs had the beef. Along with the small place of 5 spice chicken we got - was the perfect amount of food. 

By the end of the meal the star is the broth. I still had my udon noodles in the bowl so I just scooped out all the broth I could from the hot pot and put it right over those noodles and started slurping those things up. So delicious and so perfect for a cold night.

Basically, I can't wait to come back and try this place again. Next time I might try the vegetarian portion and just focus on that broth/noodles at the end."}
{"text":"This restaurant was fantastic! My best friend and I came here after a terrible experience at a new restaurant/club in the Gateway district.  
It's a small place, so I would definitely suggest reservations on the weekend.  We went right after opening on a Thursday and were the only people there for almost 25 minutes.  They only have 4 or 5 booths, seating 4 people.  The bar also has individual stoves with a guesstimate of an additional 10-12 seats.
Service from the hostess and our server was awesome.  Our server was very knowledgeable about the menu and the history of shabu shabu.  The menu that they were using was in it's last days. So there may be different offerings in the near future.
The food was delicious!  And there was sooooo much of it!  The menu has individual portions but if you aren't a big eater, it's enough to share.  We each got the Shabu Shabu with ramen.  My friend got the fish market Omakase and I got Smoked Ohio Pork Belly and a small side of Ohio Wagyu beef.  She got the ginger chicken, which had a mild flavor. I chose the Kombu dashi and definitely recommend that one for better flavor.  Every thing was super fresh and you can pick and choose what vegetables you want to cook.  It's like Japanese Melting Pot  (a horrible description, I know lol) but it was interactive and tasty.
For dessert, we got the mochi ice cream and Matcha shaved ice with condensed sweetened milk.  Super simple, but delish!
It this kind of thing matters to you, their tap water was really good.  Their bathroom was really clean and the sink is so cool! It's a Dyson that is both a faucet and an hand dryer.
Overall, go check this place out!"}
{"text":"I doubt you'll find a better Hot Pot in Cleveland. It's a small space, but their flavors pack a punch. The appetizers are good, but the mains are astronomically better. Their wine selection is also off-the-chain. If you come to Cleveland looking for some Asian-inspired fusion, come here first."}
{"text":"Ushabu is one of Cleveland 's best kept secrets.  The decor and service are excellent!   Probably one of the best I've experienced in Cleveland.   Though small in space, what really makes the restaurant special is its unique menu and attention to detail.   The entire staff makes your visit memorable.

Their specialty is shabu shabu.   If you never had it nor know what it is... think of it as a Japanese style fondue ... but AMAZING!    Imagine, a savorily refreshing traditional Japanese dish which is constituted by a compilation of fresh ingredients influenced by Chinese cuisine with a Taiwanese flare.  

Currently they are featuring a new summer menu titled \"Okinawa 1984\".   My recommendation is to start with the  Zensai section.   My favorites are the Namusu and the spicy kimchi.  Zensai means appetizer but should mean small delight!  Each bite is amazing.  Especially the Namusu.

Other dishes I recommend are Jushi, Popo, lobster yaki suba, and Rafuta.  If you like pork belly then you'll love the Rafuta.  Either way you can't go wrong with any dish,  the chef loves his craft which you'll experience with the taste and presentation.

Like I mentioned earlier if you've never been to Ushabu then definitely try the shabu shabu.   But don't sleep on the main menu.   It's seasonal but it's yours to enjoy for the summer.  

The best quality of Ushabu is everyone takes pride in their work.  If your intriguingly reading this THEN GO!!!! You deserve this!"}
{"text":"This place has so much potential in my eyes, but I have to be completely honest, my first visit was a letdown. 

First and foremost, I would highly recommend others to make a reservation if you plan on eating here. Fortunately, my friend and I did, but I could see others coming in disappointed, not realizing they would have needed one. The space is quite small and can really only seat 6 or 7 parties at a time. That being said, I really did like the ambiance here. I think they paid a lot of attention to detail. The artwork fits with the space, and while it is cozy with the small space, I felt there was sufficient space for the hotpot spaces so you didn't feel crammed against the person next to you. I also felt like the lighting, fixtures and decor were all cohesive giving it a pretty upscale feel. 

Next, I have to be a little critical of the service here. For such a small restaurant and the amount of servers, I estimate each server probably has only 3 or 4 parties at a time maximum. With that in mind, I think servers should have ample time to spend time with each guest and ensure they have an experience where they feel really taken care of (in comparison to a family style hotpot restaurant where the service would be far less). Our server did greet us right away and inform us that they unfortunately did not have their liquor license yet. After ordering our drinks though, she didn't come back until several minutes later to ask us if we were ready to order. Keep in mind that up until that point, she hadn't told us anything about the menu other than that they didn't have their liquor license. Although I've eaten hotpot several times in various capacities, I still asked for her to give us a rundown of the menu setup and portion sizing. She didn't seem very prepared to sell the product, and had this been my first exposure to hotpot, I think I would have been really lost. All she told us was that the hotpots were sized for one, but didn't describe the different offerings or explain anything on the menu. I kind of felt let down by the service here, as I said, hotpot may be unfamiliar to a lot of folks, and also I think for any new restaurant, it's important to help the guest understand the basics. My friend and I ended up ordering on our own anyways, we got the pork belly appetizer along a hotpot for each of us. At about $25/hotpot, I do think the menu is priced fairly. It's not generously sized by any means, and most hotpot restaurants will give you a lot more for that price, but given the ambiance, I didn't feel ripped off. The hotpot menu itself is ordered by protein- pork, beef, lamb, seafood, vegetarian, or a combination of any two. After choosing your protein, you can choose from three different broth options: ginger chicken, spicy miso and kombu (a seaweed base). Each hotpot comes with a medley of vegetables including cabbage, daikon, carrots, mushrooms, tofu and udon noodles. There are also several add-on options, but most are protein based. They didn't have a lot of add-ons I was hoping for such as tofu puffs, shrimp balls and different greens such as cabbage and Chinese watercress. 

Our starter, the pork belly, was absolutely delicious. While very rich, it was very well balanced, and one of those dishes that made me want to lick the plate. As for their namesake the hotpot however, my friend and I were totally disappointed. The broths were really lackluster. My friend had ordered the spicy miso, but unfortunately it had little to no spice to it whatsoever. My broth, the ginger chicken, was virtually flavorless. I've had hotpots before that were a little on the milder side, but they are typically served with more rich and robust add-ons, such as pork blood or seafood balls. For me, since the hotpot ingredients were also unflavored, it really felt like there was something missing. They did give us three sauces on the side for dipping, but it didn't add enough for me to make up for the lack of flavor in the broth personally. I'm accepting that perhaps this restaurant is attempting to slowly introduce hotpot in a way that is more palatable for those that may be unfamiliar with eating hotpot, but I still think there needs to be more in terms of flavor. 

My final thoughts were that while I was glad I got to try Ushabu, and even more glad that there is finally a hotpot restaurant in Cleveland, I couldn't see myself coming back here just for hotpot. I might come back for the small plates, if they are all as good as the pork belly, I'd be really happy with that, but again, the hotpot was a miss for me. I think if you have never tried hotpot and just want to try it out, you'll probably enjoy the experience, but on the other hand if you're a hotpot veteran, this may be a letdown for you. I will also add that I really do think the servers should be more prepared to explain and accommodate customers in order to give them the best experience possible."}
