{"text":"I've only tried the breakfast there..and it was delicious..greasy but delicious.! Very \"diner\" like restaurant... 4-5 tables max .. Great spot for a quick bite"}
{"text":"This is our go-to breakfast joint in Verdun! The price to quality ratio just can't be beat! I've also had several other menu items, and definitely recommend the pizza, the rex special sub (extraordinary tzaziki!), and the burgers and onion rings. Their greek salad is also excellent! This is a very casual \"greasy-spoon\" type place, but the food never disappoints!"}
{"text":"Love the old-school vibe without the hipsters! Hard core owners but we love our hot dogs and poutine that's not from a chain!"}
{"text":"I come here for breakfast regularly.  I've been to all breakfast spots in LaSalle, and none have been as good as this spot.  The toast are just right,  and the eggs are never over cooked.   I'm looking forward to trying their other menu items, such as their pizzas and burgers. Plus, they really make you feel like family- the waitress remembers you after one visit. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"One of the best brunch in town. The plate are full and the quality of the food is good. The staff is always ready to give you what you need (no patato more fruit). More I go better it is.  Love that place.  Leon"}
{"text":"Blt needs a little work, mayo. Bacon a bit more cooked then how they serve it.  Cream cheese bagel is lacking the yummy creamy cheese part lol  Nice family run business"}
{"text":"worst place to eat, they rip you off , charge you 4$ for adding gravy to your fries and the old hag that says ¨what are we having , what are we having¨as soon as you walk in the door , has all the table manners of a PIG"}
{"text":"I do not tend to give that many 5 star ratings, but when you add in the cleanliness of this pizzeria (plus a whole lot more menu items and breakfast to boot), it makes sense. Let me elaborate. I noticed how pristine the walls, floors and the general ambiance was the moment I stepped in for a mid afternoon snack. I confirmed they had renovated 7 months ago. The decal in the window states since 1965, so I can only imagine what it was like way back when. Now on to the food and service. Family owned and operated there is an air of pride here that is not always felt at other local joints. In no particular order, the burgers were straight up Montreal fried and dressed, in all-dressed fashion (ie. no mayo or ketchup) yet include vinegar pickle slices, shredded coleslaw, mustard and relish - like you get on a steamed hotdog chez a Montreal \"casse-croute\". The poutine gravy was a real standout. Likened to the kind you get on a good hamburger steak - not thick and goopy, just delicious. The cheese was not the squeeky kind, but did taste good with the fresh cut fries. Squirt bottles of vinegar were a neat accessory. Now skip over 18 hours and breakfast was also well above average. Their 'Le Brunch' plate included sausage links that reminded me of Picasso's (RIP), fluffy pancakes, french toast (simple white bread battered with a little egg), excellent feves-au-lard (baked beans with fat chunks), quality maple syrup (which can be subbed out for corn syrup in many places), tomato's or fruit (your choice), crisp bacon (salty, but not skimpy) and coffee (strong diner style) or black tea in a metal server. Other observations I noticed were many regulars reading their free Le Journal de Montreal newspapers. Fair prices too, yet cash only was the only real short coming I could find in my two visits."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of eating at Rex for breakfast! What a treat: the food? Delicious! Along with a warm friendly service. You get so much for your buck!! For a mere 7,50$ I got a full breakfast: two eggs, bacon, sausage, toast, french toast, pancake, beans and fruits. You MUST try this place!"}
