{"text":"Horrible service. Came to an empty bar and did not get served. Looks the owner does not know how to run a business"}
{"text":"Very decent place...the food and music was amazing ..very good customer service...this is one of the  rare places were you won't find anything  to complain about. Good Job Guys."}
{"text":"Music is good, the spot looks awesome and the girls are attentive  but the hookah sucks, it not only taste bad but they probably don't clean it as often as they should. The drinks are watered down; I had the mojito, mostly tasted like club soda with cheap vodka AND the mints were brown :( oh! and it was completely empty on a Saturday night at 1am!!! I'd suggest beer only! Or just another spot in all."}
{"text":"Simply amazing ,the place is beautiful, music is good the service was impeccable we had a blast and one of the owner Ali is a sweetheart treated us like royalty."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and music is up to date. But the servers and owners are snobby and they expect a nice tip on top of gratuity!??lol nah. All of them need to clean their act up. Stop chilling in the corners of the place and serve and be attentive to your customers. Smh"}
{"text":"Upscale shisha upscale located in wood bridge west of Toronto.  Used to be La Fanouse. Great environment and good shisha. Not the best though. Service is not bad too and they have variety of food and drinks selections."}
{"text":"The shisha in itself was decent, but the service is sub-par, if not at times completely absent but that's probably my fault for always coming at extremely busy hours whenever I'm in the area. The vibe is heaps of fun! Drinks are a little expensive, haven't yet tried any of their food so can't comment on that."}
{"text":"I picked this place, among all the near by place to my home, but it turned out it was wrong choice. The reviews were good on Google and here, thought of giving a try. But, not worth of traveling all the way to this place (it was like 25 kms from my home)  This place was locked down on monday night, when all the other places were atleast half busy. The phone number listed is not working. Not sure even this place exist in real? Looks like deserted place from outside. Won't recommend to travel all the way to this place and then returning fail."}
{"text":"I came on a slow night and didn't try any of the food. The music was good, the layout was great and I like the comfortable couches. But watch out for the prices, drinks can get expensive if you're not paying attention. Overall great experience and highly recommended."}
{"text":"Been to this place for a total of three times, and that did it for me.. Cameo has a great potential if it was done better, their hookahs are somewhat a little above average, but still fall short compared to some other places in the area. Service is not bad, they check on you often, and food gets out fast, but their staff still do not feel too professional.  They do dj nights on weekends, where it gets really crowded, bottle service, etc... So it's not your typical 'cafe' setup where you can chill and have a quite time, while enjoying your shisha..this place is always loud, and have more of a younger 'loud' crowd.  Setup and ambiance is nice, cool colours and interiors, but that's about it..  2/5 at most!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. The waitresses are so sweet and attentive. The owner was a sweetheart and checked up on us to make sure everything was okay. I came here for two birthdays in a row and will continue to do so. The place is gorgeous."}
