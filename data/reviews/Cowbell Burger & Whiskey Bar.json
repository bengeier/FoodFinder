{"text":"The food and service was amazing!  You will be hard to fine a better whiskey special downtown.  Will definitely be coming back here."}
{"text":"First time lunch visit with some friends from out of town. Food was great and the staff was very attentive. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great beer selection, sweet potato tots are a must. We come here often for the rotating beer selection and quality burgers. Service can be slow when they're slammed but always very friendly and accommodating  despite the rush. Love the pork burger with hoisin. Srsly get the sweet potato tots."}
{"text":"Fun \"Moosic (music videos ), food and drinks. Service was fast and friendly. We ate and drank around 4:30 on a Saturday before a Hornets game and the  bar stools were 1/2 filled and there is lots of space at tables but it's filling up as we type. Bruiser burger excellent. GFY salad was light and nice. Drinks were spot on.  College bball on the screen a plus as well. Nice people here making noise and having fun."}
{"text":"Maybe it's great as a bar, but we were there to eat. (On a weeknight, the bar was packed with dressed up after-work types but the tables were empty.)   The burger menu was interesting at first, until we realized most of the burgers are basically the same with one or two combinations of house items (like candied bacon, etc) swapped in or our to make \"new\" items. So while the list of burgers appears long, they are all more or less the same. If this one burger is your perfect burger, great, but it just wasn't mine.  My fries were dry and covered with what seemed like grocery store powdered parmesan, which I didn't care for. It was everywhere, and there was no tapping it off. The burger meat was just okay, the mayo on the bottom was so generous it kept blooping all over the plate, and the mushrooms on top were so dry and tough I couldn't chew them--my teeth literally couldn't cut the stems. Yuck.  I also wasn't a fan of the ambiance at large--massive flat screens on maximum brightness blasted flashing music videos to the dated hits that were playing a bit too loud, and that's just a little too much for me to relax and enjoy a meal."}
{"text":"Best corn dog I've ever had. But service can make or break a dining experience. I was part of a group of 4. Sunday afternoon. One other couple in the empty restaurant. Took 45 minutes to get our meal. The meal came out cold, and you could tell by the glaze and film that had built up on our sauces that it had been sitting for forever.  This place had a great vibe and great scotch/whiskey selection but we were all disappointed by the service."}
{"text":"Decent burgers, but over rated due to very poor staff. Last 2 times there- 1st was nearly 100 degrees inside, tons of folks asked if could adjust temp- answer: \"maybe\" (never did). Then next visit we asked numerous times to switch 1 TV to requested game- didn't happen. But bar staff had plenty of time to come to other side of bar to BS w their friends tho. Big Daddy Burger better imo, w/o the give a crap attitude at CB."}
{"text":"We checked this place out through my yelp app and the reviews were consistently good and we were forewarned about the volume of the music.  We went at around 9 on a Saturday and my friend and I both loved the atmosphere. Our server was very friendly and didn't push us to order. We got the Sinatra to start, Deep fried hand pulled mozzarella with prosciutto, fresh basil and sauce. It was YUMMY! I'm not a food critic but the batter seemed a little heavy but it didn't take away from it.  I had the Carolina burger and my friend had patty melt. They we awesome! The fries on my friends plate were cold but the server was quick to make it right and got us fresh ones and they were great!  It was an impromptu trip and it was worth it. It wasn't TOO pricey for the food and we left happy and satisfied.  The music was a liiiitttle loud but we knew that going into it per the reviews so we didn't allow it to affect our overall take on it.  We'd come back again!"}
{"text":"Wow. We were wandering around Charlotte on our first night in town trying to find a good place for dinner and thankfully happened upon Cowbell Burger. I am a burger and fries girl to the core and this place was amazing. We started out with the sweet potato croquettes, which were so good. I know they are working on a dessert menu, but these legitimately could be dessert rather than an appetizer.  They were so tasty. For dinner, each of us had different burgers with different sides. There was not a bad option among them. The onion rings were incredible - not too heavy, not too much breading.  The sweet potato tots were great, as was the mac and cheese. Not a bad meal in the bunch.   Overall, this is a restaurant/bar that we will definitely come back to...just the right mix of creativity, fun, and great food."}
{"text":"This is the former location of Nix burger, which I loved!!   That's about the only good thing I have to say about this place.     We sat at the bar after the lunch rush (ie, people were leaving, not piling in).  We were a party of 2 and ordered 2 burgers and 2 big beers.  (The beer was good!)   2 guys came in and sat beside us quite a while after we ordered and ordered burgers as well.  When are beers were almost gone...our burgers, as well as the guys' beside us burgers arrived.    Huh?!   Do they have to wait til they have orders for multiple burgers before they start cooking?  The burger was just OK for someplace that is supposed to specialize in burgers and that charges as much as they do.  Don't bother!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, one of the best burgers I've had in years. The staff are very pleasant to be around, last but not least the drinks are in point."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I visited Cowbell for her birthday. We've really enjoyed Cowbell in the past and it seemed like the obvious choice when deciding where to celebrate. Our experience was quite the opposite on this visit, however.  Not long after we set and ordered, a group of 4 clearly intoxicated guests sat down close to us and began ordering drinks/shots and an appetizer with the same waitress. After at least twenty minutes after taking our order (and watching that same table receiving and finishing the same appetizer we ordered), we finally received our own lil smokies. At least that's what I think they were (badly burnt and extremely poorly prepared). We've ordered these before and have never been this badly prepared and cooked.  The service continued to remain poor as the group of four (who continued to order shots) were visited several times while I couldn't even get a refill on water. There are many more places we could have gone to celebrate her birthday and receive much better service. We've recommend Cowbell to several coworkers due to fairly good food and service in the past, but don't think we can going forward. There are too many new places opening in Uptown to make mistakes like this with frequent customers.  Sent a similar complaint email to management but never heard back."}
{"text":"Stop here for lunch on a whim and it was delicious. My wife had the Cowbell Hotdog which is a 1/4 lb dog that is wrapped in bacon and a on a pretzel bun. I had the NYC burger that has pastrami on it with house made onion rings. Will definitely be stopping here again whenever we are in town."}
{"text":"Love love love Cowbell! My boyfriend and I eat here once a week. Amazing food for a great price!!"}
{"text":"The ruhm emanule (sp?) and Danny tacos were great! Brought some friends from out of town and they enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere!  Fun watching the mucis video's.! Enthusiastic bartender!  Ordered the F'in tacos. Too much bbq sauce. Beer cheese doesnt go with bbq sauce very well.  The beer cheese sauce had not enough cheese flavor. The frys and onion rings just ok."}
{"text":"decent vibe. CRAP service.  2nd visit this wk while traveling and my first impression was awful... I retuned only b/c of their MLB package where I could watch the Giants here out East. Upon return I realized quickly it wasn't just a \"bad day\" my dirt time through, rather their service is genuinely terrible.  indulge with Caution."}
{"text":"Our burgers came out in well under 10 minutes. That should have been our first clue. They were not hot and they were not juicy. I wouldn't say they were over cooked; it seems like to be ready so fast and not be the least bit hot, it makes you think they must be sitting it a tray full of burgers in the kitchen. They weren't bad...they weren't good. To add to the disappointment, our buns were stale and we each had s different type of bun. When a place says in their name they're a burger joint, the burgers need to be top notch. They need to be better than I make at home. Ours were not."}
{"text":"I got stuck in Charlotte for two night due to weather and got to Cowbells just in time to watch the Panthers annihilate the Cardinals to secure their spot in the Super Bowl.  I enjoyed several of the quality Bourbons on menu as well as their Wagu burger (amazing!) and worth the $20.  BUT... that was not what was as cool as this.  About an hour after the Panthers won, Greg Olsen (TE) and Jared Allen (DE) walk in and sit down 4ft behind me, wearing their Championship hats.  The place went nuts!  AWESOME NIGHT, AWESOME FOOD, AWESOME NFL PLAYERS!"}
{"text":"Great food.  Little expensive for a burger, but quite tasty.  Had the dumpling burger which was an interesting en of pork and hoisin sauce.  The onion rings, while creative, were too filling and very breaded.    The drinks were well made.  Their old fashioned was just right. The have a great selection of whiskey and bourbon."}
{"text":"Great brunch menu, good bloody Mary's.  Heard they have great burgers too, will try next time."}
{"text":"Ok, my son was looking for a burger joint uptown to eat for his 18th birthday.  I stumbled onto a fantastic burger place, Cowbell burger and bar.  The service is fantastic an our server Angie made sure everything was perfect.     Now, the burgers are fantastic and no matter what burger you get they will cook them the way you like them...I had the PM burger which was fantastic and the sweet potato tater tots are ok of his world   Great atmosphere and just an all around great time and great evening.  If you are Looking for a great Burger place, this is the place to be in uptown Charlotte!!"}
{"text":"This was an ok chill spot.  We didn't really have too many complaints.  The chicken wings were just ok and the mules were more ice than anything.  The atmosphere is cool.  It's a little loud with tvs and music but a cool place.  It is really small on the inside so I can see how it gets packs fast."}
{"text":"Visiting the area from Upper Michigan to catch up with a fiend living here. Lindsey our bartender was awesome! Made sure we had everything we needed, gave us menu recommendations and kept us laughing the entire time. Food was excellent and the boys loved their drinks. Awesome atmosphere, very clean and updated place. We would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I wanted to love Cowbell, but this has to be one of the top five worst burgers I have ever had.  Every burger at our table was way overcooked and super dry - I don't understand how a burger place can't get the temperature right. We sent two back, and our server was really accommodating, but even the replacements were over charred and unevenly cooked.  The sweet potato tots are great, but I go to a burger spot to get burgers, not sides. Get it together Cowbell"}
{"text":"This place was a fun experience! I would rate a 4 for the atmosphere and a 3 for the food. They have a very vintage feel with loud music which is always nice. Burgers were a bit pricy and for the most part good. Got the sweet potato tots and didn't really enjoy them. Maybe I'll get the Fries next time!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! Really enjoyed the \"Will's Big Breakfast\" Burger! Egg over easy done right!"}
{"text":"Great, lively atmosphere with catchy tunes playing. The fried mozzarella appetizer is really good. They lost a star for slightly soggy fries and below average burgers (for a \"burger bar\"). Definitely a great place for atmosphere and drinks with friends"}
{"text":"Cowbell has a rock and roll theme. Which is appropriate for me, since I thought the menu rocked. As many have said, there's a flavor variation for just about everyone. The bar area isn't big, but there's quite a whiskey selection, which had my table planning a return visit."}
{"text":"Burgers were just ok. Sent both of our drinks back because we couldn't drink them. We reordered a Manhattan and a Margarita. The Manhattan was straight bourbon. The Margarita was straight sour juice, no tequila and cost $13. The server, who rarely stopped by the table, said she went ahead and took the first round of drinks off the bill (thanks?) Service was ok at best. Prices are too high for what you get. Wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal!! I sat at the bar, ordered a bruiser burger with onion rings and was close to, if not, the best burger I have ever had! Go there!! Eat at the bar!! Ask for Lyndsey!! You will have an incredible experience, and to top it off, the guy next to me was drinking pappy!"}
{"text":"Upscale burger joint uptown. Been wanting to try it forever and it did not disappoint! My girlfriend and I started with the pumpkin spice croquettes with honey berry butter. Out of this world, I could've made a meal out of those alone!  We split the pilgrim burger and I can honestly say it was one of he best burgers I've ever had. The candied bourbon bacon was so unique paired with the Brie cheese and apple BBQ sauce. We had the sweet potato tots on the side. I've had sweet potato tots before usually served with maple syrup, these were so fresh and dusted with cinnamon sugar they didn't even need a dipping sauce.  For dessert we had the carmel salted pretzel brownie. Again, simply delicious. Served with ice cream and berries on top. Everything was prepared so well, nothing laid on us or was greasy. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"They have disco fries. Do I need to say more? Great, super brunch!!! Wonderful service. Try the Leroys Sleepover for a fun sweet/salty breakfast treat!"}
{"text":"Outstanding food. Burger cooked to perfection. The alcoholic milkshakes are great. Atmosphere wise it's a little cramped for my tastes, seating is uncomfortable, and due to small area and poor acoustic design it can be quite noisy with the slightest amount of people. Staff seemed nice enough."}
{"text":"While its not a traditional burger, the Dumpling is possibly the best burger I've ever had. I had to stop going because my waistline was disappearing. My husband and I now only go for special occasions. So delicious! My mouth is watering as I type."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service.   The burgers were amazing and the sweet potato tots were beyond perfection.   We will definately visit this establishment again"}
{"text":"I'm not sure where to even start with this restaurant..  Decor- it's so well put together. I love everything about it. From the wall full of paintings to the portraits of famous people. I always enjoy walking around and looking at everything they have up. The set up of the tvs are cool too! Love the music videos that play the whole time. I always enjoy a good throw back of foo fighters or blink 182! Can never go wrong with that :)  Service- incredible. Our server was so sweet and friendly. She was very knowledgeable about the menu and every section of it. Everyone works together and helps out. They are fast paced but I don't feel forgotten about. My drink never went empty, plates and napkins were brought immediately after ordering appetizers. They are just overall very on top of their job. Which I always appreciate. An unforgotten table is always a 20%+ tip!   Food- holy cowbell! It rang my bell. I got the Sinatra as a starter and was blown away. Everything is made in house from the sauce down to the mozzarella itself. You can't beat mozzarella that's hand pulled in house. The plate set up was nice too! Perfect amount of sauce. For my entree I got the boogans bacon. Uh hello!? Bacon marmalade, where have you been all my life?? It was the perfect amount of sweetness to make the burger impeccable. Hands down one of the best burgers I've had. Dessert I was told to get the velvet revolver. Which they said was a homemade red velvet cake crumble covered over ice cream.. Wait for it.. They DEEP FRIED IT!! OMG!! Life changing. You have to get.   Overall this is one of the best places uptown and I can't wait to go eat there again. Hopefully soon because \"I gotta fever and the only cure for it is more cowbell\""}
{"text":"Been here three times now.  The first two times, the place was quiet; and the third time it really humming; the singles were mixing very well :)  Service has always been top class and the burgers, appetizers, and salads are great!  Definitely way above average for bar food.  Actually, the burgers are probably as good as served anywhere.  Prices very reasonable too.  Having pretty and friendly barladies/waitresses is always a plus..."}
{"text":"DON'T COME HERE!! Called a takeout order at 645, was told it'd take 20-25min, I came at 715 (so 30min after), I did not get my food until 755. They made me stand for over 30minutes. I don't know how this place is in business. It took them over an hour to cook my takeout order"}
{"text":"What I like about this place...live music on Wed, $6 house whiskey that's actually really good and a great selection of burgers. Try them without the bun. Burgers are very good, great variety, well presented and you can finish your whole quality meal with a drink on the cheap."}
{"text":"Good food, decent service but the music is ridiculously loud and its pretty expensive for a burger and alcohol.   I asked if they could turn the music down a little bit and they would not.   Not going back and not encouraging my guests or employees that work downtown to go there."}
{"text":"I sat at the bar for lunch; service was friendly/fine.  Ordered 'Big Will Breakfast' and sweet potato tots.  The tots were OK, but the burger was a total disappointment.  The beef was nowhere near 'medium' as I ordered, but WELL done.  It also morphed from a patty to a meatball like mass between the driest 'Croissant Roll' that I've ever experienced.  I expect more from a $12 hamburger."}
{"text":"My friends and I stopped by this place the other night. We went around 7pm on a Thursday night and the place was packed! Lucky we were seated right away. Honestly overall We all agreed that the service was bad, our food on the other hand was great. I had The Melt with the sweet potato tots which were amazing. I would come back for the food, but hopefully the service will be better at a different time of day."}
{"text":"My husband and I went on a Friday night, and the place was packed, so we decided to eat up at the bar. The service was very friendly, and the bartender who took our order seemed to have a good knowledge of the whiskey selection. I've never had the opportunity to try Japanese whiskey before, so I got the business class flight, which is a great deal. We got the GFY burger and the dumpling burger. Both were good, but I don't think you actually get enough of a taste of the foi gras in the GFY burger. The mustard that comes on it, while tasty, sort of overpowers the other flavors. I'd definitely go back to try some of the other menu items."}
{"text":"I've had a few tasty lunches at Cowbell. I've had the Boogan's Bacon and the Gambler burgers, with the onion rings and the sweet potato tots (so good!).  Great lunch spot, centrally located uptown near most offices for a quality, sit-down lunch."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with a few girlfriends and had a great time!! Food was awesome and they had something for everyone. Decor is very hip and trendy. Would definitely return."}
{"text":"Was down in Charlotte for business and met a friend for dinner. I was a little annoyed that the address on my gps doesn't actually take you to the restaurant but I found it eventually. Good atmosphere for Tuesday night, food was really good --- my chicken sandwich was great, fries weren't my style but good.   Service was extremely attentive but at same time not overbearing which I hate. Will definitely go again next time in town, especially if I have the same waitress."}
{"text":"I loved this place when it was Nic's and I love the transformation into Cowbell. They have a wide assortment of burgers and some wonderful turkey burger options. I was pleased with the service. I ordered the turkey burger with mushrooms and topped with onion ring. My only concern is that the fries were soggy. I would return and  order the same burger with a different side. This is a great bar to go to with friends or during your lunch hour."}
{"text":"Good whiskey selection. Decent burgers but bad daddy's is better."}
{"text":"Decided to hit up Cowbell for a late Saturday night dinner date with the hubby. Since we got there around 9:00, we didn't have to wait at all for a table. We were seated immediately and had a server at our table very quickly after that. We ordered the deviled eggs w/bacon as an appetizer & it was delicious! I ordered the Boogan's Bacon burger for dinner w/sweet potato tots as my side. The tots were amazing, if you like sweet potatoes, I highly recommend trying these! Even though it tasted excellent, I was extremely disappointed at the size of my burger. The onion roll was a generous size but the patty underneath was more the size of a slider than an actual burger. Aside from that one negative we had a very enjoyable dining experience & will definitely go back. There's several other items on their menu that look like must try's! Cowbell has a funky modern decor and although it can be a bit loud inside, it has a really cool atmosphere."}
{"text":"I can sum this up in one word: \"Disappointing\". The menu sounds great, maybe this was a one off.  I went here on Panthers game day.  First off the service was lacking.  Took over 10 minutes to take my drink order.  When my boogens bacon burger came out all I can say is disappointing. The Patty itself look like a hockey puck the bun crunchy like they over-cooked it in the bacon way undercooked almost Raw.  Who are just not a great experience I don't think I'll ever come back here again."}
{"text":"Great vibe in this spot. Fantastic feel, lighting is great, fantastic classic rock, nostalgia, photos and awesome burgers. The deviled eggs were terrific too. Don't miss the sweet potato totts either. Great bourbon selection as well."}
{"text":"This was one of the few places open on a late Friday afternoon. We stumbled in and were overall very pleased. They have some tables a few booths and ample bar seating. The people dining at the bar seemed very happy which is always a good sign. The menu is simple in concept burgers or chicken sandwich we opted for burgers. We ordered the dumpling burger which is a solid 5/5 and the danny California which is a 4/5 just because some bites were bland and some bites were SPICY! Still over all very delicious. The sweet potato tots were good but lacked the crispy crunch I'm used to in a regular tot. Prices on food were fair VERY good prices on beer I don't think I saw a single standard sized craft brew over $5 which is a STEAL where I come from. Our waitress was very sweet and knowledgeable about the menu. She seemed to be the only waitress on the floor and kept on top of things. the female bartender with short brown hair and tattoos was phenomenal too refilling our waters even though we weren't her table, seating us quickly dropping off our beer etc. Great team work ladies."}
{"text":"I really liked the place - staff was cool. Got the Boogans Bacon burger at the recommendation of the bartender. While the flavor was good it was overcooked (ordered medium). And the Mac & Cheese wasn't hot. So I told the bartender and he was genuinely disappointed. Said it never happens. Not that he didn't believe me just that they pride themselves on quality. Offered to recook but I didn't have time. Manager came by later and gave me a free card for a burger and side for the next time I come back. And I will go back because they handled the problem and treated me right. Kudos."}
{"text":"Great place for Sunday brunch!! Love the pancakes!!! Services was excellent!! Can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"Horrible. Burgers are overpriced crap. Not even remotely healthy btw. Also the bartender is horrible, $7 for a well ? Wow what a joke and to top it off he was rude. Not worth it to come here for the food or drinks."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers in Charlotte in my opinion. Great decor and awesome music.   Usually a wait at lunch if you go around noon, but it is worth the wait. Gobbler burger is my favorite burger so far and the sweet potato tots are wonderful.   Pretty small space-may want to try to go at off times to get a table for a big group.   Burgers start at $9 which includes a side....but they are quality burgers. Worth the price.   Will be back!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  It's walking distance for our apartment, so we visit often.  Food is delish, probably the best upscale bar food 've had in Charlotte.   Our favorites are: chicken twigy, the sanatra, and the melt.  Oh, and let's not forget the amazing fries!  Con: slow service. They always seem to be a bit understaffed.  ThIs place is pretty popular,  80% of the time when I walk in - there isn't anyone at the hostess stand.  Also it can take a while for the server to arrive at the table."}
{"text":"This place has good food, but TERRIBLE customer service. I went in with my boyfriend for brunch one Sunday afternoon. There were about 15 people in the entire restaurant. We were sat at a high-top near the bar area next to another couple. We sat there for 10 minutes waiting for someone to greet us. Finally a bartender walked over and asked the area if anyone had come over...obviously a no. Apparently there was a miscommunication about who had the section we were sitting in. The bartender got a server over to greet us. We ordered fried pickles that took 30 minutes to get to us. Our food took AT LEAST an hour (there was literally no one in the restaurant). When I got my food there was a nice black hair in it. I sat patiently trying to wait for the server to come over and eventually I had to wave her down. She had the nerve to ask me if I wanted the kitchen to make my food over after I had already been there for 1.5 hours. She wasn't apologetic in the least."}
{"text":"Ok burgers.  Great menu.    Music too loud.  Calamity of errors, chipped glass sent back, music too loud, food slow to come, missing sides requested, French fries were soggy.  Other wise Mrs Kennedy, how was your trip to Dallas?"}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant for gourmet burgers and salads! I went there during lunch and it was fairly busy but the service was pretty fast. I got the Shankar burger with tots. The patty tasted so good! Very fresh and authentic flavors! The tots were very interesting as well! Recommend getting them even though they're a little greasy."}
{"text":"Great food. Nice vibe. Various burger choices  with standard ingredients and exotic flavors.   I absolutely could work my way through the entire menu. The chef is the real deal. The sides are awesome. From mac and cheese (delicious) to a pan fried corn (a nice surprise), which was fantastic. I went on a Friday night and it was busy with a really nice energetic vibe happening. But we didn't have a wait, and were seated immediately. And the food arrived timely. The service was great (Jaklyn was our server, great job). Great appetizer choices. We had the Sinatra. It was delicious. Don't be scared of this place if you have a vegetarian with you, the black bean and quinoa burger was amazing. Seriously, check this place out. You won't leave hungry or disappointed."}
{"text":"I was in a food coma after the NYC burger. The kind of coma where your family keeps you hooked up to the machines, but you don't come out of it like Steven Seagal and hunt down the people that killed your immediate family."}
{"text":"Great spot. Haven't had a bad drink or meal. Only one so so experience where the kitchen staff seemed to be struggling, but hey, it happens. They took care of me. Would definitely recommend it, especially for Bourbon lovers."}
{"text":"Just had dinner here for the first time. Cool atmosphere. Prices are very reasonable. We ordered the pumpkin spice croquettes for an app. But we should have ordered them for a desert. They were decent. I had a turkey burger and a side salad. The side salad was amazing and I never thought I would say that about a side salad. I wish I had gotten a large one as my meal. The burger was good. Overall, I liked the place. I'll definitely go back. Good place to have just drinks, as well."}
{"text":"GREAT variety of Mules (cocktails), juicy burgers, and delicious wings. I ate the Bruiser burger and she rocked the (better than we've ever had) boneless wings. We started with fried pickles and appreciated that they weren't over-battered. Lots of TVs for sports and a great throwback soundtrack (accompanied with the music videos)! Great place to hit before a Hornets game!"}
{"text":"Elvis burger was awesome! Sweet potato tots even better, but the s'mores milkshake is really where it's at. I loved it. The place was busy and we had a large group but service was still friendly and fast. Our server was sweet even though our large group caused issues."}
{"text":"Cowbell is a solid lunch option in Uptown and could be a fun spot for dinner before a show. Cow may be in the name, but there is plenty to eat here for those who don't do red meat.   The Danny California turkey burger sans aioli  with sweet potato tots is my usual. The tots have a nice dash of cinnamon are just so good. They also make a flavorful black bean veggie burger.  The spiked shakes are also great and hold a special place in my heart. My awesome coworkers brought me to Cowbell for a surprise spiked shake hour on my birthday and it was a lot of fun. You can also skip the spike and just get a regular shake.  For take out, I recommend calling ahead since it can take a little while."}
{"text":"Great spot for a yummy bite to eat, they even have healthy options!  Nice change of atmosphere from a traditional sports bar for watching a game!!!"}
{"text":"Our latest outing started with a coin toss between Basil Thai Cuisine or Cowbell Burger & Bar. We flipped our shiny quarter, the coin landed (heads up), and it was off to Cowbell we went. Cowbell is located in Uptown Charlotte next to Dandelion Market (which we love) in the former Nix Burger location... only a few steps away from the Epicentre.  We always find it odd when a restaurant closes and the same type opens in its spot. So when Cowbell (BURGERS) opened up in the old Nix (BURGERS) I was already a little skeptical. Then I found out Cowbell was created by the same people that brought us Mortimers Pub and Leroy Fox. So... I guess I became a little excited and only a few minutes after leaving our house and driving circles around Uptown to find a parking spot we were finally at the front door.  The decor could easily be described (by Curtis) as modern American Rock 'n' Roll with chic decor and a very Uptown feel. When we walked in the first thing I got excited about was the abundance of lighting and I was certain I would be able to get some good photos. My biggest complaint about every restaurant we visit is that they are all too dark. I don't know who created the concept that dim lighting is hip but I hate it and if there are any restaurant owners reading this... TURN ON THE DAMN LIGHTS!!!! My initial joy with Cowbell was quickly diminished after a few minutes when the lights went dim and my photos turned to crap :(  We kicked off the night by heeding our waiters suggestion and we got the Sweet Potato Croquettes with Spiced Honey Butter. These guys were so awesome I was having a hard time sharing with Ella. They had an exterior crust, size, and appearance of a typical hushpuppy but were dusted lightly with cinnamon and sugar. The sweet potato interior was super soft, almost a little creamy, and had the perfect amount of sweetness to balance the crunchy exterior.  Cowbells artisan burgers are created with a combination of chuck and brisket then hand ground by a 4th generation butcher. The burger list is diverse and choosing one proved to be a monumental tast (even by a professional burger eater like me). After hours and hours (or a couple minutes) of intense examination of ingredient combinations and careful consideration about time, location, weather, and the rotation of the moon... I finally decided to get the NYC Burger.  Being the highly accredited burger connoisseur that I am I take burgers very seriously and I loved this burger. The chuck and brisket beef wasn't anything notable especially after eating a Pat LaFrieda burger but the combination of burger with pastrami, aged swiss, sauerkraut, and Cowbell sauce was truly blissful. I loved the burger / deli sandwich combination and had great admiration for the chef that married these ingredients under the lightly toasted onion kaiser.  The burgers come with a side item and despite them all sounding delicious and very tempting I opted to upgrade my side (additional charges may apply) to the Dali's Fries. The photo below is the only photo that was even halfway decent once the lights dimmed but you can aptly see the fries covered in a garlic aioli, parmesan cheese, fresh herbs, and plenty of buffalo sauce. The Dali fries were absolutely delicious and I ate every last bite... but with that said... the fries had way too much buffalo sauce.  Don't get me wrong, I love buffalo sauce and the hotter the better in almost every instance. For the Dali fries it was too much because it nearly completely masked the garlic aioli, parmesan cheese, and any of the herbs that may have been there.  Cowbell is a welcome addition to Uptown Charlotte and absolutely a welcome addition to Charlotte's ever expanding burger scene. We cant wait to go back and can easily recommend Cowbell for your next burger craving :)"}
{"text":"Great burgers and beer selection. Even better mac and cheese and sweet potato tots.  I'll come back when ever I am in town.  Ask for a full size table though gonna need the elbow room"}
{"text":"Christopher Walken was right... everyone needs more Cowbell!  I found this place on a recommendation from a co-worker. I'm so happy he shared it with me. The atmosphere is unique, cross a saloon with a modern upscale bar and there you have it.   90's music videos playing on multiple TV's heighten this place's eccentricities. The bar tenders are actually engaging and the waiters are more than willing to make suggestions. By far the best burger I've had in ages and the craft beer selection on tap, while limited, was really great.  If you are in Charlotte and you don't go in and try the sweet potato tots as a side to one of their clever burgers, you are doing life wrong!"}
{"text":"What mom doesn't like burgers and whiskey. They go together like peas and carrots. Price was right as well as the atmosphere and the food. Your mom and I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"My wife and I love this place!! We use to live a block from here and would eat here 2-3 times a week. Now that we moved out of uptown we try to come back here as much as we can. We love ordering the pretzel app with the beer cheese. It's amazing. I got the bacon burger and it's always great!!  Can't wait to come eat here again soon."}
{"text":"Sweet Potato Tots - YUM!!!! They are sprinkled with a cinnamon sugar. The umami burger was decent - average size for a burger at a downtown restaurant. I feel like they have better things on the menu. I loved the deviled eggs appetizer - lots of flavor - take a bite of an egg, then a bite of the pickles. My friend liked her chicken sandwich (one of the 'legend' menu items). Very casual type atmosphere - in a slightly upscale way - almost feels like a sports bar, with a fancier feel."}
{"text":"Had a whiskey at the bar then was promptly seated at a table for two. Intimate setting, 9pm dinner, still full and happening. Had the Big Wills Breakfast burger- on a croissant. Very tasty! Topping on the Mac n cheese was excellent but once you are that, the sauce was too runny and thin. Will definitely be back to try more menu items !"}
{"text":"Superb specialty burger selection.  Really BIG burgers.  Wonderful scotch selection for real aficionados."}
{"text":"Came here with my husband and 3 kids (all under age 7) for a Saturday lunch before we checked out Discovery Place, which was just a few blocks away. It was the best lunch we've had in awhile!  I wasn't sure how kid-friendly it would be, but we didn't once feel unwelcomed.  My kids had the Grilled Chicken Twiggies from their kids menu and they devoured them.  My husband and I both ordered the Boogan's Bacon Burger without onions and hands down one of the best burgers I've had! They definitely aren't stingy with the amount of bacon loaded on there and the garlic aioli mixed in gave it so much flavor!  I chose the sweet tots for my side and those little things were like candy! Super addicting, but I had to take mine to-go because I was already so full from my burger. I love how they've mixed together rock n' roll with a bit of rustic glam for their decor!  Pretty unique!  Although I can't remember our server's name, she was a tall brunette and did an excellent job.  Very attentive, stayed on top of refills, and always checked in with us.  She even entertained my 19 month old son for a bit. Would love to try this place out again without the kids and see what their whiskey and beer is like!  Overall great time and would recommend to all!"}
{"text":"Cool, trendy place in downtown Charlotte. Decor is artsy and really neat to check out. Music is pretty loud with accompanying music videos playing - mainly rock/classic rock. Our server, Mary, was great. Craft cocktails were original and good. Fried pickles and sweet potato tater tots were delicious. Entrees were slightly below our expectations but were good enough. Warning: men's restroom tends to lock from the inside. Saw several guys waiting a long time for the restroom, and after a long wait, they found out no one was even in there. Sounds like a common problem. Restrooms (both men's and women's) are one-person restrooms."}
{"text":"Very good! I had a local beer with my burger and ordered the Hoisin Burger with Sweet potato tots.  The burger was definitely unique, but still exactly what I expected; a pork burger with hoisin sauce. It was well prepared and hoisin sauce is always tasty. The Tots were probably the highlight though: they had a cinnamon flavor that was not overwhelming, and the consistency was about perfect (crispy outside, soft, hot inside). Definitely would come back here next time I am in town."}
{"text":"Disappointed that a burger place cannot cook a quality burger. Over cooked, dry, and unevenly cooked. Questioning the freshness of the meat.  Our server was a nice girl and helpful but I saw plenty of staff standing around and when I went to the men's room it looked like a truck stop. Have some pride in your business and clean the bathroom regularly.   Will not be back and I don't imagine that they will be in business much longer if they maintain this level of quality."}
{"text":"Just Fantastic! Cowbell is one of those places you just can't go wrong with anything you choose on the menu. The items highlighted in red are a great place to start as these are the \"Cowbell Favorites!\" The service was awesome and the mules even better. Good food and good drinks are so hard to find and here they have mastered both. The cucumber mule is a culmination what my alcoholic dreams are made of!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here before attending a Charlotte Hornets game. The atmosphere, food and service was awesome. The burgers are big, flavorful and juicy. The sides are tasty as well. Try the pretzels as an appetizer. Request the honey mustard dipping sauce to accompany them. Our waitress Raven was great. Very knowledgeable and friendly. The literally have one full side of a huge menu dedicated to only Whiskey!!  Great Place"}
{"text":"My sibs and I came here for lunch and it was terrific. Good service and very nice food. I had the Big Will's Breakfast Burger (beef patty, croissant bun, bacon, poached egg) which tasted very good especially at the center. The side of sweet potato tots was amazing."}
{"text":"Had lunch at cowbell yesterday. To say that I was pleasantly surprised would be an understatement.  The ambience was regular...nothing exceptional. Service was stellar... The waiter was very well informed and friendly, without being too in your face.  My teenaged son and I shared an appetizer.... And had burgers for our entree. The food was spot on. Will definitely be going there again"}
{"text":"This edition of Excited about Eating takes us to Cowbell Burger & Whiskey Bar in Uptown Charlotte.   This modern designed gourmet burger restaurant/bar offers a full array of starters, sandwiches, salads and tacos and a full brunch menu on the weekends.   Dora here. The interior was well-lit, not gloomy like some restaurants where the bar takes center stage. Also, it was clean and lacked any musty odors from the night before, definitely a plus. And was it my imagination or did a hush come over the room when we walked in? So we might've had a good thirty years on most of the diners here, but service was friendly and efficient and they put us right at ease. :)  We started with Pretzels. These were no ordinary pretzels; they were small barrels packed with flavor, hard on the outside and soft on the inside. They complemented perfectly with the Guinness cheese sauce, which carried just the right amount of kick. These pretzels were great and something that we will be sure to try again on a return visit.  Dora here. I would've sworn the cheese dip was actually some type of Dijon mustard base. Light and mild to taste, but set my throat on fire. Yum!  For my meal, I chose the Dumpling, an Asian pork burger topped with hoisin glaze, slaw, and sriracha aioli on a Kaiser Roll and a side of Sweet Potato Tots.   This burger definitely had a unique taste with all the various flavors melding together. Makes me want to return soon to try another. If the burger was not great enough, the sweet potato tots took this dish over the top. Outstanding! Now I have never tried sweet potato tots but I can tell you they will be added to my plate whenever they are offered on a menu again.   Dora here. I really enjoyed the Boogan's Bacon Burger. The patty was huge and meaty, and looked handcrafted, and the bacon marmalade and garlic aioli gave it an added pop. And fresh fruit? How could I resist? Check out that heaping bowl of berries and pineapple. Delish!  Looks yummy, right? It was! Even so, my fork kept wandering over to Ernie's plate, and I snatched more than half of those Sweet Potato Tots. Yowza! Those tots sprinkled with brown sugar and cinnamon rocked! Heaven in my mouth!  We rate this restaurant five forks out of five for a family friendly restaurant serving outstanding food. ~Ernie & Dora Hiers, Fiction Faith & Foodies Blog"}
{"text":"Got in early because we had the kids with us.  Greeted at the door by super fun and attentive bar tender Lindsey!!  Started with pretzel bites which were delicious...good sized portion Guiness cheese sauce stole that show.  You can not go wrong with any burger on the menu. We each ordered a different one and they were all fantastic. The PM was the overall favorite. Kids enjoyed the Virgin handmade milkshakes (mocha and smores). Lindsey had some great beer recommendations!"}
{"text":"Had Cowbell today after hearing good things about it through coworkers and on Yelp.  We were a group of four with no reservations and were accommodated within 15 minutes of arrival, around 7:45pm on a weekday.  They have a vast menu full of burgers and tacos, along with a nice selection of appetizers, salads, spiked milkshakes, and desserts.  Service was quick and everyone was friendly, especially the hostess!  Sweet tea!  Oh how long it's been since I've had legitimate Southern sweet tea.  So good.  For starts, our table got the fried pickles and the \"Sinatra\".  The fried pickles came with ranch sauce and were delicious, though I feel like the pickles were a bit too thin.  The batter was good - not too thick and very crispy.  The \"Sinatra\" was a plate of glorified mozzarella sticks that were shaped like chicken fingers and graced with plenty of prosciutto and some red sauce.  These were nowhere close to frozen mozz sticks - they got a collective \"mmnm\" from the table.  I'm not a massive fan of cheese sticks, so I'll take their word for it.   I chose to have the PM Burger medium, which came with pulled pork, fried jalapenos, onions, and beer cheese.  It's definitely a messy burger that I basically ate with a fork and knife and skipped the bun, which I wasn't too much of a fan of.  The beef patty was not as seasoned as I'd like, but the burger as a whole was decent.  It had some flavor from the pulled pork and the beer cheese, but the kick was just not enough for me.  I would have liked more jalapenos.  The sweet potato tater tots were the star of the show tonight - a little sweet from the potato and from what seemed like a sweet cinnamon dust on the outside.  The outer was crispy and the inside was the perfect texture.  I hate when tater tots aren't soft inside and this was not the case.  I would definitely recommend getting the sweet potato tots.  Decent spot for burgers in the Uptown area with a nice casual ambiance and good service."}
{"text":"Super good Mac n cheese & chicken tacos. they have a few outdoor seating - which is where we sat! My friend ordered a burger medium rare and it came back well. He reordered a burger rare and it still came back well. The manager had to come talk to us and apologize - they were very friendly and apologetic about the situation and compensated us. Really enjoyed my time here. Drinks are a little pricey, one of them wasn't very good. Great service. Definitely want to go back."}
{"text":"Really good hamburgers and great onion rings. The only thing I didn't like was the live music was so loud it made me just want to finish my meal asap and leave."}
{"text":"Meh. This is bar that serves food, not a restaurant that serves drinks; had I known that going in, my expectations would have matched.  The food was ok; burger was average (I've had WAY better in other Charlotte restaurants).  The atmosphere was just too LOUD.  On a Thursday night at 6 pm, I don't expect Nine Inch Nails to be BLARING from the speakers...on top of all the tvs being on, etc.  Even if the food was better, the atmosphee would keep me away.  I imagine it's a great place for drinks if youre looking for a bar scene; but I will never go back there for dinner. Sadly, I'm gonna recommend you eat less Cowbell."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch and sat at the bar. Lindsey (bartender) was amazingly welcoming and over the top friendly from the minute we walked in the door. She recommended some great whiskeys and burgers for us. We had to send something back (undercooked burger) and she was completely understanding and got us our replacement extremely fast. The food was great but the friendly atmosphere was EVERYTHING!!! Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"This place was so good , there were so many choices when I was visiting Charlotte but I am so glad I chose this place. Absolutely delicious. Every single thing. It was quick with lots to choose from. I got the Danny california burger was hot and delicious. My girl got the fiesta tacos which were also so good, with the delicious crispy onion rings, all for $24!!! I would recommend this to anyone looking for a good dinner spot in Charlotte"}
{"text":"This the place where bankers who want to be hipsters hang out & it shows.  Overly fru fru burgers with 10 ingredients fill the menu.  I can't have tomato or onion so I went with the burger that had the least items & no onion bun, the wills, which is on a croissant with bacon and a fried egg.  You need to be able to unhinge your jaw to get the bun in your mouth, I gave up halfway through and just cut bits off the burger with a fork.  We also ordered the pretzel bites as an appetizer, which are basically very crispy frozen pretzel bits.    The wall decorations are clearly aimed at hipsters & wanna be hipsters (painted deer heads) and there was a weird tv situation going on where the 2 main TVs, which were in my direct eyesight, were on music videos but they didn't match up with what was playing on the speakers.  Rather odd & kept throwing me off.    Don't expect to get out of here cheap, it was over $40 for an app, 2 burgers & 1 beer.  If you're looking for a good burger go to Kickstand instead.  Better vibe, better burgers & better beer."}
{"text":"I have been here more times that I can count. I have had problems with orders and service in the past, but the situation is always handled in an efficient and professional manner.   Came into for brunch and we sat at the bar. It wasn't crowded, so the food didn't take long. My fiancé ordered a burger and said it was great. I ordered the veggie scramble and substituted the eggs for potatoes and left off the sauce making it a perfect vegan scramble.  The bartender  was very friendly, and made great suggestions. I didn't give 5 stars because of the problems we have had here in the past. I believe the staff needs to pay a little more attention to detail. It seems the problems have only occurred when we have had a large group, or it's been busy. I would still recommend."}
{"text":"Soooo darn delicious!! Had the Danny Tacos (sub jack cheese for cheddar) and chose the hands down best Mac n cheese I've ever had. Two words: food orgasm. I love every single bite! Posted pics!"}
{"text":"This place has it going on.  Burgers are their staple, but they also have great chicken sandwiches, turkey burgers, and several great salads and other appetizers.  We started with the chili which was a large bowl of tastiness with cheese, sour cream and tortilla chips, and a large hunk of cornbread for the dipping.  The Alamo tex mex salad is quite good too with corn, black beans, tomatoes and avocado.  We went for a couple of dressings on the side and enjoyed the poppy seed as recommended by others.  The Lisa Marie chicken sandwich was very tasty with a choice of side (sweet tots awesome).  They have an interesting cocktail menu, and several wines, draft beers and a cider to choose from.  The waitress we had was fantastic, super efficient and quick on the refills of water and soda waters.... thanks much.  I will be back to try the house specialty burgers some time... can't wait."}
{"text":"Went for last minute brunch and the food was pretty good. Lots of meat and bacon on the sandwiches and the Bloody Mary is peppery and priced fairly at $6. I ordered the sandy and the pimento cheese went great with the bacon and spinach, very satisfying breakfast sandwich. The server was slow, we thought he forgot about us a few times. But he was friendly and brought everything we ordered."}
{"text":"Food was good ,.. A bit dissapointed in the bar.  Went for their grand opening. For a place that brags about having a great selection of bourbon/ whiskey, I expected for them to showcase that.  No drink menu or specialty anything."}
{"text":"Great taste!!! But little costly for burger I went there for lunch, I had veggie burger \"Shankar\" it's delicious. I liked the sweet potato tots. It's really yummy!! The place is little high in price for burger"}
{"text":"Some things are better in theory than in practice, and so it was with the burger I had at Cowbell.   But first, the good:  great atmosphere. Much better than its predecessor burger joint, Nix. Clean, inviting, great for watching sports.   The service was also great, if not overeager. I had no less than three people waiting on lil ole me, and it got kind of confusing. When they dropped the check off, I was taking my time (it wasn't busy, so I wasn't tying up a table or anything) and one of my army of servers came over to take it up before I even had a chance to put my credit card down.   The bad:  the side I had. The cucumber salad. Since cucumber salad is the new, hip-happenin side du jour, I'd like to ask all the burger joints to have a sit down and decide how it should be made.   This one was not good. The cucumbers had some weird sweet taste to them. And the vast majority of the cucumber salad was not, in fact, cucumber - it was raw onion. Ack. Go for some other side.  The ugly:  the burger. I'm sorry to have to say that. I wanted to like it -- I really did.  I had The Bruiser, a blackened patty with mushrooms, horseradish sauce, onions, lettuce and blue cheese. Sounds yum, right?  But noooooo. First there was so much blue cheese on it, it killed the rest of the flavors. But just to make sure I had no possible chance of tasting the meat, they doused the burger with about a gallon of horseradish sauce. It came gushing out the sides and it was clear from the get-go that I was going to need to eat this puppy with a fork (or a hazmat suit).  The onion kaiser bun was DOA from all that goo.   There's also the issue of \"blackening.\" Normally this means a little spiciness. Perhaps it was the killer cloaking combo of blue cheese and horseradish, but I'm thinking that the blackening spice used here was... salt. Blech.  Finally, I ordered the burger medium. It came out overdone. And I'm not convinced the meat quality was all that good either based on what I could see after I used a trowel to scrape all the crap off the burger.   It makes me sad that a cow gave her all for that travesty of a burger. Seriously - a huge disappointment.   I'd go back if my dinner companion insisted, but I'd definitely go for a much, much simpler burger or something else altogether. But what's the point of going to a burger joint if the burgers aren't up to snuff?"}
{"text":"The food was great. Got wings, burgers and salads. The manager and other employees was great at cleaning and attentive to our needs but our Server made our experience unpleasant and ridiculously long. She was very slow, she disappeared while we was waiting for food/drinks/check/change. It was not busy and everyone else who came in after us was in and out before us. we still gave her a decent tip for the crappy service. Will go again for the food and hopefully better service."}
{"text":"This place I love the burgers are always great food us always hot. Thank you so much."}
{"text":"I got a Bruiser burger. The burger was very tasty, yet I was disappointed. The burger was very small and engulfed by the bun. For $13, they should give you more meat or reduce the price. The sweet potato tots were good."}
{"text":"I was extremely impressed with Cowbell! The prices were exceedingly reasonable and the food was outstanding!  My wife and I both had burgers that practically fell apart. They were perfectly cooked and there were seemingly endless topping options.  The atmosphere was everything you want in a mostly-inclusive \"hip\" joint. We saw a couple get seated then decide to leave because of the music volume. Cowbell welcomes everyone with open arms, but it might not necessarily be the right place for everyone.  If you find yourself hungry in the Charlotte area, make Cowbell a priority! It's something you will not regret."}
{"text":"Our son and his girl friend brought us here for brunch, before we headed over to the ball park to watch the Charlotte Knights play a Sunday game.  Although it was Fathers' Day and the place was crowded, we had only a short wait before being shown to our table.  I loved the decor that had pop and rock and roll icons on the wall (Beatles, Bob Dylan, Sinatra) while the big screen tv played music videos.  I could see how the people who work in the area would like coming here for lunch or for an after work drink.   Food was very good.  Husband was pleased with his drink. Small drawbacks were: 1) my order was mixed up, but the server made sure it was corrected quickly and I got my food only a few minutes after everyone else.  2) The ladies restroom is in an odd location.  It was a one-person stall and a line formed outside by the kitchen door.  We were in the staff's way and they were in our way.   Still I would make a return visit next time in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I ended up here with a group of about 20 people, so I'll admit that my experience might not have been totally representative of Cowbell.  However, general issues that come with being a large group aside (and hmmm, they seemed quite practiced with handing out 20 separate checks...), a few things really bothered me.  1. I understand that a restaurant cannot control what people on the street choose to do.  However, being asked for money while sitting outside is not a pleasant experience, and reinforced my decision to not leave the group (even though I was pretty tired and really just wanted to get back to my hotel ASAP).  2. You can order any burger naked, which is great for those of us on a low-carb diet.  Except, without the bun, the Big Will's breakfast burger just looked small and sad on the plate, and was ultimately pretty darn meh.  Not much there for $13.  3. The food I received did not quite match what the menu said.  My supposed over easy egg was definitely hard and if there was honey mustard on there, I didn't find it.  I didn't think \"hold the red onion\" meant that...  4. The cucumber salad was at first pleasantly vinegary and tart, but after a few bites, it became almost intolerable.  I'm all for flavor, but yikes.  5. As another reviewer mentioned, the ladies' room is a single-use and uncomfortably situated by the kitchen.  Not a nice place to wait in the inevitable line.  Plus it was super loud inside, leaving me wanting to curl up with my hands over my ears.  So given the vast number of other restaurants in the vicinity, do yourself a favor and pass up another mediocre, overpriced burger."}
{"text":"Everything on the menus sounded so good and our apps were delicious! (We got the Lil smokies, fried pickles, and disco fries) My entree however I was not impressed. I got The Melt and the cheese wasn't even closed to being melted, there was too much bread, and the party was a little too greasy. Ended up not finishing it. The Mac and cheese as the side however was one of the best Mac and cheese sides I've had in a long time!  The inside decorations and tables we're really cool but the music was way too loud, we could hardly hear each other let alone our server."}
{"text":"Unfortunately disappointed. I've always passed this place and wanted to try it but unfortunately after I did I realized it wasn't what it appeared. We were seated by our friendly hostess but after 15 mins with no waitress we had to go see if someone forgot that they had our table after our waitress realized she had our table she came over promptly from then on out she was wonderful and the lack of a good experience wasn't her fault. We ordered the cheese sticks and it came out cold(ice cold), our burgers came out each missing something we requested (cheese,a bun,lettuce etc) and was cooked improperly when we brought it to their attention they did not apologize not fix it. I'm sure this isn't a common experience at this establishment but unfortunately I will not be returning nor recommending."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I have to give a bad review due to Mike the Manager this evening. This is our 2nd time eating at cowbell and the food is actually really good, however service trumps everything! Our fries were extremely cold and we sent them back. The manager Mike brought the fries out after 10 minutes at minimal. We politely told him we no longer wanted them. He immediately became defensive and advised us that he was short staffed and again asked if we wanted them or not with the least bit of empathy or ownership taken? Totally unacceptable from a store manager. I tried to speak with him after our meal, unfortunately Mike brushed us off."}
{"text":"This place has an interesting Rock n' Roll vibe but I couldn't really tell what they were going for. Eclectic decorations, rock star posters on the wall, big TVs showing 90's music videos that are bumping over a high end sound system. It wasn't bad but it wasn't that good either, just kind of weird and loud. I definitely would not choose this type of place to come and drink whiskey though.   For food we got the Boogans Bacon burger. It's one of those beef balls that isn't flattened out into a pattie, not my preferred style but still very tasty. The bacon was pretty sparse and limp for a signature 'bacon burger.' The tater tots were pretty good although my wife thought they were too sweet. Had fried pickles to start which were also good."}
{"text":"Fun place. Burger was awesome. Atmosphere was great. Bartender was a rockstar. If I could change anything, I suggest they move to fresh cut fries. The food is too good to settle for frozen fries. I wish I lived close enough to try more items on the menu. This is the restaurant I would go as a group & order a variety of menu items & share."}
{"text":"SOUR TURKEY. Got a turkey burger, with avocados, and sourdough bread. The patty was a little mushy. Almost undercooked. I've had turkey burgers that were more beef like and solid. This wasn't. The overall burger was great and the sweet potato tots are seasoned with cinnamon and sugar, just like a sweet potato. If I were to change anything, cook the patty a little longer or hotter. Make it crispier."}
{"text":"Just grabbed drinks here but a cool place. Very cool drinks, I just had a Moscow mule and it was good. They had some interesting whiskey cocktails that I will try next time I stop by. Tons of whiskey/bourbons to choose from!  We didn't eat any food so not sure if it is any good."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a really good chicken sandwich and sweet potato tater tots.  They also bundle it with a great whiskey selection. You need to be patient as it it takes awhile to get your food from the kitchen. The bartenders were great!"}
{"text":"This was an amazing restaurant and definitely a little hidden downtown spot. We found this place while searching for somewhere to eat before the Hornets game and we were so glad we found it. An easy walk from our hotel (about 20 blocks away) and easy to find.   The service was exceptional and the food was even better! We started with fried pickle chips for the appetizer and they were amazing, then my fiancé selected The Melt for the burger he wanted....he described it as the best burger he has ever put in his mouth. That's saying something folks. We both got sides of Mac and cheese and it was the most interesting Mac and cheese I have ever ate. There was the traditional cheese flavor but there were also flavored of garlic and Parmesan which made it even better. After dinner I was almost tempted to get The Velvet which was fried ice cream served with red velvet cake and chocolate syrup (or something...I was distracted by the fact that there was fried ice cream and red velvet cake together). Fortunately for our bodies we didn't get that but next time I will need to not get food and just get dessert.   This place is definitely one you should check out and enjoy the wonderful atmosphere, crazy music videos, and the fantastic food!!!"}
{"text":"I am having a hard time finding the words to accurately describe this place. I'll start by saying the food was very good. I got the Danny California Burger which was described as spicy....I would describe it more as a mild heat that my grandma could handle with ease, but it tasted great. The staff were all very friendly.   The atmosphere is potentially the most hipster place I have ever been to this far East of Seattle. The music is a mix of 90s Alternative and modern pop/hip-hop. Think Drake followed up with Jimmy Eat World. The most \"Cowboy\" thing in here aside from the whiskey selection (which is pretty decent) is the bull horns hanging on the wall. All the rest is hipster art.  However, the food was good and the staff was nice. That's all I truly care about."}
{"text":"Unique vibe and great food. Seating is a little tight, but the food makes you forget about your neighbor dining beside you. Umami Burger was LIT, and with the side of tots, I was delightfully full and satisfied. The Cucumber Mule is great during the summer. Very excited to return in the future!"}
{"text":"Tried Cowbell for the first time last night. My boyfriend and his cousin had the burger with bleu cheese, I had the bento box with the Boursin burger, it was all delicious! The crab Rangoon dip is a MUST! Literally the filling of crab Rangoon as a dip with wonton chips drizzled in the Thai chili sauce you usually get to dip your crab Rangoon. Seriously we finished the dip so fast it was wonderful! The burgers were thick and moist. So many different choices too! And you can also build your own burger. The sushi was great as well, typical choices. They also had a fusion menu called \"burgooshi\" .. Burger Sushi style!  And it was super great service, long wait though but it was a beautiful Saturday even.  Also they played the best music, 90's hip hop!"}
{"text":"We came here on a Saturday night to get some food and watch some college football. We got here around 10PM and it was still pretty packed but we luckily got the last available table. They have a main dining area right next to the bar that has about 5-10 TVs displaying different sporting events as well as music videos. Service seemed to be pretty slow as it was pretty crowded but also it looked like they were light on staff.  The menu is a little diverse for mainly being a burger joint as they also have tacos, salads, chicken sandwiches, and appetizers. We opted for the burgers of course which they have quite a selection. I chose the Boogan's Bacon which came with bacon, bacon marmalade, and a roasted garlic aioli spread. All the burgers also come with a side that can be onion rings, french fries, mac n cheese, and others. Our food came out relatively quickly given how slow the service had been.  As for the burger, it was really good but I think it was the garlic aioli that made it stand out. It was nicely sized and definitely juicy but came with a small side of fries. Overall, it was a nice casual spot to watch some football and eat some good food!"}
{"text":"This was my favorite place in Charlotte. My family and I were vacationing here for the Packer's game and saw the excellent reviews on Yelp for this place, so we tried it. Everything was to die for! I had the black bean burger and it was easily one of the best ones I have ever had (I'm kind of a black bean burger snob). They really think through all of their flavor combinations to bring very unique flavors to all of their burgers and all of their food/drinks. My husband and I also enjoyed their alcoholic shakes, oh my goodness they were so amazing!! You have to have one whenever you go to complete your meal! I also adored the atmosphere in here with the tribute to everything bad ass in the 80's! I can't want to come back!"}
{"text":"My wife n i in Charlotte.How you go to bar and order rum n coke. They say we got pepsi smh"}
{"text":"Cowbell left me feeling as unsure as a first date. For the first time ever, I had a difficult time choosing a cocktail. Perhaps it's because I am not much of a whiskey person. However, if you are a whiskey connoisseur, this might be your jam...they have a broad selection, check the menu photo below.  I ordered the Berry mule and salmon tacos with sweet potato tots. The mule was...meh. The fish tacos appeared to be made with canned salmon; however, I am not totally sure. The taco was stuffed with what seemed to be minced salmon but the fresh salsa on top was tasty. Taco...meh. The sweet potato tots were the highlight of my meal....delicious soft bites dusted with cinnamon sugar. I actually recommend them as a dessert instead of a side.   The atmosphere seems like a great place to hangout and watch the game. Lots of televisions around with a great Uptown location and many additional options close by.   Please note, they do not validate parking for the lot located directly next to Cowbell. It will also set you back $21 for about 3 hours...I know that you have NO TIME for such foolery!  I will visit again, have a burger and update my review."}
{"text":"Cool bar with good food.  I like the vibe and will definitely return when back in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I have always enjoyed Cowbell. Burgers are delicious and the the best in Charlotte! Highly recommend the sweet potato tots, too! The annoying screaming bartender who calls customers boo, has her cleavage hanging out, and then complains about crumbs left by past guests, makes me never want to return. Complaining about the hands that tip you.... at a restaurant? Get real. Hard to enjoy a meal without her screaming during our lunch. The food and waitress today made up for it, but I'll check to make sure the bartender with glasses and dark hair isn't working before I return."}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch today and had three fantastic burgers!  the Bruiser (mushroom, sautéed onion and blue cheese) the Elvis (basic burger, lettuce, tomato, pickle & mustard) and the a Umami (mushrooms, chipotle ketchup and caramelized onions). All cooked perfectly, not too big, not too small. Good fries, Parmesan topped. I tried the cucumber salad for my side and it was tasty! The whiskey selection looked fantastic, for another visit... Our waitress even suggested some fun stuff for us to do on a cold yucky day (thanks Dee!) go here, but don't forget the onion rings!"}
{"text":"The food was good. It was totally an experience. Our server was hilarious. He would dance/ chat/ sit next to us and we honestly had a blast. We brought plenty of their flyyyyyyy whisky and had a great great time. I was impressed with their Chili. I've never had a chili as delicious as that one. I was amazed with the total (considering we were three couples and we drank so much) the total was super cheap (but again) I live in Miami.  Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"Love Cowbell.  The only reason I gave them 4 stars instead of 5 is because they skimp on the fries!  One of my favorite burger spots uptown!"}
{"text":"Get the hot wings! Super Crispy outside, soft inside. Great sauce and not overly sauces up. Amazing beer choice and good vibes on the tv. Playing 70s rock. It's a cool place to grab lunch."}
{"text":"The chicken sandwiches , burgers and beer / whiskey / scotch selections are excellent. The service on multiple occasions unfortunately is impersonal and leaves much to be desired. Be prepared to wait to order a drink and then remind the bar staff that you ordered food."}
{"text":"Surprisingly local given its location in corporate uptown.  They have a surprisingly solid playlist, as well.  I digress.  My favorite 'sit-down' burger joint in Charlotte.  Good place to go after a hornets game given its proximity."}
{"text":"I must say I was very impressed with Cowbell! The former Nix location has been replaced by another burger joint that is a sister restaurant of Leroy Fox and Mortimer's. The interior is dark but intriguing and inviting. The feel is much more upscale than you would think of a burger place but in such a good way! I sat at the bar, which is a very good size by the way, but there didn't seem to be too many tables from what I remember. (FYI, this place looks nothing like the old Nix restaurant. It's been completely revamped.)   I didn't even intend to eat when I went in for the first time last night but after salivating over the menu for a few minutes, I decided to order the Sweet Potato Corndog. Oh yeah... it was as good as it sounds! The batter was rich and sweet and the hotdog was big and greasy. The fries were up there with the best of them too. I also sampled a friend's sweet potato tater tots and they were excellent as well. My service was on point and I never had to wait for anything. The food maybe only took 10 minutes, which is always a plus. I believe my corndog with fries was only $6 or $7,  which was surprising for an Uptown spot. I only drank one beer while there but I did browse what seemed to be an extensive whiskey menu.   I really dug the atmosphere as it was hip but not too stuffy or pretentious. There were also some pretty rad old school rock music videos being played all night. But what will keep me coming back is the food. I can't wait to go back to try some of the burgers as there were so many options that sounded downright delicious. Only downside? This place might just be a little too close to my home. Willpower is key here... ;)"}
{"text":"Disappointing experience. Dry and overcooked burgers. Onion rings were sitting out before served as they were not hot."}
{"text":"We love this place. great drinks and the menu is fun. If you cant find something  on this menu you are trying hard enough! Will keeping going back again & again."}
{"text":"Ok... cotton eye joe denifntley played. We left the bartenders because they played on their phones the whole time ...$5 fire ball shots not worth it."}
{"text":"Yum! Burger and fries were great!! I also had an outstanding moscow mule!!"}
{"text":"I came here with 3 of my girl friends before going to see Rock of Ages at the Blumenthal theater. We arrived around 6:30 on Friday knowing we had to be done in an hour to get our seats. There was no wait when we got there and we were immediately sat at  a table for 4. I was a little worried because they do not take reservations, but luckily we were fine.   The location is very close to the Bank of America parking deck, and is next door to the Roxbury  and two doors down from Dandelion Market. It occupies the space where Nix once was, but the sign is hard to see in the dark.   The table was a little crammed for four girls so I couldn't imagine if there were 4 guys trying to battle for space. Good luck. Our waitress was nice and took our orders right away. I was feeling adventurous so I got Big Wills Breakfast. It's a burger with candied bacon, and an over easy egg and cheese on a croissant. It also comes with onions and lettuce, but I decided to go without, because I had read that it just makes the burger gigantic. I ordered fries as my side. The other girls ordered the Mexicali hot dog and the Popeye burger.   When we got our food, I was eyeballing everyone else and I was so excited about my food. Lucky for me the excitement was well warranted. It was delicious! I am so excited to bring my husband back because they had really good beer specials as well (and $4 ciders for those of us who don't drink beer). He's excited too because he got to reap the benefits of my leftovers and can't wait to try out the hot and fresh burgers in person!"}
{"text":"The food was cooked well and nicely seasoned. The staff was really nice and attentive. My wife and I agreed that the lemon pepper chicken was the best we had ever had. We stopped by on a random whim as we walked the city and we were happily surprised."}
{"text":"The service was HORRIBLE! After waiting  for more than 45 minutes in an almost empty restaurant and the waitress advise she forgot to place our order Ave seemed to think it was comical. Moreover, her service was TRASH. She never refilled our drinks or checked in  to see if we needed anything."}
{"text":"Decent bar food and good burgers that are great upon occasion when they decide to put some effort in.  Consistency is the thing to be careful of here.  Oh, and I felt sorry for the band that had to compensate for missing talent with added volume, especially when people only wanted to watch game 7 and not be overwhelmed by a pair of 70's lounge lizards."}
{"text":"Huge burger fan here so love the option here for basically any kind of burger/wrap you chose. I unfortunately didn't 100% love the turkey burger I chose, but fortunately, plenty of other choices to allow for next time. We also did try the fish tacos, which were very good, especially the pineapple salsa. The sweet tater tots are among some of the best I've tried in Charlotte. I love how they flavored them with honey and cinnamon sugar, so they are a bit sweeter. I'm not a whiskey person, so I can't speak to the whiskey here, but i think it can be a great sell! There is a $2 upcharge if you want to change the stated burger on the menu to a beef/veggie burger, which is something to keep in mind. Prices are reasonable, about $12-$14/burger. Service was good. I would certainly eat here again, and if you want creative burgers with fancy toppings like sriracha grilled prosciutto, apple + bourbon bbq sauce, or praline smoked bacon, this is your spot!"}
{"text":"Why any restaurant would let burnt food come out of the kitchen is beyond me! I ordered the Apple Croquettes and they were inedible. I sent an email to their email address two days ago and no response was received. Both my onion rings and my husbands fries were lacking heat. They tasted like they had been in a warmer. I'm attaching the email I sent. We will never return."}
{"text":"I love cowbell. It's not the healthiest place to eat but it's oh so delicious. As far as starters go, the pretzels with cheese dip are delicious. It doesn't taste like cheap low grade pretzels out of a freezer. They are perfectly crisp yet fluffy inside. The wings are great and they give you a perfect amount for one person. I got the corleon and the mozzarella was fresh as were the veggies. It had the perfect amount of spices. The balsamic drizzle was right amount of sweet. I never save room for dessert but I need to sometime to try their shakes. Friends of mine swear by their burgers and I will certainly be back to try one soon!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, with a lot of cool eclectic decor. I've had several burgers, and they're all good. My favorite has got to be the Danny California though. If you want to try something 'different' ... the Dumpling burger (asian pork) is what I'd recommend. Great place to come and grab cocktails for a night out too!"}
{"text":"Wandering the downtown area of Charlotte brought me here for burgers thanks to trusty Yelp. Walking in, the decor seems like a dark, but cleaner NYC pub with ample seating and a Southern vibe.  Big Wills Breakfast Burger - Because when is the next time you will get to eat a burger with and egg and bacon on a CROISSANT roll? The name of the burger speaks for itself, but I can never turn down breakfast items. The menu of burgers is large a may take a while to read, but there's a decent selection for everyone.  The multiple big screens behind the bar are viewable from every angle of the restaurant. The only that was lacking was a Panthers game (they had a bye week) while I was in town. The Southern vibe and service are definitely friendly and this place lives up to it's higher Yelp rating in its area."}
{"text":"Went here on a date while visiting Charlotte and was very excited, as I love a nice \"fancy\" burger place. Sat down and the waiter was very chatty, talking about sports and good beer suggestions. We both ordered and our drinks and food came out fairly quickly. I got the bacon burger with bacon and bacon jam along with the sweet potato tator tots. I have literally NEVER had better sweet potato tator tots in my life, no exaggeration. They didn't need any condiments and they were almost dessert like! The burger itself was a bit dry but tasty, all it needed was some ketchup. However, our waiter was nowhere to be found. None of the tables had ketchup on it and you couldn't catch any of the waiters in general. Finally, after 2/3 of the burger consumed and 25 minutes since we last saw the guy, our waiter rushed by while quickly over his shoulder yelling \"do you guys need anything else\" as he headed out the door. Dude, are you serious? I practically had to trap him near our table. If it wasn't for the lacking service, I would have definitely given this place a 4.5 star!"}
{"text":"Decor is nice&clean. Service is good. Prices are moderate. We thought it was okay. Maybe this spot is 5 *s  for beef burger eaters? My black bean burger was flavorful with mushrooms and goat cheese, yet it was lukewarm. Maybe the temp should be this for the burger. My honey's turkey was shy of being overcooked, yet tasty.  Would return but it did not knock our socks off."}
{"text":"Cowbell is a really cool environment!  Their name, burger and whiskey, says it all. Everyone in our party enjoyed their food and drinks. The bartender, Brett, was very personable and helpful with our orders and making sure we got our food in time to go to a show. We will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"The food at this place was great for dinner! Nothing to write home about but definitely solid, tasty meals. Unfortunately the service was a bit of a let down. Our server was slow, unfriendly and generally seemed a bit over it.  The place itself is pretty cool - it's a huge space which a decent menu and lots of drink specials. My partner had a fried chicken burger which was great and I had a chicken salad - also very tasty. We also shared a dessert which was not good at all - definitely manufactured rubbish - it tasted like a supermarket dessert!!  This place is okay if you just want mains and don't mind meh service."}
{"text":"Great selection of burgers, and love the sweet potato tots! As well as a nice atmosphere, get the PM burger and use the beer cheese from Otto dip your tots in !!"}
{"text":"Saturday you can find a great atmosphere, good prices. Ask for a whiskey flight. It's worthy. The burgers are good. And lindsay is the best waitress."}
{"text":"If youre looking for a mediocre place to eat stay far away from here, you will find suberb burgers and waist line filling fries. I enjoyed every morsel and whenever i look for a guilty pleasure i shall return. Great food, cozy environment and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I've tried to eat here twice and it was just epic fail both times.  The first time, my husband and I sat down before a concert at Time Warner and they assured us an hour would be more than enough time to order our food and get to our concert on time.  Our food never made it to us on time and we ended up just having to pay for our glasses of wine and going to the concert with empty stomachs.  The second time we went there, we were told it would be an hour wait for four people.  So we ditched and went down the street to Rockbottom instead where they were able to seat us immediately.  It's a shame.  The place looks cute and from what I could see from other people's orders, looked like it could be yummy, but I guess I'll never know since I don't plan on coming back just to be turned away again."}
{"text":"Cowbell is one of the most mediocre, overrated, subpar restaurants in Uptown. My boyfriend lives a block away so out of convenience we've been here many times. Every time I want to like it and have a better experience and every time it's almost laughable how bad the service and food are. I've decided I won't be going back and it's time to write a review. The main problem is poor management. I assume the owners have never been around when I've dined here because there is absolutely zero quality control. It's crazy that they spend so much time and money on Public Relations to get people in the door then grossly under deliver. I see a lot of their advertising and features especially in local magazines. Don't fall for it, readers.    Here is a list of the problems I've noticed:  1. Problems start when you walk in. The ambiance is off. Music is always too loud to hear yourself think and they don't show the games that every other bar is showing. Hope you prefer 80s music videos to the Panthers game.  2. Hostess has forgotten to tell the server that she sat us a few times (different hostesses). This is particularly a problem if you sit outside (sat by the hostess). They will forget about you and won't know you're there.  3. Last time I went we waited 15 min before getting drinks and had to go ask them to send a server. In the same meal we also had to ask for a spoon for coffee and silverware about 3 times.  4. Food quality is inconsistent at best. You never know if your food will be under or over cooked or flat out burned. We've had burnt burgers, burnt chicken, burnt bread in appetizer, burnt hamburger buns etc. We've been served cold fries, cold sweet potato tots without the seasoning and cold coffee (during Sunday brunch)  5. Despite an extensive menu, nothing is particularly good. The menu should be re evaluated. Many items are too heavy, too sweet, too much weird sauce or too much bread. Especially the veggie selections are bad but also everything. And everything tastes the same.  6. Orders are wrong a lot. Sometimes this works in your favor (free pickle chips!) sometimes it doesn't. Worst case scenario they will take it off the bill if they mess something up too badly.  7. When things go wrong, staff doesn't apologize. But other random bus boys and staff may awkwardly check in with your table to overcompensate for the ignoring lack of service during the first half of your visit.  8. The burgers aren't good. This is a problem at a burger place. You're better off going to 5guys.  9. It's really overpriced  10. Don't get the salads. They serve them full of rotten lettuce.   I'm sure there are more examples but this should give you an idea. I hope the owners read this because last time I came here I literally thought, these people need to be on Restaurant Takeover. The place has potential but not at all in its current state."}
{"text":"Went for dinner last night, phenomenal burger perfectly cooked! Love the vibe feel like anyone I take would love the space drinks were great and no wait on a Friday night. Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"We came here during a weekend visit in Charlotte. I'll start by saying, being vegan in downtown Charlotte is challenging. We decided to come to Cowbell since they had, not one, but two \"non meat\" burgers on the menu. Previous reviews described this place as \"hipster\" which is just cute. It's one of the most un-hipster places I've been too. It's more like Hard Rock Cafe and Hooters met a nice interior decorator. We were sat immediately and that's where the good stops in this review (I lie, there's one more thing). It took forever to be greeted. By the time we were seated, we obviously knew what we wanted: Jett burgers, no cheese,  sweet potato tots and a beer.  A few minutes later my beer was delivered and a whopping  50 minutes later our black bean burgers came out. 50 minutes. For black bean burgers. First bite... Barely luke warm. If my food is going to take that long, I'd like for it to be at least hot. The burger itself seemed like it was simply black beans smashed up. Like imagine a whole can of black beans smashed up, formed into a pattie and that's Cowbells version. The only saving grace was the sweet potato tots. Those little babies almost made the rest of the meal worth while. All in all, if you just want to hang in a cool place and drink some beers, this might be just fine. I wasn't too happy, and I really wouldn't give it my recommendation."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a bomb burger this js the place to go to kinda away from everything but worth the walk."}
{"text":"Cowbell was the first restaurant I visited after moving to Charlotte in March 2016. Since, I have been back more times than I can remember.   The atmosphere and decor is amazing. Everyone I bring here says the same and it's always a conversation starter.   The staff has always been delightful and helpful. They will make recommendations and have never disappointed. I personally love coming here to get any of the burgers on the menu with sweet potato tots. Occasionally, I go for the fries because they are as good if not better than the tots.   I've also come here for drinks at the bar on more than one occasion. They have a few signature drinks that are great but I usually come in for the Moscow Mule. The bartenders are friendly and will carry on a conversation while you sit at the bar.   Probably one of my favorite places in Uptown and I can't wait to eat there again soon"}
{"text":"I visited Cowbell last weekend and came to realize how incredibly overpriced the bourbon selection is. A glass of Blanton's came out to $40, which the bartender didn't tell me ahead of time and the drink isn't listed on the menu. An entire bottle goes for $65 when found at ABC. Go a block down the street to 204 North, Sea Level, or a variety of other restaurants in Uptown and you can find the same glass of Blanton's for $12-$15. Save your money!"}
{"text":"Best burger place in Charlotte   Fiesta tacos are the best. Homemade sour cream,  bbq sauce,  fresh avocado,  spicy chicken. The best in Charlotte for burgers and tacos. Way better than bang bang. Parking can be tough,  but that is it."}
{"text":"The drink menu and whiskey list are larger than the food menu. There are clever names that have to do with music or bands. The TV's are playing music videos. There is live music on the weekends, and loud music playing during the week. Now, I say this and you probably think the clientele is a lot of music loving rockers, well you're  wrong. There was a substantial amount of business types who must have been popping in after work. The location is perfect for the after work crowd. The food is tasty and the drinks are good. I can tell you I would go back to Cowbell for The Red Velvet Revolver dessert any day. If you like desserts, and you like fried red velvet cake (trust me, you do), then you need to try the Red Velvet Revolver. I practically drooled onto my computer writing about it just now. It is like combining fried ice cream, cake pops, and cheesecake all in one; except it is the cake that is fried. It does something magical in your mouth whiny eat it. The burger I had was was also tasty, but after the RVR, I forgot everything else. Get your rear end down to Cowbell,  and enjoy some good food and drink."}
{"text":"Fantastic burger.  I had their version of a Patty Melt - I forget what it's actually called on the menu.  Absolutely delicious.  Definitely large enough to share!! Friendly service. Dog-friendly outdoor seating.  I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I stopped in here while I was in Charlotte on business. The service and ambiance was 5 stars so if you're going for a drink I recommend this place for sure. I can only give it 2 stars because of the food. I ordered wings in buffalo sauce to start and they were not cooked well enough to my liking. I like wings to have that crunch on the outside and still be juicy. These had soggy/rubbery skin. I ordered a turkey burger after that and there was way too much aioli on the burger and the avocado was black and rotting. I typically do not pick things apart but after a bite I had to. Wouldn't go back for the food."}
{"text":"Great food and drinks The whiskey flight is a great deal with lots to choose from. Some nice beer selection too. It rotates so checkin to see upsets list. A Belgium wit beer was especially tastey. We had the burgers with Bison meat and Gorgonzola. Outstanding. The second time tacos, with sweet potato tots. In a party of 4, Visited twice and everybody liked everything. Attentive and attractive wait staff Happy lively atmosphere."}
{"text":"Yep, this is one of those places....  what place?  The place that asks you how you want your burger cooked then totally disregards and give you a well done burger.  Guys, you are a burger joint.  It is in your name!!!  You have to cook the burgers as requested.  Cmon!  The burger list is pretty impressive.  Other weird thing, they are a burger and whiskey bar, but when you look at the drink menu, there is not a whiskey list....  um, ok.  Also, I ordered sweet potato tots as my side and they were soft and pillowy.  Um....  crispy would have been better.   Sounds like I hated this place so why the 3 stars?   This place cranks great music!!  Soundgardens Rusty Cage is cranking out as I sit at the bar and write this review :)."}
{"text":"Burgers, great! Drinks, amazing! Lindsey, wonderful! Highly recommend. Great atmosphere."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try Cowbell since Nix Burgers closed and I read that it was one of Cam Newton's favorite uptown spots (I mean, if it's good enough for Cam, it's good enough for me, right?). Unfortunately, we left slightly disappointed. I love burgers with egg and bacon on it, and I especially like trying ones that have a twist I've never thought of before. I was excited to see the Big Will's Breakfast burger with egg, bacon, red onions, and honey mustard. I ordered it medium with a side of onion rings. The onion rings were good as far as onion rings go, but I only got three. And they aren't the huge onion rings that take up half the plate, so three seemed to be missing a few. As for the burger, it was decent. It wasn't truly medium, but that didn't bother me too much, it was just notable considering this is a burger place. The honey mustard added an interesting zing and sweetness to the burger that oddly matched well with the egg and bacon. However, in the end, my wife and I both left saying \"that was three stars.\""}
{"text":"I didn't know where to go while in Charlotte, and stumbled upon this burger & whiskey bar. Let me just say AMAZING!! As soon as I walked in I knew that I had made the right choice! They offer various local beers on draft and so many creative cocktails. I ended up choosing Sugar Creek ale and Jimmy's Page which consists of a turkey burger, brioche bun, sliced Granny Smith Apple, candied bacon, sharp white cheddar, mixed lettuces, and pineapple sriracha with my side as sweet potato tots. Beer was great!! Tots...delish, a must have! Burger seemed a bit underdone for a turkey burger (although that's how I like it)...and there was only one small piece of bacon, no apple and little to none sriracha. Overall, delicious and very happy that I stopped in!  Love the atmosphere and decor."}
{"text":"Great food, mostly burgers. They offer Waygu or Bison too. My bison burger was fantastic!  Service was great! I will be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and one of the best burger in Charlotte!!  Excelente servicio y una de las mejores  hamburguesa de charlotte  !"}
{"text":"Low key up class burgers   They have burgers and yuppidy beer. The deco is nice, wood + leather + dark gray, and the wait staff carefree.  Not super friendly but enough to make a solo diner comfortable.     Popeye and umami were decent.... though at the time of this review, I still haven't tried a real umami burger to compare  $6 22oz drafts on Monday.   $4 16oz dogfish next door at dandelion"}
{"text":"I had the wings. Pretty decent. The chicken itself was not over-the-top, but the sauce and ranch made up for it. We were just here for lunch so we didn't sample any of the serious entrées. I had a local wheat beer which was pretty good as well. I think the real feel for this place would be to come in the evening for dinner and try one of their excellent meal drinks. I'm still salivating over the melon mule that I didn't order!i"}
{"text":"Great burgers! This is a nice spot in the hustle and bustle of uptown. We sat on the patio which is quaint but nice. I had the breakfast burger which was pretty good. I was excited that it came on a croissant and when it arrived the bun wasn't a croissant at all. It was a round bun with croissant like characteristics but it wasn't flaky at all. The mac and cheese is good, I love the smokiness of the gouda thats in there. It could've used more salt though."}
{"text":"Not the move here and BE CAREFUL OF THIS PLACE. Ordered a medium prepared burger (the Elvis, their staple) and received an overly  well-done burger that tasted like it had been sitting on the grill for some time long before I got there. I could tell that to be so because my food came out like 5 minutes after I ordered it. You know how long a burger takes to cook? At least 10-15 mins, maybe more. Also the bread was not fresh. This type of behavior from a restaurant you should be careful of. I ordered their basic burger for a reason because the more exotic the burger THE EASIER IT IS FOR THEM TO COVER UP OLD PATTIES WITH SAUCES AND OTHER INGREDIENTS. I would not recommend it as good food to eat, or anything close to that. Would give ZERO STARS if I could."}
{"text":"This is a bold statement but I'm going to make it. Had the Boogan's bacon cheeseburger and it was one of the best burgers I've ever had. A friend of mine tried the little breakfast and loved it. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"THE GOOD: Remarkable local beers (Sugar Creek Pale Ale was out-of-sight!), super tasty Banana Pudding milkshake, fried pickles yummy THE MEDIOCRE: burgers were fine for the price but nothing to write home about. Same for the Disco Fries (good gravy, meh the rest, needed salt). Service was...fine, our waitress forgot about us but was nice when she was around. THE BAD: AWFUL mac & cheese. They should be ashamed to have it on the menu. Poor rectangular noodle choice, grainy sauce, icky cheese combo. I sent it back when we finally caught our waitress' attention before leaving. Swapped for slaw, which was not as good as you'd expect a claw to be which is named after a person. BOTTOM LINE: I'm glad I went here with my family and not my boyfriend. There's too many other burger & alcohol joints in Charlotte to bother returning."}
{"text":"Nice dining room area though a bit dark even in the afternoon, bar was bustling with happy hour patronage.  I had the NYC burger for $12 which was topped with Pastrami, Swiss Cheese and Kraut. I had high hopes for this combination being a fan of the pastrami sandwiches but was let down when the burger arrived, the pastrami and kraut was barely visible and mostly indistinguishable from the beef on the burger. Kraut has such a distinct flavor but not here, they need to charge a buck more and double the toppings.  The beef was cooked perfectly and had great flavor, when asked about the side options I was directed to the sweet potato tots, I asked are they house made, no frozen....pass, how about the fries are they house cut? No, sorry frozen....pass, I will take the cucumber salad."}
{"text":"Cowbells a cool place to grab a burger. A quick FYI the burgers are about 6 ounces so don't expect a big ass burger! What you do get though is tasty as hell and seasoned nicely. Tator tot sweet potatoes are a good side.  Love the staff, well maybe I'm biased here because I'm a man. Catch my drift!  I may stop on by again in the future."}
{"text":"Burger was delicious! Macaroni and cheese was surprisingly delicious!! Small place with a nice little vibe."}
{"text":"The food is good but the service is spotty when slightly busy. We wait and wait and wait some more. Got dirty plates, had to find someone to get us new plates because our server kept on disappearing. Saw my beer poured at the bar and by the time she served it, it was already starting to get warm. Friends liked the disco fries but I didn't like the carmelized onions and shrooms...the flavors didn't work for me. My first experience was definitely better...."}
{"text":"This has been one of my go-to spots for almost 3 years now. Seems like I can always get in and get a table or a seat at the bar, even on Friday night at 7:30. Service is always fast and accurate. Prices are fair for its location. Great spot for a first date where you're not killing your bank account. Let's talk about the burgers. They have a burger for everyone and for whatever mood you're in. Meat is great quality and always cooked right. If you're not wanting a burger, you'll be fine with anything else on the menu. Haven't had anything bad. Can't go wrong with regular fries and the sweet potato tots are borderline a dessert. Drinks are pretty standard, but they offer a great selection. One caveat with Cowbell is the volume level. If you're there on a night where they chose the acoustic guitar player who thinks he's playing in an amphitheater, it's gonna be pretty damn noisy. I always describe this place as a \"gourmet burger joint that plays a shit ton of 90's music videos\". If you're not interested yet, I dunno what to tell you."}
{"text":"So it seems Cowbell needs some training, practice and maybe some direction on handling a large group of people. There were 10 people in my group, so I'll venture to say that this restaurant is ill prepared in handling groups larger than say 4 people. That's unfortunate because they have such great potential. Let's recap positives and negatives, shall we?....  Good: after we walked in without a reservation, the hostess was very accommodating with seating our group. Although we arrived at around 1130, so there were only two other tables of 2-3 people. We were immediately seated, and were almost immediately asked for our drink orders after a few minutes of browsing the menu.  Aight: the food. I had an over east egg on my burger and it came out busted. So there was egg yolk all on the bottom bun and plate, and I know I know, it was going to happen anyway, but I wanna be the one to bust my egg. Other than that, the burger had decent flavor. It has potential.   My drink was aight. It tastes like a regular ginger beer. There was a slight hint of grapefruit but I had to suck on my own tongue to taste it. Wasn't worth the price.    On to the issues.   Mistake #1: our sever was impatient and seemed to have a light attitude. She wasn't really all that friendly, she didn't offer any suggestions, and my whole table noticed. She's lucky we left when we did cause my Godmother and Mother (both native NY'ers) seemed like they were pretty close to hurting her feelings)  Mistake #2: majority of the table had cold food. My burger was lukewarm and the fries were close to being cold. I was starving. Hadn't eaten all day. Did not have time for them to bring out a new burger and probably nuke the fries. So I choked it down.   Mistake #3: My dude asked for ranch for his wings. He got one blue cheese and one ranch. When he told her he had blue cheese, she was like, \"the other one is ranch\" but why would you bring out blue cheese??? Does that make sense? Is it just me? He didn't ask for one of each. Just ranch. That wasn't hard. Now it doesn't sound like that big of deal but when you add up all of the above, and don't even ask if he needs another ranch because you clearly brought out two containers of sauce because he would need it for the amount of wings he has, why even bother to bring out something that wasn't requested???  I usually let one or two things go by without a fuss and maybe the fact this was my graduation lunch and it wasn't all that great, had my senses heightened. Who knows? I might give it another try with one or two other people. Might."}
{"text":"Not a friendly experience,  sat at the bar with Ashleigh and the bartenders choose to ignore us for 10 mins until we decided to leave."}
{"text":"Everyone needs more Cowbell!   5 star atmosphere- rockstar selection of 70s & 80s videos playing on the TVs   5 star beer selection- tons of craft & local brews (as well as major domestics) FYI* the Birdsong Jalapeño Pale Ale tasted like a Jalapeño Cheeto  5 star unique burgers- I tried the Bruiser, delicious blend of sweet and spice!   5 star service- friendly prompt service.   Love, love, love! Wish I could return to try out more of their tasty burger concoctions!"}
{"text":"This review is unfair... and I hate writing a review like this.  It is unfair because the food that we ordered was definitely 5 star.  But everything else was so wrong. We were greeted at the door, the girl told us she would be right with us. No problem. She returned with a handful of dirty plates, grabbed menus with her free hand and asked us to follow her.  Ew. I would have preferred to wait two more minutes for her to have dropped the plates off in the back. She disappeared for a while after that. When she returned, we ordered beers. They came promptly but she dropped them without asking us if we had questions or wanted to order. When we finally ordered we chose two appetizers, the Vinny- grilled chicken sliders with spicy sauce and a tangy pepper and the Whistle Stop sliders- a thin beef patty with a fried green tomato, delicious bacon and pimento cheese, and a side of fries to share.  The food took 30 minutes to get to our table. Now let me say it again... the food was incredible!!! But 30 minutes is a long time.  I also absolutely hated the atmosphere which made the 30 minutes feel like an eternity.  It was a Sunday afternoon, and they were blaring the WORST rock music. I'm so open minded when it comes to music, but this was just awful. Waiting and watching, the staff was completely disengaged with the guests. Every employee was congregated at the end of the bar, chit chatting and looking at their phones.  I will be back to try a burger. The quality of the ingredients and the execution of the food is just so good not to give them another try."}
{"text":"The staff was very friendly and the service was amazingly fast for a Saturday night. I enjoyed my Asian burger and the Mac and cheese had a great flavoring to it."}
{"text":"After a night of too many shots of Fireball, my coworkers & I decided to stop by Cowbell for some lunch. We have had drinks there many times, but on this particular day we were craving greasy and fried.  We started off with the Deviled Eggs and Fried Pickles. The eggs were great- a little salty prosciutto complimented the creamy filling. The fried pickles were an enormous serving, with just the right amount of crispy batter.  For lunch, we all agreed on the Higher Ground. This chicken sandwich comes either grilled or fried- we chose the latter. It's smothered in pimento cheese (my favorite), and topped with bacon, greens and garlic aoli. This sandwich is huge, and absolutely delicious. For a side, I chose the sweet potato tots. Perfect portion, crispy with a sweet & salty finish.  The bartender (I believe her name was Lindsey) was on point. She was very busy but kept our drinks filled and was a pleasure to chat with.  Keep up the good work, guys!"}
{"text":"The two stars are for the sweet potato tots. Those are delicious.   We ordered a chicken sandwich and burger takeout. The burger they gave us was far from what we ordered. The chicken sandwich had a ton of lettuce and sauce on it but very little of the other ingredients. For the price it was very disappointing."}
{"text":"Sweet potato tater tots were amazing but the meal was overall disappointing. The burgers are kind of small. The BBQ sauce is bland, almost ketchup tasting. Chicken wings were unimpressive. There was no A/C on when we went so the joint was very HOT and humid. Even the waitresses were dying. The restaurant is loud with kind of a grungy-punk theme so just prepare yourself for the vibe."}
{"text":"Went for lunch on a Saturday afternoon...service was slow and it felt as if we were inconveniencing them.  The burgers were most definitely overpriced, they claim they are 8 ounces, that is a stretch to say the least.  They are more like little meatballs.  Their bathroom is super gross, piss everywhere. Beer and liquor prices are outrageous. If you live in NC because you love their taxes, you'll love this place. What a rip-off! Hipster central."}
{"text":"Great burgers, delicious sides, and friendly service. My husband and I went here looking for a great burger. Their menu is creative and even has options for vegetarians. Try the fried pickles and sweet potato tots - they are heavenly!  I wish they offered gluten free options and a little more variety in the music. We will go back and bring friends!"}
{"text":"Went here on a visit to Charlotte. I got the disco fries, Nick got the Danny California and panfried corn for his side. My disco fries were good, no complaints. The Danny California was listed as a spicy item but it was not spicy let alone 2 pepper spicy. Also the panfried corn was a bit over cooked but the flavor was good. One of our friends got the Mac and cheese for his side and I liked the flavor. We would come back here again."}
{"text":"Great place in the heart of downtown, a bit pricey but it's deff worth it.  Service is phenomenal super friendly and courteous.  I had the atomic dog, I'm not a big Hot dog fan, but this was so delicious.  If I every find myself around the area I will deff come back and eat here."}
{"text":"Outstanding food, great beer selection and the gfy burger was amazing. Service was exemplary. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Cool Place...but small. Buffalo Chicken Sandwich was really good...hot dog not so much. But we will try it again, not during lunc h hour though."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Great atmosphere.  Probably the best wrap I have ever had and that's saying a lot since I am from New York..and best of all, I left my phone there and when I went back 3 hours later, it was still there!! Extremely honest staff.  Thank you."}
{"text":"Bad Daddy's is generally the go to but after 3 yrs 2-3x a month it was time for a change. Cowbell was the ticket.  Boogan's, the Gambler - delicious!!  Onion rings have incredible flavor."}
{"text":"HOLY COW....BELL!!! My Pilgrim burger with sweet potato tots were out of this world! Everyone I went with lovedddddd their lunch. I can't wait to go back!  AND the host looked just like Adam Levine! Love! Haha"}
{"text":"Husband and I went here after a show at Belk Theatre. We were seated quickly but it took a while for a server to greet us. (It was very busy!) Fun and modern atmosphere. Food was delicious!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious! We ordered the Dumpling (with Sweet Potato Tots )and the Ronstadt Wrap (with Onion Rings) and a deep fried cheesecake. The Dumpling was the right amount of spicy so that it had a kick but was not burning my lips. The cheesecake was the right kind of creamy texture with a strawberry sauce and sort of a funnel cake crust.  We ordered out so I cannot comment on the restaurant service/atmosphere, but I would certainly eat here again."}
{"text":"Nothing special. All atmosphere and no substance. Hamburgers are okay. Good ideas just poorly executed. Hamburger and fries? Yes, please. Their fries were soggy and flavorless.   Don't bother."}
{"text":"This is my favorite burger joint in Charlotte so by default it's the best burger joint in Charlotte ... or until I find some place better. Top 5 reasons why I'm a fan of the Cowbell:  1. The Burgers (Duhhh).  Not super-sized but jam-packed with great flavor and ingredients.  2. The Sides Mac & Cheese and Sweet Potato Tatter Tots FTW!! the Tots have a dash of cinnamon so you know they're magical.  3. The Ambiance The décor is dope. Hip and Modern. Art, Music, Sweet Decorations. There's an awesome painting in the men's bathroom called The Punch. Check it out and wash your hands while you're at it   4. Whiskey Because Whiskey + Burgers trump everything else  5. The Dumpling Burger Yes, it's that good that it warranted it's own number. Try it and tell me I'm wrong! I'll wait ...   Side note: If they have the Organic Chocolate Porter available, try that too. Deliciousness in a bottle."}
{"text":"Paul's Yelp Elite Rating: 4.25 Stars  Another solid lunch at Cowbell, but this time, the burger was even better! Got the Patty Melt with TWO nice sized patties, lots of carmelized onions and yummy white cheese on a rye bun. Perfectly cooked to medium (my buddy Joe LOVES his burgers next to raw, so he got his \"as rare as you can legally make it\" and they did!). Very juicy, flavorful and FILLING!   Their parmesan fries are really good....as I've learned from my past soiree's here, their Onion Rings are \"hit and miss\" and I didn't want to take the chance, so I went with their always solid fries.  Look this is not the cheapest burger in town....with a coke this rang up to $16 withOUT tip....BUT, I'll pay for a good QUALITY burger anyday....and Cowbell serves up those quality burger.....just don't be shocked when you get the bill. If you want cheap, hit Mickey D's. But in comparison, this is just a TAD bit more than 5 Guys which you've heard me rant as being surprisingly expensive (although really damn good).   This does turn into a cool, \"hipster\" vibe place after 5pm, and they have a great selection of whiskeys....  As my gal pal Nikki (our awesome CM) says, who can not love Rock n' Roll, Burgers and Whiskey?"}
{"text":"Watch out, there's a new Brunch spot in town and Cowbell is a sharp shooter.    We moseyed into Cowbell as a last resort on Sunday of Memorial Day weekend. We had 13 people and had already been completely turned down by 5Church (snobs!) and then told by Dandelion it would most likely be an hour wait, but they couldn't make any promises.  We were walking by Cowbell and popped our head in just to see if they had any seating and lo and behold, they could sit all 13 of us at once, AND recently started serving brunch.  Also, I think it's important to note that they didn't make us wait until our entire party arrived to actually sit down, which was awesome.  The first thing the waitress told us is that they had been doing brunch for a little less than three weeks and they would appreciate constructive criticism, which I thought was very honorable.  Kudos for welcoming feedback!  The mimosas and Bloody Mary's were poured with a heavy hand - again, a spectacular bonus.  The coffee was on point and they never let our drinks hit the bottom of the glass.    The music (as always) was upbeat and really started the day off right.  Who doesn't want to listen to 90's jams?!  This is AMERICA.  Okay, the food - what you've all been waiting for... The food was extraordinary - which was surprising to me most of all since they have only been serving brunch for THREE WEEKS?!$. Unheard of.  There were lots of options and everything we got was fantastic.  Started with the Apple and Cinnamon Croquettes (for all intense and purposes these are savory donut holes) served with hot maple cinnamon butter to slow dance with your taste buds.  Favorite brunch items of the group were the Breakfast Casserole (a little bit of everything all rolled into one), Lenny's Sleepover (chicken tenders and fluffy waffles), the Benny, and the Sandy.  But I got the casserole and you should definitely just put that in your mouth as fast as possible.  Outrageous.  Overall Cowbell was in the stars for us.  The wait staff was so sweet and accommodating (especially considering that we were already in our NASCAR outfits and deserved to be judged), the atmosphere was upbeat and fun, the food was mouth watering food porn, the drinks were heavy, and service was quick and we had a BLAST!    Overall rating?  HELL YEA!  MERICA!"}
{"text":"I can't think of a better burger in Uptown. Hands down, I have never ordered a burger, turkey or otherwise that wasn't a delicious combination of ingredients. There is one flaw, however. We have ordered takeout on two separate occasions, and both times they have forgotten something from our order. The first time it was buffalo sauce from our Vince's cowbell sandwiches, the second time was today when they forgot a side of cucumber salad. Not a big deal, I realize. But when you walk five blocks to pick up lunch for your office, it's a bit annoying to return and realize something is missing. Both times, Cowbell sent someone to our office with the missing items, but be sure to check your takeout order before leaving the restaurant."}
{"text":"A great place to have food, enjoy great drinks and watch some games. I have had their black bean burger and their southwest salad and both are really yummy. I have also had fried mozzarella cheese with marinara sauce. That item is so amazing delicious.  The service is really great and they are willing to help out and adjust to your needs."}
{"text":"A real mixed bag experience the other night. Some good some bad, nothing terrible but nothing remarkable.  We got to the Cowbell around 10PM on a Friday night. Fortunately we got a table right away and drinks came quickly. Roll in with a party of 4, two of us (myself included) have been before and 2 were newcomers who needed some time going over the extensive menu. We started with beer cheese pretzels which were great; dark, complex Guiness flavor meets a mellow, earthy cheese, I'm a fan. Expecting to followup with an even more impressive burger!  So some of you might not be a fan of the Foie Gras concept (if unfamiliar, do your research). Cowbell claims to responsibly source their Foie Gras, so don't start a protest for my menu selection, it CAN be done. I did indeed order the GFY Burger with Beef, Foie Gras, Greens, an apricot sauce, and creole mustard. After a bite or two I decided to deconstruct the burger because something was not harmonizing right. Beef patty was great, an accurate medium doneness and worked well with the apricot. What didn't work for me was the mustard. I'm not a big fan of mustard to begin with but for a place that touts a $20 burger, I was willing to take it as-is. The biggest problem was that the Foie Gras either on the burger or alone was a let down. I was really unimpressed with the flavor profile, and had a gamy undertone. $20 burger this was not.  While two of my buddies were very happy with their burgers, one of them ordered the Dumpling Burger and it came out drenched in hoisin sauce. I mean, you pick it up and it was dripping out of the bun. I think part of the blame is on him for getting the sriracha aioli on the side. You see, a mayo or aioli on a toasted bun serves as a barrier, the fat keeps other liquid from penetrating the bun temporarily. The aioli indeed was very spicy, but oh well, lesson learned.  We all got drinks and I think this is what Cowbell does best. One of my friends got a premium whisky and coke and I could definitely become a whisky guy after stealing a sip. I got the spiked s'mores milkshake. It was good but I think it could have been better. It was very boozy, it threw it a little off balance because the subtle notes of chocolate, and graham cracker was lost in the alcohol. I almost wonder if I got a double pour... Satisfying, but I was hoping for more unity in the flavors.  The night took a really weird turn when the bouncer left the door for a minute (I'm assuming for a bathroom break) and when no one took his place, a short, young girl walked in and immediately started running to tables. She got to ours and it was clear she didn't speak english. She threw a pamphlet in front of us to donate money to help kids... just kids, no explanation. I told her we weren't interested and she, no joke, sat down in a chair with a notebook and wanted me write my name and a dollar amount... It was very off-putting but she finally went to another table. Before I could inform our waitress, the bouncer returned, seemingly recognized her, and escorted her out. Perhaps if this is a problem they should have someone at the door at all times, it is Uptown after all.  A bit exhausted with the ups and downs of the experience, we forego'ed dessert and headed to NoDa. I'm not sure if I just got series of bad combinations or if I should just view the place as a good whisky bar, boy is that liquor menu impressive. One way or the other I'll drop in soon with a fresh perspective and hope it isn't the norm."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in the Charlotte Uptown area!  I have never had a bad burger of any kind in this place. The price point is decent and the crowd on the weekends is lively. They have a good selection of beers and liquor. The sweet potato tots are the best! The mac & cheese is hit or miss. Regardless, this place is my go to anytime I'm craving a good burger and a beer."}
{"text":"Juicy burger. I got the umami burger medium and for my side mac and cheese. The burger was good ... Moist and filling. The mac n cheese was Parmesan based and milky .. Very tasty. For takeout, make sure to check your order before you leave. Good thing we live close bc my fiancé they forget his side. But other than that we would definitely go back. It's a more fancy burger $$ if you don't want five guys. If you're looking for something new, try this place ... Service was quick"}
{"text":"I work uptown and have never tried this place, always wanted to and finally did. Me and 2 coworkers went at 12:30 pm for lunch. There was no wait, but definitely busy. Our server was very informative and patient with us while we were deciding what juicy burger to enjoy. I ordered the Gambler with their Parmesan French fries. I started on the fries forgetting about my burger because the fries were so good! The right amount of crisp, definitely not greasy. My burger was DELICIOUS. No complaints at all on my end. I ate everything on my plate. If I had room for one of their milkshakes I would, they look ridiculously good. I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"I highly recommend this place for a lot of reasons.  The food was quite tasty, with a lot of cool menu options left unexplored for other visits.  They have a tremendous whiskey list, with flights available on different levels.  My server/bartender was Lindsey, and she is charming, beautiful, and talented!  I took her recommendation and had the turkey burger, very tasty!  Then she made me an excellent Old Fashioned!  I will happily return here."}
{"text":"Cowbell is a great date night restaurant or place for friends. On the weekend they usually have a dj come in which is fun. The burgers are gourmet, so don't expect a greasy, messy cheeseburger. They have about 12+ different options- plus build your own- but the Danny California turkey burger is my favorite!! And the pilgrim with apple, bacon and Brie is also a top contender. However, you can't really go wrong with any of them!   I actually get more excited for the sides rather than the burgers. The cucumber salad is awesome and refreshing. Hands down my favorite site option. And the sweet potato tots are also very good. Also ask for a side of ranch with them :)"}
{"text":"For a burger place the burger had no taste.. There was so much mustard on the Elvis you could taste nothing else.  The onion roll was stale.  Was not impressed."}
{"text":"Dropped in this Sunday for a quick bite to eat before crashing at my hotel after a flight.  Overall good food, good service, a bevy of beers & whiskeys to choose from, and televisions to distract you.    Rumor has it the place hasn't been the same since losing their previous world class Restaurant Manager; but as far as I can tell Cowbell is flourishing and with good reason.   Cheers."}
{"text":"I'm only giving this place 3 stars because our service was awesome, otherwise it would be a 2... horrible food. Not worth the wait."}
{"text":"I dropped in to Cowbell on a Monday afternoon for lunch with a friend.  We were seated immediately - the restaurant about half full.   I loved the atmosphere - kind of artsy meets rock n roll meets a bit of glam.    The menu has a really large selection of burgers (of course), chicken sandwiches, tacos, wings and salads.  You get your choice of a great selection sides - including onion rings, sweet potato tots, mac n'cheese, fries, pan-fried corn and cucumber salad.    I ordered the Jimmy Page turkey burger - which was topped with candied bacon, granny smith apple, cheddar cheese and pineapple sriracha.  Turkey burgers require a bit of finesse - they have a tendency to dry out very quickly and be somewhat bland.  I was thrilled to receive a juicy and very flavorful burger.  The pineapple sriracha provided a mildy sweet, mildly spicy flavor that paired well with the apple and bacon.  For my side, I went with the onion rings.  Wow.  I received 3 giant onion rings - the outside was crispy and cooked perfectly while the inside was soft and soooooo tasty!    Overall, I had a great experience.  The table next to me had the Carolina burger and sweet potato tots -- that also looked amazing, I'm excited to go back again and further explore the menu."}
{"text":"60 minutes for a takeout order that was said to be ready in 20 minutes. Food was cold."}
{"text":"When we walked in had to show ID which was peculiar but I suppose for all the whiskey.The atmosphere was too loud .. the food was yummy though and our server was helpful! Would go again and we got one of their flights the three tastings of whiskey and was so-so !"}
{"text":"We had a great time at Cowbell!  Our server Katie Beth was delightful and extremely personable.  We ordered two different Moscow Mules - a lemon citrus and Cucumber.  The drinks were very well made but we just weren't a fan of them.  By no means is this a reflection of the bar staff - just taste preference.   For an appetizer we had deviled eggs which were wonderful!  I loved the notion of putting a pickle on top (the pickles were the best!) For dinner my husband ordered burger with chili and coleslaw (sorry name slipped our mind) which was very good.   I had the Tomahawk burger (the restaurant donates a $1 to local charities for every order) the burger was named because the Panthers happened to be playing the Redskins this week.  It was very good -  We had deep fried ice cream with \"Happy Birthday\" written on strawberry sauce.  Our server let us know the runner was in a goofy mood and everyone was getting something cute on their plate!  We decided to play a joke with our server to tell the runner we were offended and that was a huge success and we had a big laugh!  It was a delightful experience and we will absolutely be back!   Service was top notch and that is what makes us come back to a restaurant!  Excellent!!!!!"}
{"text":"We came here for dinner on our first night in Charlotte, NC. We got seated immediately at a table pretty close to the entrance. It was a bit cold outside, so it was a bit annoying to me whenever someone else came in. Still, there was a good amount of TV screens to watch the games going on for the weekend. The waitress started us off with our drink order. I got a traditional mule and the fiancé tried out a local beer.   For our meal, we both got burgers. I got the \"The Melt\" burger that was made on sourdough bread and had cheddar cheese and grilled onions. It was alright for me. I felt like it was something I could make myself. I also got the house fries which was seasoned well with parmesan and herbs. The fiancé got the Boogan's Bacon burger with some sweet potato tots. He liked how it was put together and that it wasn't sloppy, but the taste did not wow him. He did enjoy tater tots and liked how brown sugar was sprinkled on them to bring out more sweetness.  Service was great. Our waitress did a great job keeping up with our order and my preference of having mayo on the side for my french fries (yes, I'm a weirdo).  I think the food just did not wow us... Maybe another try when we make it back in town."}
{"text":"I've been traveling to Charlotte for work and stumbled across this place looking for a bite with my fellow traveling coworkers. We stopped in cowbell because the hostess actually came out to the street to entice us to come inside. We appreciated her effort and decided to post up at the bar. This was the first of many excellent decisions made that evening.   Our bartender was Garrett, a good dude who knows how to make a proper drink. If you ask him nicely, he'll make your bourbon with a solid sphere ice cube that he fashions right in front of you with this awesome ice-shaping device. If your boss happens to be footing the bill, this place has a great selection of very fine whiskeys and bourbons. Red Breast over a spherical ice cube is a real treat to sip on (and $$$$).   It doesn't stop there, the food is excellent. We had house made mozzarella sticks, grilled wings (ask for them well done), and a variety of their specialty burgers. I even tried a deep-fried bacon wrapped hot dog. I'm a fan of every item I tried, including the sweet potato tater tots--delicious.  The food here is great, the ambience is cool with a good soundtrack and music videos on the few TVs, and the staff is very polite and good company.  Every time I go to Charlotte, we will visit cowbell. If only to give Garrett a hard time at the bar (I was greeted with a \"oh no not this guy\" last time I came in--love it), you should check this place out for awesome burgers and drinks."}
{"text":"I had a fantastic dinner with some friends. The Moscow Mule was on point and my buddys flight of 3 whiskeys was decently priced. One had a hot dog and was floored by the onion rings with the chipotle aioli. Another had the Danni California (spicy turkey burger) and said it was the best turkey burger he's ever had. His mac&cheese was not too shabby either. I had the Jerry Garcia burger (carmelized onions, cheese, cowbell sauce on an open faced grilled sourdough). The sweet potato tots were slightly sweet and delicious. I highly recommend this place, not a single complaint to be had."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying this establishment and my review is mixed. The service was really good. We sat at the bar, which I like to do because service is usually good and more personal. Bar staff was nice and knowledgeable. As my first time I wasn't sure what to order so I did a modified Jimmy Page with the fried corn. It was meh. I'd recommend though"}
{"text":"Great bourbon, scotch selection. great food, amazing bartender Olivia. Incredibly knowledgeable about whiskey and whisky; bourbon, scotch and rye. Great atmosphere. Cool vibe and great music. Cant wait to go back."}
{"text":"Came here as a stop on a bar crawl, so was not quite sober when I walked in.  However, I was still impressed with the food!  My girlfriend and I split a burger with BBQ on top and had a side of the sweet potato tots.  Shared the tots with some friends also on the bar crawl, and everybody appreciated.  Burger was juicy and BBQ on top added some nice flavor.  Washed everything down with a Moscow Mule in a copper cup.  Definitely a hipster place with a high price tag, but food is good and ambience is nice.  Have to come back and try again when eating a full meal."}
{"text":"Great potential, could have been a 4 star, the food was good, the deviled egg appetizer was excellent, the wait for food and drinks was sooooooooooo loooooooooong, oh yeah and they were out of soco"}
{"text":"OK this is the real deal. Great burgers fab onion rings Generous whisky pours! A come back to place."}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazing, no waiting , as soon as we got there we were greeted and seated, very cozy, I had my 3 month old baby and the staff made us feel welcome. The burger is very tasty, I  had the pineapple burger and I enjoyed it. Will definitely recommend this place. On the down side the is not easy cause it's on a main street. The waitress make sure we were taking care of."}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town. I came here with recommendation of the hotel I was staying at on a Friday night.  Food: I tried the Carolina Burger with sweet potato tots, as per the Yelp reviews. Was really great! Loved that 5th St Chili! I'm not a burger person but I would definitely come back to try out more menu items. I love sweet potato, but I felt like these were a little too sweet. I don't like to add sugar at all to sweet potato. So if you're someone who doesn't like a sweetened sweet potato, I'd probably skip this and try something else. Next time I might try to S'more Shake! My colleague had that and it looked delicious!  Service: Service was friendly.  Environment: The decor was really interesting. Very quirky. Music was very loud though. It was a little hard to talk to my colleague.  Overall, food was solid. I'd definitely recommend to try if you're in town!"}
{"text":"This whiskey and burger bar is downtown and near several other bars. It has a good rock and roll vibe. We started with a couple of tasty drinks from the list of mules (variations on moscow mules). There is a large selection of bourbons and other whiskeys and several good local brews on tap. The burgers did not disappoint and were juicy and cooked the way we ordered them. Our servers were attentive."}
{"text":"This might just be the best burger I've ever had! Went in for a late night meal.  Sat at a high top in the bar area and met my waitress Sarah Beth. I asked her for a beer recommendation and she brought me an excellent draft, as I was in the mood for something along the line of a Hefeweizen. Following that, I had the Sinatra,  prosciutto and pulled cheese appetizer. It comes with a little marinara sauce and really hit the spot. For my main entree I had trouble deciding but eventually settled on the NYC Burger cooked medium rare and let me just say it was amazing! It comes with sweet potato tots which I've never had before but I love.  I'll be back again before leaving Charlotte, as this place had excellent food.  My only complaint, was the music televisions but Sarah Beth explained that the earlier thunderstorms knocked out the regular tv.  Go earlier and they'll have sports on some.  But I didn't go here for television anyway and can't say enough about the quality of the food."}
{"text":"After hearing so much about Cowbell and my coworkers convincing me to go with them for lunch, I finally tried Cowbell.  The menu is extensive with about 20 different burgers that include: turkey, salmon and chicken patties. After being indecisive for about 10-15 minutes because the service is a little slow, I will say it was about 11:45 so I guess it was somewhat a lunch rush, I finally chose the Pilgrim burger. I was feeling like eating healthier that day so that was probably a bad decision on my part. The Pilgrim is a turkey patty on a honey wheat bun with brie cheese, apple and bourbon bbq sauce, and bacon. I ordered the sweet potato tots as a side. It was 7 people in our party but we waited for our food for a good while, which is somewhat expected with a larger party.   Sadly, I wasn't wowed with my burger. It was just bland to me even with bbq sauce and bacon. Even though I ordered a turkey burger, the patty was not thick or juicy at all and just kind of dry. I've had juicier and more flavorful turkey patties. The only thing that saved my meal was the sweet potato tots! I loved them, they were coated in cinnamon sugar and really sweet. I will say the sweet potato tots are one of the best in town especially since you don't even need a sauce with them.  I will give this place another chance and order an actual beef patty next time with an order of sweet potato tots for sure!"}
{"text":"This place was great when it first opened. Wouldn't return. Very loud, so if you want a bar atmosphere then this is your place."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday evening and were told to wait 25 mins to be seated. Had no problem with that so we just went next door to grab a drink. Finally we were ready to be seated and did not wait long for our waitress to greet us. We had drinks to start off, then a sweet potato corn dogs, which looked like little fried fritters. It was delicious btw. We ordered the Boogas bacon burger and the Higher ground chicken burger. I saw on Yelp that the higher ground chicken burger was just like a Chickfila burger so I had to try it for myself. I would have to say that it was pretty darn tasty, but I would love it more if it was a spicy chicken burger. As busy as it was inside the restaurant, our food came out in a timely manner. Our waitress was kind and sweet our entire meal. We could tell she was busy, but she managed to come get our refills and check up on us from time to time. I would definitely try this place again!"}
{"text":"We were very disappointed in our experience here and will not be back. Our very unfriendly waitress never said anything more to us than asking what we would like to order. Our beers were served at room temperature. The burger patty was maybe half the size of the bun that it was served on and we were mostly eating lettuce and bread."}
{"text":"We went back to Cowbell and had exceptional Service. The food was quick, tasty and everything we were craving. Much happier with our experience this time around and will keep it in our rotation of restaurants. Kudos to the management for taking complaints seriously and making major improvements in service."}
{"text":"I was really excited about this restaurant having reviewed the menu prior and read the reviews on yelp.    First the atmosphere is, as other reviews say, very cool with a music theme, with music videos playing on a big screen tv and wall decor of album covers and posters (Farrah faucet and Robert plant).  To me it was odd (and a surprise) that a \"try to be bad ass burger bourbon bar\" would play Justin Bieber and Beyoncé videos, (but I'm  sure that is just me).  Anyway, the ambience is warm and cool- the music is just alright.     The bourbon selections and variety was great- reminded me and husband of a few awesome days spent in Louisville!    We sat at the bar where the service was pleasant and prompt.  We both ordered burgers- one well and one medium.  Sides were fries and Mac & cheese.  When the burgers arrived we both commented about the smaller size for the price and both were well done.  Also, not a great burger flavor for the quality of meat advertised.  The onion roll on my burger seemed stale since it was crumbly.  Sides were alright, nothing noteworthy.    So, to sum up...fun atmosphere, great bourbon, alright over priced burger, good service (but be warned...the bartender presented our food and drinks with a \"Ta-Dah\" each time, and she sang along with the videos as well- if that is your thing, you will love it)"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch. Not impressed with service and the hostess seating each party in the back of the restaurant (when the restaurant was empty).  Deviled eggs were very mustardy, the scrambles were ok even though it seemed there was more cheese than eggs in one of them. Gluten free pancakes came out undercooked - the dough was still raw.  We liked the atmosphere and menu, but the kitchen and staff needed little help when we visited."}
{"text":"Happened on this place after a football game. The Bruiser was amazing. Seasoned well and the caramelized onions make it. The fries are crispy on the outside and soft inside. Definitely one of the best burgers I've had in years. Go. Be happy."}
{"text":"Pretty cool joint that has an 80's theme, perfect to hit before going next door to the Roxbury.  This place is ultra trendy.  The place is very dark, making for reading the menu a total bitch....... The music is loud, so just go there knowing this will help you survive if you want to actually have a conversation.  My only real issue was the Disco Fries.  Claiming to be Montreal Putine style.  Well I frequent enough Canada to disagree, I would say it is their version.  The gravy was too rich, the cheese curds to few.  They were okay to my wife and I.  I had the Boogmans + chedder and my wife had the Big Wills.  Both were perfect!  Tasty and fabulous.  The patties are rather thick, not flat, so the juices retained does make for a messing - fun - interesting meal.    The mac&cheese was out of this world.  Good stuff!  And you can order it instead of fries with a burg.  Also, the onion rings are tasty, served with a spicy sauce.  But, really?  Just three onion rings, errrrrr.....  We sat at the bar and were defiantly taken care of.  Great bartender!   She helped me with my flight of Whiskey,  Great recommendations......"}
{"text":"The food here can be pretty inconsistent. For the most part the burgers are decent, but I've had fries come out cold and over salted. Service is very friendly and usually attentive. I like that they have an extensive whiskey menu with very reasonable price points. Overall, middle of the road right now"}
{"text":"Burger was really quite good, from a pretty extensive menu. However, it was notably smaller than the bun (even if relatively thick), resulting in an oddly difficult eating experience. I opted for the Boogan's Bacon, which ultimately fell apart and had to get eaten with a knife and fork. The tots were a major disappointment. Sweet potato tots, they were seemingly coated with some sort of sweet glaze. I realize some people like brown sugar with their sweet potatoes, but with a burger this was altogether unsatisfactory. The texture was poor and the taste clashed badly with the burger. Service was good though, and I'd try again in the future."}
{"text":"This was definitely a good find. We were starving and this late night spot was awesome. The waitress was very friendly and attentive. The food..*kudos to the cook/chef! I ordered the Elvis burger with the sweet potato tater tots...it was delicious. Thank you all for the excellent experience. Sorry no pictures...I was hangry by the tine my food came."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for lunch on our last day in Charlotte. We were looking for a quick bite before heading to the airport to catch our flight. We arrived around 1 PM and were seated right away.  My husband got the Patty Melt which was delicious and I got the Lisa Marie which was also very good. I have to say my favorite part of the meal was the mac n cheese side. I have never had mac n cheese that creamy and delicious before. Definitely something everyone needs to try. We also got a smores milkshake which was also very good. Our only complaint would be that we didn't expect the sweet potato tots to be sweet with cinnamon and sugar, but they were still good.  This was an awesome last minute find! Definitely a place to check out."}
{"text":"By all stretch of seriousness.... The wings here were the very best I've ever had!! Ever!!!!  And I am a wings gal!!!  The fries, onion rings and wings.... Well above expectations!   Try this place!  You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Last night we got take-out on our walk home. Walked in, ordered at the bar, waited for probably 15 minutes and our late dinner had arrived. The two of us split the turkey burger with an order of sweet potato tots and a side of wings. Both the burger and wings were SUPER spicy (which I love) and the tots were surprisingly sweet. If you want more of a savory side, add ketchup to the tots. Otherwise, they're delightfully cinnamon-y and make for a good dessert with your burger.   The food did seem to take longer than expected, but at 9:30 at night hardly anyone was eating. It probably took the kitchen a few to get ready to start cooking again- who knows. Otherwise, pretty solid."}
{"text":"You have to try the foie gras burger! Worth the $20! Staff unprofessional, not very attentive."}
{"text":"We went here after not getting service at 5church.  This was a great option.  Quirky decor, but the music videos were fun for something a bit different.  Service was not over friendly but she was efficient. (Britt)  Ordered my chicken sandwich fried but came out grilled. Not a huge issue and I did not send it back, was a very tasty option.  Hashbrowns were a very small portion but tasted great.  Burgers were cooked correctly and tasted great.  Got a side of grits out of curiosity, the were fantastic.  Several light bulbs out throughout the place made for a bit of a dive feeling.  With some attention to details, they could do very well."}
{"text":"(More like 3.5 stars)  \"I got a fever...and the only prescription is more cowbell!\" (Am I the first to reference the SNL cowbell skit in a review for Cowbell?)  'A friend and I tried this place out last night (a Saturday) and it was a good time! Granted, the place is very tight on space. Forget having much conversational privacy here - it ain't gon' happen, my friend. There is a large-ish L-shaped bar for your multiple TV screen viewing pleasure. Also, there's a small outside eating area in front of the restaurant  We showed up around 6:00 and it was beginning to get busy. We both decided to have bottles of angry ale cider (cold and crisp!) and I went the chicken sandwich route. I ordered Vince's cowbell with a side of house fries. My food arrived and I was surprised that the sandwich (and my friend's burger) was on the smaller side. With Cowbell being known as burger bar, I was expecting heftier portions but that's not necessarily a bad thing, just an observation.  The chicken sandwich was very good. Slightly spicy and the chicken was juicy. Big plus with it being served on a wheat bun. My friend was also very pleased with her burger. Not exactly which one she ordered since she asked the waitress to bring a burger with a list of her favorite toppings! The fries were good just not anything memorable. They could stand to be a little crispier.  I decided to try one of their desserts - the velvet revolver - and was SORELY mistaken in doing so. It's a dessert that's described on their website as \"fried ice cream with red velvet cake mix, chocolate sauce, and house buttercream.\" Truly, this was the worst dessert I've ever had in a restaurant. There wasn't an ounce of red velvet nor chocolate flavor to be found. The ice cream was coated in this beady, crumbly dark coating that had NO FLAVOR. Well, actually it had a weird greasy taste to it. We let the waitress know and the manager, Aaron, came over and profusely apologized and kindly took the dessert off of our bill. As a nice gesture, he sent over red velvet flavored shots for us.   Overall, the service was extremely friendly, pleasant, and accommodating. The food, there are some improvements to be made but the restaurant has a fun ambiance and makes for a nice place to grab a drink."}
{"text":"Great burgers and beer selection.   Was here from outta state and had great recommendations, service and delicious!"}
{"text":"The fella and I visited Cowbell with some friends on a Saturday evening before a Checkers game. None of us had ever been, but what can go wrong with burgers and bourbon?  We got there before the other couple and grabbed seats at the end of the bar. The atmosphere was fun, and it looked totally different than when it was Nix. There were two staff standing there chatting, but apparently they weren't working the bar? They just sort of stared at us while the bartender helped other people, and after a few awkward looks, one of them finally helped us. Weird. The fella got a bourbon, and I got a gin & tonic. It wasn't my favorite, but I couldn't put my finger on why.  After the other couple arrived, we snagged a table by the window (perfect for people watching) and got to it. They ordered some fried pickles, and even though I saw some reviews that said they could be hit or miss, they were definitely a hit for us. For dinner, I got the Winehouse chicken sandwich (YUM) and a side of sweet potato tots. I was surprised by the tots - they were more like bullets, and they were coated in sugar, making them much sweeter than others... almost like a delicious dessert. The fella got a bourbon flight, which he loved, and he got the breakfast burger with fries for dinner. He said the burger was great, but almost too high quality because the texture wasn't as hearty as he normally likes. I know, first world problems.  Once we got to the table, our service was spectacular, and our waitress was incredibly nice and patient with splitting checks, substituting things for other things, etc. I'd definitely go back for more Cowbell!"}
{"text":"Great food and atmospher. I went there for lunch and it was not busy at all but I imagine that changes for dinner.  Be prepared to pay for parking with cash or card or you can park away from downtown and walk the distance.  The burgers can be cooked to your liking but even when they are well done, they are still juicy. The fries are seasoned perfectly and the onion rings are very good.  The menu is very original but prepare to look at a lot of different drinks and foods. You also have the option to order the burgers 'naked' which means without bun. You can also replace the protein."}
{"text":"I  this place. The food, atmosphere, and service are all great. They make the best milkshakes. I highly recommend them to everyone!!!!"}
{"text":"Was visiting Charlotte. Had an amazing lunch at the bar. Ask for Lindsey she is absolutely fantastic"}
{"text":"So have been in Charlotte (pretty much weekly) for about 10 months or so and Cowbell has turned into one of my consistent \"go to\" spots. It is a burger joint serving up an extensive variety of burgers and they also serve small bites, wings, and salads. This joint also serves up a good selection of whiskeys and they have what seems like an endless supply of drinks. I have been to this place over a dozen times now and it is a consistent experience that I can totally appreciate.  The restaurant itself is not large with a \"L\" Shaped bar and around 20- 25 tables. They also have live music on certain nights if that's your type of thing. The bartenders & waitresses area always friendly and accommodating and there are plenty of TVs set up for you to watch whatever sports you are into as you enjoy your meal. I have gotten plenty of different types of burgers including the umami, dumpling, Carolina but for me the one that stands out is the PM burger. I always get my burgers naked so unfortunately I wont have a ton of perspective on the bread but the meat is cooked well and the toppings are always plentiful. For the PM burger I love the jalepenos that come out with it and ALWAYS get the sweet potato tater tots .They are just delish (never soggy) and perfect in some honey mustard for me but I figure they will go well with anything. Finishing a meal here with two mcallans double neat is my perfect night meal.  All in all, you know exactly what you are getting here and the food is consistent with good vibes. Nothing more than I can ask for that knowing that I will always enjoy my meal. Will miss grabbing some burgers from this place when I stop hitting up NC."}
{"text":"I've been to a lot of a hip burger places around Dallas, TX where I'm from and after looking at the menu I was excited to try to this place out.  I had the bruiser with mac n cheese as a side, and they were fantastic. The difference between these burgers and something you'd get from a fast food place or chili's is the quality of the ingredients and the meat.  If you're a fan of a great burger, then this is a place to go to."}
{"text":"Hidden downtown Charlotte gem with delicious food and liquor options in a fun upscale atmosphere. 4.4 stars  Food: 4.5, Atmosphere: 4, Service: 4 Cost to worth it rating: 3 (apps $6-12, burgers $9-13) Return worthiness: yes  Highlights: - Burgers: meaty with a good char flavor and a soft bun - PM burger: pulled pork was soft and juicy with tasty BBQ sauce and a little crunchy heat from the fried jalapeños. Meat overload but in a good southern way - Fried pickles: I'm an aficionado and these were one of the best. Significant textured crispy breading of thin pickle chips. - Whiskey flight: you choose from huge list of options. Beware: I was expecting small taster glasses but there are 3 very full shot glasses which is a bit much for one person :-o - Banana pudding milkshake: nice fresh banana flavor the hub loved with booze to boot - Ham and cheese: fried flat puck of fried mozzarella with prosciutto on top. Right up the hub's alley. - Sweet potato tots: sweet and tender inside yet crispy outside - Tall tea cocktail: not too sweet and refreshing - Waitress: helped pick the whiskeys for me since I'm a novice and gave comments on dishes we were considering - Atmosphere: nice decor inside with large bright music-related art to make it pretty upscale but with 80s and 90s music videos playing on the wall - Hours: open late (close when bars do at 2am) for night owl bites  Midlights: - Mac and cheese: fine cheese flavor but didn't care for the thick noodles   Lowlights: - A little hard to find but look for the signs. My phone maps told me it was on 6th but it was off of 5th   Loved this place's character and the food to back it up."}
{"text":"Very good lunch. Husband had a burger with a fried egg & fries. I didn't have much of a choice since I am vegetarian - but the side salad & sweet potato tots were yummy. We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"The deviled egg appetizer is to die for as is the GFY Burger -- an amazing combination of ground beef, foie gras, arugula, apricot marmalade and creole mustard.   Negatives: the music is too loud and they are still building out their dessert menu. I'd still go back for the GFY anytime!"}
{"text":"Holy burger! This place has a great large selection of burgers and craft drinks (say hello to their whiskey bar) to accompany them with! And for dessert, forget regular banana pudding when you can get a spiked banana pudding milkshake! Need i say more?  All their patties are hand ground, each sauce is made fresh in-house, and their buns are baked in North Carolina. Hello, freshness! Their starter menu is huge, they've got a good selection of tacos and wraps, and their burger menu reigns supreme. From a classic Elvis Burger, to one of my favorites the SodaPop (bbq beef, sriracha grilled prosciutto, onion straws, gruyere cheese, chipotle ketchup) and even the Big Will's Breakfast (croissant roll, over easy egg, praline smoked bacon, honey mustard).  The decor in here is funky and cool, with plenty of seating."}
{"text":"My bestie and I rolled up on this spot one random night in the QC, and fell in love at first bite! Stunning decor, tasty food and great prices!  It was truly a great dining experience! Need to do it again ASAP! Would love to do a little date there or just kick it with friends. It wasn't too big, but that's why I liked it! Quaint, cute and comfort food! Lol"}
{"text":"The food is pretty good here, the burgers are creative and fantastic, plenty of cocktail selections even if you're not into whiskey (but certainly not cheap), and the staff is friendly. The wings are good, but it's a burger bar, so don't miss out on a great burger.  The staff was extremely hospitable despite the fact that I had a Falcons jersey on, they made sure I had the game and none of the Panthers fans gave us any grief. Server was extremely polite as we were there for the whole game and stopped ordering shortly after the half. If I lived in uptown, it might be my neighborhood bar."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere at this place!  Even though it's not really a kid friendly place, they have an unofficial kids menu. They gave my girls crayons and paper and they were very friendly!  The food is original and interesting!  The pumpkin spice corn dog was good!  Lots of local brews to choose from.  So happy we found Cow Bell!"}
{"text":"Came in for a late lunch and dig the vibe of this joint! Great music playing! I had the Melt and it was amazeballs! The sweet potato tots are a great side and you can taste the hint of cinnamon on them. I would recommend this place! Everybody needs a little more Cowbell!"}
{"text":"First time I've had a ginger beer drink and it was awesome! We ordered the pretzels and a burger, both were fantastic! Great service, vibe and food!"}
{"text":"Very good!!! Loved the atmosphere! The food was delicious!  The mac and cheese and the sweet potato tots are a must try!!!! Lunch time was a little busy considering the size of the place, but service was fast and friendly!!"}
{"text":"I liked that we were able to sit down right away on a Friday night. Our server was excellent! I forgot her name but everyone working seemed pleasant.   What I liked... +The Mule drinks we had were good +My husband had an old fashioned and he liked it a lot +Sweet potato tots (like everyone else) +Disco fries appetizer(it's not quite poutine so they're smart not to call it that but I liked it) +Spiked milkshake (we split a S'mores into two glasses to share it, which they were happy to oblige) +They remade two of our table's  burgers without complaint and they even brought us new sides  +It's a huge menu: both food and drinks (even though I don't care for the hard char on their burgers, I would go back and try something else) +The bartender made us two extra drinks by accident. They still gave them to us but didn't charge us  +Lots of options for buns for your burger   What I didn't like... -Apparently the men's bathroom was disgusting -The first time they cooked my medium burger it came out well done. That actually happened to all 4 of our burgers but only my cousin and I sent ours back. The second time they brought them back they were cooked correctly on the inside (medium with pink center, etc.) but there was still a very hard hockey puck char on the outside! I don't know how they managed this but it was consistent on all of their burgers  -They had pretzel buns but they weren't salty enough"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! And every waitress in this place is banging HOT! I had the Big Will's breakfast burger cooked medium with their spicest mayonnaise and it was delicious! Their onion rings are hand cut and battered! An outstanding selection of bourbon...You can't go wrong with this place..you'll drop $30 for one person..."}
{"text":"This place is small but looks great on the inside. We had a party of 5 when we came. All of us order burger. The waiting staff was very friendly. Our burgers took and hour to come out. I would expect a long wait if it was packed but there were only about 10 other people there. The burgers weren't good and were over cooked. 2 of us sent them back only to get another over cooked burger. We also order there rum shakes which were very good. It saved the day"}
{"text":"This place is incredible... I LOVE the sweet potato tots. If you love burgers, you MUST go to cowbell"}
{"text":"The burgers are pretty tasty but the portions are rather small. The sweet potato tots are excellent and their drink menu is pretty extensive. I would recommend this place to someone who likes craft burgers and unique flavors."}
{"text":"I have to take a star away at the fact that the parking situation is horrible! We drove around the block at least 3 times before finding a parking space down the block, very inconvenient and frustrating.      The rude hostess which could have possibly been \"management\" had a shitty attitude and I don't think she liked that we told her where we wanted to sit as oppose to accepting her seating assignment. We NEVER let the hostess or anyone sit us where they want, I'm paying I sit where I want.     Things instantly got better the moment Lindsey arrived (the active bartender) and our server. She had a great attitude and was very helpful and friendly. She made recommendations and was very attentive even with a full bar of customers, she was doing it all!    The food was great! The Fried Mozzarella was excellent! Followed by the \"PM BURGER\" a beef patty topped with house made Pulled pork with Guinness cheddar cheese on a pretzel bun. Very good! A bit on the small side, but it was enough.  She ordered the Grilled chicken breast, topped with smoked bacon, iceberg leaf lettuce, roasted Roma tomatoes, fresh sliced avocado and lemon aioli. Delicious! Their hand cut fries are awesome too!    It seems they prefer you sit at the bar but I'm not good at following the crowd. Good food!"}
{"text":"Cool place, but a little tight. I had the gambler burger and my wife had the Carolina. We had sides of the mac & cheese and the onion rings. We both loved the sides. The onion rings had a nice crunchy exterior accompanied with a dipping sauce similar to Outback's blooming onion sauce. The mac & cheese was traditional with a nice baked topping.   The gambler was topped with red onion, BBQ sauce, and an onion ring. The burgers were good, but to be honest the sides outshine them a bit. We agreed that next time we would come for apps and drinks.   Our total was $30 for 2 burgers, an extra side item, and 2 teas."}
{"text":"Maybe I didn't have the standard experience.  Went for a group gathering and they didn't seem to be prepared for us even though all the arrangements had been made ahead of time.  As a result, most of us were made to stand and eat and one server was left to contend with all of us.  Our food had been pre-selected and I'm not sure the burgers that were chosen for us were ones I normally would've picked if given the option.  The food itself wasn't bad, but wasn't something I am dying to go back for.  Sadly, I think the rest of the experience may have affected my enjoyment of the food.  I'm not sure if I'll go back, but if I do, it won't be with a large group."}
{"text":"Not thrilled with our meal here. My bun was cold and dry and my nephew's beef burger was severely overcooked. We got side salads and they were very underwhelming. All in all, totally not worth a $36!!"}
{"text":"Burgers are great and I'm obsessed with the tots! Never had bad service and drinks are great too!"}
{"text":"Full disclosure, I'm not a huge whiskey fan so if you are, the whiskey flights looked like a really great deal for someone looking to try out a few different kinds of whiskey. So definitely try that out if it's your thing.  The first time a friend and I tried to go, we were told we could have a seat within a few minutes, but it would be a 3 hour wait for food. We wound up leaving, but I have no idea what would have caused that kind of delay.  A couple days later we were able to get in. Lots of unique options for burgers, in addition to your standard fare. Was a little disappointed that when our food arrived, our appetizer, salads, and main course all arrived within two minutes of each other so by the time I actually got to the main course it wasn't warm anymore. I ordered onion rings as my side and was a little bummed that there were only three average-sized rings. Not exactly what I expected for something that required an upcharge.  The restaurant itself was pretty loud and the music is generally rock music - a nice mix of new music and some favorites from the 90s - so I don't necessarily recommend it if you intend on having a nice conversation with a friend/coworker/significant other.  All in all a good experience. I may stop in next time I'm in town, but not necessarily at the top of the list."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I are from wilmington NC and came up for the weekend for a wedding. We found cowbell and fell in love from the moment we walked in. The host was so sweet and the ambiance was so warming and friendly  ! Our bloody Mary's were insanely good! And so was our service from our amazing waitress named Amanda. She was so genuine and sweet and worked in a timely manner. She even charged my phone behind the bar for me since it was dead ! The food was awesome. They were only serving brunch but the kitchen let me order a veggie burger that was the best I've ever had!!! If you go here ask for amanda she will take wonderful care of you!    Ashley & chris -"}
{"text":"Cowbell is hands down the best place to go for a burger. I have experienced Excellent service everytime and the quality of the food is impeccable. Cowbell has brought a new light to the iconic American cheese burger with a side. Great drinks, brilliant burgers/ chicken sandwich choices, outside the box side items to complement your entre, and lastly awesome rock'n roll atmosphere. Easily one of my top favorite places to go you can't go wrong with anything Cowbell has to offer."}
{"text":"Venue was great. Nice and quaint. I had the deviled eggs, which were a bit tangy. I also had the gambler w/ mac and cheese. Burger was cooked perfectly, but the mac and cheese was hard. Would recommend."}
{"text":"Had the Carolina burger with onion rings and my sister had the Elvis burger and fries Although I ordered my burger medium it came out very well done and dry. Would go again but can I make a suggestion that the servers come back from behind the bar and look after their tables. Thank goodness for the two guys that were there take up their slack.  Had to ask for refill of beverage and eventually had to ask one of the other servers to ask our server."}
{"text":"This place was suggested to us by a family friend and it did not disappoint! The food was amazing and our waitress Lindsey was super outgoing and welcoming! We sat outside and the weather was amazing. All in all, we loved it!"}
{"text":"We were travelling through on vacation and stopped at this place for a quick dinner.  While service was very slow, they were still pleasant and the food was ok.  I will say the menu makes it sound way more inventive than the actually execution of the food, but it was still decent bar food.  I think on our next trip through I'd try somewhere else...not really good enough to draw me back in since I'm not a regular of the city and want to make the most of the time I'm there.  Also, the cocktails were pretty disappointing...again, sounded great, but execution not quite there.  Long story short, no complaints but didn't live up to the marketing."}
{"text":"Ding-dong. Cowbell time. This is a booshy burger bar that's got a fancy vibe and some great burgers. My advice is to come here hungry. Really hungry. And make sure you go to the gym the following day, unless you want to be a fatboy. I got the Bocaan Bacon burger with onion rings. Everything was delicious. We probably ordered too many apps because we were full before we even finished our burgers. The deviled eggs and Dali fries were great. The service here was better than average. We actually saw the manager going around and helping his staff. Wow, what a difference it makes! I'd say check this place out if you like burgers. It's not the best burger I've ever had, but it was a pretty good burger."}
{"text":"Came here earlier was amazing awesome bartender... told people how great it was and we come and now 2 hours later we still have not eaten.... they are busy but 2 tables sat before us because they knew someone... got here 740 at 955 got food."}
{"text":"Great food - nice place for a casual night - lots of sports on the TV"}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times and the burgers have not disappointed. They have some pretty good adult concoctions as well, the milkshakes are especially a blast, but they are a meal within themselves."}
{"text":"Ventured here on a double date before a Knights Game on a Friday night around 7pm (8 minute walk to BB&T Park and $6 parking at 5/3 Bank Building). The place was hopping but we were seated right away.  At first glance the menu is overwhelming...in a GOOD way. Seriously, you could probably order something new everyday for a month and still not try it all. I settled for a turkey burger, bun-less, with pineapple chutney, sharp cheddar, granny smith, and I think there was bacon on it (I think the name of it was Jimmy's Page, but I'd have to see it again). My boyfriend ordered the Jaws salmon burger, and we both had the cucumber salad for a side. His only comment was that his was too spicy. Mine however was perfect. Great flavors and a unique combo....exactly what I want at a burger spot.  The inside was very trendy. Personally, the music was too loud for me (made conversation tough...), but they play music videos of the songs in the background which was cool. Food is incredible, but atmosphere could use a little toning down.   Our server was excellent, though I'm sorry I've forgotten her name! Looking forward to going back to try something else in the future!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat burgers. I had Lisa Marie with onion rings. This chicken and smoked bacon burger is very delicious. It is juicy and very tasty. I highly recommend this place for chicken or beef burgers."}
{"text":"Heard about this place last time I visited Charlotte, so it went on the list of go-tos for the next visit.   Welp, today I got off the plane from Jersey, got the rental, and headed straight over here. Atmosphere was great, music is on point, and the burgers just made this first visit that much better. I'll have to make it over here for the whiskey flights next time cause the selection is ! Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Okay - so you're probably tired of all the bell references...so instead I will give warnings.  1st Warning: there will be a song/video playing that you will inevitably sing to, tap your foot to or dance to, no matter how little or how much you've had to drink.  2nd Warning: the smell of these burgers cooking alone will make you want to eat large quantities of meat. Vegans included.  3rd: the waitresses and bar mistresses are super fly beautimous - if you are a guy, please don't stare as your girlfriend or spouse will likely hit you. You wouldn't stare at the sun, would you?  4th: this place gets hopping on the weekends - so if you like eating and sitting at the same time - make a reservation!  5th: you will be back for more, but this time dressed as Bret Michaels, leather chaps, cowboy hat and mascara.  This place is super awesome! Give me a Kitchen Sink, the Sinatra and a Boogan's Bacon any day of the week!!! You have been warned! Carry on!"}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere, awesome burgers and beautiful ladies serving drinks... Sounds pretty perfect! Lol"}
{"text":"Ate here for lunch today. Real nice burger selection. Prices were fair. Apps were nice. Service was below average. Would go here again"}
{"text":"I went here for a friend's birthday dinner.  I thought the set up of the place was great, decor, atmosphere all top notch.  The food was great as well, I had the Danny California with the sweet potato tots.  Probably one of the best turkey burgers I have ever had.  I will enjoy a burger of the red meat variety on my next visit.  Their whiskey selection is quite large and the server did a great job every time of letting us know which glass was which as they are brought over in three glass flights."}
{"text":"Bar tender is very nice & friendly.  Lots of choices of whiskey.  Burger is delicious, and of course the huge onion rings, lol"}
{"text":"I've only been here once, but it was a treat.  It was a bit pricey but it was the best burger I've had in years.  Great atmosphere."}
{"text":"This is a great spot - the atmosphere was fun...a nice mix of business diners, energetic friends, and \"local celebrities\".  The bar offers several great local brews and the burger options are unique.  We enjoyed the Dumpling (which was a pork burger with a nice Asian influence...slightly sweet and slightly spicy) and the PM Burger (which was house made pulled pork, Guinness beer cheese, and fried jalapenos all on a burger).  We ordered the sweet potato tots as our side - very good with a dessert-like sweetness to them.  I really enjoyed the 90's rock videos, cool decor, and fun service.  We'll definitely be back to tackle two more unique gourmet burgers!!"}
{"text":"Brunch at a burger and whiskey bar!? You bet!  Atmosphere- Victorian meets rustic! Super trendy, super fun! I felt at home in this casual trendy place! The walls were an awesome mix of fun \"posters\" and then victorian looking wall paper. The ceilings were made up of cool metal tiles! Service-Friendly and fast! When we were there (1 PM on a Sunday afternoon) it was busy; I am guessing because this is their brunch time. However, this did not inhibit the great service we got!   Food- Flavorful! I ordered the brunch burger which was served on a croissant bun and I could not be more happy about that! The burger was medium rare (as I had specified) and perfection! In addition the egg on top was salted and peppered to perfection! I chose the side of hash brown cakes and was in love! My boyfriend ordered the bacon burger! It was a bacon burger for sure; severed withe bacon strips and bacon jam! I sampled a bite and was blown away! Can you say flavor! YUM! He chose fries as his side and they were delicious!  Price- Reasonable. I felt like the price fit the overall feel of the place and the quality was not compromised! We almost chose an appetizer but they were a little steep ($10 for disco fries!). For us two to dine on some delicious burgers it was under $30! BONUS!"}
{"text":"Wow....wow....wow.  When our friends suggested Cowbell, I thought we were going to Cowfish.  My mistake.  We caught a late-ish dinner in this charming bar/restaurant where the decor is as inviting as one would hope.  Music videos from the 80's and 90's play along with the great array of records on the shelves.  We ordered the sweet potatoes croquettes based on someone's recommendation. I am not a huge fan of sweet potatoes, but when Bryan (boyfriend of the year) suggested I try, I gave in.  Um---- where have these been all my life????  Served hot and crispy with honey butter and brown sugar....... They are life changing!!! Then the general manager (who was incredible!) came over and served us complimentary fried mozzarella ..... Which is made from scratch and drizzled with fresh pesto and marinara.  OMG........ Mouthwatering!!!!!  Then Bryan ordered The PM Burger, which was a burger with pulled pork, Guinness beer cheese, and fried jalepenos....... Again, probably the best combination of flavors on a bun I've ever sampled.  Service--- even with a table of 10--- was spot on.  I will happily be making a return visit AND bringing friends!!!!"}
{"text":"Great food and service! I have tried different things on the menu several times and I haven't been disappointed yet. The food is fresh and served hot, the atmosphere is diverse and friendly!"}
{"text":"Always great food and dishes are pretty creative. Good atmosphere and very reasonable for the caliber of food served. Good sized bar and usually live music when I go."}
{"text":"The burger was amazing! Small place but we were there during the afternoon so wasn't too crowded. Bartender was really cool. I don't like whiskey but they had plenty of beer and wine to choose from."}
{"text":"Great food! We went on the same weekend as Charlotte's Pub Crawl so it was uber crowded but we were still able to get a table for 10 within 25 minutes. Jen, our waitress, was great! We had to wait a bit for our food but again they were swamped. All in all.....food, drinks and service were great!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my lunch here!!! I had the jimmy page burger and got the house fries with it. I didn't get a chance to get any of the drinks since it wasnt a lazy Friday and I had to go back to work.  The burger was good for a turkey burger. It was thick and most, but want very meaty if that makes sense. The texture seemed like there was more filler than meat.   I'm convinced of all the turkey burgers I had mine is the best lol!! The only downside of my burger was the bacon. I was a little disappointed since it said candied bacon and I was expecting a thicker cut and more sweetness. I barely tasted the bacon.   However the options for burgers are plentiful and I loved the unique combos. The fries were pretty dang good too. My burger came with pineapple Sriracha that I got on the side, which was more tasty on the fries than the burger. I used the Apple bourbon BBQ sauce on my burger instead and it was amazing. I mean there was a while slice of Apple in my sauce.    I will definitely come back here for lunch, dinner, or drinks especially since the drink menu is so large! If you are a beef and pork eater you will probably enjoy more of the offerings."}
{"text":"This place rules. The decor and vibe makes you want to stay for hours. Whether it's for drinks, dinner or a quick bite, I've never been disappointed at Cowbell.  The service is always incredible (I always sit at the bar because their bartenders are the greatest). I especially love the music that is accompanied by music videos on the tvs around the restaurant. Very unique and fun.  Typically I go for the veggie burger (get the tots on the side - holy yum), but I went in today to find out that it was brunch aka no veggie burgers. After crying to the bartender a bit, I ordered the veggie scramble. Although it wasn't what I wanted, it was incredible! Just the right amount of spice and protein for a early Sunday. I would absolutely order it again.  Thanks Cowbell for being so consistently awesome!!"}
{"text":"Good burgers. They're quite new so still revamping on the menu and staff. Order took a while to come out , granted we had a party of 8. We were seated fairly quickly on short notice. All in all a good place to try again."}
{"text":"This place is in a great location super close to everything in uptown, but you will have to look for a garage, street parking, or uber like we did. At 6pm on a weeknight, we had no issue getting a table. The decor is colorful and edgy and the place has a pretty cool vibe overall.  As for the food, I was actually pretty disappointed in my meal. I ordered the Danny Tacos with a side of the cucumber salad. The tacos are described on menu as having crumbled turkey patty, avocado, smoked habanero cheese, iceberg leaf lettuce, house pico, and chipotle aioli. My issue was the texture. The \"crumbled\" turkey patty was more like mashed turkey and then with the melted cheese on top, it basically turned to turkey mush/pate. There was also way too much of the mush on the small soft tortilla, so everything came oozing out the sides. It wasn't pretty to eat and the flavor was only ok. As for the cucumber salad, it was just a little heavy on the vinegar for my taste."}
{"text":"The restaurant space has been revamped, and feels much larger than Nix.  The bar was pushed back, further from the door, leaving ample room for mingling and table seating, and the vibe is hipper too, with tufted leather chairs and low red lighting.  My favs:  Cowbell Chili & Smoked Cornbread, black bean burger, sweet potato croquettes, which are basically sweet potato donuts balls (or little balls of heaven, as Cowbell calls them), and Dali's fries with garlic aioli, buffalo, Parmesan, and fresh herbs.    I posted a full review on the blog, but these are the highlights."}
{"text":"This afternoon was my first time visiting Cowbell.  First, I loved the ambiance. Nice decor, which was clearly musically influenced, and they played 90s music, along with the music videos, and had TVs with sports. It was also very clean. The service was a bit slow; I'm guessing because they only had one guy waiting & handling the bar & not many workers in the kitchen. I'm guessing that wasn't peak time, so that's why they didn't have more workers. Our waiter did as best as he could. He got our  refills, and he checked on us, too.  Now, I really enjoyed the wings (I had the Sweet Buffalo or whatever the name). They were juicy, and the sauce wasn't typical tasting. I also had the Elvis Burger & fries. The fries were tasty but not the best I've ever had. The burger was okay. I didn't like that the bun was huge, and the patty was very small in comparison. The bun to meat ratio was just off for me. The price wasn't too expensive.  I really didn't know if I should give it four stars or not, but I choose against four stars because the burger, which is supposed to be the crux & namesake of this restaurant, was not superb."}
{"text":"Great place for a great burger. Man these suckers are good. I've had the pleasure of coming here twice and the burgs blew me away both times. I like a little spice atop my perfectly cooked beef and this place delivers. The PM burger is a winner any way you slice it.   The spiked shakes are also pretty darn good. I recommend the mocha which is a blend of khalua, Irish cream and chocolate.   I docked a star for slow service but this was a busy Friday night and they were slammed. One of my favorite burger places along side Bad Daddy's and Auto Burger and Fry Guy's food truck."}
{"text":"Awesome place.  Great burgers and great milkshakes.  Love the atmosphere.  Excellent service."}
{"text":"LOVED this trendy, upscale burger joint in Uptown Charlotte, where my only complaint was the overwhelming number of choice on the menu. After spending more than 10 minutes narrowing down my options, I finally settled on the outstanding NYC Burger, topped with pastrami, sauerkraut and the restaurant's wonderful Cowbell sauce. Served with a delicious side of fries and a cold draft beer from the extensive selection of local craft brews, the meal was about as close to hamburger perfection as you can get.   The service was prompt and friendly, the music just loud enough to hold a conversation over, and the upbeat, exciting atmosphere welcoming for both young families with kids and hip young professionals trying to impress a date. Cowbell is a fantastic addition to the Uptown restaurant scene, and one I hope stays around for a long time to come."}
{"text":"Great place for a Happy Hour.  Nice burgers, fries and good service. Very good for a relaxed Saturday evening."}
{"text":"Cowbell is basically a swanky, more adult Red Robin.. The burgers we very good and the price reasonably high (meaning $12-14) average for a burger.. Service was fast and friendly and the atmosphere was an A+.."}
{"text":"I had the umami burger, sweet potato tater tots and a sugar creek beer for lunch.  This meal could not be more perfect and delicious.  The hamburger was excellent.  It was composed of a soft bun, shiitake mushrooms, and caramelized onions.  Of coarse the meat itself was juicy and flavorful.  The tots, had a slight hint of cinnamon, and were exactly as expected, crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside.  The beer complemented my meal very well, a pale ale I believe, smooth with slight hoppy taste.  Service didn't disappoint, our waiter was very pleasant and helpful."}
{"text":"i usually order takeout from them, and they're extremely courteous and friendly :) Stan even nabbed my tab one day ;) Yay Free Lunch!!!"}
{"text":"Sodapop burger. Let me just say, I've never had such a good burger.  It came to you table and looked a bit small. But then I bit in to it and received and wonderful mouthful of bbq'y deliciousness.  Onion straws? Bacon? Cheese? Bbq sauce? Kill me now. You'd think all these 'standard' burger additions would taste like just that - standard. No. This was off the charts yummy. The burger was a perfect medium rare. Juicy and flavorful. Everything you might ever dream of a burger to be. I can't describe it. It was great.  Big thank you to my waitress, Sam (super cute! Super pleasant! You're the best!) She made my last  night in North Carolina great (flying back to San Fransisco tomorrow).  Thank you Cowbell."}
{"text":"Three stars entirely for the food.  If there was a half star to give, it would be for the cool walls and the 90's music WITH VIDEO that they had running.  The service was... lacking.  Not like anyone was rude, they just weren't present.    The place was active within 20 minutes of us arriving, but not even close to swamped at any point.  When we walked in the door, two staff members said they would be right with us, but there were THREE more parties that showed up and were waiting in line behind us before someone finally came to seat us.  A fourth party came to the door, saw the situation, and moved on.  That's lost revenue, folks.    There were at least three female waitresses and a male supervisor on the floor (plus bar staff), but we NEVER got our waitress to actually come take our order.  We had to flag down the hostess and insist that she take our food order (as she really didn't want to take more than our drink order and was sure our waitress would be with us shortly, for real this time).  We were checked on by our waitress _after_ our food came and we had sent the hostess back to get ketchup, but we didn't our see our server again until we had flagged someone ELSE down and asked for our bill.  We specifically told our server we wanted it all together, but somehow she came out and started trying to hand people their individual orders.  It would have been comical had we not said multiple times that we were in a rush and didn't want to spend an hour doing lunch at 3pm which is what we ended up doing.  I do have to say that the food was great.  One person in our party considered their burger to be a bit too small (they are on the small side, but a serving of meat is 3 oz, so I'm not opposed to keeping it in that range).  As served, they do look petit, but they are thick and juicy which isn't a bad trade off.  The sides were great, the beers arrived full (when they finally did come), and the burgers were cooked as ordered--including my cheese substitution.  My personal complaint would have been that when burgers are topped with mushroom and onion, I expect more than four pieces of each of those toppings.  Seeing it be skimpy upon arrival, I planned, but the toppings felt a little light despite the generous serving of gravy.  Would I go back?  I'm actually pretty undecided.  I'm not a burger girl so I loved that the menu was diverse and long, and the atmosphere would have been great if there were any staff supporting us, but I'm not a burger girl so any place that doesn't wow me isn't going to get my vote.  I still prefer the burgers at Ri Ra's Rooftop Patio..."}
{"text":"This place wasn't bad but for all the hype it could have been better. The burgers are meaty and filling but the menu sounded better than my burger tasted. If I was ordering a plain burger with the usual fixings I would have been impressed. Service was a little slow that day too."}
{"text":"Can't believe no one has mentioned about their brunch. Best meal I had in North Carolina. Although the main food was the fried chicken and biscuits, the grits stole the show. It was so creamy and just melts in your mouth. The portion size was perfect, did not leave you too hungry nor too full. Good price overall and even better service."}
{"text":"This place has been on my list for a while now and finally had a chance to try this out. When I walked into the restaurant one thing I noticed immediately was the volume of the music was a bit too loud. It didn't bother me as much since I placed an order to go, but it could be hard to talk over the music. My order comprised of the Danny California with the Wagyu beef patty and the famous sweet potatoes tots.   The good: I loved the sweet potatoes tots! The portion size was more than enough. My favorite part of it was the dash cinnamon on the tots.The Danny California burger was a must for me since it has avocado and I absolutely love avocado!  The OK: I ordered my burger medium-well, but I feel like my burger was a bit well done and a bit dry. The Wagyu patty (extra $5) didn't seem that special to me and lacked seasoning.   Overall, this place is good for getting drinks after work, especially if you are into whiskey. I would consider come back and try other things on the menu."}
{"text":"If I was rating solely on the menu's descriptions of dishes, this place would be 10-stars. Everything sounds SO good... Hot and creamy Guinness beer cheese, love's sugar dust, blackened beef patty finished with red wine on the grill, sriracha grilled prosciutto, oh my! It all sounds amazing, right?! Unfortunately, nothing we've ordered ever quite delivers the punch we're expecting. Don't get me wrong, nothing here is bad, it's just never as mind blowing as I hope it'll be.   The onion rings or sweet potato tots are both solid side choices. Of the burgers I've tried, the Bruiser (gorgonzola, horseradish, shiitake mushrooms, caramelized onions) and Jimmy's Page (turkey burger with apples, bacon, cheddar, pineapple sriracha) are my favorites. Next time I'm back, I'll probably try my burger of choice \"naked\" (sans bun) as all the bread I've had there is huge and kinda dry."}
{"text":"Awesome food and awesome mule cocktails. They have some great in house recipe cocktails for Moscow mules which are awesome. Also the alcoholic milkshakes are delicious. We always try to take out of town friend and family here. Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Wanted a great burger so I went to this place which seemed to be their specialty. I tried the sweet pot tots and a burger.  Meh.  I ordered medium and it was over cooked.  The tots need a sauce or something.  Too dry. No reason to come back here."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!! Had Sunday late brunch and it rocked!! Nothing like a morning breakfast burger to hit the spot after a great night!!! But hold on enough of the burger the drinks are amazing!  This place is a must!!!"}
{"text":"Downtown area. Address is incorrect. It's on 5th just a few steps from its real address. It is worth looking for. Burgers are fantastic. Can't speak to the other food. Service was top shelf. Lots of TVs for sports viewing. A real repeat spot."}
{"text":"I was in town for business, and decided to check out Uptown. I found Cowbell, and decided to check it out. As a bar, the ambiance, music and art is great. Lots of photos of rock stars, Ziggy Stardust on the TVs, pretty cool. However, as a restaurant, it leaves much to be desired. My burger was cooked ok, but was cold and dry. The bun, an onion roll, was so stale and dry, I should've sent it back. It detracted from the entire burger. All I could taste was BBQ, dry meat and dry bread. I was one of few eating and not drinking. Perhaps I chose poorly."}
{"text":"Great drinks and appetizers but the burgers were a bit of a disappointment. We came during the break between the ncaa games. We got here a bit early and beat the rush. The service was good and the drink/beer options were great. We ordered some apps that were great. The burgers sounded great but were a bit of a letdown."}
{"text":"Decent burger- but unimpressive whisky list is over priced.  Better burgers at many other Charlotte locations - better whisky selection at home."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere with yummy food! I had the fiesta tacos with sweet potato tots.. weird combo but so good. This is a must try restaurant!"}
{"text":"Really good atmosphere. Really good burgers. Sweet potato tots are delicious.   1 star taken off since I came on \"Whiskey Wednesday\" and yet they have no whiskey specials!!"}
{"text":"I love the decor in here - all music related and they play music videos on the tv's, which I love as well as sports stations at the bar tvs.  I like that they play a variety of music styles and genres.  They have plenty of options for burgers and they are pretty tasty and well-made/cooked.  It definitely gets noisy in here and it's pretty tight quarters between the bar and the tables.  Bar-staff are pretty on-point and keep up with you.  It's got a Tryon Street address, but it's the entrance is on 5th St."}
{"text":"I was in town for a convention and came to cowbell burger and whiskey bar for a cocktail event. The interior is SO COOL!! Absolutely loved the decor. The drinks were strong and the appetizers tasty. This is a great venue for a private cocktail event. I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Wow! Great Yelp find!! Tiny spot but great ambience for watching a game, hanging out or just grabbing a bite or drink. It was packed the night we came but well worth the wait. The service was great and the food EXCELLENT!! Massive whiskey selection and solid craft cocktails including beer and wine. Food menu and burger selection was impressive! Totally blown away by the taste and quality of the food. Definitely NOT bar food. Very foodie! Be sure to ask your server about their menu recommendations and trust them when they suggest the special of the day!! I'm still thinking about their food! Soooooo good!"}
{"text":"Wow.  I was excited to take my burger-loving group here because I heard it was so good.  We read the reviews and one person was talking about the \"cold, hard buns.\"  We had a laugh about that.. Whatta ya know? - we had cold, hard buns too!  The place is super cool, the music is good, there are no better wall hangings in all of Charlotte and the service is great too.  If they get their buns right, then this place will be killer!"}
{"text":"Wasn't blown away. I had high hopes from prior reviews . I will say the cocktails and beer selection was great. Husband and I both ordered medium burgers . Both came out well done and super dry. Fries came out soggy and cold. The sweet potato tots tasted like they were cooked the day before , chewy and cold. I won't be back."}
{"text":"As a customer who visited this restaurant quite often I am extremely disappointed in the last few visits (orders frequently wrong) here especially my last visit tonight.  I called in a to go order at exactly 7:45 and was told it would be 15-20 minutes.  Upon my arrival at 8:02 it hadn't been placed yet.  Now I am understanding at this point because accidents happen...however the order was placed at 8:06 and I didn't receive my food until 8:42.  Again I would have been fine with this had the manager not come out and been a complete jerk.  His attitude when he told me \"well technically you have only been waiting 26 minutes\" was unacceptable.  Yes my meal was comped as it should have been and again accidents happen but the managers disregard and attitude coupled with the last few visits being less than satisfactory AND when getting home seeing that my order was WRONG has turned me away from this restaurant for good.   Oh well...bad daddy's it is!!"}
{"text":"A decent selection of decent burgers. The address says Tryon but the front door is actually on 5th. The bar tender tried to charge me an extra $2 for my burger for some reason.  I then showed her the menu price and she corrected it.  Not sure if it was intentional or a simple mistake.  It won't be a place that I rush to get back to."}
{"text":"Each and every time I eat at Cowbell I am more and more impressed with this place.  My typical go-to burger here is the Danny California (turkey) but I've also had the Carolina (beef).  Both burgers are stellar and worth trying out.  The sweet potato tots are some of the best in Charlotte.  For those interested in an appetizer, try the pretzels.  You won't be disappointed!    The ambiance has a hipster vibe with a rock n roll twist.  One TV plays nothing but old music videos, which i love.  They have a nice bar with a respectable beer list.  The waiters and waitresses have been impeccable every single time I've been here.  All in all a solid restaurant that I recommend to anyone asking me for a \"good burger joint\" in the area."}
{"text":"Popped into this place for brunch. It looks like brunch is a new offering they have, and it didn't disappoint! I had the sausage, egg and cheese biscuit and the sausage patty was delicious.  Good bloody marys too! Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Nice place to grab a casual dinner or after-work drink. Personal favorite is the winehouse chicken sandwich with the fried corn as a side."}
{"text":"+2.5 stars  Service is lacking. All the workers hang out in the back corner and wait for a customer to show up and then run over to the hostess counter. This happened at least 8 times during my meal, quite inefficient.  The manager or shift leader was sitting at the bar for so long I thought he was a customer himself...   As for food we got the turkey burger. Do NOT get this. The patty tasted like mush, either it was raw or just mixed with too much flour or white bread even? Honestly tasted like soggy white bread... Sent it back for a beef patty well done. It came back medium well and was delicious. This place tends to cook things under. Fries were good and the Stanley nuts dessert was great (fried sweet potato cake donuts with ice cream and a sweet frosting). Lots of whiskey and beer selection.  I'd come back here for snacks like fries:tots, desserts and beer but definitely the place to sit at is the bar. Much better burgers and service in LA, maybe I'm spoiled :P"}
{"text":"Burger was ok, but not wait an hour after you order to get it good. The bottom bun was really soggy & fell apart. Grits were just OK. Service was pleasant, though."}
{"text":"I went in with one goal, I wanted fries. And not some gross soggy fries i wanted good fries. And man does Cowbell have good fries. They are perfectly season and have a little bit of Parmesan cheese to make them even more interesting. I got the Big Will's Breakfast Burger without the honey mustard and on a brioche bun. It was fantastic! I always hate when i go to a burger place and they give me some wimpy flat burger, Cowbell is definitely not that place. My burger was perfectly medium and so juicy. With the over easy egg this burger definitely does not disappoint. My friends got the Danny California with a Black bean burger and thought it was delicious. She also had the sweet potato tots which are delicious. They are much sweater than normal sweet potato fries so be warned there. Overall it was a great experience and will definitely come back whenever I am craving a great burger."}
{"text":"Came on a Saturday night, sat down at the bar. Ordered Asian wings as an appetizer, I got the BBQ chicken salad, and my boyfriend got a burger with fries. Wings were delicious-- ranch and blue cheese were homemade too! Salad was great, the BBQ chicken was very tasty. Burger was huge and prepared perfectly. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"A group of girlfriends went here a few weeks back on a Friday and the food was delicious. I got the turkey burger (I can't remember the name of it) and fries and each of my girlfriends got something different. The only thing one of the complained about was the macaroni and cheese but other than that everyone was satisfied. In particular one friend had the cucumber salad and it was very delicious. The dressing in which they use is what makes the salad so good. The only thing I'd add is a gluten free bun. But otherwise it was all very good."}
{"text":"If you're hungry definitely don't come here. Prepare to wait for hours. Good luck! Worst burger I've ever had. Literally headed to McDonalds. Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"Had the GFY burger and was blown away! Perfectly cooked, and absolutely delicious. It's a juicy beef patty topped with prosciutto and fois gras and it was amazing . I sat at the bar and the bartender was friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Burger is great!!! But review is for unhappy , non smiling bargirl who when I asked how Immigrant song cocktail is just said ; Manhattan' walked away, never explained beer I ordered. Stood on other side of kitchen door texting. I know a girls got to eat but sat at bar ate, I was dry no notice to that. After I had enough I asked manageress for check. I'd go back and sit a table. She may wear short shorts now but in 20 years when she cant get work  she'll need to change her attitude.,"}
{"text":"Do not make the mistakes that I have made.   Do not go to cowbell and order a salad. You will regret it when you see everyones tacos and sandwiches.  Went with a group for lunch and not wanting to have a Friday slump ended up ordering an $11 (meatless) salad. So not worth the price tag.   The atmosphere was very cool though and everyone elses food looked good, so I would definitely go back and try something else!"}
{"text":"Overall, this place is ok for me but it wouldn't stop me from never coming back here again. We got sat right away and service was pretty good overall.   They have a large selection on the menu. I got the burger with chili-no bun or cheese. It was delicious and cooked well to my liking. I got the fries as my side item and they came out hot and crispy. Everyone else was pretty happy with their meals as well except for my husband. My husband's burger was pretty small compared to all the extra bread that was in it.   The reason why I rated it 3 stars is that the bathroom was not clean at all. They have the type of bathrooms that are single use. I walked in and there wasn't any paper towels. Usually not a big deal but for it to be a 1 bathroom room it's really not that hard to upkeep. The other thing that seriously grossed me out was that it was obviously not attended to in a while because the trash was filled to the way top and it was so full that there were feminine products all at the top. There was paper towels also just thrown on the floor. Super messy and a turn off."}
{"text":"Great overall experience- drinks and entree were both delicious and the service was courteous"}
{"text":"Let's just get this out of the way: the sweet potato tots are very, very good. Seriously, they are something special. If you do go here, don't make the mistake of not ordering them. And if you do order them, don't make the mistake of putting them anywhere near the off-brand ketchup they'll provide you with.    Ultimately though, I think this illustrates what's amiss at cowbell -- it just feels confused. Is cowbell a casual restaurant, or a bar? Their menu is very \"creative\", with some burgers which are definitely exceptional and many others which fall flat. The menu is largely standard pub fare, with a pastiche of more exotic ingredients thrown into every other dish. The restaurant itself reinforces this trend: inside there's quite literally a bar in the middle of an otherwise unremarkable mid-sized burger joint.   In the end, although I enjoyed my time at cowbell, it's not a very reliable place to get food and didn't stand out much as a bar in an area with so many of them."}
{"text":"I was here visiting for a day trip and walked in. The service was great, the food looked nice I just wasn't impressed by the taste."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good but they have no parking and it's not convenient unless you're already in walking distance. Its a small place and their theme is awkward as you look at what's on the walls. But all things considered, i think it was ok and their prices were fair."}
{"text":"I was in Charlotte on vacation staying downtown and decided to get a burger. I hadn't had a burger in months. I went on Yelp and this place got great reviews so I decided to give it a try. This place has one of the best burgers I've had! I had their bacon burger. It was so good and the meat was moist. It was also very well seasoned.  Every bite was absolutely delicious! I ended up ordering another one two days later. I also got my family members a burger - the melt and Turkey burger. They too thought their burger was delicious and was glad I recommended the place."}
{"text":"I stopped here for a meal in between places during a pub crawl and had THE best corn dog I've EVER had! And the best part?? There's no stick! So no weird taste wood taste. I know I'm not the only one. Seriously, it was amazing! I halved the sweet potato tots and Parmesan fries with a friend and both were absolutely delicious! You're welcome."}
{"text":"Review Summary: Get yourself the sweet potato tots NOW! Everything else is just decent. I stopped in for lunch today and ordered the PM Burger, which comes topped with pulled pork, beer cheese, and deep fried jalapenos. The burger patty itself was cooked perfectly to medium as I asked but was surprisingly a little dry and lacked flavor on its own. The onion Kaiser bun was okay but nothing special either. The toppings on the burger were what made it good though. The pulled pork added solid bbq flavor but was also a little dry unfortunately. The beer cheese was awesome, and balanced the bbq pork and beef patty perfectly. The deep fried jalapenos were limited in number and weren't breaded very much (which I'm glad about), and they provided a decent level of spice and another complimentary flavor. The toppings made the burger pretty good but not great; if the bun and meat quality had been better this burger would've been killer! The best part of the meal was by far the sweet potato tots! I love sweet potato fries, and these were probably the best I've ever had. They were sweeter than most places with a hint of cinnamon, crispy outside but with a normal texture in the middle- outstanding! The service was decent and my food came out quickly. The atmosphere seemed like it would be pretty cool, especially at night, and the location has a very large bar but not a ton of tables, which I guess should be expected from a place with \"Whiskey Bar\" in its name. One last piece of advice to totally drive the point home: order the sweet potato tots; don't even consider another side. Yes, they're that good and were definitely the highlight of the meal."}
{"text":"Great selection of burgers and whiskey. Good service as well. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Food and service are always great. I love the local beer selection. All the burgers are great and for your side I recommend the sweet potato tator tots. The sinatra is an epic appetizer option."}
{"text":"Seriously good burgers! Love being able to walk uptown for lunch and this place has a creative burger list and an Elvis complex which means awesome food of course. I was tempted by 3 dishes especially, the buffalo chicken sandwich, \"Vince's Cowbell\", the NYC burger with pastrami and swiss and the fact they will turn any salad into a wrap I was digging the BBQ chicken salad/wrap.   I went NYC burger with no saurkraut and loved it. Have to get sweet potato tots as the side, tremendous. The burger is slightly smaller than the bun but didn't feel bready and was a the perfect size for lunch.   My buddy had the Danny California Turkey burger with avocado and he was seriously impressed. He got the side salad. His wife was on him about diet but this was a pretty solid healthy choice. Service was quick and attentive. Going back here sooner than later for one of the other two choices I was looking at this time but didn't try."}
{"text":"Food wasn't that great but whiskey was on point! I did the business class whiskey fight and loved it! You get to choose different brands of whiskey based on the flight level (like airline seats) and then you get 3 shots (1 of each) and there you have it!"}
{"text":"The wife and I were in Charlotte for a concert and went on the hunt for a local, non-chain place to grab lunch before we made the trek back to RVA.  After a quick perusal of our trusty Yelp app, we agreed on Cowbell and were off.   While downtown, parking for Cowbell is a breeze as there is a parking deck just around the block.  We got there a little before noon and were seated right away.  The menu is, literally, all over the place (in a good way).  While they, obviously, have an incredibly diverse selection of burgers, they also have wings, tacos, salads and a respectable chicken sandwich section for those that may not be in the mood for a burger.   Based on the server's recommendation, we started with \"The Sinatra\" (fried mozzarella with sliced prosciutto, fresh basil, and tomato sauce).  While you wouldn't think that a little bit of salty ham could profoundly impact fried cheese, but it was a very welcome change of pace that certainly changed the flavor profile and was a solid compliment to the mozzarella!   For entrees, the wife went with the \"Dumpling Burger\" (Asian pork burger, hoisin glaze, slaw, and Sriracha aioli), but admitted that it was better in concept than execution.  She felt that the glaze was overly salty and overpowered what could have been a really tasty (and unique) pork burger.  The sweet potato tots that she got as her side; however, were out of this world!  A nice sugary sprinkle really took the crispy pockets of mashed sweet potato to new heights.   I opted for \"Big Will's Breakfast Burger\" (beef burger served on a croissant roll with an over-easy egg, praline smoked bacon, honey mustard, lettuce and onion) and was very, very pleased.  The burger was nice and juicy, and once the yolk of the egg broke, it took the flavor up a notch.  The praline bacon was awesome, smoky with a slight sweetness that wasn't lost amongst everything else that was going on in my mouth.  I selected the french fries, but again at the server's suggestion, went with them \"Dali Style\" with Sriracha aioli.  Awesome heat and a great step up in flavor profile for standard french fries.   All in all, a great burger joint that I can see being VERY popular for late night after the \"Whiskey Bar\" part of their namesake starts flowing.  Will definitely stay on our list of recommendations for folks in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Order a burger and a spiked milkshake, bask in 90's rock/alternative throwbacks. This restaurant and bar is dimly lit and decorated in Lennon and The Beatles inspired art. It is spacious with plenty of tables. The wait staff is attentive. The noise levels are medium to high, think that of a dive bar. It is fun and quirky with plenty of whiskey to choose from. It's a decent place to grab dinner with friends, maybe not brunch with your conservative mom."}
{"text":"Great place, fun atmosphere, friendly staff.  Casual environment with great food. Definitely a fun place to hang out and enjoy a burger."}
{"text":"Rock 'n roll, burgers and whiskey. I dig all three of those things.  Cowbell is a product of the same people who brought us Mortimer's and Leroy Fox. This burger joint looks nothing like its predecessor Nix. Hip decor and tremendous 80s/90s music videos greet you when you walk through the door.   The most difficult challenge you may face here is narrowing down your meal choice. On the app side: I recommend the Fried Mozzarella. Make sure you add the pesto and prosciutto for a just a couple bucks more. Yes, I'm in an open relationship with fried pickles, but I've had hit or miss experiences here with them. Sometimes they are just out of this world. Other times, they are way too salty and overcooked. Proceed at your own risk.  My current burger of choice: the Bruiser. It's a blackened beef patty, onion bun, Gorgonzola, roasted mushrooms, lettuce and caramelized onions. Money.  If burgers are not your thing, Cowbell also has a fantastic grilled chicken sandwich called the Winehouse- honey wheat bun, arugula, roasted red pepper, smoked habanero jack and honey mustard.  Now I'm about to get crazy on you with what side item to pick- get a salad with the homemade poppy seed dressing. I know, I'm telling you to get a salad at a burger joint. Trust me... that dressing is beyond amazing. The sweet potato tots are great, too.  Cowbell also has a contraption that makes a giant ice ball for your cocktail... if you're into that kind of thing. It's pretty cool.  Staff is super friendly. The dining area isn't real big. There's usually a wait at peak times... but it's worth it if you have the time. If the tables are all taken... grab a spot at the bar!"}
{"text":"Went here with two of my friends before we watched the Hornets game.   Good food. Decent service. Bathroom sucked. Drinks...pretty good.  We all got a burger. I forgot now what we ordered but I remember being the last one to finish my food. My buddies just eat much faster than I do so I'm guessing the enjoyed the food.  My chocolate porter drink was great! Overall, decent place to check out. Yeah, check it out."}
{"text":"I wrote a generic review before based on the tomato soup and grilled cheese (which was good..) But now I can write a real review because I ate there several times... and wish that I could fly back to Charlotte on the regular many more times to go eat there..  When you walk in during lunch time, this place is always buzzing. It's busy, and fun and there are music videos playing on the large screens to make you feel nostalgic. The staff have always been attentive and pleasant and I loved this place.   This is another one of those situations though, where I really wanted to try something different, but I just couldn't. I was IN LOVE with their black bean burger!!! I have tried many a black bean burger and this one was by far my favorite concoction. The texture is amazing and the feta cheese is a nice touch. Pair that up with their sweet potato tots that are lightly dusted with a cinnamon sugary flavoring.. OMG.. it's like heaven in my mouth.   I am not kidding when I say that I want to hop in my car and take the 8 hour drive just to go an eat one of those black bean burgers with tots... if you go there please eat one for me, so I can at least live vicariously through you doing so. NOMMMMMM...."}
{"text":"This is a decent place to go with coworkers for drinks and dinner.  It is a good alternative to blackfin which is around the same uptown area.  They have a decent selection of beer, and very unique styles of burgers.  Beware of the burgers that come with egg on top because they cook it sunny side up, and my coworker and I had some stomach issues the night & day after.  I would suggest to get the egg over medium just to be safe.  Other than that issue everything else was great.  The wait staff are very kind, and attentive even in busy times.  The music is great with 60s-90s rock music.  I will prob"}
{"text":"When I went to Cowbell, I really dug the vibe. The musician pictures on the walls, the waitresses seem cool, the menu looked pretty promising as well with a wide variety of signature burgers...but when I got the food, it just feels flat, just expected more out of the food. The burgers are just alright and not as savory as I expected. The mac and cheese side was a bit too oily and greasy. I also had the disco fries was a Montreal style poutine; now I'm from Montreal and I didn't expect it to be authentic poutine but I expected it to be decent. It wasn't as the gravy wasn't warm and the cheese curds were lacking. As a whole, its a decent place to eat but could be a lot better."}
{"text":"Extremely cool atmosphere and a very solid burger. The bartender was cool, knowledgable, and made us feel at home. Atmosphere & Staff = 5 Stars and the Food was a solid 4. I would recommend this to anyone visiting downtown and looking for a great lunch spot."}
{"text":"The food was way too salty! I ordered the California burger and apple croquettes. Deep fried and salty are my only memories of this meal... And not in a good way."}
{"text":"This place was the cat's pajamas. I highly recommend the Sodapop burger and sweet potato tots. The burger had an intense amount of flavor... bbq beef patty, sriracha grilled prosciutto, crispy onion straws, roma tomatoes, gruyere cheese, and soy sauce. Read that again! Is your mouth watering? Mine was when I read the menu.   And I will never forget about the tots... they were cooked to perfection then topped with a light brown sugar coating. So good. So life-changing. Go!"}
{"text":"Love this place!! Great vibe with great food and the staff is on point. Def try the new melt they added to the menu when u go. It's 2 patties 3 slices of bread, American and Swiss cheese, grilled onions and cowbell sauce and it's amazing! Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"I ate at Cowbell last Saturday before a performance at Booth Playhouse.  I have to say it surpassed my expectations!  The Good: I ordered The Bruiser-beef patty with gorgonzola, roasted shitake mushroom and a horseradish cream sauce.  It was pretty incredible. I would definitely recommend it.  I also was surprised by how much I enjoyed the cucumber salad as my side. It was heavy on the cumin but I just so happen to be a huge fan.  The appetizers were ordered were also great: fried pickles were a hit and that fried ham and cheese with prosciutto and pesto was out of this world. You seriously have to get that.  The Not So Good: They were out of Basil Hayden, my favorite bourbon, so I tried the Baker's instead. It was very good. They were also out of the peach liqueur in the drink my friend wanted so she got wine instead. Not a deal breaker, just a little frustrating. I tasted my husband's burger, The Elvis, and it was very bland.  The Bruiser was about 50 times better. The fries were also unremarkable.  All in all it was a fun, casual and delicious dinner. I would definitely go back for a casual meal with a small group before hitting the town!"}
{"text":"Great turkey burger and good beer selection. Service was great and the atmosphere was very comfortable. Artwork on the walls was mostly dedicated to musicians. Worth checking out for sure."}
{"text":"Probably one of the most unique burger places I've ever been to.  It was strangely empty, but the place looked pretty nice and the service was super friendly.  The selection of burgers was a little overwhelming, as they had at least 5 different burgers I wanted to try, but I went with one of their most popular one with their zesty cheese, bbq pulled pork, and fried jalapenos ontop all on a pretzel bun and yes, it was as good as it sounds. Overall, it was just a really really good burger.  It was cooked exactly to preference and they have a variety of sides including french fries seasoned with Parmesan cheese, large crispy onion rings, and sweet potato tater tots.   I had a look at their whiskey selection and although it was a little pricey for me, they had one of the largest selections. I sometimes wonder if the bold flavors of the burger would pair well with the whiskey, but the option of being able to have a scotch or a burger is always nice.  If you're looking for a unique burger, Cowbell is definitely one of a kind."}
{"text":"Awesome place to go when visiting downtown Charlotte. Great atmosphere and drinks, especially the whiskey selection. The food was excellent, the best part of my meal was the sweet potato tots. They were both sweet and savory, but not too sweet."}
{"text":"We came here last night for a bachelorette party, and were about a half hour late due to some unforeseen circumstances, Cowbell was nothing but accommodating and had great and attentive service!! Both the milkshakes and burgers were delicious. The restaurant had a great aura to it too!! Happy customers, we will be back."}
{"text":"Great place for a burger. Tried the sweet potato tots after the waitress recommended them and they did not disappoint. The whiskey was overpriced ($14 for a small pour of Makers 46), but the food was fantastic and the waitress was very nice."}
{"text":"They have some really good juicy burgers. I I can't remember the name but I tried the one with the apple and it was good. The umami burger was good and the sides were good too. The cheesy corn was soooo good. I enjoyed everything here EXCEPT the LOUD friggin music. My friends and I couldn't hear anything in our convo. One star off for the music."}
{"text":"Easy 5 stars.  I'm surprised I haven't reviewed this place yet.  Service is spectacular, perfect happy hour location, and price's reasonable.    Usually come here once a week or so after work to grab a beer or two.  All the food I've had here is really solid.  I usually get apps to go with the beer.  Sliders are perfect.  Fries are great.  Mozzarella sticks are always solid.    Gotta love the pictures everywhere as well.  Keep rockin'!  dmo out"}
{"text":"A classmate recommended this place to me and it was certainly a hit. The DJ is dope af, plays all the latest hits to keep the crowd with a little head nodding as you enjoy your food and or drinks. The bartender was also very knowledgeable on the menu and the drinks, her name was Bria, do check her out. No cover, nice ambiance, good service, great food, I will certainly come back when I'm back in the area."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! Absolutely one of the best burgers I've ever had. Those sweet potato tots are to die for. Several items are marked as spicy, but I don't recall the symbol next to the burger I ordered and it definitely was spicy. Luckily the waitress kept my drink filled the whole time.   Really cool atmosphere, definitely fits in downtown Charlotte. Obviously it's hard to find parking, but if you want to spend a night downtown this is the place to eat. Its sophisticated but not too pricey. Will eat here again."}
{"text":"3.5 stars, rounding up.  A little more upscale than the former occupant, Nix, Cowbell offers a variety of specialty burgers and dogs.  They are also incredibly popular, judging by the crowds at just before noon on a weekday.  I've been there twice and have tried both a burger and a dog.  I have to admit that I'm partial to their dogs, since their burgers are just a bit too massive for me.  The Mexicali dog is pretty big as well, but the flavor is dynamite.  It's served in a pretzel roll and topped with pico, avocados, and chipotle aioli.  It definitely satisfied my craving for something different...and spicy!   For sides, I've had both their mac 'n cheese and fries.  I'm definitely a mac 'n cheese snob, and wasn't really fond of theirs.  It was too cheesy without enough pasta.  But I loved their fries.  They were crispy and topped with Parmesan, and I ate almost the entire portion.    Service was quick and efficient.  And I liked that either the manager (or owner?) came over to say thanks for coming and he hoped we enjoyed their food.    I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Being from out of town:    Pros: Burger and tacos were decent.   Cons: Service was TERRIBLE,  not once checked on; appetizer forgotten, order wrong, and something as easy as a request for ketchup forgotten (accomplished by approaching the bar and asking for).   Overall, maybe it was a bad night and poor staffing. If given the same scenario, be prepared to wait for an extended period of time and ready to self serve."}
{"text":"I was staying nearby at the Marriott and saw this place on Yelp and decided to stop in for a quick lunch.  The staff was very friendly and was happy to offer suggestions from the menu.  I ended up getting a turkey burger on sourdough bread and it was very good.  They had lots of drinks to choose from, but it was the middle of the afternoon so I just had a soft drink.  I would have loved to had time to go back and have a drink though, so next time I am in town I will make sure I stop back."}
{"text":"Well I have made a return trip to Cowbell.  I don't know if I was drunk during my last visit or if the food has gone that far down the hill, but this was a totally different experience.    This update would be 2 stars, but that burger was cooked a perfect medium and tasted pretty good even though the bun was smushed and chewy."}
{"text":"Do you hear that? The bells are ringing! The Carolina definitely rung my bell today. I just had it with some side salad and thousand island dressing. It was great! Like I told my friend Ryan, it's actually better than the BLT steak burger I had at BLT Steakhouse two lunches ago.  The beef patty was cooked just right - medium rare of course. I could tell it was good meat. And the warm, soft buns... Yes, they were good too. The chili slaw that distinguishes the Carolina sandwiches? Oh, man, they're good too! So bottom line, nothing bad to say about it. It was even the right size for me to hold the whole thing and bite through unlike some high end sandwiches that gets too messy if you try to do that.  Now, service? Yes, it's just as important as the food in many cases. And this place did not disappoint. The crew was hard working, serious but friendly and nice. Most importantly, they weren't too intrusive. Very important for me. So, yeah, although Ryan picked this place because it's connected to his office building, I will be back for more. Maybe I'll try all of them."}
{"text":"Bon jovi, Better Than Ezra,  Foo Fighters, Van Halen, 3-11??? You can't get much better than that.    I convinced my co-workers to try this place out with me for the first time.  I've walked past it enough that I thought it was time.  They were nervous about trying something new, but oh were we happy that we did.  The place has that leathery lounge feel with an element of rich/money flare.  Tables are stacked close together with booths lining the walls. Very small.  We were a party of 7 so our wait at 12:00 was about 10 min.  (They don't take reservations)   With 80 hair band Van Halen playing softly in the background we JUMPED (go ahead and Jump!) into ordering.  My Danny California burger was good....spicy but good.  Nice thick piece of meat! I also got the cucumber salad and it was very good.    Prices are no joke, though.  My burger was a whopping 12 bucks.  0_o.   That's all I am going to say about that.    Great option to have for lunch when slaving away at work.  Totally loved all the music and the videos that they played!!"}
{"text":"I need more Cowbell!  I'm sure you are dazzled by my creativity...but not nearly as dazzled as I am by the new Uptown burger joint Cowbell.  Their location is pretty bold, located just a few storefronts down from Basil and Dandelion Market, Cowbell had to be good to stand up to those two Charlotte staples.    We've visited Cowbell a few key times for dining in Charlotte, once on an early Thursday afternoon and again for a late Saturday night dinner before a show.  Upon the second visit, it was clear that they maintain consistent and high quality service.    The hostess and servers we had both times were friendly, helpful, and outgoing.  There was no quick glancing down at a pad of paper when we asked about the beer list and they asked which type I would like when I ordered a Maker's on the rocks.  It is impressive for your servers to be as knowledgeable as your bartenders. They also have these delightful ice spheres...it makes you feel just as excited as a five year old with a swirly straw.  The drinks are very reasonably priced...another great example of \"you get what you pay for\".  Plus the variety of choices are huge...if you want it...they should have it.   Moving on to the food. Again the service staff shines in the ordering process.  The recommendations we received both times were absolutely delicious.  Don't you dare leave that place without trying to the fried pickles.  The thickness of the pickle slices, the excellent batter that created one of the best crunches I've bitten, and of course a light but delicious ranch dressing makes this a dish you absolutely cannot pass up.   The drinks and the pickles are just a tease until you get to the burgers, chicken sandwiches, and hot dogs.  If you are a burger lover...this is your place.  The menu will please frat boys looking for the basic cheeseburger to foodies who will fawn over the Umami or Asian Burger.  The quality of meat is outstanding and I've never had one cooked improperly. Another interesting characteristic is that despite the huge variety of ingredients some burgers have, the construction and presentation of the burger is actually quite sophisticated.  The kitchen staff does an excellent job with plating and each dish I've had looks gourmet.  And do not forget the Mac & Cheese, you will absolutely not be disappointed.   Now here's the kicker...I've rarely seen anything on the menu that tops $10...and this includes entrees with side.  No joke. High quality food, great drinks, fantastic service...and you can get out of there full and a little tipsy for about $25.  I'm impressed...and you will be too!  Oh! And the only reason I did not give 5 stars was the absence of a dessert menu.  Womp Womp.  Oh well, hopefully they will have one soon!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is cute. The staff is very nice & take care of you. The food... wasn't too much flavor."}
{"text":"First tried it on a Wednesday evening after work.  Not too crowded, but we had 6 so we made a reservation anyway.  Service was great and food was even better.  We ordered a few appetizers (pretzels, twiggy's, and the Sinatra).  Pretzels are great for sharing and they came out hot!  Twiggys we got grilled I wasn't overly impressed, but again, good for sharing.  The Sinatra (breaded mozzarella) was by far the most delicious, but only comes with three pieces so we had to split them... I could've eaten a whole plate by myself.  As for our meal, I ordered the Jimmy's Page... Turkey burger, apples, cheese, pineapple salsa, DELICIOUS.  and the sweet potato tots are heavenly!  I will definitely be back again soon, oh and they have spike milkshakes which sadly I was too full to try!"}
{"text":"One of the only places in the city you can get FoieGras and it's on a burger! This place is always delicious and they have some of the best mac and cheese in the world. My favorite side is the sweet potato tots, with a little honey mustard they are little golden nuggets! We always end up spending more than we anticipated because the whiskey selection is so great. We will be back again soon."}
{"text":"This place is great!  Friday night, very busy, no wait for a table?! That was exciting.  The staff is very friendly and helpful.  This was my first visit and the waitress was able to spend time answering all of my questions about items on the menu.  There was really no wait to order or receive food which is a huge plus on a busy night.   The atmosphere is nice.  Very trendy decor throughout the restaurant.  The bar area is beautiful and chandelier lighting was a perfect touch.  My friends ordered an appetizer: fries with gravy, cheese, mushrooms, & onions.  I usually don't like this type of item, but tasted it anyway and it was delicious!  I was really impressed.  They have a huge selection of alcoholic beverages, almost overwhelming!  The Pineapple Express burger was so wonderful! The only thing I didn't like was the BBQ sauce.....stay away from it!! Awful! Onion rings, corn, and especially sweet potato puffs=sooooooooo yummy!!  Happy I finally got to try this place."}
{"text":"One of my locals so I'm an advocate. However food is inconsistent at times. That being said when you get the good time which is the majority you are blown away from these creative burgers with many options!!!  Go here!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best burgers I have ever eaten! I love the decor and the music they were playing. The server was so helpful and a delight to have been waiting on us!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here several times and feel qualified now to say the food and service is fantastic. I've had the umami burger and breakfast burger - both times perfectly cooked. The patty looks small but it's dense  and you can tell the meat is high quality. Sweet potato tots or onion rings are a solid accompaniment. Waitresses have always been friendly and on point w service. My only wish is that lunch specials were available!"}
{"text":"Post work snack with friends here on NYE. I had the Disco fries, which are a great compliment to coat your stomach prior to drinking. How I never noticed this place, I have no idea. Our bartender Lindsey was very lively and attentive. She sang at times and managed to chat it up with everyone while keeping the drinks flowing, food moving, and everyone happy. She spoke to everyone who came in the door and was simply really good at her job. I had a Peach something drink and stopped after that, as I had a slight buzz and this was my first stop for the evening. Their drinks are a little pricey at $12 average, but I suppose worth it. I'll be returning to taste more of their food menu. Cowbell is a gem hidden in plain sight."}
{"text":"Came after a ballet at Blumenthal- SO delicious! Awesome atmosphere, great service, awesome drinks. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"BAD BEER, BAD BURGERS, NAD SERVICE   We had high hopes for this place however we were quite disappointed. The beer was off, kind of tasted like the tap lines hadn't been cleaned in months. Our medium burgers were well done. Comments to our waitress were met with a \"I'm sorry about that\" but made no attempt to fix things.  Perhaps she couldn't understand us because the music was too loud.  Go to the Dunhill, see Pete at the bar and have an old fashioned."}
{"text":"I was craving a cocktail, specifically a whiskey cocktail, so we decided to try Cowbell Burger & Whiskey Bar. I was underwhelmed by my Manhattan, unfortunately. It was a little too sweet, and I think they skimped on the whiskey. I ordered the Danny tacos for dinner, which were pretty good. I like the music-themed decor as well. Overall, it was good experience, but I'm probably going to try another spot for drinks/dinner next time I am in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Cowbell is my steady Eddie for a good burger uptown.  There is a lot of variety in the menu so it's easy to please a group with varying tastes and I've never been disappointed in anything I've ordered.  My go to is the dumpling burger or the buffalo chicken sandwich.  Sometimes the chicken is a bit over cooked, but the great sauce makes up for it.  The sides are good, if you are watching calories, give the naked burger with cucumber salad a go - leaves you satisfied without feeling over stuffed - good to have options like that in a burger joint!"}
{"text":"I went there today with my daughters and it was ok ! I was expecting more .driving by often and always thinking about giving it a try I finally made it . The female server Alex was very efficient, she gave us great service. The wings we had were good, so were the onion rings. But, the burger wasn't the highlight of the meal; or the fries, or the cucumber salad . side .i was craving a good burger and I thought this place would do it for me ."}
{"text":"Excellent food, fantastic service. Wish I'd caught the name of our waiter so I could give him mad props. We had a great time. Busy place but still got us out in plenty of time for our show at Blumenthal. Totally will go again next time we are in town."}
{"text":"What a great place! My friend and I found this place on yelp and wanted to give it a try after reading the awesome reviews. The beers were amazing, the good was tasty, and the atmosphere was fun and unique! It was very loud inside, while that is part of the atmosphere, it made conversation difficult. If I come back to Charlotte, I will be back!"}
{"text":"Went on a snowy night in Charlotte. And sat at the bar to be quick service.  The food was awesome!!! I had the high ground chicken sandwich with the onion rings and my gf had the Elvis burger.  Both were perfect in every way   I will return!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  My brother and I came here about 2 months back.  I had the Big Bell burger and I must say it's one of the best I've ever had.  My brother had the Jimmy's page and he said it was delicious.  They also have an amazing beer selection.  I had the Birdsong Higher Ground IPA and it went perfectly with the burger.  We then hung out there for most of the night to watch the NBA game, and after having a few more drinks, we decided we were hungry and wanted some munchie food.  We then had the Disco fries and Whistle Stop sliders, both of which were really good.  I highly recommend this place if you happen to find yourself in Charlotte and are craving a good filling burger!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times int he last 2 weeks and both times felt like this is a pretty fun place for dinner and drinks.  On both occasions, we were seated fairly promptly upon arrival. The waitresses who waited on us were friendly and helpful with bith food as well as drink questions. This restaurant has a fairly large selection of whiskey and several good burger and sandwich options.  I have tried the buffalo chicken sandwich as well as the California (full name escapes me) burger. The Buffalo Chicken sandwich was decent..not great but not bad either. The California burger, however, is REALLY good. I know it is a turkey burger and all you burger purists will gasp audibly when you read this, but it really IS that good!  I know this has become one of our regular spots when in Charlotte.. you should check it out too!"}
{"text":"Cowbell is one of my favorite uptown spots- they have an enormous menu which can be a blessing and a curse for those of us who are indecisive/take meal decisions way too seriously (aka me) but I always enjoy my meal here!  My favorite item on the menu is actually not a burger but he ronstadt wrap- it has chicken, corn salsa, tortilla strips, etc. and had a delicious and spicy pineapple habanero sauce. I seriously have dreams about this wrap it's so good! They also have super fun alcoholic milkshakes, one of which has an entire slice of apple pie in it... can't make this stuff up.   The atmosphere at cowbell is seriously awesome and this is a great place for a work lunch or happy hour with friends."}
{"text":"Was in the area and looking for a burger and beer, this was the first place that popped up on my Yelp app.  So glad we stopped and gave it a try.  We had a little wait for our table of 4 so we decided to sit at the bar and order some drinks.  Bartender was great in offering suggestions.  They have a nice selection of Moscow Mules, I've ever seen.  This place has a has the best burger selection it was hard to decide on just one.  We all loved our burgers.  I think next time I will try the tater tots. The fries where good but nothing to jump up and down about.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try this place and finally had the opportunity yesterday.  We went out to the Knights game and purposely didn't get anything to eat so we could walk to this place afterwards. We had a large group and they were very accommodating. The set up is nice and it reminds me of a bar you would find in a San Fran or NYC neighborhood. For appetizers we ordered the pretzels and the Sinatra...both were excellent choices and great for sharing!  For my main course, I ordered the Boogans Bacon. It was very delicious but I would recommend adding some cheese. Order the sweet potato tots!!!  So yummy! Overall, I'm very happy we chose this place and will be dining there again!"}
{"text":"The decor in this bar is nice, and there are some good beers on tap. I found the prices to be a little high, and service was at times sluggish. I had an order of pretzel bites, and found them to border on inedible; they had been cooked past the point of chewiness and felt stale. The accompanying cheese sauce was also disappointing.   I wasn't here for long, and I probably won't be back. The bar didn't have Tuaca or Chambord, which isn't a huge deal but their presence would've made the experience a little more positive for me. Perhaps their burgers are good; I cannot recommend the pretzel bites."}
{"text":"Great spot for lunch, dinner or even catch their brunch. Great atmosphere with awesome decor and music. The wait staff are super friendly and right there when you need them. They have a variety of delicious gourmet burgers that melt in your mouth. I highly recommend their sweet potato tots as well they are unbelievably."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere. Ate here with family before a concert and it was fast service, great food and drinks! We will return!"}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME. The drink menu is very extensive. Very great tasting and inventive. A little pricy though - either give a little more, or reduce the $12-14 price tag. Very tasty though.   Appetizer was the fried mozzarella with prosciutto, basil & marinara - unreal. This is very good, INCREDIBLE in fact. Get it! I command you! :-) You will die happy.   Husband got the PM Burger- cooked perfectly. Topped with pulled pork, fried jalapeños and beer cheese. Incredible also. I tasted it... A few times.   I got the Jet burger - black bean, quinoa, etc. not too great, not too bad either. Forgettable. Kind of dusty tasting, however the burger would have been great with some sort of acid - slaw, pickles, even some sort of aioli with vinegar or something! Needs a little more balance of flavor.   All in all, I would DEFINITELY go back!! Next time if I'm back in town, I'll get the fried mozzarella, a whiskey drink and a real beef burger and I know I'll be able to die happy!"}
{"text":"A cool and trendy burger joint that tries to be a bit more than your average burger joint.  I came here for lunch on a nice sunny day with a coworker of mine.  The place was fairly busy with the work week lunch crowd rushing within their 60 allotted minutes.  Atmosphere - Hodgepodge of 70's memorabilia, dark color accents, close/ crowded, decent noise level, a busy ambience of bankers rushing for lunch  Service - Friendly, quick, attentive  Food - It was okay.  I got the Elvis and a side of Sweet Potato Tots.  The burger arrived promptly after ordering, but it was just okay.  It was cooked to the level of \"done\" that I like; however, nothing about it stood out to me.  It was juicy...yes...but again...just okay.  Maybe it was the size of the burger  (which seemed on the small side) or the bun...whatever it was that day...my choice felt underwhelming.  The tots I ordered came with sugar sprinkled on top.  Others may like this added to their sweet potato tots...I unfortunately do not.  Overall - My experience here was just okay.  I will definitely give them another try in the future as the customer service was executed well and the restaurant has a fun and energetic vibe.    On this day, Cowbell just didn't ring my bell."}
{"text":"I will start off and tell you to skip this place and go to Bang Bang Burger instead!!!!  So I went last week at around 9 pm and I have been here before. Therefore, I had very high expectations. So they are known for their burgers because they are juicy and good from what I experienced the last time I was there.   I don't know if it was the menu changing over that impacted this or the fact that it was later in the night or possible management changes. I try to give people the benefit of doubt.   Nevertheless, the burger was TINY! I order a two patty burger ( writing in the description on the menu) and I was expecting two patties.   I got one patty supposedly rolled up from two. My question to management was how many oz come in one patty.  Standard around 6oz before it is cooked.   So I was expecting like 10oz burger but I got like this tiny burned burger.   In addition, the side I order was freezing cold. Who likes cold Mac and cheese? Not me.   Granted the manager was nice to try to resolved the issues but it was just overall terrible experience and not okay . Never again honestly !!!   Skip it and go to Bang Bang Burger. Trust me."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, friendly staff, great drink selections, but we were very disappointed with our burgers. Very bland and dry. Not worth the amount they charge. I've had better burgers from fast food joints. I'll be back for drinks and the decor but I think I'll pass on the food."}
{"text":"I thought the \"Bruiser\" was delicious and the side of slaw was also tasty. The place was packed by 12:15 for lunch. The kitchen was backed up so it took 30-35 minutes to get my food after it was ordered which was really long on a one hour lunch break. It was because there was a large \"To Go\" order for 30 called in. Unfortunately, they admitted that they knew it was too much so it led to seated guests suffering. They apologized and offered free burgers for the next time. My only advice to the manager was if you know you can't handle the business at the same time try to manage the \"To-Go\" earlier or later or say no to the order if you can't change the timing. I liked the food so I plan to go back and this time be the first priority."}
{"text":"So much of a mish-mash of good and not-so-much that I have a hard time deciding!   I'm already over the pretentious new burger joints. I get the whole let's-get-topping-crazy and play with flavors, but there is a lack of authenticity when that idea takes over the comfort portion of your burger.  Had lunch with wife and son. Got there early enough to not have to wait. Got seated quickly and our waitress came by to take our drink order. I always appreciate a quick drink taker! The menu is chock full of wildly topped burger combinations (but no just plain old bacon cheeseburger for the young folks, like my son, so we landed up paying for one of the 8 topping burgers with everything taken off but the cheese and the bacon.) (The bacon BTW was awesome!)   I ordered the NYC (Kraut, Swiss, 1000 island, and pastrami). I like my pastrami sammies different, so ordered it with seeded mustard (they don't have) and cheddar instead of swiss. Seems that changing your cheese is a payable upgrade! Yep, $1 on the bill for a change of cheese! I also ordered the onion rings as m side. The burger was not ample. For $12 (and a buck for cheese) I would have expected a more formidable foe, but flavor-wise it was pretty darned good. Good, flavorful pastrami, and mustard are magic! The onion rings, though, were a patent-damned disaster! They looked phenomenal! Big, inch wide cuts of onion with a thick fried batter. There were only three o the plate but so big it didn't matter! Oh, except for the fact that they had no flavor AT ALL! They didn't taste like onion. They didn't taste like batter. If not for the tasty Cowbell sauce (a spicy aioli) I could have been eating the napkin for the amount of flavor they had. Such a sad waste of a side.   My wife enjoyed her turkey burger but was underwhelmed by the fact that there were 2 pieces of roasted shitake mushroom on the patty. A fair bit less than one would have expected. Otherwise she was pretty happy with her choice. She really enjoyed the cuke salad which is cucumbers, onion and a light vinegar dressing.  Service is where a lot of my issues lie, if you have read any of my posts. Our waitress was a pretty, sweet young woman. She started off fine but then she hit my sore spot about halfway through the meal. I ordered tea with \"lots and lots\" of lemon. On my first refill, there was not a ice cube left this side of the Appalachian mountain range. It was evident as she poured my tea, but was not identified or fixed. I cannot stand when my ICED tea has no ice! Anyone else....Beuhler....Beuhler. It's such an easy fix and yet allowed to just wallow until I have to ask. Also never received any extra lemon's which tweeks my heiny. These are easy service pints which are not being met by WAY to many in the service industry.   Anyhow, overall, not a bad experience, just not a great one. For the price, I would have expected much more. I think, to a degree, they are catering to a crowd that wants to spend 12 skins on a burger just to say they eat there rather than finding a great $7 burger cause it's great. So, no more pricey hipster burger joints for this guy. Have been underwhelmed to often.   I look forward to the day I can write another 5 star review (or a strong 4 star) but until then...Eat well.  V-Dub"}
{"text":"Burgers were really good, and cooked perfectly. Sweet potato tots yummy, and mac and cheese was very tasty. Server was helpful and attentive. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Its super loud, busy and open late. I had the poutine, it was delicious!!!! The banana pudding milkshake was super yummy!! Order it now!!"}
{"text":"I happened to wonder in here one night after walking around the city and I'm glad I did. I love this place and definitely will recommend this place to everyone.   The fries were mind blowing fantastic. The burger that went with it was equally fantastic.   This place is awesome."}
{"text":"Awesome ! We sat at the bar and Jennifer waited on us she was fun and happy to help us.  No local Juciy jay  or corona but the whiskey drinks were the best. We both had hamburgers and I have to say both were out of this world good. Asked to watch Hockey on the TV and was put on even upsetting other customers but worked it out. This place is fun. You must add it to your list of things to do in Uptown Charlotte.  Thanks Cowbell"}
{"text":"Boogan's Bacon Burger, atmosphere,  delightful waitress, superlative whiskey selection and good service. Can't ask for more.  Burger cooked to perfection, pressed to cook properly, dressed for success while eating. Third time there, all with the same consistent results.  Pricey, but worth it. I highly recommend this establishment.  As a side note, they support live music! YEAPPA!"}
{"text":"*Burger Review*    I have to start with that just so that you know that if you have \"Burger\" in your name, you better come correct!  I'm tough on Burger joints, if you didn't know.  Luckily, Cowbell brings the heat!!  They do an excellent job of combining atmosphere, beer, whiskey, and food.  It has it all!  Let's start with the burger:  10/10 - With an extensive variety of options to choose from, you would be worried that they didn't take the time to perfect any one of them.  So far, I have had two of them.  Boogan's Bacon and the Gambler.  Boogan's is everything bacon and mmmmm mmmmmm, it was good.  Onion Kaiser did the trick.  The Gambler gave exactly what I wanted.  bbq sauce and more bbq sauce.  Awesome!  Drinks:  9/10 - They have numerous local beers on tap and they is usually some kind of special on something running.  I have gone with the Business Class whiskey flight the last two times.  They have three different levels of whiskey flights.  Business Class, First Class, and some other class that I can't afford.  Best parts of the flight..  The GM came by to check on us and informed us that he created the carrying case for the flights.  Just thought I would add that in because it is a cool unique little tid bit.  And, the bartender knew all about the whiskeys and made strong suggestions as to where I should start so that I didnt wash out the flavors of the other whiskeys.  Thought that was kind and informative.   The sweet potato tots:  10/10 - Yeah, they get there own frickin category.  Have you every eaten a french fry mixed with the deliciousness of a krispy kreme doughnut.  Yeah, that is what these taste like.  The perfect mix of salty and sweet.  Oh man.... They are so good.  If anything, just go here for these tots.  Trust me on that!  Enjoy!  -Ian M."}
{"text":"My second trip wasn't as fun as the first, although I was able to eat this time. The Pilgrim burger was very good; turkey, Brie and bacon? Shut my mouth. The mac & cheese was alright, but I couldn't taste the love.  The place was packed when I arrived, but I found a spot at the bar. Service was OK; the bartenders use the terms \"hon\" and \"love\" a little too freely for my taste. I mean, it's not Hooters. There must have been a reunion or after party coming up; all kinds of industry folks at the bar. I had to move down to make room for them.  The whiskey selection was decent, although not as good as last summer and still overpriced. Understood that it will always be a little different."}
{"text":"Great food. Mid to high pricing but quality is there. Bar is much better than expected. Not a five guys. Expect to drop 50-100 bucks here on a date. Worth it though."}
{"text":"This place has gone downhill fast! Worst meal I've had in Charlotte. We ordered the buffalo fries and had to send them back because they weren't hot when delivered and tiny! When our server, Kris, brought these back out they were over fried and tasted burnt. Fine. We've been here before and the food and service are generally decent. I ordered wings for the table and the Alamo salad. The wings must have been sitting in the window all day. They were hard and cold and had been resmothered in wing sauce. Terrible. We asked to have them taken off. Our server didn't seem to care in the least. Last time we go back."}
{"text":"Ok this place earns 5 stars for the fantastic looped music videos.  The food was good and alcohol menu featuring local beers and a great whiskey menu was great too."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by this place! I called ahead with a party of 9 on a Saturday (eek) and they kindly replied back, \"We will get a table started for you.\" I was shocked. We arrived 20 mins later with half our party, and they indeed had a table ready for us. The atmosphere was very nice.   It's a whiskey bar so of course I had to try their Manhattan. It was lovely. I was impressed by their drink selections. Alcoholic milkshakes, beer cocktails, local draft options, whiskey galore, and a long list of mules and cocktails.   We ordered the bruiser with caramelized onions, gorgonzola, and a blackened seasoning. It was cooked a perfect medium rare! And those sweet potato tots....yum! My friends thoroughly enjoyed their wings and burgers as well and were very impressed. I'm so glad we gave it a chance!"}
{"text":"Yummy but sooooo heavy! Our server/hostess was awesome. I got the f'n tacos and they were delicious but like poo-your-brains out heavy. The sweet potato tots were yummy and reminded me of the Q Shack's tots in Durham. The berry mule was very tasty. We loved the music videos playing and the decor. A great place to go if you have severe attention/focusing problems and want lots to stare at. It was very slow in here on a Sunday evening- was nice."}
{"text":"Waited a long time to get a table, with the high reviews we had high hopes for a great burger and dinner. Sadly, the fried pickles was overly salty I'd pass on them. I ordered 12 wings half lemon pepper and half buffalo sauce. The wings were so salty that I could barely eat them! The sweet potato tots sounded interesting but were soft and had cinnamon in them. The Bruiser Burger with added jalenpenos was good, but not good enough to wait an hour or so for again. They did have music videos on the screen which was interesting and nice."}
{"text":"This joint could've got a 4 or 5 cause the burger was good albeit too small for the price but the indifferent and slow service (took 30 mins to get a chicken burger, server's excuse was other bigger tables were being served and didn't even apologize. Is this the pathetic excuse you give to your customer?) ruined it. Shame."}
{"text":"The food was nothing special, and nothing that I would remember. The burgers were okay, interesting combinations on the menu but didn't quite come through once in front on me. Sweet potato tots were the best part of the meal. Started with the Sinatra and was disappointed when the crispy coating from the outside of the cheese was a mush on the inside due to not being cooked all the way."}
{"text":"Found this place today by chance and it was great! First, it is very welcoming coming in.  Quite an eclectic decor with photos of famous people mixed with \"cow\" decor.  Great music and music videos playing.  And may I add one thing to this....I am so TIRED of going into restaurants with sports playing on the TVs.  I was so glad for the respite.  Ok onto the food.  There were disco fries on the appetizer menu so of course we had to try them.  Excellent!  They had the requisite cheese and gravy plus some delicious carmelized onions and a little mushroom!  I opted for the\"State\" hot dog which was basically a chili dog.  Fantastic roll, sweetish chili  - very good.  A little light on the slaw for this southern girl but I could have asked for more.  I also had the pan fried corn as my side.  I mention this because they had several sides to choose from and I appreciate this.  Fries get tiresome.  I would completely recommend this place and look forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"I want more Cowbell!  Last time I was in Charlotte, this little burger joint was right around the corner from where I was staying and I debated going in a couple times but never made it. This time (while in route to Ohio) I stopped in Charlotte for lunch and the Cowbell was my destination of choice. Being that it was after the main lunch hours, the restaurant wasn't very busy and I was able to saddle right up to the bar and grab a stool.   After perusing the long list of burgers & getting some beer recommendations from Lindsay behind the bar, I settled on the Bruiser Burger with sweet potato tots for this dining adventure. My blackened beef patty came on the softest onion Kaiser roll with horseradish cream, gorgonzola and caramelized onions. The burger also comes with shitake mushrooms, but I opted to go without. The cooked to medium burger was juicy and overflowing out of the bun. I don't know when it will be, but I'm looking forward to trying more of what they have to offer in the burger dept. The tots were so good, I could have eaten a bucketful. They had the slightest sprinkling of - I'm assuming - cinnamon on them that perked the flavor up a bit without making them too sweet.   I didn't partake in any of the whiskeys offered at the Cowbell, but I'll save that for next time."}
{"text":"Walked in and was sat right away, the restaurant was not busy at all .. took 15 mins for someone to acknowledge our presence , watched servers argue over who had to take our table , server came over about 15 mins later and said she didn't see us sit down, placed our order , she forgot to put in our appetizer, so we got our food first , burger was burnt on the outside and came with one over cooked strip of bacon, fries were undercooked. The only thing that earned one star was the fact that our server was friendly."}
{"text":"In a land of greasy beefy burgers, oversized dry buns, useless and tasteless accoutrements and massive salty and greasy fries, thank God for the Cowbell Burger and Bar.  My faith has been restored in the burger.  Thank you for the taste explosion and the pleasant feeling after dining experience.  The staff were attentive (not tooooo attentive), greeted quickly, served quickly. All in all a 5 star affair which I NEVER ever give."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Great burgers and great drinks. I always come here when possible!! We love the pretzels app the beer cheese is to die for! I never have bad food her and the service is always great."}
{"text":"I liked this place!!!  It was a little hard to find but once we got there we realized it was worth the hunt.  I was shocked to walk in on a Friday night at 7pm to a mostly empty restaurant.  Maybe others were still walking in circles trying to find the place but I was expecting it to be packed.  The bar filled up first and by 8:30 or 9 it was definitely \"full\" but you can tell they are still in the \"need to publicize\" phase.  Again, due to the location, you aren't really going to just stumble upon this place...you have to be intentionally seeking them out.    The atmosphere was very fun and as others have described it has somewhat of a \"rock and roll\" theme.  They had a couple big screen tv's showing some throwback music videos!!  It was everything from Smashing Pumpkins to Journey to 311 to Nirvana.  They also had a couple smaller tv's showing a basketball game.  Needless to say, the men were in heaven.    This really could pass for more of a bar than a restaurant and typically I don't seek out bar food but Cowbell really pulls together the combination of a fun atmosphere with a fresh/solid menu.  We started with the pretzels and Guinness cheese dip.  AMAZING!!!!  The pretzels were bite-sized and warm, lightly salted, not too doughy, baked enough for a light toasted exterior and a mouth-watering finish.  They were so good!  Our table had a tough time deciding on an appetizer so I look forward to coming back and trying the fried pickles or sweet potato croquettes!  We all tried a different burger so we got a pretty good sampling of the menu.  Everyone was very pleased.  The veggie burger was the only one that didn't get rave reviews...it was a little bland.  The sides were awesome too...I had the sweet potato tots and these things were phenomenal.  They tasted like little bite sized donuts.  They were lightly coated in cinnamon-sugar and slightly crunchy on the outside.  They were pretty much ridiculous!  They are the kind of snack I am going to crave in the middle of the night and go to Cowbell JUST to pick them up.  They were THAT good.   The regular fries were great too...they had somewhat of a parmesan crusted topping with a few other spices---crispy, long, lean, you get the picture...  The service was good....almost TOO good...meaning, I think our waitress was bored because she hung around our table quite a bit.  Haha...we didn't mind but it is hard to say how the service is/will be because this was a pretty slow night.  The menu is inventive but not over the top.  The food is good quality and the price point is reasonable.  The chef looked like he was 15 so I give him credit.  This is definitely another solid restaurant in Charlotte!!  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"The drink menu is vast! The food was great and the service was good. We are excited to come back to try more of the menu! Over all, a good time was had!"}
{"text":"Interesting burger concoctions that will leave your taste buds screaming for more. I had the NYC, burger with pastrami, which was great. The sweet potato tots were really good. They were dusted with sweet cinnamon :P  Will definitely come back again and again till I try them all!  4/5- service was slow for a half packed house. Our appetizer came out minutes before our burgers. Kind of disappointed. Server was very attentive and considerate to our needs, which was a plus"}
{"text":"I love that this place is open late! Went on a Saturday night for some late night eats. There was a dj so it was a little loud but the music was good. The chicken sandwich was ok but the bread was a little tough and dry. The disco fries were deliciously smothered in gravy, mushrooms, and cheese. I also had the banana pudding shake (without alcohol) and that was a piece of art in and of itself! So good and worth trying if you get a chance. Parking is difficult in this area so I suggest taking an Uber or walking."}
{"text":"Do you like whiskey? moscow mules? burgers? Cowbell is your one stop shop for all of these and more! I LOVED the interior of this restaurant/bar. It was classy and welcoming, yet not too bougie. There are several tables, but also a good sized bar area if that's what you're looking for.  At first we came here for the alcoholic milkshakes, but after seeing the extensive moscow mule menu, we quickly changed our minds.  Mules are my jam, so you could imagine how hard it was to choose one!   -Cucumber mule: refreshing twist on your standard! The cucumber was subtle, but enough to give the drink a good twist. My favorite out of the ones I tried! -Melon mule: a little too sweet for me. They use the melon grey goose, and the taste was a little overpowering  -Irish mule: whiskey instead of vodka! Better version of a whiskey ginger ale  They have whiskeys from ALL OVER, and while I'm no whiskey connoisseur, I learned quite a bit just from reading the menu lol  They also have a huge food menu. Too many choices, and again we had a hard time deciding.   -Pretzel bites: fried pretzel dough was good while hot, but got a little too hard when it cooled down. Cheese sauce is REALLY good though! Best shared with more than 2 people  -Ronstandt wrap: you sold me at avocado! also comes with chicken, black beans, corn. And...SWEET POTATO TATER TOTS!  Pro tip: DIP IN CHEESE SAUCE! mmmm so so good  -Disco fries: omg droooool poutine. Everything mixed well- fries, gravy, mushrooms, cheese curds. Mushrooms added a really nice layer to the dish and it didn't get too soggy! Or maybe that was just us stuffing our faces in an efficient manner...  One of our best decisions while visiting Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Had the NYC burger very interesting twist on the standard burger, tasty and well seasoned.  Staff was super courteous excellent service. Décor is spot on.  Must try the sweet potato puffs with the honey butter they melt in your mouth."}
{"text":"Cowbell is a good option for anyone in the Uptown area! Their sweet potato tots are heavenly! I tried the pilgrim burger, which was very interesting, but probably wouldn't be my choice if I were to try Cowbell again. I also liked the pretzel appetizer, but I am a big fan of soft pretzels in general."}
{"text":"First time trying this spot out. Parked a few blocks away (it's on a side street with no on-street parking).   The Good: Hamburgers were cooked as ordered (Medium); onion rings and sweet potato tots were tasty. Great dipping sauce for the rings, no dipping sauce for the tots. Great whiskey selection (if you enjoy it). The wife had the Gambler (cheddar, BBQ sauce, roasted tomato), and I had the Jerry Garcia (open-faced on sourdough with mushrooms, gravy, caramelized onions and melted swiss). Both were fine, but nothing too amazing.  \"Bad\": They had a whiskey menu, but no beer menu to select from. The server asked what kind of beer we preferred and when we said \"dark,\" he responded with, \"like an IPA, a pale ale?\" Ummmm....no. The beer he brought was tasty, but the beer selection is somewhat limited. It was a quiet night (the place was maybe a third full), but no one from management stopped by to check on us, and the hostess pretty much ignored us as we left (I don't expect management to stop by, but it is a nice touch when it happens, especially when the place isn't slammed).  The decor is a rock-n-roll vibe with classic rock album covers and song lyrics on the wall, pics of rock musicians and movie stars, etc. The music playing in the restaurant was more modern rock, pop, \"country,\" etc. (Beyoncé, Imagine Dragons, Florida-Georgia Line).   The place is trendy and upscale as another reviewer mentioned, but the wife and I both walked out saying, \"meh.\" Not a bad place to grab a burger, but nothing exceptional, in our opinion."}
{"text":"LOVED IT! The service is personal, the food exceptional! The deviled eggs are outstanding, as well as the onion rings an sweet potato tots with cinnamon-marshmallow-creamy dipping sauce!!! Not greasy, and lots of healthy but VERY FILLING options!"}
{"text":"I had the Carolina burger which has chili in it and it was absolutely wonderful. I would definitely have it again and again. Sweet potato tots were on point as well. Can't go wrong with this set.   But if you're getting a side, you must order their mac & cheese. The best mac & cheese I ever had. It's not your typical cheddar cheese mac & cheese. It had more of a Alfredo taste to it which I loved. And it wasn't too heavy as it might sound like it would.  You can't leave this place without having their milkshakes. Their S'more milkshake was sooo delicious that I came back that night to get some more. I had it virgin, but I imagine spiking it with a little bit of alcohol wouldn't harm its glorious taste too much."}
{"text":"I went to Cowbell last year with my wife and we loved the food atmosphere and service. We happened to stumble to this restuarant while we were looking for another place to eat we loved the place."}
{"text":"Well I must commend them on their customer service. I will admit I went at a busy time. Lunch!. I like there fried pickle. However they must add salt to there batter which made them extra salty. I orderd a Burger medium rare and it was well done. So you might be thinking why am I giving them Three stars, There service was on point at tom me that makes a big difference. They were willing to fix my meal. However I was on a time constrant. So the manager took care of it.    I will give them another try, just because of the way they handle my situation.   Customer severs makes a restaurant. Then FOOD!!! at least in my world. LOL"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by the food. On an uneventful Monday night, my BF wanted to eat here for dinner (mind you, we don't live uptown, so this was a semi-hike). I ate here once before, and didn't remember it being mind-blowing. Since it's a burger joint, it was only logic for me to order a burger. My other half was about to order wings - kid you not, I almost backhanded him on his head - why the heck would he want to come to a burger place out of the wing to have wings!!!??? Once he found his misplaced senses, he went with a burger as well (or for the pure fear of being smacked by me).   I opted for the Jerry Garcia with a side of onion rings. Only 3 onion rings but they were big and perfectly fried and when i took a bite the onion stayed put! The burger was perfectly seasoned (but a bit tiny) and cooked (medium per my request). It's an open face burger with a brown gravy and the entire thing was legit.  He ordered a plain burger as always (bless his heart), but it came with a big portion of fries (normally served with sprinkled cheese, he asked for that plain as well). Fries were tasty.  The 2 burgers were $20 and a soda put it a $25 dinner for 2.   Not sure if I will go out of my way to eat here, but if I'm in uptown and feeling a burger, this is definitely the place to go!"}
{"text":"Business traveler in Charlotte so always looking for new places to try.  This time it was Cowbell.  Really liked it!  Very friendly staff.  Nice room. I had their Old Fashioned cocktail which was well made and then their Umami burger made with grass fed beef which was excellent.  All in all, very good and I certainly will go back."}
{"text":"Had a pretty good experience at Cowbell.  The server was nice and attentive.  The menu was great.  I wanted to try one of everything.  The burger I got was blackened (little salty, but very good) with greyer cheese and sauted veg.  Only real beef (no pun intended), was the menu says cooked to order so I asked for it Medium.  It came out WELL done.  Was eating before the Hornets game so I ate it.  Still good, but was a little dry due to the doneness.  Wife had sliders.  She loved them."}
{"text":"My family and I stayed at the Marriott right around the corner so the convenience was great. The atmosphere was cool and trendy. We love burgers, no complaints there. The service was friendly and accommodating. However, it was extremely slow. Our waitress and other staff were attentive and gracious but it took nearly 45 minutes to get our food. They made bacon cheese fries for us which was not on the menu and were quite good. We also orders wings which we prefer hot. They were okay and somewhat sweet which is a personal choice as far as taste goes. So they were not our favorite. Our burgers were quite good, cooked as ordered. The chicken \"twiggies\" (tenders) were a bit over cooked but my daughter didn't seem to mind and enjoyed the fries that came with them, except the parmesan cheese sprinkled over them. Over all it was not a bad experience and the food isn't bad but not all to our taste."}
{"text":"My daughter and her friend was just served these pancakes.  Both orders were burnt on the back. I asked for a medium well burger and it was burnt.  Bad day for the kitchen.   The fried pickles were good."}
{"text":"Great speciality burgers, and other minute items to match like sweet potato tots or spiked milkshakes.   Outstanding scotch and bourbon selection too."}
{"text":"I made a reservation for 14 people. They set us up for a spot for 10 people. 2 of us had to sit at different table and rest of us were uncomfortably smashed together. When asked to sit at a different location, management said no without giving an excuse and didn't seem to care.  Before making the reservation, I asked if the parking validation is for the full day. I was informed by two different people that on Saturday, it would be validated for the day. When time to leave the parking deck, the ticket was validated for only 3 hours. The entire party had to pay for parking, when informed it was validated for the entire day. I called to complain and the hostest would only say \"it's just 3 hours\" repeatedly. She didn't apologize or seem to care. Horrible customer service."}
{"text":"We went here for breakfast/lunch we wanted something light and drinks. From the moment you step in the amazing smell of the whisky bar you want a burger and you want it fast. The staff was awesome we told them we were from out of town. First time here. Their recommendations were on point. Loved it."}
{"text":"Came here to pregame, burgers where absolutely slammin! Started off with a whiskey flight and some Beers and then finished with the GFY burger and the Bruiser. Each burger was great. Glad. We got a chance to experience!"}
{"text":"First time here, not disappointed!  Smaller place than expected but great food!  Burger cooked just right.  Had the Boogans Bacon and highly recommend!  Wife had the Sandy and said was also very good.  If you are in uptown Charlotte and want a great place for a burger and huge selection of Whiskeys, this is the place!"}
{"text":"So as a resident of downtown we have a love hate relationship with cowbell. We like the food, very consistent. We hate the overly loud head banging music. I always notice families, couples walk in then leave and i suspect its because of the music. Very hard to carry on a conversation. Mgmt. needs to pay attention and make some changes..."}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME!!!!! We started here to kick off my friends bachelorette party and we got the best service. All the staff was so nice and accommodating and made our night so good. The music and the food was also equally awesome everyone liked their food and we were a party of 10. Sarah Beth was our server super great -ask for her she's super sweet and works hard to make sure you have a good dinning experience. Will definitely be back!!!!!"}
{"text":"We were craving burgers, and decided to give cowbell a try and reading the nice reviews.  When you walk in, it is a really cool looking place. The decor is nice, but also all over the place.  The service was great, too.  Our waiter, Drake, was extremely attentive and personable. He made good menu suggestions, and was always around to ensure we had what we needed.  For an appetizer, we got the pretzels with the beer cheese.  They were good, but not great.  Mostly because I am partial to a giant pretzel, rather than the nuggets.  The best part of the meal was definitely the burgers, though.  We got the burger with the fried egg on it and the croissant bun.  It was delicious and melts I your mouth. For sides, we had the sweet potato tots and the onion rings, which were phenomenal and complemented the burgers perfectly.  We are looking forward to heading back and trying some more burgers!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, and great food! Tried the Umami burger after reading about it online and it really did capture the umami taste.  A little loud but it was a Saturday night with a pub crawl going on around the corner, so not surprised.  Service could have been a little more on top of things, but overall great experience.  I will definitely return, especially since I couldn't even decide what to eat, there were so many great options!"}
{"text":"No. Just leave this place and walk one more down to Dandelion. Drinks were good but they messed my burger up and took over 20 min to make me a replacement mid rare burger. Husbands burger was overcooked and tastes terrible. Onion rings were really good....tater tots were decent.   Again, go for the drinks and that's it."}
{"text":"Always a great place to go!! The burgers are great and even the bean burger is amazing too. I love the fries as well. Small restaurant thou.. Hard to get a big group in takes a while but overall great meal fun atmosphere !"}
{"text":"My first stop in Charlotte while down here for business was Cowbell. It was around 10, and while most places had closed the kitchen, Cowbell was open and ready for some business!   Place was pretty empty... But it was a Wednesday night, so I expected there not to be noisy. However, there was a musician that was playing there that night. He was one of this one man bands. It was great!   I ordered a house whiskey with coke ($5.. Not bad!) and then a house whiskey on the rocks. Both were good... Expected for a house drink. I order d the F'in Tacos, which featured beef, pulled pork, beer cheese, and friend jalapeños. Got it with a side of Mac n cheese, cause ya know... Southern comfort!   Food came out pretty average as far as time goes. Tacos looked great, and tasted quite good. Mac n cheese left much to be desired. But, the tacos were tasty and not too filling.  I would for sure return. It was overall a good experience!  Go in confidence"}
{"text":"I ordered the blackened salmon burger but they ran out of salmon. The manager ran next-door to Capital Grille and got me a piece. The next time I come here I will try the p.m. burger which looks amazing. They also were able to substitute my side with the chili so I could try it. This place is a gem. I also ordered The Croce since I love old fashions. Any place that has a picture of Johnny Cash and Tom Petty must be good. If you love burgers, this is your place."}
{"text":"As far as the food goes, everyone in our party of 8 loved their tacos and burgers. The service is the downfall here. We called to try and get a reservation for 8 on a Saturday night at 7pm. The hostess said they don't do reservations on Saturday nights but ensured me they aren't busy until 8pm or that it wouldn't be too long if we came before then. We got there 5 minutes until 7pm and were told it would be a 30-40 minute wait, which I expected so it was totally fine. We went next door and had a drink while waiting for a text about our table. After 50 minutes of waiting we decided we should head back to cowbell since our table should have been ready by then. The hostess was rude and acted like she could care less about us waiting. We chose to keep waiting since it was 15 degrees outside and continued to watch her sit tables that she could have easily held for our party. Finally after over an hour and a half of waiting we were seated. An older man kept walking to the hostess stand and we figured he may have been a manager and apologized for us waiting 3 times longer than we were told, but he never said a word to us. It's sad that a place like this couldn't even offer an apology or a free appetizer for being so inconsiderate. Hire a hostess with a smile on her face who actual cares to be there instead of give snarky remarks and playing on her phone the whole night!"}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite meal in Uptown to date. Cowbell delivers with fantastic burgers, sandwiches, apps, and a nice selection of local and unusual beers.   I came here on a Friday night with the husband after much indecision about where to eat. We easily snagged two seats at the bar and ordered a martini (for him) and OMB Copper (for me) while we perused the extensive menu. Hubby was happy that the bar was stocked with Titos vodka for his martini, and even happier with the huge spread of meaty sandwich options.   We decided on the sliders and deviled eggs to start, followed by a spicy chicken sandwich and salad. Everything was outrageously delicious with the sweet potato tots and sliders stealing the show. The tots seemed to be lightly dusted in cinnamon sugar and were like little donuty pillows of heaven. Holy yum.   New favorite spot, we will be back soon."}
{"text":"I had a salad for lunch to which I added the grilled chicken it was very good decision. The staff seem to handle the lunch crowds without any problems as my food was out in less than 5 minutes."}
{"text":"I like cows. Cows are so weird, yet so cool. Milk, leather, beef, I like cows.  Cows, Turf Grass, Artsy paintings, Cows on turf, Cowbell has lots of cows!  Cool burgers, Trendy Burgers, Hipster burgers. Cowbell has Burgers!  I don't want to go as far as calling it a knock off of another hip burger joint, but it's obvious they're either inspired by or imitating them.   With limited selections of a good burger joints uptown, these guys might be the new king."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and the burgers are on point. I got the chili and it is spot on. Jen and Sarah never let our glasses go dry. Try the whisky flights."}
{"text":"This is a great place to grab a bite to eat either at lunch or for a casual dinner with friends. The menu has something to offer for everyone. Take some time and explore the menu there are some hidden gems on there that you might overlook if you're not careful."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a lighter option, I suggest the Jett Blue Wrap. Crumbled black bean patty, spring mix, almonds, blueberries, goat cheese and blueberry vinaigrette wrapped in a spinach tortilla. To be honest, I thought the combination sounded \"weird\" but ordered it anyways to try and be healthy. Boy was I wrong. The black bean burger was super moist and flavorful and all of the different ingredients really worked well together.   Plus it justifies ordering the sweet potato tater tots. They are like mini doughnuts and and sprinkled with brown sugar (or something similar). Oh. My. Gosh. Good.  Atmosphere was a little loud. And while the spiked smores milkshake was awfully delicious, not sure it's worth the $10 price tag. Didn't seem very \"spiked.\""}
{"text":"As a very wise man once said/yelled:  \"We need more cowbell!!\" (-Will Ferrell).  I definitely cannot get enough of this place.  Burgers... whiskey.... craft cocktails and craft beer... SOLD.  These guys are related to the really awesome other places in Charlotte Leroy Fox & Mortimers so they are definitely doing something right.  I really like how creative their burgers are.  Although, my one gripe is that the Elvis burger misleads you to believe there is peanut butter and bananas on it... but that's just me being silly.  The Elvis is actually the epitome of burgers if you are looking to go classic... beef patty, cheddar, ketchup, mustard, roma tomatoes, onions and a garlic aioli..... my mouth is watering as I type this.  There's a little something for everyone on the menu.  Those a little adventurous with heat... I recommend the Dani California.  Super tasty turkey burger with a great kick.  Not a burger person?  They have salads and chicken sandwich options.  The staff here are friendly and the space is great.  The decorations make it fun and interesting.  I love how you can find something new on the wall every time you go - makes for great conversations.  My last visit they had 80s hair band videos playing... EPIC."}
{"text":"Had a great time at this place!   Delicious drinks. Loved the ginger beer and whiskey combos they offered.   The pretzel bites were a great snack to share with friends.   I had the Danny California (turkey burger) that was just enough to fill me up without making me feel too full.   Finally I shared the S'mores shake with my girlfriend. Couldn't even taste the alcohol!    Other points to note: live DJ, pictures of cows everywhere, and a ringing cowbell on a Saturday night. A great time."}
{"text":"Great food. Great beer. Great service. All on a snowy and ice Tuesday night just before closing."}
{"text":"Great food and service! The Mac n cheese is amazing and a must try. Will definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Picked up some carry out on a Saturday night when I wasn't feeling very social and wanted to savagely inhale a burger in the privacy of my own home. My food was waiting for me right in the front when I arrived and I was on my way home in less than a minute.  I had been to Cowbell a bunch of times for drinks but this was my first taste of the food. I ordered Big Will's Breakfast Burger mostly because of the fried egg, and holy shit was it good...I think I blacked out after the first bite. When I came to, there was nothing but crumbs in the box and egg yoke on my face.  I ordered onion rings as my side and they were on par with the burger. They were super crunchy and the spicy honey mustard sauce took them to another level. I guess if I had to gripe about something I could complain that there were only 4 rings, but I definitely still felt plenty full.  I don't know if I've ever paid $14 for a burger before but this was totally worth it. When I win the lottery I'm gonna come back and get the $20 GFY Burger with foie gras.  UPDATE: I didn't win the lottery but I got the GFY burger anyway. GFY probably stands for \"good for you\" but I prefer to think it stands for \"go f*ck yourself.\" Anyway, it was a damn good burger, but not really worth $20.  The amount of foie gras was about as expected. However, the copious amounts of prosciutto (normally a good thing) seemed to overpower the taste. I will say that I really appreciated the delicious apricot marmalade though.  I satisfied my curiosity, but my suspicion was ultimately confirmed that foie gras doesn't really work best on a burger."}
{"text":"Best burgers , sweet potato tots, oinions and my drink cencerro drink is the best.  You got to try if you don't your missing out"}
{"text":"Can't believe I forgot to update this last year.  Am happy to report that we did indeed make it back here when we were feeling better and able to enjoy it fully.  Met some friends here and the four of us were treated to great service, super food, and terrific drinks.    Husband was especially fond of his whiskey flight.  I loved my Danny California with Salad.  Husband did the Bruiser again, only with big beautiful onion rings this time.  If you're looking for a great casual place in the heart of Charlotte that's not super expensive, this is it!  Especially if you're fond of burgers!"}
{"text":"The best burgers and drinks you will find in Charlotte! The staff is amazing and the food and atmosphere goes hand in hand - definitely a must go!"}
{"text":"I was torn here between 3 and 4 stars but, with only one lunchtime visit under my belt, I landed on the 4.    The 4 worthy aspects:  Service -  Ate at the bar and it was friendly and fast.  Taste of the burger - Had one with caramelized onions, gorgonzola, garlic aioli, shredded lettuce and it had a nice combo of sweet and tart and savory it also came with shitake's which I declined.  Atmosphere - A little dark (in a good way) with cool art and those bangin' 80's MTV videos playing on a big screen.  Just an interesting place to look around and soak in.  The closer to 3 items: Burger to bun ratio - While the burger was thick and tasted great, there was way too much onion kaiser encircling the burger.  At least 3/4 of an inch of a bun rim around the whole thing.  Burger Temp - In that, I was not asked how I would like it cooked.  I'm not sure if this is the standard practice and they simply cook everything to medium-well (which is what I got) but, given the choice and the recently enlightened NC rules on the topic, medium-rare is what I would generally order.    While I would not drive down here from LKN to get a burger given the number of good options up this way, I can absolutely see myself walking to Cowbell for lunch again or perhaps meeting a group after work for some drinks and an early, beef-centric meal."}
