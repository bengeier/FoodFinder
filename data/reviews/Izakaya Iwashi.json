{"text":"Me encanta el concepto de este restaurante: Café Sardine durante el día (brunch normalito pero excelente café) y taberna japonesa Iwashi por la noche. Dos chefs, dos menús y dos experiencias completamente distintas en un mismo local. 

Fui a cenar el sábado pasado con mi marido y un amigo japonés. Los dos pidieron ramen, pero como a mí no me apetecía decidí pedir dos tapas: un delicioso tartar de atún servido en copa y un plato de caballa espectacular. Este último me dejó impresionada, sin duda volveré a pedirlo cuando vuelva. Mi amigo también lo probó y coincidió conmigo en que era excelente, así que lo recomiendo totalmente.

El lugar es pequeñito pero con mucho encanto, decorado con un toque vintage desenfadado y la cocina a la vista. Después se puede ir a tomar una copa al bar Waverly, a cinco minutos andando en el Boulevard Saint Laurent."}
{"text":"I've never been to Sardine but when I heard that it was going to be serving traditional japanese food past 6:30 pm, I knew that I had to try it. .
As soon as the clock strikes 6:30 p.m.,  café Sardine turns into Iwashi izakaya. Now, for those who are familiar with Sardine know that it's a very small space. Every time I've gone to Iwashi thus far, it's been packed, so that's always a good sign, but you may feel a little bit like a... eeh... sardine in a tin can sitting during their rush (which can last all night, that's how good the food is). 
Needless to say, despite their small venue, this allows the staff to give more special attention to their guests and for food to arrive relatively soon (it's still a sit down restaurant though, not a fast food one.)

Their menu is small but I mean, we're here for the ramens. I went last night and they had added the veggie ramen on there which was as aesthetically pleasing to my eyes as it was to my palette. 
They have a nice selection of sake. Their beer menu is meek with PBR and Sapporo, but it fulfills that beer need if that's how you roll. They also make specialty cocktails which apparently are delicious (I'm a beer girl) according to my friends who I've gone with. 

I think anyone will enjoy this restaurant especially if you like japanese food. Great servers, great ambiance, and the food is worthy of a return (I've gone four times so far). 

Recommended dishes: karage fried chicken with aioli, tonkotsu ramen with pork, tuna tartare, and vegetable ramen. 

* the vegetarian options are limited so ask your server about their veg options."}
{"text":"What a difference a day makes. Add two or three years and your locavore-foraged-hipster restaurant Sardine, might just become very different, morphing into an izakaya serving ramen and a variety of Japanese inspired appetizers. I liked the old Sardine concept well enough, but the execution never quite lived up to its promise. This new incarnation, although at first seemingly much simpler, entails a lot of hidden complexity; from the rich stock which is made the old school way, to the perfectly pickled kimchi, to the craft tonic that makes for nicely balanced cocktails. And of course, the \"did I just walk into a set design meant to be a hipster bar in Brooklyn\" interior, makes that simple piping hot bowl of ramen, somehow a lot cooler. Regarding the latter, I had it twice - the first time it was too salty, but good, and the second time, everything was bang on, from the broth to great noodles, to eggs soaked overnight in vinegar and soy sauce, it was all damn good. I have a feeling they'll just keep getting better. Try it before the lines are around the block."}
{"text":"So delicious and so cozy, it's hard for me to be happier then when tucked in here with a sweet faced date slurping noodles and sipping hot sake. The sake-based cocktails are delicious too, and I loved the tartar I tried the first time I came. But now, especially when it rains, I mostly think about that thick flavourful spicy broth, noodles, egg, a bowl I'd like to swim in, dim lights, friendly faces hollaring hello and smiling you through the menu. Man, if I didn't have other plans I'd brave the rain and try to find a friend to cuddle in with me at tiny trim little Iwashi tonight. Long man you run little pop up! Keep us warm through the winter at least!"}
{"text":"This place is so cosy, the laid back and dimly-lit ambiance more than make up for how small it is. Get here early as it fills up quickly. Best spot would be at the bar, as it can get very noisy if you're at a table. 

Dishes are served in the form of tapas, which is great because you can share and try a bit of everything on the menu.Food was very good especially the fish. My favorite were the mackerel and tuna tartare. The fried chicken was nothing special and the spicy ramen was disappointing. The broth lacked depth and the noodles tasted like the instant kind. 

Gin and yuzu drink was refreshing and strong and my friend was satisfied with her bloody cesar. We couldn't resist ordering the green tea creme brulée for desert, the creme was good but I found the sugar crust too thick. 

Overall, I'd come back as the food was generally good, the service excellent and the price affordable. I just wouldn't order the spicy ramen again."}
{"text":"Ffffabulous Ramen! Was not expected to find an authentic japanese bistro there. I ate Ramen to die for!!! So good, so tasty with subtle flavor only found in Japan. This place is incredible!! Amazing menu created by chef Fujise san."}
{"text":"Small portions, high price, low flavor.... If you dont know how to cook asian dont... Better off for the ramen at saka-ba!"}
