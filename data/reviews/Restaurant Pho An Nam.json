{"text":"Edible. What we received was not what we ordered, but it was okay and we were hungry.  Probably not the best place for pho in the city..."}
{"text":"There is something about this place and drag queens. We ate there twice and there was a drag queen sitting next to our table at both times. Good looking ones. 

Food is good, service is excellent. Lemongrass chicken and basil friend rice are the winners here, followed by the coconut sticky rice dessert."}
{"text":"La soupe tonkinoise est excellente! Pour emporter, c'est génial, ils mettent le bouillon à part, alors c'est bien frais et chaud quand on arrive à la maison."}
{"text":"One of the best Viet restaurant in town. Cosy and modern place combine with an Asian environment. The food is super delicious and leave you unforgettable taste."}
{"text":"Not impressed at all!  Had very basic Viet dishes and they were completely lame, frozen vegetables in stir fry, iceberg lettuce was the most exotic fresh vegetable I saw. I am a Montreal visitor, I know there is good Vietnamese food here. This is not it!"}
{"text":"Allez-y pour les soupes repas, particulièrement la soupe Cochinchine aux crevettes.

Le seul point négatif c'est qu'il n'y a pas de porc au menu."}
{"text":"Tout prêt de mon travail, ce restaurant est ma solution quand je veux manger quelque chose de bon et très vite.

Je dirais qu'en moyenne, il faut 15 minutes pour que votre assiette arrive après la commande maximum ! Au moment du dîner, la place fourmille !

Depuis quelques temps, je commande par téléphone et vais le chercher pour ensuite le manger au boulot. Beaucoup moins bruyant, mais toujours aussi bon !

Je recommande le poulet sauce arachides et épinards frits avec les vermicelles de riz. Le reste viens toujours accompagné d'une soupe ou d'un rouleau impérial frit.

Bon appétit !"}
{"text":"The place is packed, a good Vietnamese restaurant. They also have Thai dishes and sea food.

Service was slow, we had to ask the waiter to check if our main dishes were ready.

I had a pho, it was good, XL size. It was worth the price. If you're near Saint Catherine east, I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Not my favourite vietnamese restaurant. But good option to have since i live right around the corner from it. Way too much msg in the food. Reasonable prices. But i guess it's one of the better ones around here."}
{"text":"It was delicious and authentic!  I had the Com bi cha thit nuong - and it was perfect!  My food-fussy fiance loved his dish - chicken and rice (it's always chicken and rice!)   

I can't wait to return to Montreal for some Vietnamese food!  Bon Appetit!"}
