{"text":"Excellent brunch. We shared the special. A pancake cooked in a cast iron skillet topped with chicken, potatoes and spinach.....mmmmhmm delicious.  And we shared the sticky bun. That was amazing. The experience was very tentative Jason the manager introduced himself and Jordan our server was super personable and friendly. I will be returning."}
{"text":"Overall the restaurant was nice! Great atmosphere. Service was off a little, but may have just been the change of shift. Not super welcomed by bar staff. But definitely will try again, and try the food!"}
{"text":"I've rented a room twice for some presentations in the back and it's awesome. Great venue. Flat screen TVs for demonstrations, the internet access is fast enough to do a live demo, room is spotless, the people are lovely."}
{"text":"My classical chamber ensemble, the Mill Ave Chamber Players, did a concert last week at the Newton. Not only is the space beautiful and adaptable to use in many different formations, but I can not say enough of how helpful Tanya and the staff were. It was a great space for our audience too: going to a concert, enjoying a glass of wine or beer AND browsing Changing Hands!  We will definitely be back at the newton!"}
{"text":"I held my wedding reception here in their event space. The event coordinator Tanya did a phenomenal job in making our wedding day extra special. All of my guests commented on how beautiful the venue was. The working fireplace, brick walls, and two gorgeous chandeliers made the space a perfect spot for a romantic and intimate wedding. The Southern Rail catered our reception and even made our wedding cakes. All of our guests thoroughly enjoyed their meals as evidenced by the numerous compliments. Again, Tanya and her team couldn't have done a better job listening to the wishes of my fiancee and I and making our day exactly as we imagined it would be. I highly recommend The Newton for any and all events!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, love the concept and location. The food itself is disappointing, the collard greens do not have bacon as described on the menu. The catfish was overdone and the cornbread was dry. The ambience and service is great, maybe come for drinks and skip the food?"}
{"text":"The NEWton is not new at all.  It's formerly- or still- known as the Southern Rail Restaurant which I had frequented a couple of times. It's really the plaza that is called the Newton.  It has the Changing Hands bookstore and the most pleasant garden store there. Three great places in one location. I enjoyed brunch with a few friends but nothing mouthwatering enough to marvel about.  Great service and ambiance with a chance that I'll return...sooner than later."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great food, friendly staff.  Bookstore has rare and hard to find books.  Restaurant has a cool fireplace outdoors.  Four peaks on tap at the bar inside the bookstore and at the restaurant.  Red velvet pancakes are to die for and the grilled cheese sandwich is so sinful!  You have to visit at least once!"}
{"text":"Loved it and the food was so delicious. My husband and I had a great time and the waiter was super friendly and knowledgeable."}
{"text":"Wonderful concept: multiple venues in one location. The service was friendly, as well as the quality of food.  A bit pricey.  I'd go back."}
{"text":"Great hangout! We didn't try the restaurant but we wandered around the bookstore and had a drink at the bar. Friendly service, an interesting selection of both new and used books, and fair prices on drinks. 1 star deducted for a crazy parking situation including a lot that was way too narrow to turn around in once I got to the end and realized there were no open spots and no way out other than backing all the way back out again."}
{"text":"This was one of the best restaurants I've had gone to in a while Erin one of the waiters was nice always prepared and was always in a happy mood."}
{"text":"Organized a girls night with Tanya and had a fabulous time. We had a great happy hour at Southern Rail and then rented a room for private astrology readings at the Newton. Tanya did an awesome job and we will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"This place is SO cool! Who knew Phoenix had so much style? (Sorry locals!) We held a private event at the Newton and they took great care of us. But the bookshop and restaurant were also awesome - we were so glad to impress our clients with this awesome spot. The food at the restaurant was also top notch - best chicken and dumplings I've had, even better than in the south."}
{"text":"Both times that I have been here, it was for a Meetup conference event of some sort. We sat in the large back room off the bar. It was comfortable, and acoustics were good. The bar server was friendly. The building, including the restaurant and book store, has a hip feel to it."}
{"text":"Great venue!  I was there for Kimberly Kingsley's book signing.  The book reading area is a great spot to host an event, it's intimate yet spacious."}
{"text":"Amazing Coffee from Guatemalia, and they have a Sea Salt Chocolate Chip Cookie, which is unbelievable, and on the side is a great restaurant and Changing Hands Books and Gifts, all local businesses"}
{"text":"I had an appointment at the Newton at 11:30AM to view an event space for baby shower and nobody ever showed up. I waited 25 minutes and had to leave. I'm sad I had planned my only lunch time of the day for this and was left disappointed."}
{"text":"Had a hot cup of coffee while waiting on a business meeting.  Friendly staff and pleasant environment.  Will be happy to visit the complex again."}
{"text":"Great venue and the best event planner that I have ever worked with.  She offered some very creative suggestions for my event.  On the day, she was cool, calm and made sure that everything flowed as planned."}
