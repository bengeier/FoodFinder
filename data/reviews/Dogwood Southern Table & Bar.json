{"text":"Food was excellent. Service was phenomenal. Atmosphere perfect for a special occasion."}
{"text":"Took work associates to dinner having found this restaurant online the night before. I live in Charlotte and had no idea this place even existed! Well, everyone loved the food and experience. I had our server choose the appetizers and none were left uneaten. The pimento cheese spread and bacon jam were by far the favorites but no one complained about his other choices.  If there's anything to complain about, and it's hard to find anything, it'd be the noise level. As the place filled up it was hard to hear across our own table.  Lastly, if you're going to complain about price just don't come here. You get what you pay for and here it's great food, great service, and a loud but friendly ambience."}
{"text":"Tried Dogwood for the first time for lunch, it was great! Food was wonderful, servers were very nice and the restaurant is gorgeous with a good vibe. Place was packed too. Highly recommend, it's our new favorite local place."}
{"text":"Had brunch here yesterday, and it's definitely the best brunch I've had in Charlotte.  Beignets were great.  Chicken & biscuit and walnut french toast were so good. Can't wait to go back and eat dinner."}
{"text":"This restaurant is part of the Dresslers Group (see my other reviews on their restaurants). I met my friend there on a weeknight and they tried to sit us along the banquette between 2 large parties and one of the parties had a baby. I don't think so. I asked to be moved to a quiet corner. We were then placed against the wall the farthest away from the hostess stand and could see the kitchen a little so it was much better. I ordered a cocktail called the 'pardon my french martini' for $13 (see pic). I give them an A+ for the taste and filling it to the tippy top of the glass. We both ordered french fries as sides and a main course each. However, the server brought out the french fries first so we started to eat them. Then the main course arrived 25 minutes later! (I know this exact timing because I took a phone picture of both as soon as they came to the table and can see the timestamp.) Why would Dogwood do this? Is that something you have to ask specifically that you want your side WITH your meal? Wouldn't you think that if you were ordering a side it would arrive when your main course arrives too? Is that too much to assume? Who has french fries as an appetizer? I had to ask the server where our main course was and if it was coming out of the kitchen soon. THAT IS NEVER GOOD to have a wait on a meal. Anyway, I got the pork chop and she go the fish special of the day (see pic). Both were good- with good food quality, but you definitely need to order and a la carte side because what is on the entree plate around the pork chop is really just a garnish and I didn't touch it.   Their website- I always look on a restaurant's website before the first time I ever visit so I am not fumbling around wasting time looking at the menu on the day and I can pay attention to the person I am with instead. I was confused by their website. At the top of the page, I clicked on 'menus'. Then on that page you see all these pictures of community suppers with pairings from local breweries. What is that about? Where is the regular menu? I am not part of your community and don't want to come to your supper.Well, if you look at the top of that page in tiny letters you see 'download current entrees' to see what they are serving on a nightly basis. Why wouldn't that be all over the page? Anyone? Anyone? Bueller? Definitely a head scratcher.   Overall, I give this restaurant 4 stars instead of 5 due to the potentially bad seating situation, the a la carte side item fries not served with the meal, and difficult website navigation."}
{"text":"Went with a large group last week the service was really good. 4 of us ordered the rib eye. It was flavorful but not the best cut. We all had to leave at least half of it on our plate. My husband had the scallops which he said were great. The cheesecake and pimento cheese were awesome."}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times on different occasions and the food and service have exceeded my expectations every time!  From the front door host, to the wait staff, to the bartenders, to the owners, everyone is well versed on the offerings and have treated me like a special guest every time.  The kitchen bar is fun if you like the interaction, the full bar is spacious and the dining room has a modern luxurious feel without losing coziness.  This is my new favorite in town!  Amazing dishes and drinks!  Foodie heaven!"}
{"text":"Nice place, good service .....had Brunch here .....Best French toast I have ever had :)    I wish they had few more options for vegetarians....."}
{"text":"Awesome lunch!!  NC flounder was perfect.   Sat at bar and had good lunch style of service.  Love the finish out and flow of the place. Well done."}
{"text":"Changed our Tip amount!!! This review would have been 4 or 5 stars because we had a great time at Dogwood, however our server was slow, possibly over-stretched during lunch so our tip reflected that. (13% instead of 15% tip). Later when our card statement showed the charge had cleared, someone had changed the tip amount to give themselves the full 15%. I figured this might be a mistake, so I called Dogwood to ask why the tip amount was changed. They said they would pull the receipt and email a scanned copy of it to me. Seven days later, that still has not happened.   Scott, emailed me to say \"I have not retrieved the signed copy of your credit card receipt.\" He goes on to say he will refund the amount or comp an appetizer or desert on our next visit. We weren't concerned with the amount, only that we had potentially been stolen from. When I pressed him to show the actual receipt, he did not respond (been a week so far and he did not respond to my email insisting he find and send me the receipt). He's crazy if he thinks he can drum up more business from us by comping an App or Desert after having our Tip changed.  If he would have sent us a copy of the receipt we could see if it was the restaurants mistake, in which case whoever changed our tip better be fired, or if it was our mistake, then this review would have been 4 or 5 stars.   So I will not recommend anyone go to Dogwood Southern table, or if you do, watch your card statement and match it to your copy of the receipt. I will not frequent a restaurant where someone steals tips when they did a bad job."}
{"text":"I'm a foodie and will say that this is one of the best meals I have had in awhile (pheasant with Brussel sprouts and fingerling potatoes). My friend had lamb, which was outstanding and I will order the next time I visit.  Simply: excellent cooks with notable dishes that requires a high attention to detail.  I will definitely enjoy future meals at Dogwood!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant.  Consistent and super fresh.  They know what they're doing over there.  I always have a good meal here!  The oysters are always super fresh and any fish dish you get here will be to die for.  One of my favorites in Charlotte."}
{"text":"This place gets the trifecta. Great food, service and ambiance. Menu options both for the kids and Adult menus were good. Food quality was fantastic. From the kids slow cooks pork ribs which were \"Texas good\" to the Bison Flank Steak and Ribeye. Owner/manager was involved in the experience but not over bearing.  Highly recommended even if you have kids."}
{"text":"Favorite dinner and Sunday Brunch of my Wife and I. Best, most inventive bartender in town. And great value for the money."}
{"text":"Always great! Never had a bad or even mediocre meal here. Baked pimento cheese, charcuterie plate, chorizo and squid, hush puppies are all fantastic appetizers. The pimento cheese and charcuterie are my favorites though. I had the wild boar and scallops last time and I have never had such delicious and tender scallops before! I could have eaten a whole steak of the wild boar. It was simply amazing. We had great service from both our waiter and the manager. Always have to finish a meal here with the carrot cake or toasted pound cake. We bring our own wine and pay the corkage fee (I think $10/bottle) since wine can quickly put your bill over the top. This is my favorite restaurant in Charlotte, hands down. Be prepared for a leisurely paced meal. We typically spend about two hours here, but usually come with friends so it makes for a fun night out. Atmosphere is a little loud for my liking, but food and service are 100% worth putting up with a little noise."}
{"text":"Unreal service. Ambiance and food was to die for!!  Would suggest bar keepers call. A great play on asking the bartender to service up what you'd like!!  The food was hand chosen and farm to table! Amazing all around"}
{"text":"It was my wonderful wife's birthday, and we decided at the last minute to grab a bite somewhere close to the house.  We had heard about the Dogwood, so we took a chance on somehow getting a table without a reservation at 8 on a Friday night.  We live near Southpark, so it was a very short drive over to the restaurant.   Valet parked and walked in to find the place packed, of course.  If it wasn't, I wouldn't want to eat there anyway! I took a chance and asked the host if there was any chance to get a table without an extended wait.  He suggested that we sit at one of the 8 seats right at the kitchen.  We both said \"why not?\", and we were showed us to seats.  They were those high top bar chairs, at a raised bar overlooking the kitchen.  Not exactly the most romantic of spots, but very fun.  After ordering drinks, we decided to order several appetizers and see how we felt after that.  We chose the fried oysters, the roasted oysters, and some crab/salmon cakes.  All of the dishes were great.  All during our grazing, the chefs continued to interact with us and throw us \"tasters\" of other dishes and sides.  One of the \"sample dishes\" was the roasted sweet potatoes in molasses.  It was so good that we ordered a side order!  The wait staff was pretty attentive but at one point neglected to bring us some bread - despite two requests.  Finally, three of the staff brought us three baskets of bread at one time!. It was delicious!  We were told that the Dogwood was a Dresslers restaurant, and one of the trademarks of a Dressler establishment is the fact that all their desserts are homemade.  Homemade in the sense that the owner's mother actually makes the cheesecakes and a few other desserts in her home kitchen! Not usually a big cheesecake lover, the waiter talked us into it as their most popular dessert.  It was heavenly.  Light and delicious.  All in all, we were extremely pleased with both the menu and the service.  Or waiter comped the cheesecake because they had overlooked the bread....  Great restaurant and a great evening."}
{"text":"Just ok.  Unfortunately, the food was pretty typical of my fine dining experience since moving here to Charlotte: not spectacular & I walk away feeling like I overpaid.  I ordered the scallops for my entree.  At $29 I thought it was a lil pricey.  I've had better for less.  For dessert I had the toasted pound cake which came with a scoop of vanilla gelato.  Again, just ok. When all said & done total bill $48 for entree, cocktail, & dessert.  I give 3 stars as the ambience and decor is very sleek and modern.  I would probably return to have a drink at the bar, but not much else."}
{"text":"So far so good...I am a fan of Dressler's, so when I heard there a new restaurant opening under the same owners, I couldn't wait to try it out. The chicken carbonara was really good - very creamy. I'll be back!!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere = 4 stars (Very loud, otherwise would have been 5 stars) Taste of Food = 4 stars (pork loin, shrimp n grits) Waiter Service = 5 stars iPad Beverage Service = 2 stars (clumsy, slows you down, hard to compare items) Bar atmosphere = 4 stars (looked happening) Price = 2 stars Value = 2 stars  ~$160 bucks for dinner for two people (includes 20% tip, 2 adults beverages and 2 desserts), isn't outrageous given the previously mentioned variables, but it's not anything close to a deal, that's for sure.  Yelp tells me this place is \"dressy.\"  I put on a tie for a 7:30 Friday night dinner reservation.  Wife put on a nice dress.  Kids at the table next to us were wearing tie-dyed t-shirts.  No joke.  Maybe they want it to be dressy, but I definitely didn't get a dressy vibe looking around.  Do I like this place?  Yeah, I liked it. Will I be back?  Nope - too many other equally good options for half the cost."}
{"text":"Service was excellent. Arugula salad good, but shrimp & grits is excellent! Large portions."}
{"text":"Dogwood does not disappoint. My husband and I have been looking forward to trying this restaurant out since moving to the area a few months ago. Our entire experience - from the moment we walked in the door - was perfect. In addition to excellent food, we loved the rustic-modern decor and the friendliness of the staff.   Because every dish on the menu is so appealing, we found it difficult to determine what to order. Should we get all small plates? Should we get entrees and share? Thankfully, our server (Kevin) offered a great suggestion - get 2 or 3 small plates, and split a salad and entree. This was perfect for the two of us and we truly loved every bite of each dish!  For our small plates, we ordered the crab pups and baked pimiento cheese. The crab pups were delicious and surprisingly light - a nice combo of hushpuppies and crab cake. We were especially excited for the pimiento cheese, which is an item that we like to try at every restaurant if it's available.  And of course, it was absolutely to die for. So creamy and the perfect ratio of spice and pepper to cheddar. It was a generous portion - suited well for a party of 4.   After the two small plates, we were glad that we decided to split the shrimp & grits. We both received hearty portions of creamy, beautifully seasoned grits topped with shrimp, chorizo and a light gravy. I loved how light the dish was; it wasn't smothered with overly spicy tomato sauce or cheese like many other versions of shrimp & grits out there.   Finally, we ended the night with the fluffiest, airiest, most delicious cheesecake either of us have every had. It has truly ruined us for other cheesecakes.   One last note on the excellent service we received. Besides having a very attentive and knowledgeable server, we also enjoyed the perfect timing of the service. Our glasses were always full, dishes were cleared in a timely manner, and the rate at which dishes arrived at our table was absolutely perfect.   This was a great experience for my husband and I, and we look forward to returning very soon. We'll be singing Dogwood's praises to all of our friends!"}
{"text":"Amazing dining experience from beginning to end. Cocktails are fabulous, food is creative and delightful on the palette. I love that many ingredients are locally sourced.  We don't often go the full 4 courses when dining out for dinner but this was exceptional. Mom's cheesecake is beautifully done, just as others have reviewed.  A new favorite for my visits to the Queen City."}
{"text":"I enjoyed eating here. Creative, delicious but pricey. It's worth a visit in my opinion.  Staff is friendly and makes you feel at home. Lots of local ingredients and well prepared food."}
{"text":"Best lunch in a long time and great service from Sarah. I really wanted a nice piece of fish like grouper or sea bass but it wasn't on the menu. Sarah checked with the chef and he was having grouper for a dinner special. He said no problem. All 4 of us got the grouper cooked to perfection with golden rice and charred tomatoes. Crab cakes, shrimp with chimichurri and fried oysters all great. Nice local beers and top of the line bourbon. We went with shots of Jim Beam room temperature! Chef came out and thanked us for ordering the grouper. Perfect lunch. Going back soon"}
{"text":"bacon jam is lovely. service is top notch, like all the Dressler joints. a little more attention to the seasoning and this place would be top notch."}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere, food was excellent, service was incredible and the owner on site! That's how a successful restaurant is run!"}
{"text":"Awesome night at Dogwood! Great service, drinks, and cheesecake. We ate several small plates and were very satisfied. Be willing to eat foods that are out of your comfort zone- you won't regret it. We will be going back to Dogwood very soon!"}
{"text":"Fantastic meal for lunch. Pimento cheese excellent. Order the Southern Burger! Wife enjoyed the blackened catfish. Well seasoned with a great bun. Nice quiet place since we were early for lunch. Got a great table by the window. We'll go back soon."}
{"text":"Loved the food and the service. I had the duck and was glad that they could sub a different vegetable. This duck was the best I've had in a long, long time! The only down side was that there wasn't enough light to see the food. We were seated in a nice cozy corner, but there wasn't any light near us. We were longing for at least a candle on the table or something."}
{"text":"Have been here 3 times now, twice for brunch and once for dinner.  The food is always good and the service is prompt and friendly.  We especially like this place for brunch and I definitely enjoy their bloody marys."}
{"text":"Went there for a business dinner and had the Oysters (too small and not very good) couple other starters that were avg to good nothing great. Had the soft-shelled crab that was just okay . I really wanted to like this place so actually went back the next day for lunch. Had the fried oysters and they came sitting in grease the lettuce wrap which was good. (could use some type of sauce, also the shrimp the sauce on the shrimp was great  but over all just an average lunch maybe a little below if you factor in cost. The staff was great. I'll give it another try, but just one"}
{"text":"Great new place in South Park.  It was kinda small but the food and the service was great.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"Just a review on the bar as I didn't eat.   Great bar in Southpark. Drinks a little pricey, but in line with Southpark.   The food looked good, but didn't eat."}
{"text":"The Dogwood is awesome!  Went with my girlfriend on a Friday night. Unknown to us, it was the start of Restaurant Week.  I called ahead earlier and the host told us the seats available were at the Kitchen Bar, but assured us it's an experience. So we went for it, and he was right!  We pull up to the complimentary valet parking and they were very professional and friendly. Went inside and the place was electric. Packed with people, but in a good way.  We were taken to our seats which were right by the appetizer prep station.  The Restaurant Week menu had 3 apps, 3 entrees, and 3 deserts to choose from for your meal for $40. We ordered the Roasted Muscles and Tomatoes & Goat Cheese to start. My first time trying muscles and they were amazing.  The goat cheese was also incredible! The coolest thing was watching them be prepared right in front of us and talking with the chef.  For the entrees, I had the Pork Loin and my GF had the Grouper.  Both were awesome. We finished up with a slice of the Toasted Pound Cake which was a perfect cap to the meal, or so we thought.  Our server, who was stellar all night, hooked us up with a slice of cheesecake on the house! Fantastic!  Our server was super friendly and helpful throughout the night. I had to run out to make a phone call and he kept my gf company for a couple minutes.  The guys behind the Kitchen Bar were great to talk to and would hand us samples of the different appetizers throughout the meal. We got to try the Succotash and the Pan Fried Sweet Potatoes, as well as some cured pork they had on display.  Highly recommend the sweet potatoes!  Great meal, amazing service, can't wait to go back. Definitely top 5 meals of my life."}
{"text":"This is the second time I've tried to have dinner at the bar. I was waiting for a friend, and they weren't terribly busy, but I still sat there for 10 minutes and neither bartender offered me a drink. I left and told my friend to meet me at The Palm. The first time wasn't much better. 15 minutes to get a drink and another 25 to receive our app, which was shrimp. It was tiny and overpriced. Done with them."}
{"text":"Went for brunch on Sunday morning - overall, waitress was polite but food was horrible and we were misled into ordering $20 worth coffee between two people.  Positives: - Food was served promptly - They were accommodating in making a vegetarian meal option (substituted fruit for bacon)  Negatives:  - ALL the food was too salty. All I could taste in the eggs and biscuits was salt. An hour later, I can still taste salt in my mouth. The grits were good, but the rest of the meal was disgusting.  - We were offered \"coffee\" (in quotation marks because it wasn't otherwise qualified), and then charged $3 (plus tax) for each cup thereafter as an \"Americano.\" Waitress never offered, nor did we order, an Americano or specialized drink. She kept offering more \"coffee,\" and given that customarily at American brunch, regular coffee is chargeable ONCE with nonchargeable refills, it was reasonable to assume that this is what we had ordered. $20 later, we were misled - by omission - into ordering 5 cups of subpar machine coffee. This is incredibly disingenuous, and frankly, offensive.  I had heard great things about this restaurant. Will definitely not be going back."}
{"text":"Another really good experience, this place is consistently very good.  Management knows how to run a restaurant.  Food was excellent, service was pretty good.  Very close to being a five star experience, but service had several stumbles that made it just below.  Had a house made charcuterie plate which was excellent.  Four or five homemade sausages that were interesting and different, all really good and well presented.  For entrees we had a scallop and boar special which was truly special and a bone in strip that was very good.  Everything was well cooked and well seasoned.  Added a side of the collard greens which are the best I've ever had - rich and nutty with a splash of heat.  Finished up with a homemade carrot cake and coffee both of which were excellent.  Service was friendly and mostly good.  Waited a few times, for drinks, between courses, and for an extended period after we got the check (ya know when you don't get card out in time and the server bolts?  Yeah, that).  Overall great experience and thisclose to being perfect.  Will keep coming back ."}
{"text":"Best dinning experience ever~!Great food and great service! Definitely one of my favorite restaurants now!"}
{"text":"Underwhelming & incorrectly priced.   Ambiance: They were hosting Wesley Walls birthday party in the room next to the bar. That took up basically the entire bar so there was no place for us to get a drink before our 8pm reservation. Very LOUD! Impossible to hear anyone you are speaking to at the bar and in the dining room you can't enjoy your company if you are in a large party, as all tables as rectangle.   Food: overpriced & underwhelming. $35 for 4 scallops. $42 for a ribeye that was 30% fat. Brussels sprouts were almost to salty to eat. Only stand out was macaroni & cheese. Everything else tastes like you would get from the frozen section of Harris Teeter.   Service: we had a party of 8 & the waiter tried his best to keep up. However he yelled down our throats the entrées because it was so loud in there and never let us ask any questions regarding the flavors."}
{"text":"Came in for a pre-mother's day dinner with my husband and our daughter. We love Dressler's and we thought we would check this place out since it has the same owners. Sat on the patio to enjoy the weather. Great ambiance inside and out. Started out with the house made chips and onion dip; it was just okay. We should have tried some of the other snacks and small plates offered. For our entrees I had the shrimp and grits with I really enjoyed; the shrimp were a great size and perfectly cooked. My husband had the special of the evening which was snapper. It definitely missed the mark: very fishy and overly salty (and I like salty food). Found the prices to be reasonable and comparable to restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"I'm traveling in Charlotte for work and Dogwood was recommended by a fellow colleague. I thought the ambiance and decor were on point. It's brand new building, but feels rustic at the same time. Great location- basically next door to Whole Foods. I came on a Monday night so parking was easy. No wait either.  Service was excellent. My waiter and the manager were stellar- very friendly and professional. I love that you can order drinks on their iPad menu.   My local lettuce salad was delicious but 1/2 way into it I wished it had a gourmet soft cheese on it- like goat, humboldt fog, etc..  For my entree I ordered the Heritage pork loin with apple chutney, grits, and mustard greens! Wow- for a farm-to-table restaurant I thought the portion size was bigger than than normal. Again, the dish was delicious but I think it could have used a bit more spice and flavor. Like maybe more clove & cinnamon in the apple chutney. More tangy mustard seed in the greens, and maybe some cheese in the grits. The pork loin was perfect though- a crisp outer layer, moist on the inside not over cooked.   I would definitely return next time I'm in town. Would love to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"This edition of Excited about Eating takes us to a large mixed community in the South Park area of Charlotte, to Dogwood Southern Table & Bar. This contemporary eating establishment offers \"elevated southern cuisine\" using in-house creations from local and sustainable sources.  Dora here. Because it was Father's Day and we didn't make reservations, our only seating options were the patio or the bar. Glorious day, beautiful patio, no brainer.    For an appetizer, we chose the Maw Maw's Biscuits served with butter and jam. The biscuits were great, crusty on the outside and soft on the inside. Adding the butter and jam made for an outstanding bite. Dora here. When I lifted the linen and saw the charred tops on these biscuits, I considered asking for another basket, but hubby usually orders everything extra crispy, so he was thrilled. No worries! Even with the toasted tops, these biscuits were great. Buttery flavor, crumbly, and had to eat with a fork. Good to the last fork!  For my meal, I chose the Steak and Eggs. Normally, it's sirloin, but this day it was prime rib, green beans, potatoes, and spinach served with an easy-over egg on top. The prime rib was cooked a perfect medium rare, tender and juicy. The crispy potatoes and veggies paired well with the dish. I am not one who usually orders steak out, but I would definitely order this dish again.  Dora here. Whenever a place serves only brunch on the weekend, I'm usually ready for a dilemma. Give me my cereal or an English Muffin with peanut butter and jelly for breakfast and I'm good. When I go out for lunch, I want lunch, so I opted for the Breakfast Burger today. I appreciated all the individual components: scrambled egg, cheddar, bacon jam, incredibly soft bun. But together? Not so much. And it turns out I'm not a fan of grass-fed beef. Something about the flavor just messed with my taste buds. Who'd have guessed? Hubby liked it.  What's your favorite brunch dish/place? We'd love to know! ~Ernie & Dora Hiers, Fiction Faith & Foodies Blog http://bit.ly/2tbY8bB"}
{"text":"Great food, service, menu and atmosphere!  The Rosemary lemonade drink is incredible.  Everything we had was cook to perfection - pimento cheese dip, scallops, lamb chop, succotash and chocolate fudge pie with peanut butter gelato!  Great for special occasions because it's a bit pricey."}
{"text":"Dogwood is great! Wonderful cocktails, friendly staff, great food. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"We had an excellent experience at Dogwood.   We came in after dinner at home for a cocktail. The atmosphere was beautiful, and the staff was incredibly friendly.   The bartender, who is definitely trained in his craft, took time to recommend drinks. He explained the difference between some of their higher-end whiskeys and made delicious drinks.   During our visit both the manager and owner stopped by to say hello and introduce themselves. We felt very appreciated for our business, and this was on a busy Saturday night.   We can't wait to return for dinner."}
{"text":"Incredible pasta with vegetables in balsamic sauce.  My wife had the steak small plate, she very much liked it.  Cheesecake incredibly light and tasty.  Very friendly staff.  Will definitely return when I am back in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Local food, friendly staff, casual yet upscale decor and feel. I am in love. Can't wait to go back to try the lunch menu! We had a glass of wine and split three starter plates and were blown away. The duck was amazing, as were the ribs, and my boyfriend loved the bison tartar. I'm so glad we said yes to the sorbet special (raspberry margarita, mango ginger ale, and blackberry pepper) the mango and blackberry especially were amazing flavor combinations, and I'm usually all about the chocolate desserts."}
{"text":"Hands down! The best customer service in South Park! I can go to an other restaurant in Charlotte, including one of the 3 surrounding restaurants around Dogwood. I chose Dogwood!   Brian, Brittany, & Joanne are the best bar tenders in Charlotte! Scott, awesome management! I bring clients, friends, family here every chance I get! It helps that I live upstairs."}
{"text":"Excellent from start to finish. We arrived shortly after 5:00 on a Wednesday afternoon. A few people were already seated at the bar but we were the first to be seated at a table. Brad, our waiter, was prompt to greet us and share with us a history of the restaurant. We ordered a beer, a hard cider and boiled peanuts to start us off. Brad explained the specials to us and was very knowledgable when it came to answering our questions. We ordered the roasted mussels (a starter), tiger fish, (a special), roasted sweet potatoes, (a side), squash and kale (a special). Each dish was large enough to share and each dish was absolutely delicious!  For dessert we shared the toasted pound cake with a scoop of vanilla gelato. Again, it was ample for 2.   A wonderful evening, delicious food, excellent service, nice atmosphere, we will go back!"}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant.    Started with a goat cheese arugula kale salad topped with blackberrries.   Main course highly recommend the wild boar. Incredible flavors"}
{"text":"From the moment we sat down our waiter Mitch was extremely attentive. We tried several of the appetizers and the NC oysters were a hit! The beer selection is quite extensive! I can't say enough about our entrees which were delicious and then dessert to top it off. The cheesecake..:amazing!"}
{"text":"When I think of Southern table I think of a wooden picnic table with a red and white picnic clothe table cover with pitchers of lemonade and sweet tea both freshly squeezed and brewed.  This place is far from that, it's more upscale than the name and the dining space. My husband and I have dined here about four or five times now. Twice with friends we introduced to this place and other times on DATENIGHT and on our anniversary. The service is stellar and the menu is pretty simple and broken down very clearly. The staff is knowledgeable and very personable from our many experiences. Our favorite items from the menu includes the fried oyster appetizer, any fish that is on the chefs special feature for the evening, the salads are all tasty and our favorite dessert is the grilled pound cake with vanilla ice cream.  The oysters are fries to perfection the only issue we have with them is THE PORTION is TOOOO SMALL.  This place is great for DateNight, lunch with friends, a group outing or just because. Some of the portion sizes could increase for the appetizers but hey they are appetizers not the main course :-)"}
{"text":"Return visit for lunch & I was thrilled with the roast chicken, berry, walnut salad which they subbed with goat cheese for me! Good portion & We had the starter pork belly lettuce wraps & a bottle of lovely white wine. Excellent service!"}
{"text":"You have to try the Baked Pimento Cheese and the Bacon Jam! Awesome!!  Great service and a nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"My friend and I visited Dogwood one weeknight and were able to walk right in. I had come on the recommendation of a friend. I have been to Dresslers countless times but was looking forward to trying a more modern, elevated farm to table menu. Word of warning to the ladies: Weeknights are full of tables of dudes (I assume business meetings) who leer at you as you walk by, even if you're wearing modest, business attire.  Despite being a new spot, the interiors are quite underwhelming. I expected a \"wow\" factor like the awesome wood wall of wine in the Met location but there was nothing special about the very chain feeling restaurants. They had photos of the farms that the food allegedly came from, but no labels, so it looked like a bunch of random photos if you didn't know. Similarly, the menu didn't have any mention of what farms anything came from, so I think that was a missed opportunity. The thing that particularly bothered us about the interior- it was incredibly loud so we had a hard time having a conversation. As a result, I would not recommend it as a good first date place!  The bar menu is perusable on an ipad which is either cool or off-putting depending on your style. I tried a Moscow Mule which was lovely and my friend tried one drink that was not to her taste so she switched to a rosemary lemonade.   When looking at the menu I surprisingly had a really hard time finding what to order because I don't eat pork and much of menu is pig-related or cheese related (my friend is lactose intolerant). Some of the dinner snacks looked good but it was late so we went straight for the entree. I believe their menu changes quite regularly, which is good for seasonality but bad if you find something you like that you'd like to order again.   I ordered the cioppino like a good San Franciscan, and it was a little different than traditional, but I really enjoyed it. The seafood wasn't cooked to death and was very tender. it seemed like a good value at $18 because the seafood was plentiful. I always like a cioppino with a nice sourdough of course, but a crusty paisano bread is a passable accompaniment.  My friend had a trout with quinoa and ramps (why are ramps so popular all of a sudden?) and the trout was lovely with a very flavorful topping, but the quinoa was terribly bland. The dessert menu was lacking anything interesting, so we skipped dessert (which never happens).  The service started great but then fell off and it wasn't clear who was our server. It took a good 20 minutes to get our credit card back to sign. At the end of the meal, we both wondered if we'd return."}
{"text":"Delicious meal drinks and nice atmosphere waiter Kevin was attentive n down to earth. Def would visit again!"}
{"text":"One of the best foodie places in Charlotte. Literally never had a bad meal here and the menu is creative and delightful. Put it on your list for your next night out."}
{"text":"I like butter and salt a lot but man his place must think that is all it takes to make cuisine southern. The service was nothing short of amazing; however, I was a little disappointed in the food. I come from a southern family but I felt like their southern food was a little over \"southernized.\" Everything was super heavy and most of my meal came with us in a To Go box. I left feeling like I needed a Pepto Bismol. It was just too heavy and perhaps overly trendy southern for me. I did feel like they really aimed to please though. They graciously brought me a different champagne when the first one I ordered was too sweet for me. Next time I'll probably stick to small plates. I ordered the short rib at the server's recommendation and I just didn't like it. My husband ordered the shrimp and grits and loved it. We started with the pimento cheese which normally I love but I didn't care for theirs. I'm probably the only person who is not a huge fan of this restaurant."}
{"text":"Great service! My wife had the Southern Rice Bowl with pork belly and greens, it was very good.  I had their take on a Ruben with house smoke pastrami, on the 5 best I've every had."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant, you can feel the similarities to the other one run by the same owners. Smaller than I expected, but in an intimate way. We tried Mother's Day brunch - excellent. Fantastic fried oysters, super shrimp and grits and one of the best cheese cakes I've ever had for dessert. It is not a value place -  the only reason I can't give it a fifth star is because they charged us $2.75 for a glass of iced tea, which to me should have been included when paying $40 bucks per person for 3 course lunch."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Dogwood for the first time on 3/23/18 and had a wonderful experience!  It was SO GOOD we went back the very next night.  We ate and drank at the bar where we received superb service each time!  The food and cocktails were amazing and the staff working behind the bar are all true professionals.  Each one highly skilled, and extremely friendly.  My husband and I were both blown away especially by Brian and Jo Ann's hospitality.  They each share a passion for their craft, and both have a wonderful way of making their customers feel very special!  I cannot wait to visit Charlotte again, so we can head back to Dogwood Southern Table & Bar.  BTW-Brian was voted best bartender in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"I can't stop speaking The Dogwood's praises after stopping in for dinner last week. The owners, Tim and Scott, are so pleasant and welcoming, and really provided great knowledge and information about the mission and culture of The Dogwood.   While they describe themselves as a \"modern Southern kitchen,\" I would also add that they have culminated a local, rustic atmosphere, similar to a modern barn. They have beautiful brick columns and a wooden stable, where you can feel like you're enjoying the farm to fork cuisine in a modern day barn.   The Dogwood offers 80 different bourbons, making them the largest collector of bourbon in Charlotte. The menu offers a variety of bourbon flights. Speaking of spirits, they also offer a variety of craft cocktails, and on Wednesdays, they do a cocktail night where you can taste the bartender's new concoction of the week for only $5.00!! And, they do $5.00 burgers and $1.00 oysters M-F during happy hour!  To start, you should order the bacon jam, a simple yet complex dish. The bacon jam is made with only 5 ingredients, including coffee grinds, and gives you that hint of sweet and savory simultaneously. It's served with country bread to soak up it's goodness.   If you're into tartars, the bison tartar was fabulous. The house mustard gave it an entirely different complexity, and helped balance some of the saltiness. It's served with a quail egg on top that provides more savory flavors to soak up the rest.    I can never pass up scallops, so we went with the scallop dish for our main meal. The combination of flavors would have been good on their own without the scallops! Served over butternut, kale, fingerling potatoes with an oxtail marmalade, this dish was heaven!!   For dessert, please and I repeat, please do not miss out on Mom's Cheesecake, which is a secret recipe from Mrs. Dressler, made in her own kitchen! It is the best cheesecake you'll ever have the pleasure of biting into. You know how you can order cheesecakes and sometimes they're a little bit frozen in the middle, or they are too lumpy? Not this one. The consistency is impeccable and your fork goes straight through. It's smooth, creamy and rich, with a perfect graham crust.   They also do seasonal sorbet's and gelato, made in house. We tried the tahini gelato, which was definitely different and not something I'd typically order. It wasn't overly tahini flavored, which surprised me. It was good, but I much preferred the strawberry rhubarb sorbet, which was refreshing, fruity, and the perfect combination of tart and sweet. I'd eat that any day of the week!  Until next time, Dogwood.."}
{"text":"I think I found my new favorite restaurant in CLT. The staff was courteous. They knew the menu well, made excellent recommendations and the food was a 10/10 every course. We started with the smoked trout with capers. Absolutely incredible! We also had the braised beef ribs with forbidden rice. I can't imagine anything better on the menu. I could eat it everyday. We also enjoyed the steak cut fries and cheesecake. By far the best cheesecake I've ever had. Such an amazing experience. The cappuccino was also perfect. Better than any coffee house.   The Childress blueberry desert wine was very sweet and very good. I hope anyone who lives in CLT takes advantage of this amazing dining experience!"}
{"text":"Dogwood's is a pretty solid dinner spot. I've been here a few times and each experience has been a good one with great service and delicious food.   On our past visit, I met some girlfriends and we decided to eat at the chef's table and watch them prepare the food. Such an awesome experience...id recommend it to anyone!   We started with a sampling of the pork belly and it was heavenly. Next up, we got to sample some bacon jam which if you haven't tried and you're a bacon lover (like me) you NEED to try it. It was so good! Every single bite got better and better.   For our meals we ordered the short rib, macaroni and cheese, pork ribs and fries.   Don't judge us!   I'd absolutely order every single dish again. The short ribs were tender and juicy the macaroni was cheesy goodness and the fries are hand cut and served up hot with both ketchup and aioli. Can you say winning?   If you haven't tried this place, definitely check them out. The menu is pretty awesome and they have different specials each week!   *Oh, they just added beignets to the brunch menu!  You're welcome!"}
{"text":"Such a fancy place!! I loved it!! The service was excellent even though the place was jammed pack. I had the duck n dumplings which was a delight! I also tried the scallops and wild boar and it was excellent. I can't remember the last time I had such good food. A must go place for sure. I'll be bringing everyone I know to this place!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in Charlotte, great atmosphere, awesome fresh food and a great wine selection. Coffee is amazing and locally produced"}
{"text":"What a terrific find on our trip to Charlotte. This place was outstanding but reservations strongly recommended. Had basically every appetizer my favorite was the duck and dumplings. Trout was delicious the wild boar and scallops delicious! The mahi-mahi delicious, zero complaints!  Must try their version of the old fashion which is infused with smoke. Right up there with New York restaurants."}
{"text":"I had never heard of Dogwood until I saw it on a best brunch list. It exceeded my expectations. For the quality of food I believe the price is right on. Plus they offer bourbon flights! Our server JT was above and beyond attentive and helpful.  I ordered the Crab Cake Benedict as suggested. It was amazing and quite filling. I would highly recommend putting this on your must try list. I also could not resist trying the French toast. I really enjoyed slightly crunchy batter. It's a huge portion and sinfully delicious. The coffee is french press and enough for two cups. I would suggested going earlier because the noise gets a little loud when they start to fill up. It's a very inviting atmosphere and they have a neat bar area that faces the kitchen. I can't wait to come back and try their dinner menu. JT also informed us that they have really cool events that feature different chefs and drinks."}
{"text":"I've been here 4 times. The food itself is generally quite good, its the service that has consistently held this place back. They just appear to be pretty understaffed whenever we eat here for lunch; we've had the same waiter a few times who is just not very friendly and does not treat us very well. He will not tell us anything about the specials and then a minute later he is at another table and tells them about the same specials in much greater detail. Also I have never had a waiter who did not come by later to ask how the food was once it came out. Unbelievable especially at a more upscale restaurant. It also took quite a while for the food to come out. My chicken pasta looked very unappetizing but everyone else in my group's food was very nice. If they had more and better service here this place would be great. I am glad they do not have gender neutral restrooms, I am not sure why yelp is even asking such a stupid question."}
{"text":"We chose here for restaurant week, and...it's a winner!   Someone made mention that it was \"on par\" with Treehouse.  Now having been here, I put it a couple of notches up, especially with how nice it is inside and the ambiance.  It feels more cozy and welcoming.  I believe we tried almost a little bit of everything:  Drinks: Rum Old Fashioned - Possibly the best one I've had in Charlotte, it is my go-to drink. Tito's Mule - This one started out watered down, so we sent it back.  What came back was spot on perfect. Chardonnay - Why bother when the mixed drinks are so good?  Openers: Pimento Cheese - To die for.  Melted, lots of pimento, with crispy bread. Bacon Jam - Better than to die for.  I ended up eating most of mine with a spoon. Arugula Salad - My wife had this.  Not sure why when we had the above but OK we got some greens.  I had a bite, it was good but...see above.  Mains: Trout - Heard it was delicious. Duck - Heard it was delicious. Sirloin - Hmm.  Possibly a stumbling point.  We ordered two, Medium Rare and Medium.  They came out the same, and if anything they were RARE and a bit rubbery.  Could be the cut.  At least the leftovers should reheat well without killing it.  Sides: Macaroni & Cheese - Quite good! Collard Greens - I've yet to like these, so my opinion is moot.  Heard they were a bit over the top with vinegar, though.  Desserts: Pots de creme - Solid. Carrot cake - Good. Cheesecake - Downright awesome.  Light.  Fluffy.  The waiter made mention that most \"things\" (e.g. bitters, ginger beer, and more) are homemade, and this becomes perfectly clear early and often.  Speaking of our waiter, \"James from Cleveland\" was great.  He is a wealth of information, made fantastic recommendations, and everything was right on time and as it should be.  By the way, if you check in on yelp you may get a coupon for a free dessert.  I saved mine for next time :)  We are glad to have tried Dogwood for restaurant week, and are looking forward to coming back soon!!"}
{"text":"My new fav in Charlotte! Amazing service caps off delicious meals and deli able tastes!  Love the changing menu.  The bar staff service level is amazing and friendly as well.  Great place!"}
{"text":"We were in town and I found this restaurant through yelp.  I was very impressed with the service.  They were able to push our reservation back day of and our server Samantha was very attentive and funny.   The food was superb. My husband really enjoyed the North Carolina Oysters and his Kansas City bone in Strip.  The portion was massive but it was cooked perfectly and he managed to eat every last bite. I had the chicken and it was really well cooked as well.  The menu changes a ton because they use locally sourced ingredients.  We also really enjoyed the pan fried sweet potatoes.  I hope they keep it ok the menu.   Next time I come to Charlotte I'd like to come back."}
{"text":"Very interesting concept. Southern favorites with a special twist. Everything about this place was wonderful. To me, the best part was the \"story\" behind everything they serve. All locally sourced - less the wine b/c apparently N.C. wines aren't so good. If you've got a few bucks squirreled away for a white tablecloth dinner, give them a try. Oh yeah, free valet parking too!"}
{"text":"What an awesome place. We ate at bar and had several of the small plates which were fantastic. Great food, great staff and great craft cocktails. Our bartender brian was amazing. 6 stars"}
{"text":"Very good ....  clean ...modern ...... food quite decent .... good cocktail list...will go again ...."}
{"text":"Went on a Wednesday night 2/11/2015 (dodged a bullet) and the place was packed.  We ended up in the bar because the dining room was full (7:30pm), which was not too bad but we were seated behind a stone column. I ordered the pork lion that came on a bed of cheese grits and greens.  The pork lion with the apple chutney was very good but the grits were cold.  Need to mentioned the pork lion was a bit on the salty side and grits were congealed.  My friend had the sirloin steak, which look like something from outback but he said it was good.  Will I go back..hmm. Not sure on a regular bases but if I do, I will be a little more attentive to the temperature and food quality.  Also, need to add another $ sign to the summary, it is a $$$ not a $$"}
{"text":"Yelp is so off for this one and so disappointed after a long drive to settle for mediocrity.  Also it is way more expensive then was expecting. So in short let me save you 200 dollars and go somewhere else.   From beginning to end it was just mediocre. Had octopus and chorizo which was ok but does not mix well to me. The broth was decent and flavorful. The raw oysters were good but the dogwood ones with chorizo were eh. Had the scallops and wild boar. Let me tell for 40 bucks you get 4 bites of salty off tasting pork. The scallops with the sauce were cooked right and good. The vegetables with the dish were also good. The espresso martini was also a miss as it was more watery then others I've had and not creamy. Even my buddy said his entree of trout was no good. Guess you are paying for the surrounding atmosphere. Skipped dessert as just had a high probability of being unexciting as the whole meal was."}
{"text":"My husband and I had the pleasure of dining at Dogwood last night. When we walked in, the lovely aroma of great food let us know the evening would be well spent! The space is attractive and homey without falling into 'country kitch'. Our server, Rebecca, was pleasant and knowledgeable. We started with a Wagyu beef appetizer which was very good, then moved on to duck (DELICIOUS!!) and wild boar chops (YUM!) A great bottle of red, suggested by Rebecca, took this stellar meal to the next level. We even had dessert, a rarity for us, cheesecake and toasted pound cake - both divine. We will certainly go back the next time we are in town!"}
{"text":"My wife and I came across Dogwood during restaurant week. We came in without reservations, but we were seated at the kitchen bar within 10 min. Our waiter, Atto was super friendly and always on top of things. My wife had the flounder and I had the pre-fix steak. We were treated with complimentary appetizer, gelato specially made by the sue chef, and a desert. The only reason I didn't go with five stars was the price, a little on the expensive side but worth it. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place was unbelievable from start to finish! We walked in and it was restaurant week.. unbeknownst to us. I was visiting my hometown from San Diego last minute. (For a funeral) The manager did his absolute best to get us settled in the bar area. It was my Moms 72nd bday and it was an impromptu outing. She doesn't like sitting at the bar, but here it was different. We saddled up and immediately felt at home. Clean bar with warm welcoming faces smiling at us. The crafting of the cocktails was something to behold. Muddling, slicing, burning cedar chips, preparing fruits and garnishes, etc. Impeccable. We decided to eat at the bar as well. We ordered shrimp and grits, crab and chorizo hush puppies, fried oysters, golden beets and baked sweet potatoes.    E V E R Y bite was unreal. Best shrimp and grits I've ever had and I'm southern as can be. They ended up giving us complimentary drinks in honor of my Mom and a delicious chocolate desert to boot. Usually sitting at the bar you get dodgy service and not so great attention to detail. I have travelled the world and dined out a LOT and they know what they are doing here. Amazing customer service and attention to detail. Thank you guys for making my Mom's Birthday night so special, one that we will never forget. And thank you for accommodating us on such a hectic night and making us feel like valued clientele. Needless to say, we will be back and you should go now! You'll feel like part of the family. Cheers!"}
{"text":"There is really nothing bad to say about dogwood. The food is amazing, the cocktails are amazing and the service is always phenomenal!"}
{"text":"Dogwood Southern Table was so good! We went for a business dinner and had a reservation for 8. The table was ready when we arrived and we were seated immediately.    The server came around and took our drink orders quickly. Someone asked and if they had Pappy Van Winkle and they actually did!!! The moment someone was interested in Pappy the server went and got the F&B manager to discuss the purchase, type and other options. They ended up having a bottle of 20 year Pappy and many other rate bourbons. My coworkers decided to order something else the F&B manager suggested and they really enjoyed it. The F&B manager literally sat down with the interested coworkers and had a detailed 10 minute conversation.   That service was definitely above and beyond.  The food was also excellent.  I liked the palmetto cheese spread appetizer the best but everything was wonderful and all at the dinner raved about the food, drinks and experience."}
{"text":"Cozy and pretty atmosphere and a sophisticated atmosphere. Nice for a special occasion lunch or a date night."}
{"text":"On vacation in South Park when we decided to get a small bite to eat. We had the pork cheeks, hush puppies and the calamari (I believe). All were great dishes especially the pork cheeks. The service was great and the local beer was excellent. Very dark lighting with a welcoming atmosphere. I would return if I were on a longer vacation."}
{"text":"Do not let the location in a new mixed use development deter you:  this is a great restaurant.  The missing 5th star is due only to ambiance, which I found to be a little too sterile/cold for a gastro-Southern space. But the service was exceptional, as was the food and drink.  The boiled peanuts with Kosher salt were awesome.  The baked pimento cheese app was killer. Bottled wine well priced and nicely curated.  Pound cake dessert you Yelpers raved about lived up to its expectations. The best:  Brain, a manager, gladly answered my question about the Hendrick's infused blackberry gin.  Then he proceeded to provide a sample (excellent) along of that with samples of their house infused bourbon and a luscious port dessert wine.  Can't wait to go back. I'll also try their 2 other locations."}
{"text":"Sit at the counter if you can, best seat in the house.  Food was great, service was fine.  Went back the next week for oyster happy hour."}
{"text":"Another home run find on Yelp. They had a very interesting Prix Fixe menu for Mother's Day. Every single it was superior. Jocelyn gave us outstanding friendly service. Owner and managers cam by to assure all was well.   These folks do good food and drink."}
{"text":"I have been several times since they opened. Very clean, & comfortable. Always have GREAT service & a great atmosphere.   The drink menu comes to you on a electronic tablet, & the food is great & original, if you don't know what to get-ASK. The staff is very personal, so much that since my 1st visit the owner has always made a point to come up, shake my hand & just talk even if they seem to be very busy.   I even walked in an hour before they opened at 3:30 on a Sunday. The staff let me come in & finish watching the Panthers game. Simple things like this keep me coming back & earned my business. I've recommended to several friends also & they have all raved about how great the entire experience is.  Only thing is construction right now is blocking some close parking so you might have to walk further than you'd think, however, you can always valet if you wanted."}
{"text":"Pros: Excellent service, delicious specials off the menu (don't forget to ask for that), I had turkey sandwich with fries it was nice, moist and yummy. Nice restaurant setup and location.   Cons: Limited menu, nothing southern about the food, bad parking."}
{"text":"Fabulous restaurant! Wonderful atmosphere and food though a little loud when it fills up and reservations are a must on the weekend. We shared the hushpuppies, baked pimento cheese, and octopus and chorizo appetizers. By far, the octopus and chorizo was the table favorite. Don't be alarmed, when they say octopus, they use the whole octopus tentacle to bell. Ask your server for extra bread to soak up the marinade. The lamb was perfectly cooked as was the wild boar. The NC Flank and Duck leg (tonight it was boar in place of bison) came with a nice balsamic glazed and roasted corn salad. This kitchen sets the example of how to cook scallops. Perfectly seasoned and lightly seared. Most of the desserts are old recipes from the Chef's mother. The cheesecake is my recommendation. It has the flavor of a New York cheesecake but in contrast, it's light and fluffy. The lightest cheesecake I've ever had. It makes me disappointed in my cheesecake attempts at home. Overall great restaurant and I'll be back when I'm in Charlotte again."}
{"text":"This new \"farm-to-table\" inspired restaurant was nothing short of delicious!  From the atmosphere, decor, service, and food- I was very satisfied! They even had a complimentary valet!  I discovered this place on Yelp! And thought it would be a great place to try- so I booked my reservation right on my phone. Easy Peasy!  I went with a group and we tried many different entrees and appetizers ... And I don't believe there was a crumb left on anyone's plate! Everyone was super satisfied with their dish. I had the scallops and they were cooked to perfection- a nice sear on either side, with delicious flavor and the sauce and sides all worked really well! I'm already excited about going back and I'd recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"Omg, this place is amazing. I frequent The Capital Grille, Palm and Dresslers.. Serving all locally sourced food this is an amazing trip through the Tarheel  state. The place feels like home, the staff truly care that you feel welcome. You MUST try this... Just do it!"}
{"text":"Really great spot with excellent food and fantastic service.  This bustling place is for a special occasion, meal with clients or colleagues or a nice date night. Tables are close together, but the service is well informed and able to answer questions about the food and recommend wines based on your preferences. All food was prepared well with good flavors."}
{"text":"A bit disappointed in the pricing and portions for brunch. When paying $15-18 for a plate, you wouldn't have to expect to pay $5 extra for a side (grits, potatoes, etc). Atmosphere, staff and flavor are great, but portions are super small for the prices. Wouldn't be back for brunch for this reason."}
{"text":"We have been here many times with family, friends and just the two of us sitting at the bar. There is a beautiful fireplace that separates the bar area from the dining room. It is always dimly lit, but not too dark. Atmosphere is great, it is never too quiet or loud. Parking can be a possible issue depending on what time you go. Just plan to valet, as it is complimentary. Also, if you plan to stop in for a drink at the bar anytime after 6:15pm-6:30pm, do not expect to find many open seats. Just order a drink, and wait for people to get called to their table to eat.  All beer, wine and specialty drinks are on their iPad menu. There is a top shelf bourbon menu that can be requested. Brian makes the best craft cocktails in South Charlotte, if not the entire city. Even if you don't see something you love on the iPad, just tell him what you are in the mood for. He does not hesitate in making your craft cocktail, and it is always beyond amazing and well thought out to this most minute detail.    Food is always excellent and service is top notch every time.. Keep in mind, M-F 5pm-6ish they have a $5 burger special that comes with steak fries and $1 oysters in the bar area only. Over time we have had the Bacon Jam, Pimento Cheese, NC Shrimp, Carolina Dumplings, raw VA Oysters, Burger special, Seared Scallops, Shrimp and Grits, Mac and Cheese, Collards and this week the Oreo Cheesecake Gelato. Nothing is ever short of amazing. If you are in South Charlotte, this is your go-to dinner destination!"}
{"text":"I've been multiple times and each visit is better than the last.  Most recently, I ordered the duck leg and bison. My God!  Although, based on what I've tasted and seen, you can't go wrong with anything on this amazing and ever changing menu.  From the beer and wine list, to the entrees, to the sides, to the desserts, order it with with complete confidence that your mouth will leave most pleased."}
{"text":"Fabulous!  Best roasted oysters ever. Very personalized service and enthusiasm from staff. Excellent cocktails and dinner. Was with a friend who travels the world and dined in most every country.  We were very impressed."}
{"text":"The perfect way to screw up southern cuisine. Stop trying to make everything posh. Wooden Robot and Juicy J on tap however the cheese board was not very good. I will pass on a second visit."}
{"text":"I just LOVE Dogwood!  It has been our go to spot for about a year now.  The food, drinks, and atmosphere are all great and most of the time the service has been amazing.  My recommendation would be the chicken and biscuits for brunch, one of the burgers or pulled pork for lunch, and for dinner I have really liked everything I've tried.  Our favorite app is the pimento cheese.  The only thing I was ever unimpressed with was the French Toast."}
{"text":"The food was really good but my dining experience was poor. I dined solo as I was traveling on business. I was seated in the very back corner in an awkward table next to the kitchen. I witnessed some kitchen staff handling food with bare hands and eating some of the meat they were slicing. Add to note, they didn't wash their hands after eating the meat slice which is a health code violation.   My server stopped by only twice: to take my order and take my money.   I noticed how well he treated the table next to me, throughly covering the menu and explaining the mission of being an eatery of locally sourced food.  I was considering this place for a company event, but they lost my business.  I suggest treating clients better and with respect. It was rude service per se, but just lack of service. The food is a great and priced accordingly. So they would have been much higher if they made an effort to appreciate my business."}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place.  It's rare that a restaurant that has been open for such a short time can be this good.  We arrived early for our 6pm reservation on a Saturday night and we were able to sit in the bar right near the cozy fireplace.  Our waitress, Monique, came over right away with the IPad with the drink menu.  She gave us great suggestions and we ordered a Dark and Stormy and a Blackberry Collins.   My husband said the Dark and Stormy was the best he ever had.  We also ordered the Chips and Dip while we looked over the menu.  They came out quickly and were amazing!  So addictive.   We then ordered the Dogwood Oysters, Fontina Cheese, Ceviche, Littleneck clams and the Grouper.  They all came out a bit staggered which was great and they all tasted amazing.  Each one was perfectly cooked and were so delicious.    The manager came over and was very friendly and down to earth.  You can tell that they put a lot of work and heart into this place.  I can't say enough about our waitress, Monique.  She rocked.  I am counting down the days until we can go back."}
{"text":"Came here on Friday night with 8ppl for my very belated birthday dinner.. First time and after looking at their menu. I'm super excited. The hostess was willing to wait way beyond our 6:30 reservation because no one in my group seem to understand to be there on time even tho I have reminded them 3x.  I arrived at 6:20pm and decided to sit at the bar. It wasn't busy for a Friday night.. It took a min for the bartender to notice me. I ordered the Forktale Rose Sparkling. It was good and to my satisfaction to the tastebud. When half for the group arrive, they also sat at the bar.. they had to wait for bit (longer than I have) before the bartender to take notice of them! I can hear the friends mumbling how they're not happy about that since it's Friday and they sure need a drink from a long day of work! Finally we're seated by 7pm.   Customer service: 3/5 could've been more attentive. I have 3 waiters but water wasn't efficiently filled. We ordered pop over or bread 2x. It didn't come til mid way thru the meal.. That's when I had to ask for the 3rd time!   Food: 4/5 I ordered the duck leg/chicken leg with grilled veggies and sweet potato purée. Duck was on the salty side but it has the perfect crisp to it. The purée was heavenly. Wish there were more. The staff brought me a cheesecake for my birthday. I shared it. But the bit I had was yum!   Ambience: 5/5 perfect night. Not too loud and too busy. All the tables was spaced nicely.. usually places would pack tables in where I can hear the next table over. But not here. Decor was perfect.   I would love to go here again. I would think this is a good place to take that special date. He or she would've been impress!"}
{"text":"Such amazing food. Friendly staff (even when we have brought small children in) delicious food and drinks. I always encourage people to give it a try even if some of their menu seems intimidating to them. Never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Dinner was terrific and so was the service. I had the seared scallops which were delightful, while my boyfriend ordered the bison flank steak which he also really enjoyed. The chef sent out a small plate before our meal which we enjoyed. For dessert, our waiter chose the cheesecake, and it was phenomenal. My boyfriend doesn't usually eat sweets of any kind, and even he couldn't resist! We will definitely be back :)"}
{"text":"I constantly am trying to find a great Brunch after Church and was lucky to find Dogwood was serving, so three buddies and I went. We all occurred to purchase the Low Country Eggs Benedict which were astonishing. You get two sunny side up eggs over fried green tomatoes sitting on top of collards and topped with hollandaise sauce. We all concurred that it was among the finest dishes we've ever had. The setting is quite modern with a Large City feel as well as the wait staff was very professional and careful. I believe Dogwood might be my new favourite eatery."}
{"text":"We took some co-workers here who were in from out of town last night. To be honest this was the third place I tried to find a table at for 11. However Dogwood was able to find room for us.  A few of us got there early and the place was packed!! Typical for the holiday season though. We went up to the bar, perused the ipad menu and ordered some drinks as we waited for our party. I got the Mountain Door Malbec which was rather nice actually. I ended up sticking with that for the night.   As for starters we were rather hungry and tried a few things.  I heard the oysters were good although I didn't try them myself. We got the crab pups which I loved!! They describe them as like crab hushpuppies... I would say they are more like mini ball shaped crab cakes but regardless yummy!! We also got the pimento cheese dip. I was a bit afraid to try this one as I am not a pimento cheese fan. However this stuff was AMAZING!! So addictive and it did not last long on the table. The dip is topped with their bacon jam which lets face it tasted as fantastic as it sounds. One of the guys also ordered the homemade chips for the table which were great to snack on.   I personally decided to go for the Thyme Gnocchi... the description kept calling to me from the menu. When it arrived I was a bit disappointed. It did not look appetizing really, and a lovely medium rare steak was sitting across from me lol. However I ate the entire place and it was delicious!! I do feel like maybe it was a tad one note and could have used something to break it up, but honestly it was still good :) The picture I took makes it look way better, so I think the very dimmed lighting was part of why it didn't look great.   One thing about this place is that it is VERY loud. I've run into this with many new restaurants lately. It was a bit difficult to talk unless the person was sitting right next to you, and even then it could be difficult to hear. I'd say that is a downside and normally I'd dock a star for that, but honestly... bacon jam!!   All in all I shall return promptly with some family, or friends, or maybe even alone to try some of the other dishes including the toasted pound cake which I heard is good!!"}
{"text":"I visited Dogwood, which is run by the same folks as Dressler's, last night to have dinner and drinks with a friend. I forgot it was restaurant week so the wait would have been over an hour but there were two seats available back near the open kitchen. I think there were 6 seats total. We took those and settled in for a delicious night.  The cocktail list is fairly impressive with lots of classics and bold flavor. They also offer a bunch of bourbons by the glass; nearly 40! They offer some Scotch too. There is a nice selection of wine and I beer, if that's more your thing. I ordered a Sazerac.  The food we ate on was the chips, roasted oysters, pork belly with gnocchi and the house made sausage plate. Everything was so wonderfully prepared and the chefs in the kitchen were telling us about the food as they made it and where it came from. The meat plate was a nice surprise. There were about 8 different types of house cured meat and it came with pickles and whole grain mustard. So flavorful! The entire staff was impressive and the taste of homemade limoncello that was given to us didn't hurt either.  I'll be bringing my husband there for a bourbon night soon."}
{"text":"Very cool atmosphere, food is farm fresh with southern charm, but something for everyone. Bar staff was friendly and knowledgeable. Crowded at peak hours, but layout makes it comfortable."}
{"text":"Amazing place! Food was excellent and the service was outstanding! My wife and I enjoyed our date night and will definitely be back. You get what you pay for and what you get here is high quality!"}
{"text":"The braised short rib was ABSOLUTELY amazing. So was the mac and cheese. The service was also incredible and I would highly recommend this spot to anyone."}
{"text":"Had the southern rice bowl.   Outstanding.  Yellow rice with beans braised brisket hot and sour greens, all topped with an eggs.    If you want contemporary southern around Charlotte, this is your spot"}
{"text":"Atmosphere of this place is fantastic. They've made great use of reclaimed elements and rustic decorations to make the space feel very cozy and inviting. The appetizers (we had the fried oysters, and pimiento cheese) were very good. I had the steak and eggs, which I honestly thought was undersized and under seasoned for $19. Would like to go back and try dinner which I've heard is much better than brunch."}
{"text":"After selling our car and getting ready to fly cross country, we celebrated with a meal at Dogwood. We were both starving, having only having a small snack for breakfast and fasted for the rest of the day.  Our waiter was very helpful with ordering, as he made several recommendations that we took him up on that were quite wonderful: Octopus Chorizo, BBQ spare ribs, duck breast with gnocchi, and wild boar with scallops.   The spare ribs are very tender, as the meat falls off the bone with a touch of the fork and are well sauced and delicious. The octopus is like a meaty soup with a little heat that was quite nice.  I had the duck, and it was fantastic. Fat rendered just right and the gnocchi was some of the best I have had. I had a taste of the boar and it was quite good too.  The hard part was dessert. Normally there are 2 or 3 items that really stand out for us, but here we wanted to have everything, lol. So ended up getting a carrot cake and a peanut butter chocolate cheesecake. All the items are made by the owners mother, and you can taste it. Super good!  Would definitely come back to try more of their dishes for sure."}
{"text":"Incredible food in a warm, inviting atmosphere.  Great craft cocktails (highly recommend the Legends of the Fall bourbon drink) with unusual flavor combinations.  Can't go wrong with the scallops and the bison absolutely rocked.  We'll be back!!"}
{"text":"The service was overbearing.  Seemed to be rushing us.  Shrimp and grits were good but pork was fatty and overcooked."}
{"text":"Love this place for lunch! Great atmosphere in the restaurant and the bar, it's beautifully decorated and I love the fireplaces. Servers are wonderful, wine list is fab and food is delicious. My new favorite southpark lunch spot!"}
{"text":"I loved my experience here. The price range on Yelp was not accurate. This place will get you for an arm and a leg but aside from that, everything was perfect. The service was fantastic, the server was there when we needed him and gave us space when we needed it.  The food suggestions were fabulous but their drink menu was also great. For lunch I had the steak flank and duck and I must say it was great. After dinner I had the pound cake for dessert. I will say for pound cake it was really good. It wasn't dry and was served with a side of soft serve ice cream. I also had the gelato. It was unique because at first I really wasnt enjoying it, but after my pallet adjusted it was delicious. Im definitely coming back here."}
{"text":"This was my favorite meal in Charlotte. I sat at the bar and watched the kitchen work- truly a well oiled machine! I had the bison carpaccio and a chefs special for my meal. The rabbit trio was one of the most well prepared meals that I have had in a long time. They also have what's called the \"bartenders call\" where you let them create you a custom cocktail- yum! Service was also superb. Happy eating!"}
{"text":"I had two excellent experiences here and can't wait to go a third time!  I went there the first time for lunch and was extremely happy with the whole affair.  The food was great, the service was great, and the ambiance was great.   Both my roommate and I were very pleased with our food and we just had to have the cheesecake, which is incredible.    My second visit was for Sunday brunch and I was equally impressed.  My date said that those were the best grits she ever had!  The coffee is outstanding, and I feel like there is not one bad item on the impressive menu.  I wouldn't hesitate for a second to recommend this place to anyone that wants to try well made southern fare.    I am certain the cocktails are excellent, but I rarely drink when I am out.  I have met the bar manager while at my liquor store, and he knows his stuff."}
{"text":"Excellent burger special and beer at the bar.  Great spot to unwind after a long day. Carrot cake was delicious!"}
{"text":"Save room for the pound cake!  We weren't really hungry, so ordered pimento cheese with bacon jam and house chips with onion dip. The onion dip is homemade with chunks of sweet onion. I had a Salty Dog drink.  Yum. Not your conventional meal.  But will be back for more."}
{"text":"My wife and I had lunch here for the first time and found that, yes, it did indeed live up to its excellent Yelp reviews. We each had a beet and goat cheese salad that was fresh (except for a few candied pecans), delicious and substantial. Even at $10, it wasn't a bad value. We then split a grilled chicken sandwich with house fries that ran $13 and easily left us both satisfied. OVERPRICED BEVERAGE  ALERT applies as fountain drinks run $2.50. This, as my readers know too well, is a major pet peeve of mine.  Our server was very pleasant and attentive as was service overall. The atmosphere was clean and inviting and the open kitchen was attractive. Rest rooms had an luxurious local business hand soap. Sanitary rating was 98.  Overall though, I found it to be the typical, somewhat pricey South Park restaurant that saturate the area. Yes, it was good, which is why I give it four stars, yet aside from the rating, it was nothing special for its area which is why I can't call it a Gotta Try. Still, if you are in the area, it is definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"I really like Dogwood. Their food when they get it right is great! When they don't it's a total bummer. Such a roller coaster of emotions from appetizer to dessert! I was taking a friend here to try it out because I thought it'd be a nice casual southern food experience. It's not really very casual but it is tasty. Dress a little more nicely than usual.  The atmosphere here creates a lot of hustle and bustle resulting in a very lively dining experience. Our waitress is a very nice lady though quite pushy with the drink orders. I didn't want a drink that night however. It's a nice menu you just point at stuff on the ipad they give you, no paper!  We started out with the sauteed octopus with chorizo and this dish knocked it out of the park! The spice from the chorizo combined with tender octopus and some braised greens really make for a great flavor combination in one bite. I almost wanted to order another one and make it my entree.  My duck was disappointingly deficient compared to the great appetizer. I appreciate a medium rare duck a lot but this thing could have quacked it was so raw. As it was pretty dark I didn't notice until I took a bite and took 5 minutes to chew a piece. I do not think it rested an appropriate amount of time either as there was a lot of blood running around this plate. After I noted this to our waitress she apologized and got it sent back for another round. It was a lot more edible after this however I don't think it was as good as it could have been if it had been done right the first time. What a shame.  Thanks for a decent (though expensive) night Dogwood! I look forward to seeing if my next trip will be an improvement."}
{"text":"We went there for an event. We had the dogwood table the 16 of us squeezed around.  Definitely elbow to elbow.   Our server was just super wonderful. Real supper pleasant fun loving type that made our whole crowd relax after the second day stuffed into a small conference room for 9 hours. She was a breath of fresh air that made my whole night. Thank you.   As for the food, well, I had lots of small plates the were way better than the main course. Beef ribs, octopus, and other delights.   The place is in an up scale area with residential above shops. Very interesting living area. The restaurant was very nice and fairly busy on a Saturday night. We all had a good time."}
{"text":"Fabulous cocktails, adventurous meats, and the best cheesecake I've ever had. Service by our waiter was lacking, but they're were several other people on the staff who regularly checked in.   I had wild boar and scallops, and my friend had duck breast with gnocci. Both were seasoned perfectly.  Wild boar- if you're wondering- if not gamey at all. It's like a cross between been and pork.  My friend raved about her dirty martini, and I enjoyed The OF (old fashioned). We split the mac and cheese, which was a mix of parmesan and greyure. Oh! We started with pimento bread. One of the best around. The cheese is melty and gooey."}
{"text":"Nice ambience and food. Good selections and friendly staff. Looking out the window, I could have been in Europe or perhaps Providence, RI..."}
{"text":"Great service, great food, great ambience.   Came here for dinner with my parents and they loved it. We started with arugula salads, then my mom had baked pimento dip and raved about it. Dad got the duck breast and said it was wonderful. I had shrimp n grits and it was also yummy. I finished with chocolate cake and Mom had the classic cheesecake. The chocolate cake wasn't super rich, and the layer of mousse was just what it needed.   Definitely recommend coming here!"}
{"text":"Really liked the ambiance of this place. Nice, breezy and unhurried, with a friendly staff, which is exactly what you need after a day at the office. I was almost immediately served with a palate cleanser of goat cheese, fresh greens and a blueberry reduction on an apple slice, which was rather pleasant. The fried oyster appetizer, however was an unmitigated disaster. The breading was too thick (first strike), the poor oysters were overdone and tough (second strike) and it was obvious that they had been left too long in the fryer (punch out, called third strike). How is this even possible in the South? Lighten up on the breading and baby those morsels!   The entrée more than made up for the appetizer, as the shrimp and grits were outstanding. Rich and creamy, you could actually TASTE everything -- from the Linney's Mill grits (from Union Grove), gulf shrimp and chorizo sausage (yum!) to the green onions, tomato, peppers (very nice) and okra, all the ingredients were in harmony. I could tell that a good deal of thought and a little love went into this dish. Well done!  No room for dessert, so I had to \"settle\" for a \"Kentucky Coffee\" of Makers Mark bourbon, a tasty Americano, rye whiskey, spiked cinnamon and whipped cream. That drink could become a habit with me. All in all, it was a delightful experience (even with the oysters) and I'll make it a point to come back."}
{"text":"Great experience.  Can't say enough about how much we enjoyed this place.  Great meal in a casual atmosphere.  Drinks were very good, cocktails are exceptional, beer list though small is representative of NC beers.  Don't drink wine so can't comment on that.    Food was amazing, had a fish entree that was probably some of the best fish I have had.  My wife had the shrimp and grits and said it was outstanding.  Even though the place was packed, never felt rushed and the service was very attentive."}
{"text":"I've never had a bad experience at Dogwood.  I've been twice for a full sit-down dinner and the quality of the food and service has been outstanding.    For me, the dining experience doesn't blow my mind in any one aspect, it simply does southern/american cuisine very well.  The happy hour food special they run during the week ($5 lamb burgers/$1 oysters) is out of this world.  You can't find a better burger for $5, and even if I remove the price, it's still one of my favorite burgers at any price point.  It's only available in the bar area, but it's a great way to have a mid-week meal paired with an excellent selection of drinks."}
{"text":"Charlotte North Carolina, know as the \"Queen city\", after the late Queen Charlotte Sophia of Mecklenburg-Sterlitz, the wife of King George III of england.   The \"Hornet's Nest,\" rings true to the historical buzz of local residents who fired off enough ammunition to send the lobsterbacks sauntering away across the pond.   And even more infamously known as the \"Crown Town,\" for it's hiphop roots and relevant namesake the \"CLT.\"     A midwesterner commensing his business related travel to this magical place, my first thought was purely awe for the lush, vibrant trees surrounding this quaint coastal state... I can see why \"City of Trees,\" is even more fitting to address her majesty.    Flying in from Chicago I knew just by the fresh taste of the air I was somewhere captivating, historic and downright friendly!   Southern hospitallity is a catch phrase to many, but coming from the Chi-town I truley learned the meaning of hostpitallity and why the South is synonomous with this expression.  I step foot into Dogwood Southern Table & Bar and find myself in a quiet, romantic and... straight up classy joint. A very modern look on what many consider a traditional type of cuisine.  I was greeted by a friendly host who showed me to my table and presented an iPad with a list of creative cocktails brewed up by the very reputable barmaster who you will have to meet on your next visit here.  A gentleman who we shall call Deez pointed me in the direction of a signautre whiskey cocktail coined only as, Legends of the Fall. Ceylong Cinnamon bark smoked glass, fitted with a local distiller's earth shattering Rye Whiskey,  spiced simple syrup and house bitters topped with an orange peel that I could happily take in as my last bit of Vitamin C on this earth.  The first sip was heavenly and it only got better from there. Deez and another gentleman who stopped by my 1-top recommended the Duck Confeit and Dumplings for a hearty appetizer. Delicate and succulent Duck Leg was complimented by southern sytle dumplings which at first look I thought were scallops. The delicate texture and remarkable flavor quickly assured me they were infact dumplings, but those by the likes of which I had never embraced on virgin my palet. The waitress who brought the appetizer took the extra step to mention how persistent she is with tables to try this dish, and after just one bite I can 100% agree it's worth the imposition.  There was not a single thing on the menu which didn't look absolutely delectable, luckily the waiter made my decision easy by recommending the Scallops and Wild Boar. Wild Boar... the other other white meat. I think of pork and usually the excitement fizzles out faster than my best friends wedding night at the Palms resort in Vegas. But this was on another level. Rich, enchanting red meat cooked medium rare with the heartiness and remarkable flavor of a the tenderest of fillets, complimented by a texture which words cannot give justice. I just so happened to embrace the last drop of my Legends of the Fall rye cocktail when Deez brought me another famously made drink by the local bar master called a Ruff Rider. Teddy Rosevelt comes to mind with every sip, I could feel my mustache curling in excitement and even the thought of 4 bullet's to the chest couldn't phase me as I surrendered my taste buds to this simple yet perfect old fashioned, just as they didn't phase our 26th.   As I attempt my best efforts in summarizing a mindblowing experience at this masterpiece of Southern comfort, the Rubarb Tart Gelato materialized from what seemed to be thin air. Before I knew it I was on my last bite and speechless when asked how the desert tasted....It truely made me feel some sorta way.  If I could go back to waiting tables, living in the restuarant scene or even just getting out more often..... I would want to relive this moment as many times as I could because even the lack of medical marijuana wasn't enough to damper  a record setting and magnificent first southern dining experience. Thank you Deez, Winter and Auggs (sorry for mixing up the names) you made a Chi-city foodie realize he hasn't yet begun to live.   Righteous!"}
{"text":"This place is great, but make a reservation for Friday/Saturday nights. We ordered exclusively off the small plates on the first part of the menu, but ordered almost all of them. The sausage was flavorful and good. Dumplings had tons of sauce and good flavor. The duck was a bit dried out to my taste, but had good sauce to pair. The ambiance was great, even a bit louder than you'd think. Seems like groups like to gather here rather than just people on dates, which is good to know! They have a pretty extensive drink menu as well. Our server was a young gentleman and was top notch. Hostess staff was very respectful as well. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Delicious food and great service. The only negative we had is that it's very noisy- more than a table of 4 and it would be hard to hear your friends.  We will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Dogwood took my suggestion and added a vegetarian entree to their menu (one is better than none - thank you!). Last night I returned to find that the entree was my favorite meal which I order at any restaurant that has it: gnocchi! Yay! It was fabulous. Soft, tender, very flavorful.   My husband again ordered the hanger steak, which he says is the best steak he has ever had. Both of us found ourselves rolling our eyes back in our heads while enjoying our meals and wine - sexy! Dogwood is certainly a restaurant we will add to our go-to lineup for a fantastic meal and evening."}
{"text":"Staff is personable, which is appreciated.  Atmosphere is fun yet elegant.  Drinks are great.  Food is sub-par for what it should be. I will likely try again (will be the third time) just to see if I have just been unlucky with food choices the first 2 times (although have tried a few things each time)."}
{"text":"On the way to a meeting, but we were early. So found the restaurant on Yelp. Nicely decorated, but slow on the Monday after the Super Bowl. The lunch menu had 4 starters including the fabulous bacon jam, 6 salads, 4 sandwiches and 6 entrees. Wife had fried green tomato salad and I had the roasted beet. Absolutely no complaints with size, freshness or presentation. Had  mine topped with fried quail and wife had hers with the crab cake. Again both delicious. Finished with a coffee and carrot cake. Will be back on our next trip."}
{"text":"Can we talk about how amazing their small plates are?  Their unique twist on souther cuisine is definitely worth a try and pimento cheese is one of the best I have ever had"}
{"text":"The interior and the staff are very nice. We ordered some pimento cheese and mushrooms. The cheese was really good. The mushrooms hardly had any flavor. I ordered a vegetable plate with the pea succotash, sweet potatoes and kale salad which was tasty but not anything special. My date ordered the scallops which looked pleasing to the eye but when I tried a bite, her complaint of no flavor was verified. It's like they cooked the dish and didn't add any spice or flavor to it. The house made punch was probably the highlight of my visit as they make it with their own house made ginger beer. Other than that, I probably wouldn't go back for the food but wouldn't mind people watching at the bar with some punch or coffee."}
{"text":"Ok - best ribs I have ever had. On the small plates. I know I am from the Midwest but have been a lot of places. Device is great too. Had the CVBC cocktail. Recommend if you are drinking dessert."}
{"text":"Only ok. ESP for the prices. My food (scallops) was luke warm, and way too salty. Service was good, not great. I see the excellent reviews, and I'll assume it was a bad night. Too bad, because it's cute!"}
{"text":"I'm definitely a fan of this place as it is a must do in Charlotte.  I will say it was a decent scene on the inside despite I was seated a little over in a corner.  There is a nice ambiance if you're in a larger group (2 or more) that feels a little high society like the rest of South Park, but not too stuffy as this place does have some southern charm to it (just not a whole lot of character that some more established restaurants in older neighborhoods offer).  All that being said, don't let the new South Park ambiance fool you because the food here can compete with any of the innovative and trendy places in Noda or Plaza Midwood (So can their prices).  I had the duck breast and Gnocchi dish, which right off the bat the fact that they had duck on the dinner menu was a good sign because many restaurants don't feature this or do it very well.   And they did it very well, it was delicious and beautifully prepared and the gnocchi was exquisitely complimentary.  Also had the the buffalo carpaccio which was good but probably a little pricey for what you actually get.  The drink menu is great and though I only had a cognac and bitters the menu seemed endless and the bartenders can even make you something out of thin air just by telling them the alcohol and flavor.  The dessert menu looked a little weak but i opted for the coke float and was not disappointed (hard to mess this up but they used Mexican Coke and some damn good vanilla ice cream so I was happy).  Note:  This place isn't cheap but I think its fair to say you get what you pay for on most dishes here given the circumstances and this is why Dogwood is a solid 4 star experience.  Food:  8.5/10 Ambiance: 6.5/10 Service:  9/10 Price:  $$$ (Not a bargain but also not a ripoff)  Will return."}
{"text":"To be fair I just had oysters, a salad and some beer when I went but I was with a pretty large party who all seemed to enjoy their food thoroughly. The service was great and the people were super nice and accommodating.  We were celebrating a friend's birthday and were a bit loud and stayed for quite a while but the staff embraced us with open arms.   The oysters were fresh and served with all the typical accoutrements and the salad was delicious.  I sampled a few dishes from my dining companions' plate and everything was delicious!  Great selection of beer on tap.  I didn't look too hard at the wine list but it seemed extensive and yes they have a full bar!  I was just in a beer drinking mood . The mark ups on the beer were a bit steep for what I have seen in Charlotte but I guess you are paying for the ambience? (Or that South Park rent, as it's near the mall in one of those shopping/ dining centers... I still have to get use to all the strip malls here in Charlotte) I will certainly be back as I don't mind paying a pretty penny for a decent meal and excellent service!"}
{"text":"Awesome food experience!!! Went there for dinner and service and food were both amazing.   Definitely start with the octopus and chorizo and the pimiento cheese dip.  I could have just ordered appetizers as everything sounded delicious and I wanted to try everything.  Cocktail selections are very unique although a bit pricey.   For my entree I ordered the flank and duck which was fabulous.  Steak was cooked perfectly and duck fell off the bone.   I wish I could have remembered our waiter's name as he was very attentive and provided excellent service."}
{"text":"Grabbed a late week night dinner here with a friend and WOWIE WOW! We loved it. Great location from our hotel, great vibe, great service too. The salty dog cocktails were AMAZING and I won't even talk about the drool factor when the Oysters Dogwood arrived. OMG! Oysters and chorizo? I could have had 12 more TO MYSELF. AMAZING flavor and just the right amount of zing. PERFECTION. We both ordered the KC steaks covered in mushrooms, dried cranberries, potatoes and HEAVEN. Yep, I said it HEAVEN, It was in the form of a sweet sauce that was ASTOUNDING! I will be back. I will order the oysters again and proceed to try every dish on the menu. I KNOW they will not disappoint."}
{"text":"We decided to check out Dogwood for our anniversary dinner - so glad we did!  The exterior does not do Dogwood justice - the interior is dark, warm and has a restored farmhouse rustic vibe. Really like the rescued wood fixtures throughout!  Similar to Dresslers, service is top-notch. Everyone from the bartenders to our server were gracious, patient and informative. I had noted in the reservation that it was our anniversary and both our server and Jon Dressler himself congratulated us.   The menu is fairly long with many sharing options - we ordered the oysters, warm pimento, and mushrooms to start. All three were very good with the mushrooms being exceptional! We also had the market salad, which had a great fennel dressing.  Feeling full we decided to share the grouper - our server had it split for us and the separate portions were just right. Excellent flavor profile, fresh and light.  We finished the night with a slice of the chocolate peanut butter cheesecake - great as always.  Great experience, we will be back!"}
{"text":"The service was slow.  The ribs were so tough that they shot off the plate when both my wife and I tried to cut them.  We sent them back. Second set were equally tough.  Brussel sprouts we're so tough we couldn't get a fork into them.  Steak was so tough I got tired of trying to cut it.  They comped most things but I will not be back"}
{"text":"Best bar drinks in Charlotte.  Food is excellent.  Tables are a bit close.  Really great bar scene and vibe."}
{"text":"We have eaten there several times in the last month.  The service is impeccable! This time I had the special from five to 6 o'clock burger very good. All the food we have dined on there has been very good. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Ok, I'm changing my review. I went back with some girlfriends on a Tuesday after work, and everything turned out much better than my first time.  It was a beautiful night, so we sat outside on the patio. Our waiter was mostly prompt (except for the one time my friend and I waited 20 minutes for our wine... I was about to take out a mission persons report). They have an iPad for the drink menu, but a regular food menu. Odd, but okay.  We put together a few small plates/snacks to share - pimento cheese (our deeelicious favorite), bacon jam (good, but really just chopped up bacon; Tapas 51's is better), house chips (tasty), and crab pups (fine but small). Then we split the pumpkin pecan cheesecake for dessert, and with three people, we each got about three bites - perfect.  Every place deserves a second chance!"}
{"text":"Love this place! The atmosphere is gorgeous as well. I always love their cocktails and dinner specials. JT is our favorite server whenever we go!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place because I love their other restaurant Dresslers.  We got seated right away and noticed that I could not hear anyone seated at my table. They have done a terrible job with ambient noise control, which definitely affects the experience. We had a nice server who was very attentive. Drinks were good and appetizers were very good. I recommend the bacon jam along with the warm pimento cheese spread. The fried oysters were solid, but I did get one with a shell that almost broke my tooth.  The entrees were not very good. In fact, mine was terrible. I ordered the special bone in pork chop and this dish was just a mess. The chop was undercooked and chewy with a huge amount of fat. I've never seen a cut this bad. Then to make it worse, it was loaded with salt. I had two bites of this dish. One of my friends ordered the ribeye and for $42 he thought he would get a decent size piece of meat. No, he got what looked like a sirloin. He hated it. The rest of the crew had fish and this seems like a better choice if you decide to go to this disappointing restaurant.  Lastly, this meal cost $200 for two and it simply is not a good value. I'm not sure why they feel they have the right to charge $34 for 4 scallops. They were good, but that price is ridiculous. So, this will be a one and done for all of us who went last night.  Charlotte has way too many great restaurants to return to this one. I'll stil go to Dresslers, where this team gets it right. Dogwood is for the dogs!"}
{"text":"Hands down one of my best experiences at a restaurant in Charlotte. Was very accessible for a large group. The waitstaff gave excellent suggestions and were able to describe the food impeccably. The OF was a great take on an old fashioned. The baked pimento cheese dip was so good. I would highly recommend this restaurant for big groups and small gatherings."}
{"text":"Honestly, I go here for the bartender. I'm not a Foodie but my chef husband is and he's has extremely high standards. He said it's his new favorite place in town for customer service the bartender and the food.  The customer service and the bartender are why I go back. He's a mixologist/artist and a really easy to be with person, as is his help.  The food is out of this world as well but if you want GREAT cocktails?  This is THE place in this area to go."}
{"text":"Excellent service, incredible food. Perfect for date night or out with friends. Warm environment, cozy, inviting ambiance. If $ not an issue, it's awesome. Plates were just enough but still a little hungry when left. Whatever you get, it will be delicious. We eat out every night so will save it for a special occasion. 2 people, no alcohol or sides was $96 w tip."}
{"text":"Had dinner at Dogwood tonight.  first, let me say I've had dinners here before tonight.  I had the chicken which was serviced on top of rice and greens.  The chicken was lukewarm--obviously precooked--and covered with gravy to make up for the flavorless chicken.  The greens were a few uncooked pieces of greens.  The rice was mushy. This was not a worthy dish to trying.  To the Chef or cook-try a little harder on this dish, or remove."}
{"text":"I was very excited about this restaurant opening in South Charlotte and done by local restaurant owners. It is billed as farm to table with local, fresh ingredients.  The interior of the restaurant is cozy and quite lovely with fireplaces and stone.  It's located in South Park.    To be fair, we came on the first Friday they opened. Our server took forever to get us our wine and she didn't know at all what she was doing.  She struggled opening the bottle, and then she poured a rather pricey red way over volume in the first pour.  She had to be prompted to stop pouring -  to the point that we did not get 4 glasses out of the bottle because she poured so much in the first glass.  In terms of wine, they ran out of the first bottle we ordered so we switched our choice only to be told they were out of it.  They were also out of the next bottle we picked.  So, the owner came with a recommendation.  When I asked if it was a similar price point as my previous selection, I was told \"of course, we aren't THAT restaurant\".  However, when he checked the wine, it was not the correct price point.  He did the right thing by us and discounted it a bit.  We ordered oysters as an appetizer and they were amazing.  Especially the gulf coast ones.  However, I asked for tabasco for them and was told they didn't have any.  Later, the waitress brought green tabasco but that's absolutely not the same.   I ordered the arugula and walnut salad and it was perfectly prepared and tasty.  The entrees were a problem.  They were out of my first fish selection so I selected a fish on the menu but requested that they prepare it with an alternate to the fingerling potatoes.  I asked for more beets, a sweet potato instead - basically anything other than the potatoes.  The waitress told me they couldn't do that.  That made no sense to me since the menu had a listing of local farms they are patrons of.  Anyway, I decided on the shrimp and grits.  That was a really bad decision as the shrimp was overcooked, the grits were overcooked to a point of sticking together in a giant clump and the sauce was bland. I ate the shrimp (I was starving) and left the rest.  The owner asked me what I thought of the food and I politely told him it was \"ok\".  That once again, he needed to have tabasco or some seasoning available (this was a white wine based sauce and didn't have sausage).  He didn't seem interested in my feedback.  On the positive note, my husband had the grouper and thought it was outstanding.   The owner returned with a piece of cheesecake that is his mother's recipe which my husband gobbled down quickly. However, he did not apologize for the experience, thank me for feedback or invite me to return.  I might consider returning but there are better choices in South Park."}
{"text":"This was our first time at this restaurant. We had no idea what to expect. Finding a parking spot was a challenge but it was worth the effort. They were serving a Sunday brunch. I ordered the quiche and it was excellent. The coffee comes in a French press so it wasn't quite as hot as I prefer but it was fine. Would definitely try this place again. The brunch menu was very reasonable."}
{"text":"After dinner drinks, beyond terrible service. Nothing for 20 minutes, then brought a bottle of prosecco and sat it in the middle of the table, warm and without ice. Ugh, food may be good but service is out to lunch."}
{"text":"Dogwood is my new favorite restaurant in Charlotte. I love a great tapas place and they have it here. My husband and I never order an entree but instead get several small plates to share. From the cheese to the shrimp and the little sliders everything is amazing. We love to go here and split a bottle of wine and enjoy Mom's cheesecake for dessert. If you are a foodie this place is a MUST"}
{"text":"With a Name like Dogwood, I dont know why but I was thinking to myself Nice a friendly little local spot to sit and relax, no table cloths, No fancy servers etc.   Well to my ...Not shock, too harsh. Ah, to my dismay we walked in and table cloths, Waiters and we were early so they were all just standing around waiting on the crowd to come in looking out the window like you would expect me to do being my first time. LOL  But service was ok, and with the lack of business he seemed to be able to talk to his fellow servers while the wife waited for him to come back for wine/drink order.  He was friendly and seemed to still just run a little slow in his reaction time but once we figured that out it became an expectation, he was not so bad, and had nice presence about him.  Food was very good, and hot, and after my initial dismay, sort of liked this place but again, it was just the name that threw me.  I am sure we will go back, in fact I looking forward to it.  So check it out, and see if you enjoy it I would not say anything to turn you away."}
{"text":"Great food and service  Adi our waiter was excellent he knew every single special by heart recited them exquisitely never had to look at any notes great suggestions for the food that we had service was outstanding it was just a great place to dine only one thing Was that it was tough to get a seat at the bar however very nice young lady moved over so we could have two seats together which was extremely nice prices on the drinks at the bar I thought we were a little high if $15 per vodka on the rocks seemed a little high to me other than that I would go back in a minute and a great restaurant recommend it to anybody  Will go back soon"}
{"text":"Dogwood is delicious. But more than that, the service is AMAZING. My parents and I went while celebrating my mom's birthday in Charlotte back in December. Two months (to the day, actually), I am STILL upset I wasn't able to eat my leftovers. (I was driving back to Louisville the next morning, and I'm not sure a pork loin with polenta would've made it back in a neat manner.)   They have a full bar, including some some more \"hard to find\" liquors, which my dad had in bourbon. My mom wasn't sure on a wine, so they let her sample it before committing to a full glass. I stuck with water, but refills were plentiful (always appreciated).  We started with the Carolina Dumplings (I seriously could've licked the bleu cheese out of the dish... SO tasty.) and the Bacon Jam (DUH.). Since we were first timers, the chef also sent us a small bite before that, if I recall the timing, which was so cool and cute.   I can't remember what my parents got, but I do remember my dad cleaned his plate, and my mom likely chowed down on her leftovers the next day. Again, I'm still sad I didn't get a chance to eat mine--it was so tasty and well done.  They brought my mom something delicious for dessert. I was so full by that point, I only took a little bite. She loved it though; it was a perfect stop for a birthday celebration. Our server walked us through everything and was great while not being overbearing with suggestions, etc. I wish I remembered his name; he was good! In other notes, they do have valet parking. The menu rotates, and they focus on local and seasonal items. While it's slightly pricey (depending on how you do it), the service, taste, and quality totally are worth it. I would happily go back here when in Charlotte again!  Note: I would highly recommend reservations!"}
{"text":"There is a reason they have been rated so highly over and over. The food is top notch. The happy hour burger is delicious, prime grind, with melty cheese and a smokey tomato jam. The quail and blueberry waffle was crispy and had abundant fresh blueberries in the batter, a perfectly elevated chicken and waffles dish.  The Bartender is nearly clairvoyant. He can make custom cocktails based on your descriptions and nothing that came across the bar was anything less than delicious. The seasonal cocktail featured a smoked glass and a housemade spiced simple syrup. Simply put, it was the most flavorful and scented cocktail I've ever had. Go and get one."}
{"text":"Our first time here and we were thrilled with the experience! We were pleasantly greeted at the door by the manager and host... taken right to our table, and had a drink in our hands in under 5 minutes. Our waitress, Allison, was probably one of the very best we'd had in a very long time. The food was everything we could have hoped for and they even made an exception to accommodate me on a menu item they no longer had.  The toasted pound cake is a \"must try\". I have never had that before and our entire group was blown away! Highly recommend this restaurant. Our experience will be hard to surpass! Great job!"}
{"text":"Went to Dogwood with my wife on a Saturday night --- we were seated promptly at our reservation time at the chef \"bar.\" I would describe this place as French cuisine meets Southern. We ordered the duck confit and pimento cheese appetizers, both were good. We shared the pork shank entree and good thing because it was enormous. Cooked perfectly. The Chef came to speak with us about our dishes as we were settling up the bill, and they also brought us some complimentary basil-lemon gelato which was a nice touch. Good service. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Easter Sunday brunch.  Food was very very good.  Service was a little suspect.  Manager noticed and gave us a app voucher.  Portions were also a little suspect.  However, the food made it all worth it and it was a good overall experience.  Nice attention to detail with nice specialty drinks too."}
{"text":"So happy we decided to choose Dogwood to finish our day after our Christmas shopping! Wonderful experience. Great mixologist prepared our cocktails perfectly. Our waiter, Rob, was very informative, helpful and very attentive, yet allowed us to dine without interruption. His knowledge of the food selections served our decision making well as the menu is extensive, without being over the top. My husband had the muscles, unbelievably generous portion, seasoned to perfection! He followed them with the bourbon rib appetizer that was to die for! I enjoyed the house made potatoe chips sharing them, as they, also, were a generous portion. Followed up with the shrimp & grits that were delightful and filling! Leftovers for sure!  Skipped dessert this vist, will try something next time. Will definitely  make this a frequent spot to enjoy and plan on bringing friends with us very soon!"}
{"text":"Great experience tonight we sat outside on the patio and it was perfect.  The service was great and the small plates we had were awesome.  The mushroom, shrimp and pimento cheese small plates were very good."}
{"text":"My wife and I went for our anniversary and was pleasantly surprised at the great service and food. While I was looking forward to the bison and duck, which was on their websites menu, the waiter informed me the local bison supplier was no longer able to keep up and they no longer had the bison. Kind of bummed but his recommendations for the flank steak and duck was well worth it.  Having locally supplied food was a plus. There was one mishap on my salad, but was fixed without question. Upon hearing this the waiter promptly expressed regret and gladly provided a desert on the house. Great food and service. Entree Portions are plenty without a la carte sides. The waiter provided honest opinion on the food and amounts as to not over sell the food. I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Lively spot in the Southpark area.  Convenient to a parking garage just down from the restaurant. Great vibe and trendy!   Southern dishes. Today they were trying hard to sell my friend, Dan, and me their pimento cheese appetizer. The problem (for me) is that it included bacon. I am not a pork or beef eater, so NO to bacon!  I had a chicken sandwich that came with fries.  Oh yes, the sandwich came with bacon, which I asked them to hold. It also had a lot of garlic, which made it not quite as good for me.   I loved the tables and the space. I observed that they can accommodate larger groups of people, which is a good thing.  The music and acoustics were not conducive to good conversation, until after the lunch hour settled down.   I liked discovering this spot and so glad that we went. Next time, I will see if they can do some bacon-free pimento cheese. And I will go well after the lunch crowd has come and gone."}
{"text":"Definitely owe these guys an update!  Last time we came we kept it low key and ate at the bar. There was a Carolina game on so it was kind of busy. Our primary bartender worked in sync with the other and were very attentive. We decided it was going to be an all appetizer kind of night to really get some variety!  The appetizers came out as they were prepared and we were fine with that - what we ate:  Pimento Cheese with bread and their infamous bacon jam - classic gooey goodness.  Brisket with pickled onions - nice sized bites with deep smoke flavor and tang from the onions.  Aranicini - who doesn't like Italian style deep fried risotto/rice balls?  NC Shrimp - nicely done with tempura style seasonal veggies.  Arugula Salad with market fresh peaches - double yum.  And last but not least - Chocolate Pie with Market Berry Coulis - dense, chocolately, delicious!  We came on a Wednesday and they were running a house made cocktail special for $5 - great deal for Dogwood as most of their cocktails run $10-15. Add to that hand pressed coffee!  Only ball dropped was the salad which we had to remind them of - a sous chef brought it out personally though with his apologies.  Overall, great place for a date night to try some great food and drinks!"}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times, and each visit leading up to my most recent was fine, which is why I'm giving them 3 stars. My most recent visit just left a poor taste in my mouth, and since I've been stewing over it for a few days, I decided I would share.   We visited at dinner time to celebrate a birthday. We arrived a bit earlier than our reservation time and told the hosts' table that the other two people in our party grabbed a drink at the bar while they waited for us to arrive. An older gentleman responded that the other two in our party had a table in the bar area and we could just sit there or he'd try to see if he could find something in the dining room. We had a reservation for a table in the dining room to celebrate a birthday, so I'm not sure why he was trying to see if he could find anything! After greeting the rest of our party, my husband went back to the hosts' table to tell them that we are not eating at the bar. Fast forward about 5-10 minutes and my husband is nowhere to be found. We walk out into the dining room, and he is sitting alone at a table in the very back corner. When I asked why he was sitting there alone, he told us that the same gentleman who said he would 'try to find us a table' would grab us from the bar and escort us to our table. That never happened.   Our waiter was okay but it wasn't the type of service you'd expect with a $250 bill- he took my husband's drink order but walked away before I could order one for myself. He was helpful with the menu selections. Unfortunately, my $44 medium-rare steak was incredibly hard to eat. It was so tough and filled with strings of fat that were impossible to chew through - I took 2/3 of the steak home so I could chew in peace. The kitchen also apparently served two dishes incorrectly to our table, for which they corrected by offering two free desserts to those individuals. I thought this was a nice gesture, but our waiter only brought out two dessert menus and never asked the other two people at the table if they were interested in dessert. We rarely order dessert at a restaurant, but it was quite obvious that we were celebrating a birthday, so I was irritated by lack of concern.   Overall, I'm pretty disappointed by most recent visit because I've had much better experiences there. I'm sure we'll eventually go back again, but it certainly won't be my first choice."}
{"text":"Outstanding. The service (at the bar during lunch) was friendly, attentive and informative. The Drunjen Pork Lettuce Wrap appetizer, Creole Shrimp-n-Grits and chocolate pie were delicious. Thank you Yelpers for the insights. I chose this restaurant based on previous reviews and they open at 11:30 for lunch. I highly recommend. The venue offers outside dining or inside. The inside is rustic, has low noise level and is good for a business lunch or friend get-together. I really enjoyed this experience."}
{"text":"Our waiter was a little off otherwise I would have given another star. The food was good- we shared the duck and steak- all excellent . The waiter could have been friendlier and really wasn't familiar with the items we asked about"}
{"text":"Definitely a cool spot to check out. My boyfriend and I went for restaurant week. We enjoyed it overall. Staff was very friendly and our waiter was knowledgeable. The drink menu had something for everyone which was nice since we like to try new things. We ordered an appetizer, entree and dessert. The food was very good but I took one star away because my steak was overdone which is always a bummer. My boyfriend and I both ordered medium and his turned out perfect so I will say the food is great as long as they cook it right. One other thing is that the parking situation is great but they do have a valet option. Overall I would definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Probably my favorite place in Charlotte. Brian makes the best drinks. I've gotten to the point where I tell him what I plan to order and then say that I'd like a drink based on bourbon, rum or vodka and I am always pleasantly surprised at what he comes up with.  Everything I've ordered from the menu has been great. My favorite appetizers are the pimento cheese and the bacon jam. I've thought about ordering 3 of the bacon jam and making that a meal.  The burgers during burger happy hour are the best burgers you can buy for $5."}
{"text":"So this is a beautiful new restaurant right behind Whole Foods, in Southpark. I loved the ambience. Our Waitress was great..she was right there the whole time, making sure we had clean plates and utensils...Very informative about the menu too! We started out with the Beignets. They were very good...the espresso sauce not so much. We arrived before 12 on Sunday so we had to wait for the Bloody Marys which are served with a beer back! Which is such a great  Midwestern thing..I was not surprised to hear that the owners were from Minnesota.. ( My Old State). I ordered the Crab Benedict... I hesitate every where except Charleston in Ordering Crab Cakes...Why oh Why can they not be More Crab..less filling?? They sat on a round of a whole wheat bread and I could barely taste the Crab from the bread...thats a No go for me again. Presentation for all the dishes was beautiful, I tried the Walnut French toast..it was presented like Bon Appetit but alas did not taste so good..very dry. The Pimento Cheese gratin was delicious. We did get the bloody mary..nice rim on glass and the beer back was good. The Chicken and Waffle sandwich was liked by my friend and the omelet next to me was dry. I would try it again for dinner..it has possibilites...the over all ambience is nice, just needs to tweak the entrees again...."}
{"text":"Wow  Is this place OVERPRICED. Food was good but $12.00 for a Woodfords on the rocks. That was just to start. Granted the food was good, but way overpriced. I had the flounder good, I've had better and paid half of the price. My wife had Shrimp and grits.Again, ok but twice what we would have paid somewhere else.  If you have money to burn for good food this is your place. PS this place was Noisy. The other couple we were with laughed about the fact that we had to yell at each other to carry on a conversation."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have always had a wonderful experience when we come to Dogwood! Craft Cocktails doesn't say enough about the expertise of the bartenders! Ask for Brittany or Brian. They are the best bartenders in Charlotte. Tell them what liquor you prefer and they will create your new favorite drink! Love this place!"}
{"text":"This restaurant changes its menu depending on the seasons. When I went in the fall, I thought everything on their menu was amazing. However, when I went in the winter time, I'm not a big fan of roots and that's pretty much what's available in the winter. So I would definitely recommend it any season except for winter time."}
{"text":"Multiple small plates were a good call, nest vibe, food was different, unique and good.  Chips were soggy and disappointing.  Mac and cheese a plus.  I'll return - looking for the elusive 4th star, it is lurking here."}
{"text":"Love! This Southern farm to table stole my heart tonight.  Each dish was simple with lots of wow in each bite.  What we ate: Crab Hushpuppies - Let's just say this hushpuppy makeover was the best I have tasted, a great balance of flavors and you could actually see the crab!  Carolina Dumplings - I went out on the limb to try these since normally I don't like dumplings but these were pretty amazing, the granny smith apples with the ham is a surprisingly pleasant combination  Bacon Jam -- it's bacon used as a main ingredient in a mouth-watering jam, don't think I need to say this but AMAZING.  Sauteed Mahi Mahi -- perferctly cooking and not your usual grilled mahi mahi, and it came with okra! it was my hubby's dish but I could have easily eaten it all  Hanger Steak with spaghetti squash --- best combination ever, I was so happy that they serve steak without the potatoes!   Mac N Cheese -- This is was perfectly cooking, pasta was al dente which I have never seen happen in baked mac n cheese.  It was a bit rich and I enjoyed my entree so much that I couldn't enjoy this as much as I ususally would.  Succotash -- Ok, I never thought I would order this but the server said it was favorite so we got it and he was right.  It was buttery veggie goodness.  Mom's Cheesecake -- this is an NY Style cheesecake made by the owner's mom, it was the best cheesecake I ever had and beat any of the ones I ever had in NYC by a million points.  It was so good that I got a slice to go."}
{"text":"This place has the magical combination, a great chef and fantastic staff! It's farm to table all the way with wonderful local ingredients and an outstanding atmosphere. A definite must try!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service, great ambiance!  Went with a large group to celebrate a birthday dinner....they were quick to accommodate a request for sparking wine when we sat down as well as dessert at the end of the meal which avoided the awkwardness of stepping away in the middle of dinner. Great experience!"}
{"text":"First time. Went here for brunch. Didn't realize they opened at 11 (our time) and we were 10 minutes early. They saw us outside and sat us anyway, very cool of them to do that. Had steak and eggs and you will not go wrong getting this, extremely tasty and well seasoned. The biscuits here are absolutely delicious. Wife had the standard eggs, bacon and grits. She said they were all cooked perfectly and seasoned well. Coffee was Americano and I was not familiar with that but it was good as well. Had the coffee cake for desert, portion size was large and it was excellent. Will definitely be back here again."}
{"text":"Grouper special was unbelievably delish as was the baked pimento cheese. Incredible dinner and service! Will def come here again!"}
{"text":"I always am looking for a good Brunch after Church and was fortunate to discover Dogwood was serving, so three friends and I went.  We all happened to order the Low Country Eggs Benedict which were amazing.   You get two sunny side up eggs over fried green tomatoes sitting on top of collards and topped with hollandaise sauce.  We all agreed that it was one of the best dishes we have ever had.    The atmosphere is very contemporary with a Big City feel and the wait staff was very professional and attentive.  I think Dogwood may be my new favorite restaurant."}
{"text":"I'm with any reviewer who has complained about the outrageous pricing and the noise level here. I was one of their first customers when they opened and spoke to the manager about how loud it was in there, that you couldn't hear your dinner partner. Was told they were working on the acoustics to help absorb the sound without compromising the decor (huh? - Nothing to write home about in that respect!). The food was not outrageously priced then although I wasn't thrilled with the mediocre glass of a carefully measured white wine that on a later visit was priced at THIRTEEN DOLLARS (I did say mediocre & ordered it without looking at wine menu pricing). I haven't tried Rusty Bucket yet but would be willing to give it a shot when it warms up and can sit outside. Cork Buzz looks very nice - I wish they had a more \"normal\" dinner menu. It's too contrived!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere and company were great but the server was subpar and the food, although good, took forever to get and was cold. Our meal was compted after having to tell them, and then we were ignored never asked for dessert or coffee. Poor show of service and overall experience. If you're going to spend this kind of money and want an enjoyable experience I wouldn't suggest dogwoods."}
{"text":"Excellent service with even better food!  We had a nice bottle of wine and several of the small plates which were excellent!  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to try this wonderful SouthPark restaurant one recent Saturday night, and were rewarded with one of the best meals we've had in a long time. My scallops were delicious, and my wife thoroughly enjoyed the hanger steak she ordered. Their wine menu is extensive, and a fair number of craft beers are available on tap. With its trendy atmosphere, great service, and outstanding menu, Dogwood is a terrific addition to Charlotte's dining scene, and one that will be on our short list for future date nights."}
{"text":"When your grandmother offers to buy you lunch, tell her to take you here. My feisty 93-year-old grandmother has been here a time or two and decided to take me. I had the BLT, and I'd have a second if it weren't so filling. Also, the coffee (called Freedom Fresh) is fantastic. I was told that they were roasted by the owner."}
{"text":"Lovely atmosphere, delicious food and 5-star mixologists that can make cocktails you can't get anywhere else!"}
{"text":"The worst tomato bisque I've ever had in my life, you can't possibly mess up tomato bisque right? My husband thought I was joking until he took a sip, you should've seen his face. Possibly could've gotten sodium poisoning along with a heart-attack had I consumed the whole bowl, it tasted like half a carton of Morton dumped into a bottle of heavy cream. My $4 Trader Joe's soup at home tastes like 3 star Michelin comparing to this. Then there's the southern rice bowl, at first bite it seemed decent until you get a few more bites in then you realize your teeth are hurting from sugar overload. It was like devouring a bowl of sweet pickled kale. Southern doesn't mean overloading on \"southern\" flavors.   Then there's the price, this place is way overpriced. I've dined at numerous upscale establishments and don't mind paying for a good meal. NOT HERE.   Two stars for great decor and good service. Zero star for food."}
{"text":"This place was awesome!  The service was spot on and the waitress did an excellent job explaining dishes.  She was very attentive to our party.  We started with the pimento cheese and bacon jam appetizers.  The bacon jam was spectacular.  My entree consisted of scallops and wild boar.  The scallops were seared perfectly.  The boar had excellent flavor and I would order it again without an hesitation. The meat paired well with a glass of red wine.  The rest of my party enjoyed the fish."}
{"text":"Love Love this restaurant!! We ate here for the second time in 2 weeks and enjoyed it so much that it has become our new favorite restaurant! The cocktail list is fun and creative and the menu is unique and flavorful. The hostess remembered us from our last visit and found us a quiet spot in the back of the restaurant. I had the crab cake hush puppies and mussels this trip and they were both Devine!! I highly recommend this restaurant for a romantic dinner for two or a fun night out with friends!"}
{"text":"Just had a really delicious lunch of chicken pasta. Poblano Chili's were the ingredient of the day and were in soup, sandwich and of the light pasta sauce. My husband says it's the best burger he ever had. Pleasant environment and excellent waitstaff. Definitely making our favorites list."}
{"text":"It's a lovely spot to have lunch with a friend. Go on a sunny, Spring afternoon - you won't ever want to leave. The food is delicious with creative, Southern-inspired dishes that constantly change. Love their craft cocktails and can't ever turn down their dessert! This is a new Charlotte gem in a great little nook near SouthPark mall. Valet parking is a bonus because parking in the area isn't super easy."}
{"text":"What an experience! Could not be happier. We sat at the Chef's bar and we were able to watch the kitchen work flawlessly. Our server was on top of his game and made great recommendations. The cocktails were creative and fresh. We had a few charcuterie boards, octopus, lamb and rabbit! Each better than the last. We will absolutely be back for round 2!"}
{"text":"Sat at the bar for drinks, appetizers, and entrees. And left before entrees we're even ordered. Bar tender on Monday 1/29 and total snob. Seemed bothered by us the whole time. Too bad because we were regulars and won't be returning."}
{"text":"As one of the first patrons of this restaurant upon opening, I cannot rave enough about how absolutely fabulous this restaurant concept has become in the Southpark neighborhood. Mr. John Dressler has done it again as far as successful restaurant concepts. Lead bartender, Brian is the ultimate curator of new and eclectic drinks that appeal to the clientele interested in expanding their alcoholic pallet. And the Monday through Thursday Oyster Happy Hour? Ridicuously awesome. The Bacon Jam app is off the chain and their Burger?? Quality All. THE. WAY. Dogwood is a Class A restaurant ALL the way!!"}
{"text":"We decided to give Dogwood a try after reading all the reviews and we are so glad we did! We had an excellent meal. We started with the baked Fontina and NC shrimp. The fontina was creamy and delicious and the sauce the shrimp were in was to die for. We dipped our bread bc we couldn't let it go! We also did the ham toast with radishes. It was good not great but good. The bread served with all the starters was phenomenal. For entree we had the lamb special and the grouper. The lamb was cooked perfectly. It was buttery and accompanied by a yogurt sauce that was fantastic. The grouper was awesome! The sauce the fish and veggies were plated over was insanely good. We finished up with the toasted pound cake and  some French press coffee. Perfection.  Our server was on point, she was knowledgable and super helpful. The only thing I'm not crazy about is the iPad drink menu. I know that Dogwood is owned by Dresslers but I prefer Dogwood by far."}
{"text":"Was lucky to get an invite for my sweetie and I to attend a soft opening for them on Friday night.  We had the Gulf and East Coast Oysters (Thank you Mr. Dressler!), Fontina Cheese Appetizer, House Salad, Scallops with Squash, Steak with Mashed Potatoes and a side of Au Gratin Potatoes and for dessert an Apple Empanada and a Chocolate Cake.  We drank the Vouvray, which is oh, so drinkable with everything!  The oysters were amazing, especially the Gulf Oysters.  I'm from Florida, so this was a true taste of home.  The salad was dressed well and was crisp and fresh.  The Fontina Cheese Appetizer was buttery and tasty.  It needed a couple more pieces of toast.  The only negative is the cheese firms up fairly quickly and so spreading it on the toast becomes less effective, especially when you take a bite and the whole smear of cheese comes off of the toast.  The Scallops had a good flavor and were cooked well.  They were a bit on the cool side though.  The Collard Greens that came with them were good as well.  The Arugala drizzle was a nice flavor, but it was a cold drizzle I wish it had been a hot drizzle.  Might have helped the temp of the scallops.  The squash that came with it was good, but I wish they had been a different color as they looked like the scallops.  Also a bit on the cool side.  The Steak with Mashed Potatoes was very good.  It was closer to rare temp, which we both appreciate, but we asked for medium well.  It had a great, fresh flavor though.  The Mashed Potatoes were oh, so, good!  (better than Dressler's).  The Au Gratin Potatoes were tasty, seemed as if it was the fontina cheese over the potatoes.  It was supposed to have onions it it, but we couldn't find any.  The Apple Empanada was tasty, but the crust was a bit like a pop tart... a little dry and crumbly but luckily - I love pop tarts.  The caramel drizzle was really good.  The Chocolate Cake was tasty, but again, a bit dry.  Not as moist as I expected.  I know I'm being very critical of everything, but we gave the same feedback at the restaurant, so I'm just re-iterating it.  We enjoyed everything we ate and getting everything tweaked to the Chef Scotts' high standards (not mine) is the goal.  The restaurant design is really nice with interesting wood joists placed high in the ceiling as well as really cool photos of various scenes from the local food providers they use.  There is an expansive bar area with extended seating and 2 fireplaces.  The bar is sleek and modern looking but still welcoming and comfortable.  We definitely look forward to getting back to Dogwood's soon and trying some more of their delicious choices!"}
{"text":"Very nice ambiance. The crab hush puppies and French fries were delish. I also ordered the large portion of ribs and although tender, they were not as tasty. I do think the restaurant was a bit over priced and probably wouldn't rush to finback. Our waiter Josh was great however!"}
{"text":"Love this little strip of places tucked behind the Whole Foods (Whole Foods itself is a bit of a different story, but I digress). One evening after coming from the airport, decided on a whim to see if we could get into Dogwood, and wouldn't you know it, they were absolutely packed. And we were utterly out of place, in traveling clothes. They made room. Awesome.  Now Dogwood isn't fancy or anything, but still, we were out of place. This is entirely on us, but from the welcome to the server, they were absolutely excellent. Even though we had no reservation (and they were packed), they slid us in. To be fair, we were tucked behind the brick column were no one could see us, but that's okay. It may have done a bit to dampen the noise - which can be considerable when the place is packed (which is often).  When it comes to food, there is plenty to choose from, and that is just on the appetizer menu. There are some interesting choices, such as the roasted oysters that come out chilled (not really sure how that works) and the cheese plate that doesn't have much cheese on it.  The real star here, beyond the service, is the 48 hour duck and dumplings. It tastes nothing like the duck you are used to. No gaminess and more importantly it just falls apart. If you don't like to share, or just want to keep it for yourself, get two. Well worth it."}
{"text":"It's expensive but the food quality is amazing and the atmosphere is great. If the weathers nice it out on the patio it's really a nice scene. Highly recommend for a special night out."}
{"text":"Let me preface this by saying: this is my first Yelp Review of any business but I exclusively choose businesses based on yelp reviews.  This was my first time at Dogwood Southern Table and Bar and I chose the restaurant based on the reviews.   The Service: The service started incredible slow and our waitress wasn't on the clock until about 15 min after we sat down so we weren't even greeted by her until then. Even after that - I must say that the service was absolutely amazing. She was attentive but not overbearing, she made great recommendations which me and my company both decided on. In addition, she went above and beyond and offered us free dessert based on a comment about our favorite desserts.   The Food: The recommendations the waitress made was absolutely superb. The Wild Boar (trust me - I was weary about it too) dish was one of the best dishes I've had in Charlotte. I also had a glass of wine that I asked the waitress to bring based on her pairing recommendation - it was a perfect match.   The down side is that it's far from uptown, especially when you have after work reservations and the traffic is insane, and sits in South Park. It's also a bit pricey but it's totally work the money. I absolutely will come have dinner here again. Great atmosphere- Great Service- Incredible food."}
{"text":"Excellent brunch! No matter what you order for your meal,  be sure to get some biscuits.  Baked pimento is a hit too."}
{"text":"So, the 2 start rating in \"Yelp-ese\" is \"Meh, I've experienced better\" and that is exactly how I feel about this place.  The boyfriend and I were looking for a brunch place we hadn't tried before and this is one we probably won't return to. We arrived and were seated in the \"lounge area\" aka, the bar.  There was one or two other couples there as well.  I ordered the Buttermilk Fried Quail (which came with Blueberry sauce and Buckwheat johnny cakes) and he ordered the Walnut French Toast.  We also ordered a basket of \"Maw Maw's Biscuits\" and two coffees.  To start, the coffee was very good.  It was French Press though so you really only got a 6oz cup, but it was very good.  Two out of the three biscuts were tough and dry, but when each biscuit cost $2 each, they better be the best biscuts i'd ever tasted, so our meal was already off to a not so hot start.  The Walnut French toast was quite good and the portion was huge, two people could easily split.  The Johnny cakes that came with my meal were good, the quail was bland, and I had to ask for salt and pepper as there wasn't any on the table. All in all, our bill came to $48 before tip.  I don't think that the brunch at this place was worth what we paid for for it.  From now on, I'm sticking to Terrace Cafe, at least if i'm going to pay $50, the food will be good enough to be worth it."}
{"text":"Had heard raving reviews of Dogwood both from fellow Yelpers as well as some Foodies I trust...may have hit them on a bad night.   The highlights included the service which was mostly spot on. Attentive but not overwhelming and generally knowledgeable. Did, however, have an overzealous wine pourer which always drives me crazy..don't want wine 3/4 up my glass so I'll order more- that really doesn't / shouldn't work, right? The winning order of the night was the Striped Bass special and it was special...perfectly cooked and well presented. The octopus and chorizo was very good as well however the yummy sausage may have covered up that the octopus was a bit over cooked.   A few very glaring low lights.. Soggy, watery mushroom \"pieces\" that had absolutely no taste..combined with some very random half- melted burrata cheese placement in the dish made this small plate muddled at best, inedible to most. The Collards (shame, shame...) were also underdone and lacked seasoning. Pretty inexcusable for a Southern themed restaurant.   Will give it another whirl on a weeknight (we went on a very busy Sat night) hoping it lives back up to the hype but they have some work to do."}
{"text":"I still adore This great place. What staff is better than Scott, Robert, Ariana, Chef Eric and JT? No other staff at ANY restaurant I've dined at here in Charlotte!!! Thank you very much Dogwood for staying consistent with your service as well as your delicious food! I appreciate everything about this restaurant and its great staff!"}
{"text":"I went with some friends from work and had a nice time. Service was nice. Amazing cocktail and loved the shrimp and grits! Really, really good!!!!!!Dessert? Chocolate cake was light but flavorful!"}
{"text":"A truly outstanding find! A bit pricey but wow what flavors!  I was headed with our group to another location but it ended up having such a long wait that we deviated to this one.  It was way dark inside... so dark that you have to use your phone to read the menu. The place was in a nice area, with several other selections, and you could tell it was on the higher side, but the group decided to stay.  First the cocktails selections... really interesting inspired drinks like no where I have been. Smoked cinnamon bark whisky, raspberry infused bourbon with blueberries, and a whisky vanilla old fashion just to name some of them. I had a great vanilla porter beer but the group raved about the specialty cocktails.  I was so full from my other meal of the day that I only ordered a starter as my main dish... chorizo octopus. Yes that's right... read it again... chorizo octopus. It was wonderful! The most tender octopus with a great chorizo spice and for a starter it was enough for a meal. I am used to octopus being a bit chewy but this was a kin to a fine filet! Melted like warm butter in my mouth! The combination was surprisingly amazing!  The group that I was with all raved about their food as well and I got to try the blanched and then flash fried sweet potato chips infused with watermelon glaze... WOW! Fantastic! A very flavorful selection!  Our service was outstanding and the place was a vision of decor.     Desert was no exception... any of you that have been to Dreslers near Morresville NC know that Mamas cheese cake or mamas carrot cake is not something to be passed up. Well it turns out that Dogwood is a member of the family and momma makes their cheese cake and carrot cake too! We had both and all agreed they were the best anyone had ever had.  The larger down fall of this location was the price... a meal for 4 cost almost as much as a higher end car payment and really reminded me why I like to eat at home... however today I still find myself thinking about that chorizo and octopus!  I suggest this location for flavor profiles you will not normally find in food and drink"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat in Charlotte. The food is wonderful and the service is excellent. Always take out of town guests here and they enjoy it as much as we do. Love their pimento cheese. You must try their bacon jam. Definitely love their desserts too. As I said earlier this is definitely my favorite restaurant in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Tasty!!! I was excited to try Dogwood - I've always been a fan of farm to table establishments - reading reviews on Yelp allowed me to scope out a few \"must haves\" before I even got there. Was another couple with my husband and I - we started with the oysters, bacon jam and southern dumplings... (Dumplings were awesome)! The others were good too... But those dumplings..... I ordered the scallops and hubby got the shrimp and grits - we cleaned our plates! Grits were almost sweet, which was strange, but not bad - dessert was a little disappointing as I was expecting something \"southern\" (I guess pound cake is southern)? But I saw one evening there was banana pudding and if hoped for something like that instead of carrot cake - or chocolate creme brûlée.  Regardless, we will absolutely be back. Sunday dinners just got a whole lot more exciting."}
{"text":"The service here is lovely and they pay great attention to detail. I mostly go here for lunch (only been to dinner once) and honestly everything is good. If they ever have a fish sandwich on special of any type, I usually always get it because they prepare it perfectly. Glad to have something like this in South Park area."}
{"text":"We were stopping by Charlotte for one evening and looking for a place to eat. Based on the yelp reviews we picked Dogwood and were not disappointed.  The Decour is contemporary however the service is old-fashioned southern charm. The food is southern traditional but with a modern flair. The extensive wine list and 80 Bourbons or presented on iPad for you to scroll through. The pictures are pretty much speak for themselves as to the high quality and delicious taste of the food."}
{"text":"I have avoided shrimp and grits for 79 years. What was I thinking?  Had them here Saturday night and they were fabulous!  A friend had bison and duck. So original and tasty. My gal had fried oysters which I found exquisite.  The sides - sautéed sweet potatoes and beets - were great.   The decor is beautiful, but that doesn't  translate to outrageous prices. In fact the meal was very reasonably priced.  Finally, apologies to the server because I forgot his name. He was very professional without being overly attentive. Oh, Yeah, he did comp a slice of their signature cheesecake.... a perfect ending."}
{"text":"We enjoyed a great meal at Dogwood during restaurant week, although we all ordered off the main menu. Great oyster dishes, fried, half shell and stew started.  Followed by delicious grouper, scallops and rib eye. The only miss was the flounder which was under-cooked. Great wine selection too, discounted 20% off, although prices seemed a little high.  We will definitely be back. It's a great addition to SP area."}
{"text":"We had a GREAT family meal here last Thursday. The inside of the place is so cool. Try the ribs appetizer and grouper! For dessert the toasted pound cake is excellent. We will be back."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant, great wine, delicious food. We sat outside and it was a real treat. The waitress we had (I can't remember her name, I'm sorry!) gave us great recommendations, and she even complied when I made a (slightly ridiculous) request to have my wine served in a fancy glass. The flounder was excellent, as was the carrot cake. I don't live in NC, but if I'm ever down to Charlotte again I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Our go-to place for small plates and craft cocktails. Make sure to sit at the bar on Wednesday evenings for Cocktail Lab. $5 for the cocktail of the night."}
{"text":"In CLT for business and after reviewing Yelp! I opted to try Dogwood for a client dinner.  I am so glad I did.  I recommend getting a reservation and we scored a choice hightop.  The staff was engaging, kind and welcoming. As all six of us were from out of town, understanding the NC focus for the restaurant and we were not let down.  Craft cocktails made to perfection and the food is to die for.  We shared the baked pimento cheese, calamari and chips/dip for starters. I had, at the suggestion of our server, the duck entree. There was no room for dessert, but there will certainly be room for a visit to Dogwood on my next trip to CLT."}
{"text":"Good small plates selection. Had crispy fried oysters, deviled duck eggs and octopus with chorizo. All solid bites. The market salad was a throwaway...they skimped on the chèvre and dressing."}
{"text":"The Grouper is UNBELIEVABLE!!  Unquestionably, the best I have ever had... Great atmosphere and attentive staff."}
{"text":"Outstanding experience. Had the NC Shrimp and Grits. Excellent meal, great environment and service."}
{"text":"We visited on 10/5/16 - Outstanding, again. The chef was imaginative and thoughtful in presentation, and every bite is praise-worthy. It's the kind of food that's incredibly satisfying far beyond just being satiated. Truly an experience that is adventurous, but not overly unfamiliar or stuffy. Flavors that make you say, \"wow, that's the perfect marriage!\" But you'd have never though of on your own (or most wouldn't). The wait staff is AMAZING. We did not get our beloved Chris this time, but Drew did a great job, and Chris remembered us and sent a couple amazing bites to our table. The service, space, even the drinks are top notch and I believe this is our new 'spot'. Highly recommend trying Dogwood, regardless of your palate. High-end casual, relaxed and an absolute gem in Queen Charlotte's crown."}
{"text":"Charlotte is now a large enough city that it's easy to neglect one area of town while pursuing excellent cuisine in another. I'm sorry to say that South Park (for these Matthews residents) is the area that got neglected. I thought of it as eclipsed by chain restaurants, and didn't realize until recently that there were gems that needed discovering.   One of those gems is Dogwood Southern Table and Bar. They offer not only gourmet Southern cuisine, but the best cocktails in town.   Adi was our excellent server and he was an expert guide of the varied menu. We had excellent food in our wild boar and shrimp and grits and terrific beverages, as well.   This was a special occasion for us and that did not go unnoted by the staff. We had glasses of champagne and a fantastic cheesecake to enjoy (courtesy of the restaurant) for our special day.  Parking was easy...there is a \"P\" parking sign leading patrons to the rear of the restaurant. There's a walkway through the garage to the premises.   I'm gluten free and there were many options and a very customizable menu. I ended up with the pimento cheese appetizer with carrots, and shrimp and grits. Both were delectable.   My husband and I will return and be sure to bring others with us next time."}
{"text":"First visit was January 23, 2016.  Happened in not knowing it was QueensFeast weekend.  No matter, as the entire experience was FANTASTIC. From Robert's greeting at the front door to JTs service to our Kitchen Table new friends in the prep area, our expectations were exceeded.    We dine out a lot in Charlotte, but had never found our way to this hidden jewel.  My advice:  FIND IT!!!  Thanks, all.  We'll be back with friends!"}
{"text":"Folks were in town and I needed a spot to impress them. Something that screamed Sweet Caroline, some may even say the land of the pine. I found this gem in the area and thought I would give it a shot.  I walk into Dogwood and the warm atmosphere felt like I was being tucked into bed and I was ready to cuddle up with this amazing menu.   Now my folks were in town so I needed something legend.....wait for it....dary. What better than the craft cocktail Legends of the Fall. The bartender took her blow torch from welding the bar together to spark some fire under some cinnamon infused bark. She instantly put my glass over it to get a nice smokey flavor and topped it off with some TLC. Highly recommend.  The food was out of this world but not really....everything they serve you is within the Carolinas. Everything is locally grown and fresher than MC Hammer. This was one of the best dinners I have had in a long time."}
{"text":"I've dined at Dogwood a few times now, and I must say my experience has gotten better each time. Most recently I had dinner there with a group of 6 for a celebration.   We started with apps, and the bacon jam was delicious! For my entree, I had fish and it was the perfect size and the flavor was spot on. The waiter knew we were having a celebration, so they gave us a couple of complimentary deserts which were delicious and we really appreciated it!  Our waiter was awesome. He was friendly, helpful, and attentive. Another waiter dropped a dish right behind me, and he felt so bad about startling me that he gave me a card for a free appetizer on my next visit - not necessary but very appreciated!   Overall this restaurant is delicious and I can't wait to visit again!!"}
{"text":"This place really doesn't need another good review, but here it goes. Great food, good service...treat yourself!!! Bacon jam was the best. Their in house gelato was nice too"}
{"text":"This review really goes out to our server Adi. I promise you, there is no relationship... At all.  The city of Charlotte has great restaurants, but great service is not as easy to find. The worst is when you enjoy the food, but the service is lacking. Well, at Dogwood you do not not have to search any further or any farther.  Our server Adi was attentive, kind, funny with great recommendations.   The pimento cheese, (I know) was supringsly delish. I would have NEVER ordered it, had he not recommended it.  For entrees I got the scallops and boar, my husband had the flank and duck. Both were good, he also recommended the grouper... We didn't get it. Next time we'll get that and shrimp and grits.... Though, I'm not sure if they rotate the menu items.  Dessert wise, know that this is a Dressler restaurant, so the desserts are similar at them all. Here, we had the pound cake, which was okay. Next time we'll get the cheesecake."}
{"text":"The BEST BURGER in Charolette, hands down! But get there before 6:00, not on the menu $5, burger with the best hand cut fries!  Everything else on the menu us also outstanding! We love all the bartenders too!  Hurray for Brian, Joanne, Michael & Brittany!"}
{"text":"Loved every single thing about this place with the slight exception of our beignets that were a bit on the dry side but delicious nonetheless. We had the crab cakes, chicken and biscuits and the bison. Everything was great for Sunday brunch, well seasoned and cooked perfectly. Can't wait to be in Charlotte next to sample their dinner menu. One of the prettiest and cleanest bathrooms I've seen, and the servers where pretty fabulous too!!!!!"}
{"text":"Ate lunch here with my parents, I like to try and impress them with the food scene when they come to Charlotte and Dogwood had just recently opened so I took the risk.  WELL WORTH IT!   Their lunch menu is super simple and packed full of delicious choices.  I had the cat fish po boy and my husband had their pork sandwich.  We both cleaned our plate.  The win however goes to my dad, he ordered the NC trout and we were all envious.  It was so good, he even closed his eyes while he was chewing it :) Dessert was great, they told us that Grandma Dressler comes in every morning and makes the carrot cake and cheesecake from scratch.   I can't wait to check out the dinner menu!"}
{"text":"Been there 3 times now. Food and drinks are on the expensive side but good. Nice place to go with a group or with a date. Menu isn't overly large but everything I have tried has been well executed. Love the atmosphere. Nice Charlotte addition!!"}
{"text":"Love!!   Surrounded by other great restaurants in a one mile radius, Dogwood has some serious competition... but after my dinning experience there, I am convinced that they have nothing to worry about as long as they keep up what they're doing!   Phenomenal food and even better service.  I adored the place from the minute I walked in. The ambiance is warm and inviting, while lively at the same time. The wine menu is on an iPad, which makes browsing through the list more enjoyable! The severs were so pleasant. We ate there during restaurant week, which gave us the opportunity to try a few different things. I loved the roasted mussels, and quite enjoyed the tomato and goat cheese baguette appetizer. While they ran out of the mahi I ordered, they replaced it with another similar white fish which was delightful. From all the courses I was least impressed with the dessert, but that's not to say it wasn't good. I had the toasted pound cake, which tasted good, but was a bit too heavy for my liking.   I'm going back soon with an empty stomach; they have way too many terrific sounding dishes that I need to try, and an impressive cocktail menu that I didn't get to explore on my first visit!"}
{"text":"Pretty good. Pimiento cheese dip was great. The salad was good but seemed like more of the size of a side salad. Their desserts are amazing though!!! Had the chocolate cheesecake with the peanut butter gelato"}
{"text":"One of the Top 5 restaurants I have ever been to. Allison was such an amazing server. She was knowledgeable, funny and attentive. The food.... omg, amazing. The good is sourced from local farms and everything is fresh fresh fresh. The ores cheesecake I had was the best cheesecake I've ever eaten. The menu changes every three weeks so I could literally eat here everyday. If you are in Charolette this place is a must!"}
{"text":"Frequently come here on a Sunday for Brunch. TosY sat i. The bar, and experience e still great--can't beat the food and the service.  Get here early, it fills up fast!!!  Heard they have a great Happy Hour during the week.  What a difference a day makes, when it comes to a dining experience. Yesterday went to a restaurant that I have been bugging my friend to go to--very disappointed. Today we find Dogwood Southern Table Bar by accident, and what a find. You want a great meal experience, locally sourced food, great service, then you need to get to this restaurant.  I had the chicken and biscuits with Chorizo gravy, and. Y girlfriend had the crepes.  The chicken, nice crust and flavor, the chorizo gravy was phenomenal.  The crepes, had chicken Shitake mushrooms, asparagus with spinach and a great house jus, made with a veal stock.  You need to ask for Michael, knows food and great service.   We'll be back for dinner, and did I mention the great value-delicious food at a wonderful price!  This place is always awesome--great food and service. You cannot go wrong at Dogwood!"}
{"text":"Great spot! Drinks were awesome and service was great!  The bartender's choice was a great addition to the drink menu. You give a few adjectives that you enjoy in a drink (crisp, refreshing, with vodka and ginger). Then they give you a card on the drink that says all the ingredients with a miniature clothes hanger.  Didn't eat, but saw a lot of food come out that looked phenomenal; especially chicken & waffles."}
{"text":"Dogwood Southern probably doesn't need another good review but we just had an excellent lunch experience. Should I start with the service or the food? Both were excellent.  We were looked after by Allison. Service is clearly a priority of the restaurant. Allison was attentive as you'd expect at a nice restaurant. Always there when needed. Allison knew the menu inside out and was not shy in making recommendations. All good choices.  The lunch menu is not overly extensive, which means the food is excellent and all three dishes we ordered where extremely tasty; good size portions, beyond flavorful and true to the menu description. Many if not most of the dishes support local growers and farmers.  This is a good looking space with plenty of ambience and a large bar - so probably good for many types of occasions.  We did get recognized by the staff as regular restaurant goers with a digestif. That was a nice touch at a reasonably priced lunch."}
{"text":"This place was amazing.  It's pricey but well worth it.  The service was some of the best I've ever experienced and the food was phenomenal!  A great place!"}
{"text":"I had been wanting to visit Dogwood for months and was so excited when I finally made it. I went for a Sunday brunch and while the food was great, I was extremely disappointed in the service my party received. I felt as though we received some serious attitude from our waiter and the manager. The manager at least made things right by comping some of our food, but we didn't appreciate the overall experience. I'm very disappointed to say I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved the service and food. We came in off the road underdressed for the atmosphere and were treated to a fantastic time. Highly recommend this spot for delicious local fare and drinks. The staff was knowledgeable and kind. Our waiter JT made some wonderful recommendations."}
{"text":"We tried this out on a Sunday night about 6:30 and got in without reservations. Service was great and my wife and I thought the food was excellent. We had the sausage appetizer which was unusual for us but it was completely consumed and very tasty. The oysters and house salad were my wife's choice.  The grouper with vegetables was mine. We both found everything delicious. Yelp sponsored a few desert so we had mom's cheesecake and French press coffee to go with it. We may come back just for dessert alone and sit at the bar.  Very good place.  Will return."}
{"text":"This is no joke the best meal I can EVER remember having. We started with a Legends of the fall, duck confit, beef carpaccio, and had wild boar with scallops and duck breast finished off with cheesecake and poundcake. Absolutely amazing and our server Audie was amazing with his suggestions. I cant wait to come back!!!"}
{"text":"Seen this place on Groupon so decided to buy it & check it out. I got the lunch one thinking I could go in a Saturday but they are only opened for dinner that day so I opted to go on a Sunday. I sat at the bar and informed the bartender that I had a Groupon for lunch and she give me the menu. I ordered enough to cover the $25 Groupon. Starting with the fried oysters which could have been seasoned better but eating them with both the slaw & sauce they were good. Then I got the duck fingers and scallops, the overall dish was good but the duck fingers were very bland. The scallops on the other hand were cooked and seasoned perfectly. I gave 2 stars do the the blandness of some of the food and for the fact that once the check come the bartender then tells me that I can't use my Groupon but it's brunch not lunch, when she could have told me that from the beginning and when I asked for the manager he acted too busy so I just paid my tab and left but I don't have a desire to go back after that."}
{"text":"The BEST restaurant I have experienced in Charlotte. Lively, friendly, but not overbearing, staff. We had a party of three but ended up seated next to an acquaintance who was having their featured entree-bison and lambchop. The aroma was too alluring to resist. As others have stated the pimento appetizer with bacon jelly is over the top good. Yes, it was loud but not in an obnoxious, beer bar kinda way. People were enjoying the dining experience and the comfortable, sleek setting. The complimentary valet was \"icing on the cake\", as they say. I will definitely  be going back very soon."}
{"text":"Neither trendy nor over-the top upscale - the Dogwood Southern is simply a fancy restaurant located at the corner of Sharon Rd and Fairview Rd. They're trying to brand themselves as a farm-to-table restaurant but it didn't quite feel that way.   I swung through with some friends for dinner on a casual Tuesday evening - we jumped straight into cocktails and appetizers. I ordered the 'Legends of the Fall' and was mildly disappointed to taste a copy cat of an old fashioned. The chick n dumplings; however, was a thoughtful and well done appetizer - the dumplings just melted in your mouth.    For the main course I had the beef ribs which were tasty and my friend ordered the special of the day: scallops and duck. This wouldn't be my first choice of items to combine and when I had a bite from his plate my assumptions were confirmed - his entree wasn't nearly as good as my beef ribs."}
{"text":"A delicious meal made even better by the incredibly attentive and friendly wait staff.  I had the arugula salad, the shrimp n grits, and the cheese cake. I highly recommend them all."}
{"text":"My wife and I tried Dogwood for the first time last night. The service and food were outstanding. I had the duck breast and she had the chicken with black bean and poblano rice. We passed on dessert but will try something when we go back."}
{"text":"Place was packed yet service was excellent. Food is a creative take on Southern cuisine. Shrimp and grits really nailed the texture of good grits with a savory broth that enhanced the shrimp and okra, with a mild kick from the peppers and chorizo."}
{"text":"Very nice dining experience and friendly knowledgeable staff. I was here for lunch and had the kale salad and the crab cakes and they were the best crab cakes I have ever had. They also had a few local great craft beers on tap. Very nice place for a night out and fine dining experience."}
{"text":"Dogwood is hidden behind the Whole Foods in South Park, but it hides a nice interior and some delicious bacon jam.  We ended up coming here to eat small plates and booze, while being disappointed in the stale NCAA basketball tournament.   This place is a spinoff of Dressler's (in the Metropolitan), so a lot of the menu items are similar, especially the drink menu, which was a bit disappointing, because we hoped to try something new.  The ribs and pimento cheese plates were good, but the bacon jam with bread was great. The only downside was the jar of bacon jam was small. Gimme more jam, dogwood's....  Hopefully we'll head here for some entrees, but who knows. This place is a solid backup spot, if another restaurant in South Park that you planned to go to is too packed."}
{"text":"Dogwood is owned by the same people as Dressler's. The idea behind this restaurant is \"Elevated Southern Food\". My dinner group met here to celebrate the group's 6th anniversary.  First off, the decor is beautiful with reclaimed wood, a couple of fireplaces and wood beams. Tables in the dining room seemed to be right on top of each other. And the place was LOUD with nothing to eat the noise so you could barely hear the person across the table from you.  The drink menu is provided on an iPad for your viewing. They seem to have an extensive wine and whiskey list. The beer list consists of local and regional beers. I started the non-alcoholic thing recently and they have a few non-alcoholic drinks including a house made ginger beer which is what I ordered. It was spicy but delicious and not too sweet.  Almost everyone at our table ordered some sort of appetizer or salad. I ordered their market salad which was described as greens with a mixture of root vegetables and a spicy dressing. The problem here is that half our table (we had 11 people) received their appetizers and then the rest of the table waited approximately 15 minutes for theirs. The salad was good but the pieces of root vegetables were tiny.  For an entree, I ordered the Trout. Around the table, shrimp and grits and the Ribeye were popular. The trout was good with a nice skin and presented on a bed of rice grits but the grits lacked flavor. I was able to sample my neighbors ribeye and that was delicious with great flavor and very tender.  Most of us ordered dessert. The carrot cake was really good. I ordered the NY cheesecake and while it was good and creamy I thought it could have been a bit more on the firm side.  For service, our server was amazing. She kept up with everything.  The noise level is what killed this experience for me and the appetizer timing issue. But the food has some highs and lows and you never know until you try a place out."}
{"text":"Came with my step sister and her boyfriend who are gluten and meat free. My husband and I had not been here before and it did not disappoint. Everyone's food was fantastic as well as the service and we can't wait to go back as the menu changes seasonally!"}
{"text":"The drinks were very good.  However we paid 15.00 and 14.00 for these drinks.  Nothing in my opinion can justify the price.   The Old Fashion was great, but tough to enjoy knowing I was not going to get another simply because of cost    Food menu looked good but we went for some happy hour food specials.  I got the oysters (1 dollar each).  The burger also looked very big and good for only 5 dollars.    The service was great and the stuff was good, just tough to beat that price for everything."}
{"text":"Absolutely one of the best restaurants I have patronized in a long time. Not only were the servers prompt and attentive but also very knowledgeable about the specials, the spices used etc. The dinner I had was awesome, with sublime appetizers shared by me and my guest. I don't usually opt for dessert but the selections on the menu all sounded amazing. Will definitely be coming here again."}
{"text":"Stopped here for dinner while traveling for business.  A beautiful interior, enthusiastic wait staff and interesting menu.  They have some new twists on traditional southern food.  We had a great charcuterie plate that had rabbit sausage, duck prosciutto, boar pate and more.  The shrimp and grits were fantastic!"}
