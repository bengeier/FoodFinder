{"text":"I've been here about 6 times and choose to get the same thing every time. I really like the food here and it is good quality. I have a sensitive stomach that will let me know when I have encountered bad quality.  The only reason why I did not rate higher was the bathroom amenities here are sub par...... Ie I wouldn't want to sit down or stay very long in there"}
{"text":"I and another girl were riding on the bus one blistery day and it was extremely cold; we were the only people on board and I wanting to kill some time before my meeting I spotted a Pho noodle restaurant and rang to get off.  Much to my surprise the girl also got off and followed me into the restaurant.  I thought as I sat at an available table that she must have wanted a quick warm up as well.  Imagine my surprise to see her approach my table with a menu and ask me what I wanted to drink.  Ha-ha she was my waitress!  Well it wasn't too hard to know what to order as I was needing something to sooth my aching shivery body so I ordered the beef sate.  In minutes a very large bowl was put before me by my bus companion and it came with heaping amounts of beef, fresh sprouts and fresh basil on the side.  I sprinkled my basil in the soup and dug immediately in.    The beef was so tasty and the broth was spicy and yet with a touch of sweetness.  I could also taste the added crispness of the fresh basil which was such a nice added zing. . I gobbled this up in no time and was presented with a bill for under $10, definitely one of the best spontaneous pit stop pho's I have tasted in the city and one of the best remedies for fighting cold weather blues."}
{"text":"I visited Pho 88 on a recommendation from my sister-in-law.  Upon entering, my senses were flooded with the scent of mothballs.  Luckily, the adaptive processes of the brain helped me to acclimate.  I had a Vietnamese soup and mango bubble tea.  Both were delicious, and the bubble tea was extremely smooth and creamy.  Unfortunately, I visited again the next day for a bubble tea, and I had a very different experience.  It had fairly large ice chunks, which led me to chew it more than I drank it.  I would still go back, but would make a point of needing the bubble tea well-blended (if I want ice chunks in a drink, I'll get a frap at Starbucks)."}
{"text":"Pho 88 is definitely a goto restaurant you can add to your list if you are wondering where to find decent Vietnamese food in Southeast Calgary, which has a ridiculous number of Vietnamese restaurants to choose from - making it hard to decide where to eat. We've tried it three times and that was good enough to form a positive opinion.   Our food tasted very fresh with each visit so far and it we did not have to wait long. The price worked out to less than $35 total for two people each visit.   The restaurant is clean, the staff are very polite, the atmosphere is quiet, and it is right along 17th avenue SE (not hard to find).   It is in our top 3 Vietnamese places in the Southeast.   Thanks Pho 88!  ~ Shane"}
