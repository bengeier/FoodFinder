{"text":"It's October 18 12:29 , if the lid comes off easily off the cup please don't give us that shit, I just spilled half my drink in my cup holder."}
{"text":"wait time just to be greeted at the counter, is ridiculous. I understand them being busy, Just acknowledge that were here waiting and that you will be with us. Only focus is on the drive thru. Restaurant was empty."}
{"text":"They say \"have it your way\" but if that were true I'd have what I order made my way instead of whatever they decide. The wait times at this location are at times ridiculous. I ordered a whopper jr with cheese no lettuce and there was no cheese on my burger! Then they have the nerve to give my about 4 onion rings and I ordered a medium. Is a medium at BK really only 4 onion rings now or are the employees here just not caring? I came back only a few days from this last visit I mentioned and ordered a extra long cheeseburger no lettuce a chicken crisp rodeo sandwich with cheese and a rodeo cheeseburger with tomato. Yep sometimes do like tomatoes! The extra long burger had lettuce, the chicken rodeo had no cheese and the rodeo burger had no cheese. Some of it did taste good but it all wasn't how I ordered it. I decided to try breakfast the next day and it was actually decent  I know this is fast food and I don't expect the experience to be 5 stars but just simply getting a customers order right isn't much to ask at all."}
{"text":"This place used to be decent. First on Sunday I got a cheese burger that had something hard in it, don't know what. Then tonight I went with a friend and her kids and they missed part of the order so I repeated and instead of value drinks they put in value fries. It also took no kidding over 5 minuets to get the drinks one of which was an iced coffee drink. The wait was probably due to them having to fix a drive thru order where they failed to enter half of what she ordered. If it is the only way I can visit with my friend I will go here again, but I will not go for myself."}
{"text":"When they first opened,they were like a well oiled machine.Every order was exactly as you ordered it .Hot and fresh.In the last six months they have become a nightmare.Anything you order......drive through.....check your order. Very seldom.right.On top of this ......thry have a nasty attitude.They overcharged me and the order was wrong.Not even busy@ the time I went
Go to the one on Criag Rd.....unless you have time to check your order.I am.done with this BK.They suck"}
{"text":"Such a disappointment at Burger king. Service was too quick which I felt I was being rushed and out of the way. I ordered the original chicken sandwich and when I opened it there was like a dime size of mayo and hardly any lettuce.  It's not a dollop of Daisy! The bacon cheeseburger looked like some one sat on it. Not worth my damn $20 f'ing dollars. So upsetting. I could of had something better to eat. Never again am I going there."}
{"text":"Poor poor poor drive-thru service and wait time. Horrible that you can sit in line 20 minutes without moving. Learn how to serve customers. If you can't handle a double drive-thru line, close one down.
Never again. Mc D's & Carl's Jr all near. Go there instead."}
{"text":"We have been to this Burger King twice, and both times we have had a bad experience through the drive through. The first time we went, we ordered the \"2 Whooper meals for 10 dollars\" deal they were having. We received our bag and when we got home we realized that they put 4 orders of fries in there instead of the two whoppers and two fries. We had to drive back and have them correct our order. 

Next, thinking this may have been a fluke, we went back a week later to order again. My wife got a salad and I got some chicken fries. We get home and my wife is adding the dressing to her salad, and suddenly smelled something horrible. She looked at the packet of dressing she received for her salad from Burger King and noticed it was expired by two months. 

This place needs to get it together. Whether it's new management or new competent staff, something has to be done. From our experience, orders were taken incorrectly, and expired food is being sold to customers. This place definitely needs some quality control. I would not recommend this particular Burger King to anyone."}
{"text":"Horrible Food

This has to be the worst fast food around.  Don't let the prices bring you in.
I ordered a original chicken sandwich on July 4 afternoon due to a special they were running for $1.00. The sandwich was pre-made and was sitting there, they assured me that it would be fresh. The chicken was dry out and burnt,  the toasted bun was burnt.  I ate 1/ 4 of the sandwich and threw the rest out.  Last trip I had there was for a soft ice cream cone.  The ice was placed on the cone leaning off the the side which cause the ice cream to fell of the cone and leaving me with a mess that I threw out.  I would highly recommend to stay away from this burger king and go across the street to McDonald for better food."}
{"text":"Horribal service first went to ordered my food everything smooth then we noticed we where's missing chicken nuggets no big deal pulled around ppl make mistakes it's ok then leave get home check my sons kids meal after they asked me boy or girl I got a girl toy then my wife's BBQ chicken was missing her BBQ and it's had cheese smh and to top it off I order a double whopper with cheese I get a reglare whooper so at this point I had to drive back I get there no apology no let me do something to fix it just a ok let me get you the food i get my order and they still mess up forgot the cheese on the whooper and I get home to cold fries will not be going to this franchise and will be going to sky office and filing a complain."}
{"text":"This is one of the best locations in Vegas. The girl who took my order through the drive-thru was super professional. Yes, I do care about tone even through the drive-thru. 

The frozen coke machine was down which seems to be a common theme at most other locations as well. Onion rings were not over fried and bun was soft. Not the case at other places..hard burger buns, dry as heck fries and onion rings..

Fast food gets a bad rap. We all eat it unless your an extreme health-nut yet pretty much only pay attention to the employees or cooks when there is an issue or complaint! Well I am here to say that I appreciate the ghost hero's at this establishment! Star missing because I guess she didn't hear me say large not small on the drink. Large is not negotiable in the dead of summer! Can't be five stars because you can't give fast food five stars, can you?"}
{"text":"Which place is it a new updated restaurant. All the employees are very friendly take your food to the table check on you to make sure that everything is OK. They even know that I like mellow yellow zero peach!  Hey it's fast food but these guys do a great job."}
{"text":"$16.00.... ordered the whopper combo and the new crispy chicken sandwich.  BK should be ashamed to serve food like this.  Whopper add usual cold,  but the new highly touted crispy chicken.... burnt, way to salty,  greasy bun (don't know how they did that)  tossed out after eating almost half.  They were not busy.. no cars I  drive thru except me,  two parked cars, but I was so rushed at window, and like assays no\"thank you\" or anything.  Guess I'm done . You'd think someone cared,  especially with all the competition near there..."}
