{"text":"Overcharged me then didn't refund me because they were 'busy' food was awful and way under portioned. If you are in the area I highly recommend a street rat medium rare rather then Ill Gut I mean Grill Hut!!"}
{"text":"The food I thought was not bad, pretty pricey. And after I heard they had a mouse sighting... Don't think you should be eating and I know I won't be eating there anymore."}
{"text":"The food was cheap, did not get much shawarma , customer service was brutal!!!! Got over charged and the lady made no effort to give me change! Completely ignorant saying mistake happen and it's ok (it's ok?!!! For
Who, not me) she wanted nothing to do with me or my concerns with anything she simply walked away. For a business which will surely fail less then a year, more effort would be required to Any normal business owner!! Would never go back again!!!!!"}
{"text":"Usually I try to keep my Shawarma intake to post night out at the bar, but in this case I didn't have much of a choice. As it turned out, it wasn't that bad of a choice. 
The Grill Hut doesn't exactly match the stereotypical Shawarma restaurant littered with an array of tables, chairs and cheesy decor. This place is spotless, has contemporary furniture and the service courteous and fast. 
I had a Falafel and a Ginger Ale for $5.50. That's a pretty good deal. The fillings were fresh - cucumber, onions, beets, lettuce and tomato. Slop on some Hummus, hot sauce and tzaziki and we are good to go! The Grill Hut was a good surprise, and even though I have had my Shawarma fix for the time being, I will go back for sure!"}
{"text":"expensive.  the staff seemed slow to understand my order.  I bought some samosas and they tasted like week-old fried lumps of compacted skin flakes from a bum's asscrack.  The bottom of the barrel.  I would rather go to mcdonald's."}
