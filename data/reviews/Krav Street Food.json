{"text":"The food is amazing!  We love the pot roast, grilled pork chop, Cleveland cheese steak and rice with chow chow.  The portions are generous and the flavors outstanding.  We have not been able to eat at the restaurant yet but this has become our favorite take out place!  Nice addition to the Avon Lake restaurant scene."}
{"text":"The owner and staff were very personable and the food was quite good. I had the Philly cheesesteak sandwich with potato chips and my friend had a cheeseburger and fries and we were both impressed with the quality and size. I should also mention the side of coleslaw was very good, a little small but still tasty. I will return."}
{"text":"Tater tots and the great dipping sauces make this a must if you are in the Avon Lake area."}
{"text":"The food is good for a food truck, but it is good truck food in a sit-down restaurant. Not fancy or great but a good value."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for lunch about a month ago and just like their food truck it didn't disappoint! I got the Argentinian steak wrap. From first bite to last, it was a flavorful trip! Thanks for staying true to your food truck flavors I've had in the past! While it's a little off the beaten path you need to go and sample this hidden gem of gastro pleasantries!"}
{"text":"My first experience here yielded mixed results, and while I really wanted to love this place due to the amazingly friendly and helpful people behind the scenes, it was a mixed bag.  The Cleveland Cheese Steak was very good, and the meat was of a very high quality. There was just so, so much A-1 mayo on it that the sandwich was eventually overpowered by it.  The Korean Polish Boy was enormous and filled with fresh and tasty ingredients but was so over-the-top with sauces and spiciness (and everything!) that I was turned off midway through the meal and couldn't even look at it anymore.   The tater tots were delicious, as were the sauces that came with them.  And staff was as friendly and solicitous as could be.  I plan to give it at least one more try, as I love having something this fun and unique in Avon Lake."}
{"text":"Went here today for the first time.  It was absolutely awesome.  I had a gyro (although annoyed when people pronounce it wrong).  I was sad when I realized it was almost gone!  My wife, who is vegan, had the portabella mushroom burger and was so impressed!  Owners are super nice.  Waitress was very helpful and friendly.  Tater-tots HEAVEN.  I cannot wait to go back!  GO here! Go often, let's keep these people here in Avon Lake!"}
{"text":"Got the Korean pork loin pita... it was amazing!  Fries were great and the chipotle mayo dipping sauce was a really nice touch. Wife had the Cleveland cheesesteak and it was one of the best bites I've had. Portions are huge and prices are very reasonable so come hungry. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"One of the most satisfying meals I've had in awhile. I got the Pulled Pork with Asian slaw sandwich lunch special, accompanied side salad and mini salted caramel cupcake. Voila! It was amazing. The sandwich was perfect the prefect size, the salad was huge and the cupcake tasty. The brioche bun was grilled to perfection and the slaw was just spicy enough. The only thing that could be improved was the texture of the cupcake itself. They also deserve to be in a better trafficked location so all the people get a chance to sample this deliciousness."}
{"text":"My husband & I decided to give this place a try. We both got burgers. I believe mine was called a cowboy burger? Anyways, it was amazing! My husband loved his burger also. We definitely will go back!"}
{"text":"We loved their food! I ordered the Greek salad with chicken and he ordered their lamb gyro of course with tater tots. Their horseradish dipping sauce is to die for. I couldn't stop eating them. We also added 3 mini cupcakes for $3..they weren't great and cold. He likes them though! I think another company supplies them though. The rest of the food was homemade and outstanding. Definitely a good mix of choices. The staff was extremely friendly. We will definitely be back."}
