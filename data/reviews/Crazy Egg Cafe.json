{"text":"I had the biscuits and gravy and so called hash browns. The biscuits were flat and tasteless. Hash Browns were cold and not even crisp."}
{"text":"Met my extended family for breakfast at Crazy Egg and we had the best time in such a pleasant, clean and bright restaurant.  The food was so good and hot!!!  Our waitress waited on a table of 9 and she was very efficient and so pleasant and patient with a large group.  With 9 different orders, all food came out in a timely manner, hot, and so very good.  Kudos to the chef and all Crazy Egg staff for making our eating experience a great one.  We will be back for both breakfast and lunch........again thank you for a great Saturday morning!!!!"}
{"text":"Nothing fancy here. Just good food and great service in a clean comfortable place."}
{"text":"Very clean. Cash only but they have a ATM. Sat myself for breakfast. Ordered a blueberry pancake and bacon with decaf coffee. Got my food in 5 minutes. Cost me $6 bucks all together. Good deal :)"}
{"text":"Just visited the Cafe this morning for breakfast, and I'm actually somewhat upset I've never stopped in before now! It was fantastic, friendly, & fast service paired with delicious food (the kind you mostly only get from home or a kitchen that cooks it like home...)! Also, the prices are fantastic and well worth it for the portions!

I will definitely be returning, and I'd recommend everyone check this spot out!"}
{"text":"Service was a little slow, but it was busy. No credit cards was annoying, but they have an ATM. Food was good."}
{"text":"Great find. Prices are good,service is spot on, clean, kid friendly and breakfast was delicious."}
{"text":"A simple, uncomplicated place to be in the early morning. Nice people who will stop to talk and enjoy a joke. Great food prepared quick and right. I really enjoy this place and you will too."}
{"text":"Cash only breakfast place with reasonable prices and take-out available. Nothing amazing but its CHEAP BREAKFAST.

I've never eaten inside but have had take-out three times now I believe and its passable breakfast you don;t have to cook yourself."}
{"text":"I hope they are busy all the time like they were today. Fast service, really decent prices and hot food. The only thing missing was a good steak and egg breakfast. I didn't see it on the menu, but we enjoyed what we got. The eggs benedict was really good. Homefries extra crispy is the way to go! Definitely a go to place!! We will be telling others about this place!"}
{"text":"Great little breakfast spot. Quick and friendly people working. And who ever made my fruit cup went above and beyond (I'll post a pic)"}
{"text":"Cash only. But they do have an ATM.   Great service every time we have been there. Good food also every time"}
{"text":"Awesome - friendly staff, massive plates at low prices. Now my go-to for brunch in the area."}
{"text":"Very hearty food, nice wait staff. Clean and a pleasure even if a bit small. The omelets were fantastic."}
{"text":"Little cozy spot! Best breakfast in the area! The food was fresh and and taste like it was homemade! I will most definitely be back. Especially since I live close by to it"}
{"text":"Been here a half hour and no food.  I finished my first cup of coffee and had to walk up to get a refill.  The place is only half full.  The food was very good and reasonable though"}
{"text":"Little breakfast shop in a strip, very basic but cheap breakfast. The most expenisve item on the menu is a $7 omelette, most items are $4 to $6 range.  Service is friendly, there seems to be lots of regulars."}
{"text":"All cash only-- it's in a place that used to be called \"Ray's deli\" except they redid it and looks very nice.  It was kind of empty..but due to that it has been closed for so long that's understandable.

I had bacon club on wheat toast.  Can't possibly go wrong and it was perfect.  Does not come with sides but I had fries and wow they were great...very crispy almost battered.  

Buddy had chicken noodle soup and the sausage and onions.  Two thumbs up from him.

They do only accept cash but I understand why.  POS sales on debit cards can quickly eat into a slim profit margin.  Maybe give a discount for cash and charge a little more for debit?

Going back."}
{"text":"I've gone here on two Sunday's. It's wonderful. Inexpensive, clean, and delicious.  They service has been great!  They will turn any omelet into a wrap. The chorizo omelet makes an awesome wrap. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Check out the breakfast and lunch specials for $3.05 each. Mom and I had breakfast for $15.05- 2 egg omelette with onions and cheese, hashbrowns, toast and bacon and eggs Benedict with hashbrowns- plus 2 beverages- served by the owner. Restaurant was spotless and food was delicious. Open 7am-3pm daily."}
{"text":"The only reason I didn't give it a 5 of 5 is that the time it took from ordering the food to the time it took to reach the table was over 30 min BUT it was worth it. It's a small quaint place with a wonderful staff who is always there to fill your coffee. Didn't care for the old ATM at the entrance. Has to run card through twice so bring cash since it is cash only. I think the wife and I found a new breakfast spot. Also. Very clean. Simple and great staff.  Bathrooms extremely clean and can't remember when I had a coffee at a restaurant for $1.50."}
{"text":"Not bad but not good. Definitely hit the spot but the flavors we're lacking. I wish cash only meant awesome food. Usually that is the case but not here."}
{"text":"Very family friendly, well lit and clean.   Service was excellent. The food was great, portion size were large....and the coffee was good !!!   I will return again."}
{"text":"So first of all this place is cash only. It's a cute little spot but there isn't anything really special about it. It felt like I was walking into my school cafeteria. I went here because people were raving about the food but I didn't think it was anything out of the ordinary and it tasted like something I could have just made it at home. The prices are decent as well. Not sure if I would go back here."}
{"text":"Come for the down home service and no frills wait time.  It was exactly okay by any standard.  They are not reaching for the stars, but it is a good value.  I have an issue with high reviews in suburban areas, as they are often inflated.  We need to keep an eye on this.  I have a feeling this place is far from crazy, but more consistently mediocre."}
{"text":"New favorite cheap eats for breakfast
Had the Greek and crazy omelet with a side of corned beef hash .... great 
Service fast , food hot and tasty ,what more can you ask for? ? I found the place on Yelp and glad we stopped by. Their specials are till 11am and the price is right. ..we will be back"}
{"text":"This place is cash only. How is that even a viable business model? I am disappointed, I will not be returning."}
{"text":"nice little diner on a busy street. Staff was very nice and very responsive. the food was ok ... I wouldn't say it was top notch tho. the coffee was on the weak side and for a breakfast place I feel the coffee should be good. don't get me wrong it's a nice little place and the prices are very affordable but if your looking for fluffy pancakes and good coffee you might want to try somewhere else. I gave umm 3 stars for the service would of given 5 stars had the coffee not tasted watered down and the pancakes not fluffy and must add the place is small they need more space tables are arm to arm there. give it a try worth it for the price and staff."}
{"text":"The service was great as were the eggs, bacon and sausage. I don't recommend the pancakes as I felt they were McDonald's quality. Prices are good though."}
{"text":"Very clean and very inexpensive. Friendly staff. Creative with specials. Cash only by they have an ATM. Small bar/counter seating also if your going dutch. Good neighborhood spot."}
{"text":"Very fast service. Fast time from order to table. Wait staff seemed as though they cared. Price point was correct. The food was very tasty. Atmosphere was clean and new.  All in all come in and get a good breakfast."}
{"text":"Bustling around 10:30 a.m. on a Sunday, which made for a delay in our omelets. But the servers came around several times with coffee refills in the meantime.

A no-frills kind of place. The omelets were somewhat drier and less fluffy than I would prefer, but both the Greek special (spiniach, feta, gyros strips) and cheese and mushroom versions tasted good. Hash browns were a bit dry too; would have benefitted from frying in butter (or more butter) to give them crispier bits. 

Overall a decent breakfast, and evidently quite popular. Worth another visit."}
{"text":"Despite being cash only (what year is this?) and some of the other patrons smelling so disgustingly and strongly of smoke that I was wondering where they were hiding their lit butts, the waitress was incredibly kind and helpful and the food was exactly what I expected: breakfasty, tasty, and dirt cheap."}
