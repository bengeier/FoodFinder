{"text":"This place just opened in a that previously has housed a series of would be sports bars.  While this new incarnation still has a ginormous bar, and a lot of very nice Mexican beers on tap, it's clearly focusing primarily on it's extremely delicious, extremely fresh mexican food.  We went here for the first time this past weekend.  The place was very clean and spacious.  The service was very friendly.  Because it was new, there were some minor glitches.  The family that owns the place cooks everything made to order, and they don't quite have their groove in terms of timing. The family don't speak a lot of english and the bartender taking orders doesn't speak much spanish.  There was a lot of affection between the family in the kitchen and the bartender in the front, so I'm sure they'll work it out. I'm not sure they could handle a rush right now, but in a few more weeks, I'm sure they'll be cranking out the yummies!  In terms of FLAVOR, their food is outstanding.  We started out with freshly made guacamole, and freshly made chips.  I don't usually like fresh chips - because they taste so good and are always so laden with oil that I pay for it later.  These were properly drained after cooking, and were perfect to eat, and afterwards as well.  The guacamole incorporated green onions into the recipe and was really flavorful.  My husband ordered the fish tacos - made fresh with a green chile lime sauce.  I didn't get a taste - he didn't eat them as much as he devoured them while making lots of yum yum noises.    I ordered tamales.  They had a sign outside for tamales, but as of now, if you want to have a couple as a meal, it will take thirty to forty minutes.  That said, it was completely worth the weight.  I had the green corn and the red beef tamales and both were marvelous.  We ended up ordering a dozen to take home to eat later in the week.  The green corn tamales had bits of sweet corn in the masa, and the chile and cheese in the center was a nice combination of mild and creamy.  The shredded beef was flavorful and smoky.  Neither were really spicy (ok with me), but they were both really flavorful.    The black beans and spanish rice were equally outstanding.  Again, there was a really wonderful smoky chipotle taste to each.  I think I could easily have made a meal of just their rice and beans.  I didn't try their desserts, but i'm sure we'll be back many times."}
{"text":"I'm a regular on weekends for they're Menudo. Its the Bomb. And if you like tripas. man the burritos of tripas are just as good. Actually the Asada is also good. Ha... I guess you can say all they're food is really Good!!!! Y tambien los frijoles..."}
{"text":"We had a coupon so we decided to eat there today.  There was a young man on the phone in the tiny dining area, yelling and cursing with constant F-bombs at the person on the other end.  It was non-stop and it was loud and it was angry.  Therefore, we took our food out to the patio even though it was a bit too warm out there.  We could still hear him.  I asked my son why the staff didn't put a stop to it.  He feels that the man made them nervous.  I don't want to eat anywhere that the staff is afraid of their customers.  Good food or not, I won't be back."}
{"text":"It's hard to find a good Mexican place around that has great meats. This place grills all of their food so you won't get a greasy burrito (like filibertos). Got the chicken one which comes with just cilantro and onions. Carne asada comes with beans added. This means you're getting about 99% meat. Great customer service as well.   Ps. Add jarritos to your menu!!"}
{"text":"The carne is grilled out front every morning which causes a plume of beefy delicious smoke to rise into the air in front of the brightly painted building. Their beef is always grilled right with good crunch from the outdoor charcoal grill.  Where most local Mexican places go wrong with their carne asada burritos they do it so right. Carne, beans, cilantro, onion. Done. The only negative is they don't open until 0800 and there's always a line"}
{"text":"Delicious!  We really liked the horchata.  The grilled meats had an excellent flavor."}
{"text":"Staying at a near by hotel and just walked over to this restaurant. Noticed, on going in door, a sign for the Tuesday Especial: 99 cent fish tacos. Sounded good to me. Ordered three. Arrived quickly. Each taco consisted of two (smallish) warm, soft tortillas generously filled with fried fish, lettuce, tomatoes, onion and some type of sauce. Had some spice (heat) to it too. Can't go wrong for $3.21 with tax. Place seemed clean to me, floor tiles looked new. Staff polite. Good food cheap price. I'd return."}
{"text":"The place doesn't look like much, but their food is great. They just painted it bright orange and green, so it actually stands out now like it should rather than just being an overlooked secret."}
{"text":"Terrible food! My stomach hurt all day afterwards and I could not get rid of the horrible taste. The rice was dry and tasted days old. The beans were flavorless. The enchiladas contained no recognizable meats and had a bad flavor. Just awful overall. And I was very upset by the lack of hygiene, with meats left uncovered and exposed to the files, which were everywhere."}
{"text":"Awesome tacos! Pastor, carne, and barbacoa are super delicous. Can't wait to try more of the menu."}
{"text":"We go all the time and get the family 1 lb meal of carne asada and it is bomb. Our kids - toddler age up to 10 years old - all inhale the little tacos (they just skip the spicy stuff. It comes with salsa, grilled jalapeños, tortillas, chopped cabbage, and chopped onion/cilantro. The whole family loves it. My husband and I sometimes get it and hide it from the kids.   I've also had their fish tacos, bean/cheese burritos, and some amazing asada quesadillas. I've only had positive experiences. People there are friendly, and the line is usually fast."}
{"text":"The best carne Asada burritos fast food style. Never had better Carne Asada Fresh grilled over charcoal. Beans are also very bomb diggity. Way better than filibertos/los favoritos etc."}
{"text":"This place is a staple in our home  they have the freshest cooked meats, best beans, and all their chili sauces - hot sauce, etc.... is fresh and unique. They service is pleasant and the atmosphere is that of a cares for mom and pop restaurant."}
{"text":"Went with some local friends.  Essentially a bar with a few tables in a very spacious room.  The menu is simple, well prepared and very fresh Mexican.  unpretentious.  Owner's daughter is especially pleasant and aims to please.    I had combination plate which choice of three items.  everything is very light and well prepared.  Great reasonably priced beers.    would definitely go again if in the area.   Note closed on tuesdays..."}
{"text":"My brother and I have been coming here since it opened pretty much! And it's our favorite! The carna asada is so moist and amazing! I think everyone needs to try this place!"}
{"text":"I went to this place last week.  It is new, so the staff is still literally getting up to speed, but it was exactly what I was looking for.  Around Phoenix you have the choice of Sonoran style Mexican food or grigofied Mexican food.  If you don't want mounds of cheese or Granadilla seeds in your Guacamole you are out of luck.  El Asadero is literally home cooked Mexican food. Look in the kitchen and there is mama (the boss).  Everything I had was simple, fresh and full of flavor.    I am looking forward to going back and tasting the spicy taste of home."}
{"text":"Ordered at a very dark drive thru with no lights on at all. Even at window the lights were not on at 8:30pm. Purchased a pastor burrito which had an off and almost sour taste to it. The meat appeared to have been boiled due to gray color and was tough and chewy. The burrito itself was a good size though and heavy."}
{"text":"It used to be good. They started using some kind of imitation white cheese that doesn't melt and tastes terrible. Check your order before leaving the drive thru. Good chance it's incorrect."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best street tacos and burritos on the east side of the valley. The Carne and Chicken is marinated and grilled over coals."}
{"text":"This place is delicious food. I am not a big critic of Mexican food but I found the food delicious and well portioned. Staff was nice and all was well. We went a little bit before the lunch rush on a Sunday and it was quiet and relaxing. As we were leaving it was filling up, so maybe go early or late. Chill little place with a old school feel and flavor... Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Lengua Tacos are excellent! The beans, rice and beef enchiladas were delicious. Friendly service, Oh!! Please try the Flan, you won't regret it. I just found my new  favorite Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"If you want bomb Mexican food come here!  I usually get a carne asada torta, bean burrito or carne asada fries while the husband likes to order their carne asada burrito.   We've also ordered carne asada, rice and beans for a birthday party.  It worked out well and the food was a hit.    I definitely recommend giving this place a try."}
{"text":"otro restaurant que nomas empiesa a vender y deja de vender comida buena me comi un burro de lengua y estaba malisimo pri eri se equibocaron en mi burro despoes les pedi otro y no me lo querian cambiar despoes que aseptaton darmelo me lo dieron con la tortilla helada y ni disculpas piden  arriba mexico!!!"}
{"text":"Everytime I come here I get the carne asada burrito and it is my favorite!! They have the best meat and the guy cooks the meat outside and it smells so good! Every time I'm up here I have to come stop by!"}
{"text":"Horrid! The lady at the counter was wonderful, but the food made us sick. I went to their restroom, located inside the storeroom, and saw something that would make a health inspector's hair stand on end. The room was dirty, yes, but that was not the scary part. Standing in the middle of the hot, fly-filled room was a rack stacked with pans filled with food, presumably ready for replacing empty pans out front. It had an assortment of raw meat, rice, beans, etc., none of which was covered or refrigerated. The buzzing flies crawling all over it was the finishing touch for me. Unfortunately we had already finished eating so now we are all dealing with the consequences of eating spoiled food. Yuck!"}
{"text":"This food is absolutely amazing!  Just ordered a bunch of food for work from here and it was the best Mexican food I've had in Arizona.  Chimichangas are amazing, the street tacos are amazing, and even the rice and beans are just the BOMB!"}
{"text":"Yum yum yum! The beans in the bean and cheese is good! Lost a star because a few times ago that I went here I ordered a carne asada quesadilla and there was barely any cheese it was more like meat and tortilla. Cheap Mexican food that tastes yummy!"}
{"text":"Food is awesome, however we watched a women behind the counter say \"don't tell him the price just charge him\" \"he won't know the difference\". She is currently calling patrons that have left \"jerks\"! I don't care how good the food is, we will not be back. Went from gold to trashy! If this is your manager as she acts like she is, expect to lose money, expect money to be missing from the drawer,(prob her), and expect long time customers to not return again. I encourage the owner to get in touch with me so I can explain in more detail this experience."}
{"text":"best beans in Arizona, try a bean and cheese burrito; the melted cheese is heaven in your mouth and the salsa is perfect with any dish."}
{"text":"I love it here. Been coming for months and I've never had a bad experience. Their carne asada is top notch and no matter what you get it won't disappoint. If you're looking a top notch sanitary experience coupled with unauthentic Mexican food, stay away nobody wants you here anyways. Cantina Loredo has a spot reserved for you. Just look at the place, you know what you're getting yourself into.. Don't let that deceive you from the gem that's inside!"}
{"text":"I am unsure of some of the reviews on here. I mean, the place is clean, the staff is friendly and the food is good. Ordered 4 tacos for my love and I. Al Pastor, Carne Asada and 2 Pollo Asado. All were really good. The asada was slightly dry and the salsas were super hot but the food was ...quality and really, really good. Quality and goodness that I would return for. The chips that I ordered alongside the tacos were made to order and absolutely excellent. The flavor from the mesquite grilled meats was great. Chicken was my favorite. The staff was seriously so nice and explained everything to me and my bill for chips, salsa and four tacos was only ten bucks...great deal and food, thanks :)"}
{"text":"Eww....how is this place still in business?!? Carne Asada...burnt, dry and no flavor. Filiberto's taste better and cheaper!! Don't waste your time or money."}
{"text":"what can I say? this place has delicious food. I ordered a carne asada burrito and a fish taco. I sat outside next to the grill which made my experience even better. before I started my review I had already wolfed down my fish taco so I didn't get a picture of it lol. the burrito was just as good tho!  they do charge extra for debit or credit cards tho but that's the only negative I could find about this place"}
{"text":"This place has great California burritos or is it Arizona burritos? I can't remember. It's what other taco shops wish they could be. I think it's because they actually cook the meat over charcoal?"}
{"text":"The green sauce !  and the carne asada meat is delish. Typical prices, but very authentic!"}
{"text":"The restaurant was dirty, the floors were dirty outside was very dirty and uncapped. We ordered street tacos and they were fair. The cooking step behind the counter seem to be hustling and working very diligently.  The taco meat seemed a bit dry.   Someone really needs to help this place with cleanliness."}
{"text":"Went with a friend who raved about the nachos. I saw the taco shells being made fresh and so I decided on the 3 chicken taco meal. The pico was filled with jalapeños and fresh tomatoes.   The nachos were piled with well seasoned black angus steak: carne asada. The chips crispy.   The \"b4\" breakfast burrito has chorizo, eggs and potato. It was delicious and came with an horchata."}
{"text":"Amazing carne asada! What flavor! The smoke flavor & spices are wonderful. I ate mine with a fork-no need for a tortilla. Small establishment offering outdoor seating.  Drive thru also. Grilling starts early in the morning  out In front of business. we were staying at a hotel down the street and could smell it all day! This place is a diamond in the rough!"}
