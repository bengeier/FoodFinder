{"text":"All of the great reviews are true!  I was in town and business and love checking out local places. I got the white pizza with gyro meat. Oh my gosh!!! So good. If you get the breadsticks, get the mozzarella on it. Amazing!  The only note is you can't eat in. Take out or delivery only."}
{"text":"Great place, great pizza! First time we were there, we ordered a  large pizza, dine in. We waited...and waited...customers came...customers went...no pizza for us yet, so my husband went up to the counter and asked if ours was ready.  The guy apologized without hesitation and told us  they apparently  overlooked our order and he would make us one immediately.  He reimbursed us for the mistake (we were not angry or demanding  a refund--he just handed over our money--with more apologies!)  THE PIZZA WAS WELL WORTH THE WAIT!!!  DELICIOUS!!! Perfectly baked and seasoned, with just the right amount of  \"grease\" to make it yummy and, most importantly,  AWESOME CUSTOMER SERVICE!!! What a nice bunch of people!!!  A place like this DESERVES your business--they are awesome!!! Keep up the great work! Can't wait to come back for another pizza...and a hoagie, or two!  PS--this place is IMMACULATE--used the restrooms and they were also spotless.  Such a nice place!"}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of this pizza but my son enjoys it but the subs are very good. The fries are clearly frozen rather than fresh cut.   Cannot get the online rewards point system to work."}
{"text":"Nice menu and good online ordering system.  I may have caught it at a bad time, but I couldn't get it to work on Firefox, Chrome, or even IE.  Ordered from my phone browser.  Food arrived quickly and was hot and fresh.  I got a Greek pizza, cheesy bread stix, and a tiramasu.  The food is AMAZING!  Well prepared, hot, and delicious.  I really wish I lived near here so I could order more!  Definitely recommend to anyone that likes Italian."}
{"text":"Plain and simple, unassuming store front with no seating. Since moving to PA (Moon Twp), I've sampled their meatball grinder (err I mean hoagie) and tonight their pizza. Out-freaking-standing. The guys behind the counter were super friendly, and the food stood up to the test. Great bite to the pepperoni, perfect balance of cheese and a great sauce, and most importantly, a delicious crust that even my kids would eat! Will give other pizza joints in Moon/Cory a test, but given the crap we've had so far (other than Giani's in Cory), this pie is going to be tough to beat. Well done guys! Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Best pizza in imperial hands down! The pineapple and cheese is amazing."}
{"text":"Really good pizza and sandwiches at reasonable prices. Been using them for years. The big item is my family has two children that need to eat gluten free. They offer the best gluten free pizza we have found. Fast and friendly delivery. They also offer a Reward point system when you order online. They just delivered for a party last weekend and it was great once again."}
{"text":"Great spot to hit up for lunch or dinner.  They have really good prices on all their food, even great lunch deals.  I recommend their pizza or hoagies.  Best pizza around North Fayette."}
{"text":"Very great place! found it when I searched \"best subs in Pittsburgh.\" bathrooms were really clean and the seating area was clean and spacious. Food was terrific and they were voted by many customers that they were one of the best pizza places in Pittsburgh! :)"}
{"text":"Best pizza around.  Hoesntly, we tried every pizza place in the Robinson, Imperial, West A area. Nothing beats Angelia's. We will only order Angelia's from now on.  A XL Pizza is reasonably prices. (about 18$). You won't regret it.  Sign up for the perks also, you get points as you order for free pizza."}
{"text":"The pizza here isn't horrible so much as it is  disappointing. The sauce is bland, the crust thick and doughy. The service and restaurant are fine, but if you're looking for a good traditional pizza, this isn't the place."}
{"text":"I ordered take out yesterday on the way home from work. I ordered a buffalo chicken pizza and a margherita pizza both medium. The total was 32 dollars. A little expensive I thought, but I figured with those prices it would be good. WRONG. Buffalo chicken pizza was ok. But there was nothing \"buffalo\" about it. It was just a couple pieces of chicken with cheese and bread. No sauce. The margherita pizza was just bad. It looked nothing like a margherita pizza. It was completely covered in cheese, no basil and guess what. No sauce. Idk if someone dropped the ball that day or not but..that's not worth 32 dollars for sure. The only reason I give them one star is because I have to. They did have the pizzas hot and ready for me on time to pick up so I guess there's that. I can't go back and pay for that if they can't even put sauce on my pizzas. Try at your own risk!"}
{"text":"Grew up eating this and it's still my favorite pizza in the airport area! I know that they have an extensive menu, but I just about always get the pizza.  Both the red sauce and white sauce are tasty; never had a pie from there I didn't like!"}
{"text":"Normally I don't waste my time writing negative reviews, but when a decent place starts to decline it's worthy of taking note. This was at one time a better than average small town pizza shop with reasonable prices and decent quality. Over the past several months, the quality of the products and service has seen a considerable drop. Orders are frequently wrong, cook times are becoming unreasonable, and food quality and portion size are decreasing. Even in a small town there are other options, and it's sad to see a business that no longer cares about it's customers."}
{"text":"A group of us placed a delivery order of 3 pizzas, 6 fresh chicken wings, a gyro, and a cheeseburger. What we got was the pizzas and the wings with no condiments. The pizzas were ok. The wings were very dry and hard. The delivery person came back with the two sandwiches which were cold!! The cheeseburger only had 10fries which we were told is a half order. But still no condiments. To top it off we got charged a $1 service charge for delivery when flyer states it's free and we tipped the driver $7. Speaking with the manager he offered us a %25 discount on our next order of we decide to go back!!"}
{"text":"Conveyor oven is not the way to make a real pizza! Can't even eat it! Soggy and not cooked!"}
{"text":"I don't know what happened to them.  They were always my favorite pizza couldn't say enough about them however something has changed.  The pizza's don't have the same greatness that they once did.  The crust still has good flavor but the rest something has changed, cheese? sauce? but something. When we would have pizza for family or guest there never was any left.  Now there is and goes to the frig and eventually gets thrown out. Driving by it never looks as busy as it used to so maybe it's not just us..."}
{"text":"I order from this place at least once a week.. Their pizza is amazing. My favorite is the white pizza. The delivery app is convenient and easy to use. I've never had anything from Angelia's that I was disappointed in and I've tried a lot on the menu."}
{"text":"I love their gyros delicious and their pizza is amazing!! The service is quick and accurate! I highly recommend eating here"}
{"text":"This place looks seriously dicey, especially from the outside. I ate here only because it was the closest thing open at eleven at night, but I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food. I got the vegetarian hoagie, and it was awesome. Spicy, cheesy, greasy, it was everything I wanted in a hoagie. I finished the night with wicked heartburn but it was totally worth it."}
{"text":"I feel like my experience here was quite the opposite of other reviewers.   I ordered a large pizza with chicken, mushrooms, peppers and onions. The delivery was speedy, but the pizza was a mushy mess. Half of the pizza was burnt black. There was way too much tomato sauce so the whole pizza turned out super soggy, despite of the burnt crust. The sauce tasted like spaghetti sauce. They were so skimpy on the chicken. One word: sloppy!   Overall, it was a horrific eating experience. One star for the fast delivery and another for putting the right toppings, but that is all. Will not return here again."}
{"text":"Interesting.  All my reviews for this location went poof.  **ponders**  Anyways...this place is pretty darn good.  We've had their regular pizza, white pizza, calzones, fries, mozzarella sticks, bread-sticks, cheesy bread-sticks, steak hoagie, steak & egg hoagie, and their chicken strip basket.  For each of the above items the food was excellent and on-point.  It is way above the chain-based pizza places in Pittsburgh, and dare I say their hoagies (which are award winning) are some of the best even when you compare to sit down restaurants.  In the pizza department I think their tomato sauce could benefit from some extra seasoning for increase the savory factor, but it still does its job.  I highly recommend their Cajun chicken as a topping for the white pizza and bacon for a regular pizza topping.  I would make this a 5-star review, but there's always room for improvement.  We order at least once a week, and every other time I've gotten regular pop instead of diet when I ordered a Diet 2L as part of my delivery order.  Now I know the drivers are charged with putting together their orders and routes once the food is made, at least that's the case in most places I've seen, so I never hold it against them entirely and still tip nicely.  So...if they can go 4 orders (a month probably) without messing up my 2 Liter selection ... then BAM!  they get the fifth star ... ceteris paribus of course."}
{"text":"I didn't actually eat here, I got my food delivered but I thought I should write a review because it was so great. I ordered a bacon and pepperoni pizza and an order of breadsticks off their online ordering system. I put in the comments my hotel room number and told them if it were a problem to come up I could go down to the lobby. I was expecting 45 minutes but in less than half an hour I had a knock on my door. Yay!  I wanted a beer so I ended up leaving the pizza in the room and didn't get back for another 30 minutes because of a weird beer finding adventure (what's up with no beer being sold in gas stations?!!) Anyway, even after half an hour the pizza was amazing and so were the breadsticks!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I order the strawberry cheesecake bites all the time and they are amazing! They are like egg rolls with cheesecake and strawberries in it with icing for the top! So delicious!"}
{"text":"Favorite pizza place. They have a great app to order from for those who dislike calling and placing takeout or delivery. The hoagies are great."}
{"text":"Their antipasto salad is delicious as well as their hoagies & wedgies! Delivery is fast. Food is hot and fresh. Delivery driver's are always friendly!!"}
{"text":"LOVE Angelia's!  I first tried it when a friend of mine that lives in Moon ordered it for a movie night we were having... it was so good!  Now I order from here pretty regularly for our office.  They are always very accommodating for our large orders.  Seriously, I ordered 24 pizzas once and they didn't skip a beat, and delivered our order right on time.  Everything was still fresh and hot when it arrived, which I thought was impressive considering the sheer volume of the order.    The crust is always perfectly done, just crunchy enough on the bottom but still soft and delicious throughout.  Their sauce is a tad on the sweeter side, which isn't usually my favorite, but theirs is done right.  I am a big fan of the regular cheese or pepperoni pie, but we've also ordered a veggie pie from here that was outstanding.  Great combination of veggies... olives, mushrooms, green peppers, onions, and -my personal fave- banana peppers!    I'd definitely recommend Angelia's if you're in the area and looking for a great pie and great service."}
{"text":"Service sells... end of story...  Being new to the area, I am constantly out and about, exploring new eateries. On this night, I decided to roll the proverbial dice and pick my pizza from the short list of places that are available on Eat24!  We selected a medium deluxe, which turned out to be crispy and delicious, albeit something you could get from a DiGiorno Pizza box (had to get that out there to explain why I chose 4 stars instead of 5). The same can be said for the cheesy breadsticks and sauce. The price however, was very competitive for other local pizza joints!  In addition to the pizza and breadsticks, we ordered two cannolis. I decided to drive to the location for pick up, considering my address is not recognized by the app (shame on you Eat24). I was surprised to find that the pizza shop was more like a sitdown restaurant, and I noticed a few awards for hoagies (which I intend to try soon)!  Now, while I wasn't wowed by the quality of the food, the services and convenience stepped up to the plate and knocked a 4th star onto this review! I was greeted in a polite and timely manner. My food was ready in the time frame that was promised. Needless to say, I left the restaurant a happy man.  When I got home, I realized I had left something behind... holy cannoli... I didn't get the desert! After discussing it with my better half, I decided that it was too cold and I was too lazy to go all the way back for a three dollar desert (besides, who needs the calories). Just then, the phone rang... it was a call from the service team, who realized two cannolis were without a home. Long story short, they went out of their way to make sure those cannolis found their way!  So, it almost breaks my heart to say that the quality of the pizza was about that of a chain restaurant, but I cannot wait to adventure back to try the hoagies and I know I will find spectacular service along the way!"}
{"text":"I love Angelia's they got great pizza and hoagies. I actually love ordering the Sicilian style pizzas. The ingredients taste good and next time I order I will get the chicken bacon ranch Sicilian style which I know will taste amazing. They deliver straight to the door and they are pretty quick which is always appreciated. I've been there 4-5 times and it's very consistent."}
{"text":"I was stuck at a hotel so I ordered from here. I figured you couldn't go wrong with fried food from a pizza place.  I got Provolone Sticks, Shrimp Basket w/fries and chocolate cake.  I was disappointed in the Provolone Sticks. The breading was good, but the cheese does dot make good cheese sticks. the cheese was more mushy than stringy and it was oily when bitten into. The Shrimp Basket was a typical one, but the fries tasted very greasy.   The chocolate cake slice was frozen. I didn't like how it tasted after it was thawed. Why was it frozen?"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches, if your hungry, The Pig is worth a try. The Taco Pizza is excellent."}
{"text":"Nope. Just don't. Ordered well ahead online and paid in advance. The guys working were dismissive in telling me it will be 10 more minutes, when I got there on time. Okay. I then got pizza and should have checked it because it was wrong. I ordered white and got red sauce. Come on, this isn't brain surgery. Anyway, didn't notice until I got back to work and just ate it. Not mind-blowing. Not totally horrible. Just not what I wanted. Will never go back. So many other pizza joints in the area, try them instead."}
{"text":"We decided to stop in and grab to go food the other night.  At first,  I wasn't impressed when the kid taking our order couldn't answer my simple question (nor could the kid cooking) as to if it was breaded or grilled chicken on the Buffalo chicken roll....... So instead,  I opted for a taco roll & boneless wings.  My hubby ordered hot cheese balls & the pig. We waited about 15 minutes for our food (pretty quick I thought!) And I checked our order before we left.  Instead of The Pig,  the kid who punched in our order put in a fish sandwich. Glad we checked!  The (I'm assuming) owner & manager fixed the problem immediately. They were really friendly and apologetic about the kid's mess up.  We knew it wasn't their fault & were very understanding. Got our food home.... And it was so good!  Definitely a lot of food for a very reasonable price.  I don't know that I would get the taco roll again because it was so spicy,  but I would certainly try something else on the menu!! Very reasonable prices... Friendly management.... Food was good."}
{"text":"fairly good pizza around.  Sometimes it turns out a bit burned, but otherwise,  our go-to around Oakdale"}
{"text":"I was at the La Quinta (great hotel) with a friend this weekend and we weren't expecting much from the local pizzerias. We yelped this place and it looked like the best--but not really enough reviews to tell. So here I am, adding another one, in the hopes that this place gets more business.   We were impressed. We got the white pizza with pepperoni, sausage, and bacon. It was pretty damn good. The cheese was real, a little stringy/chewy--just right. The crust wasn't too thick or thin, and was well done: crisp but kinda' flaky-buttery. The meat wasn't too greasy and didn't give me heartburn. ;-)  One problem: Adding toppings ain't cheap. But for the quality of pizza, we felt it was worth it.  We'd definitely order from here again if we were ever to go back to the Pittsburgh area. I have had better pizza, but only in artisanal restaurants with woodfired ovens. For a simply delivery place, this was top-notch. Order here over a chain any day..."}
{"text":"I stopped here on a whim two weeks ago before a work meeting because I had time to kill and I'm so glad I did.  I tried a slice of their Sicilian cheese pizza and it was fantastic!! It actually spoiled me because yesterday I tried a slice of Sicilian cheese pizza at another place and it was bland compared to what I had at Angelia's.  For pizza, I definitely recommend Angelia's Sicilian."}
{"text":"Pizza was excellent! The crust was buttery, cheese and pepperoni were awesome. I also ordered hot wings which were just OK."}
{"text":"the pizza is good. the subs are amazing.  do yourself a favor and order the Crafton Special. thank me later."}
{"text":"I'm not customarily a specialty pizza kind of person but their Buffalo Chicken pizza is out of this world! My DH says the gyros are fantastic."}
{"text":"Finally found a good lunch spot!  So far I've only had the chicken parm hoagie, but I must say I'm impressed.    Just seeing what everyone orders and says I've yet to hear anything bad about this place.  You should see the salads, they're huge!  I think I'm going to try the pizza next.  Oh, and there's an adjoining frozen yogurt place now.   Does it get any better?"}
{"text":"As is our Friday tradition, some of at the office order lunch and someone pulled out a menu for Angelia's. On this day I decided to get one of the various lunch specials that are offered and ordered an Italian hoagie.   For $7 I got a 12 inch hoagie, a bottle of soda, and an mildly upset stomach. The sandwich was loaded with meat and the toasted bread with barely any of the melted cheese was pretty good. The veggies were a wilted mess though and the bread was on the soggy side by the time I could take a bite of my meal. I used a fork and knife to tackle the unruly hoagie and dipped it in the Italian dressing. I knew I should have ordered my usual, a gyro big enough to keep me full till after quitting time.   On a positive note, the pizza isn't bad. Very greasy but it's a satisfying and there is a nice variety of items on the menu and prices are reasonable. Also, they deliver very quickly."}
{"text":"Wasn't the worst pizza, maybe the second worst. Ok, if you're from Western Pittsburgh area you may love this pizza but it reminds me of the cheap pizza served in middle school. Sort of like a sponge texture for the crust, which some people in this part of town think is amazing. Very greasy, too. If you're from the east coast or believe the dough is just important as the toppings, I'd skip this place. 4 cheese sticks weren't enough for the price and were ok. Fried mushroom were the best part of the meal. My wife and I ended up throwing the pizza out after a couple of bites."}
{"text":"Dave!!!!!! You are an awesome manager! You brought my kid nephew a drink when I forgot to order it. Thank you. He is a starving college kid. You Rock! I appreciate you doing this for me! I'll call and order pizza just from you guys for him. You are a rock star in the hospitality industry!"}
{"text":"Ordered a meat lovers pizza and it was really good.  Actually one of the best I had  . There menu is huge and everything looks good.  Had to call twice to place an order,  which was little annoying an shad to hold the call for 1-2 min.  But I would say it was worth it."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza place in the Imperial/Robinson area, we get it at least once a week! Great coupon for carry out for a large cheese pizza."}
{"text":"I'm from out of town stuck in hotel so I needed something delivered and after reading other yelp reviews I chose this place Good for me because the pizza I ordered and the cheesy bread sticks are delicious They were slow getting here but the guy called to confirm my location and the food was still warm when he arrived"}
{"text":"Lots of hero worship reviews here. Delivery took over an hour and I'm right down the street. I was not impressed. $8.97  + 1.00 for delivery + tip and I never shoot the messenger, so all in for about $3.00 a slice for four slices of Sicilian pizza with extra cheese and mushroom? I made 'za in high school and this was bush league. Delivered cold, and I mean stone cold, the mushrooms were probably canned, rubbery and way too salty. Not a good experience. I won't be ordering again. The delivery guy was pleasant. Food, not so much. I warned you."}
{"text":"Just ordered takeout from here. I got the Crafton special sub, and a white spinach pizza with pepperoni for a total of $24. I was really excited to order food here after reading about the Crafton special, I love trying one of a kind dishes you can't get anywhere else. I was also excited by the near perfect rating. I have to say, and maybe it was the build up of anticipation, I was not overly impressed. The food was not bad, but I when I go somewhere with those kind of ratings, I prepare to be impressed.   The first thing I dove into was the pizza. It was pretty greasy and wet (could've been since there were tomatoes and pepperoni). But it did have a nice buttery garlic taste, and fresh veggies.   Second, the Crafton sub. It was a big sub, with lots of meat. It was also very wet, this time with Italian dressing. It wasn't terrible, there was just no wow factor when it comes to the flavor.   Other than that, it was awesome it only took 20 minutes to make the food. For a quick pizza shop, it wasn't bad. I'm on the fence on whether I'd try it again; I'd probably instead choose to explore a new place."}
{"text":"Simply awesome, can't go wrong.  Custom pizza Bread sticks Jalapeño poppers Chocolate cake"}
{"text":"After noshing on sandwiches for three days in a row I really needed something else to eat.  Order up a large pizza with pepperoni, bacon, onions, jalapeno, and tomato.  Delivery was faster than estimated, and the it was to die for.  The crust was absolutely perfect, just the right amount to crisp on the outside without being overdone, but still soft and moist on the inside.  The pizza was loaded with toppings, and we made short work of it.  Definitely the best pizza in Moon."}
{"text":"Back in Pittsburgh and for lunch yesterday ordered the Chicken Philly and again they served perfection. I think they will be my go to when we move here in 2 weeks."}
{"text":"Favorite pizza place in Pittsburgh thus far.   I've had the supreme meat pizza and the vegetarian pizza and both changed pizza as I know it. The sauce is a good, rich tomato sauce that's not sweet like other cheap-tasting sauces. The cheese they use is a flavorful provolone mozzarella that's soft and not plasticky like cheap cheeses. I'm a dough snob, and that was the aspect that impressed me the most. It's a thick, dense dough that isn't dried out and adequately holds the ten tons of toppings piled on the pizza.   It's expensive, but definitely worth the price for the quality of ingredients."}
{"text":"Don't know about the food as I walked in and was promptly ignored as a driver was trying to get paid for a cash delivery, the manager was saying \"I will pay you tomorrow\" and the others \"working\" there were milling around while the guy taking the phone orders was be challenged by each item and re confirming everything as he went. After about 10 minuets of being ignored, I left....really it isn't that hard."}
{"text":"Lolita and rob sound like little bitches been ordering from Angelina's for years never had a problem. Misery loves company"}
{"text":"We order from this location all of the time.  Their pizza is great as well as their hoagies and pepperoni rolls.  I've noticed they deliver milkshakes now, yet haven't tried them but several neighbor's have and said they haven't been disappointed.  I mean where else can you have pizza and milkshakes delivered!"}
{"text":"Amazing food best in the city. And the service was great. My food hit the table in 10 minites flat......"}
{"text":"Angelia`s Pizza is a very solid go-to pie at a pretty reasonable price. Try some of the specialty pizzas you cannot go wrong! It would be nice to have a dining room to sit down and eat after the Moon games and practices!  We will continue to enjoy your pizza!"}
{"text":"Angelia's is a must-have when I'm back in PA visiting my family! Their pizza is the perfect balance of sauce, cheesey goodness, and toppings. I appreciate the generous amount of cheese and toppings also! SO delicious."}
{"text":"Updating my previous review and adding on another star. Ordered from Eat24 and the food was ready in about 20 minutes. Decided to pick up this time and check the restaurant out. They have a nice seating area and an ice cream place, I believe it's called Chill, that's attached next door! The ladies running the front were also super friendly and helpful.  Ordered the hot chicken wings and Italian wedge this time around and both were super favorful. I enjoyed those much more than the pizza I ordered before. We also decided to get some butter pecan ice cream from the place that is attached to Angelia's as well. It's perfect. It's homemade. It's ice cream, not frozen custard. It's delicious."}
{"text":"Hidden gem. I ordered online and tried a calzone with meatballs, it was huge and excellent. It is a take out or delivery place no dine in. My only negative is that I ordered extra sauce and it was refrigerator cold."}
{"text":"Really great pizza, affordable pricing and love that they deliver! We've ordered in twice and they're definitely our new pizza place!"}
{"text":"Had pizza from here twice. So far so good. I prefer the Sicilian pizza. It almost taste homemade. Still haven't found anyone with wings to brag on yet though... I'd eat there pizza again for sure."}
