{"text":"Unfortunately, we've had several bad experiences with the wait staff. And, it doesn't matter whether they are busy or slow. It either takes forever for your waitress to take your order or the kitchen to fill it!  The wait staff sits in the back corner of the restaurant to chit chat rather than service customers. If you have time to kill, this is your place; if not, choose another restaurant."}
{"text":"I always pass this place and I wanted to give it a try. I will never go back. Order a stuffed pretzel to start it was a pretzel cut in half with cheeses in the middle weird right not what I think when I think stuffed pretzel but not bad. My boyfriend ordered ranch wings with fries and I got chicken strips with potato pancakes, Then we waited a loooonnng time.  When the food came they gave me fries instead of the potato pancakes I ordered and the chicken strips were aweful all I could taste was burnt grease. At this point I was so disappointed I didn't even want to complain just get out of there.  Also my boyfriend and I are an interracial couple and were being stared at meanly by many tables which added to an even more upsetting night. I've read other reviews and seen they have a good fish sandwich that would not be enough to get me back in these doors."}
{"text":"Great German restaurant with a good lunch/dinner menu. I recommend any of the sandwiches, especially the fish sandwich (which is sort of their claim to fame). On fridays they have mac and cheese, which makes for the perfect combination. The pretzel sticks and stuffed pretzels are good too!"}
{"text":"Oh my god I LOVE this place. Been coming here since I was a little kid. The food is outstanding. It tastes like home cooking. We like going here on Fridays and Saturdays because it's not loud and crazy usually. The only thing I could really complain about was having a DJ there on Saturday night playing rap from the 90s that no one really wants to hear. Other than that, we always have a great time here."}
{"text":"It's the best fish sandwich in Pittsburgh!  During lent you can't get a seat, so get take out. It's quick, organized and they wrap the bun in foil, so it doesn't get soggy.  Huge portion size, you could make two fish sandwiches if you wanted. I always eat half the next day, it is so big. I also love the potato pancakes jus like my Dad used to make and they offer sour cream to go with them. Sometimes they run out of the potato pancakes if you don't get there before 6. Very disappointing. All the staff is friendly and the menu is very economical. So, I couldn't wait till lent again to get a fish sandwich and potato pancakes. My husband and I got a seat in the bar area immediately tonight, watched the Pirate game and still delish:)"}
{"text":"A great place for lunch in the area. It's typical pub food but very good pub food at a fair price. A+ in our books. As a bonus it's a Poke Stop so bring your kids in to fill up their Pokemon."}
{"text":"I don't understand why this place is always crowded. Food was cold and tasted like it came from right from the freezer and was nuked for a minute or two. Service was fine, but the food was not with the prices. You can eat better food from the frozen dinner section of the grocery store with less effort than it takes to go here."}
{"text":"So we sat down and had to wait 15 minutes for our server to come over and ask about drinks. Then it took another 15 minutes for the two waters to come. Then we ordered the provolone sticks, which were pretty good, but a little greasy. The problem was that we didn't have any utensils or napkins to wipe our hands off with. We asked our waitress for some and we still did not get any. Then, she gave us bread and butter, with no knife to cut the bread with. About 15 minutes after we got the bread, she came over with a side salad, which again, we asked for utensils. She finally came over with utensils, but one of the forks was dirty with leftover food stuck in it.  Our food came at 7:20, which was an hour after we ordered. I got a chicken caesar salad. There was way too much dressing on it, to the point of making the lettuce soggy and the chicken had veins stuck in it.  Overall, the appetizer was good, but the service was very very slow. My salad was way too soggy."}
{"text":"Terrible. The family went there for my sister's birthday dinner tonight. The place was less than half full (12 people in addition to our party) but it still took over an hour to finally get our food, closer to 90 minutes actually and we weren't an exceptionally large party, 14 people and 2 of them were children of 5 years.  My sister-in-law's steak was so over-cooked it was inedible. My brother's liver dinner was like rubber. Another brother's fish sandwich wasn't even assembled, he got a small piece of fish on a plate with a bun and a piece of lettuce on the side that he had to ask for after the fish was delivered. My nephew's fries were burned and inedible. They also have no appreciation for food allergies, I have a mild allergy to root vegetables, especially onions. I ordered cole slaw as the side for my sandwich, 99% of the time a very safe choice vs a salad for me, There was nothing stated on the menu that there are onions in the cole slaw and who puts onions in cole slaw anyway? I realized it after I tasted it, I just hope I'm not up all night with a reaction to it.  We were seated by the kitchen, the profanity coming from the kitchen was inexcusable, unprofessional and inappropriate, especially with 2-5 year old children right outside.  The only saving grace was our waitress, she tried her best to keep us all happy but unfortunately couldn't do anything about the quality of the food or the kitchen staff. I hope that she soon finds a new job at a better place. None of my family members will be returning there."}
{"text":"Typically a better than average food experience.  Waitresses tend to be the worst part of the experience.  Fish is very good, as is the Friday mac n cheese.  Good beer on tap.  My hubby and I go here a handful of times per year and, if you can handle the snippy wait staff, you'll enjoy the food."}
{"text":"Fish sandwich and potato cakes and slaw outstanding  90 minute IPA 22 oz drafts  Great service"}
{"text":"Years ago, I came here quite a bit.  Lots of fun, good food and the service was fine.  That was years ago.  The original owners have, from what I've been told, turned the place over to their sons, and the differences are appalling.  The food has gone sharply downhill, aside from the fish sandwiches, which still are a major draw during the lenten season.  Food is often cold, improperly prepared, or simply wrong.  Different servers almost every time you visit ( high turnover is never a good sign for a restaurant), and an interesting phenomenon: at least one urinal in the men's room is almost always out of order.  The bar is another matter.  Many of the bar staff I was familiar with are gone, replaced with younger, less experienced bartenders who are more interested in socializing with customers than serving them.  Additionally, how does any bar worth visiting run out of any major brand of alcohol on a Friday night??? This happened on at least two of my most recent visits.  I always try to give a local place the benefit of the doubt, but I've run out of patience.  Maybe the sons will sell the place (another rumor I've heard recently), and give someone who might care a chance.  Either way, I'll miss the old Kretzler's."}
{"text":"Below average.  I ordered a sandwich and they did not have one of the main components of it.  They charged me the full price, even though the menu had the same exact item on it (without that component) for a few bucks less.  Very minor discrepancy on total cost, but I found it incredibly obnoxious to treat customers that way.  They lost me as a customer over $1.50, based entirely on principle.    If you're going to run out of all specials and menu items, and not even update the board in the front, you should at least do so with some class and tact.    You also can't just unilaterally decide to not include elements that are listed on the menu because the kitchen is out of them.  In the industry, the proper procedure is to let the customer know and then provide an alternative option.  Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Ok everyone knows about the HUGE fish sandwich ... and all you can eat fish on Fridays. ... but October fest is coming . .. and the parking lot will be busier than fish on Fridays during Lent.  Their soups are made on site.  The cream of spinach and broccoli soups are delicious ... the navy bean soup is OUTSTANDING.  This restaurant is like Cheers that the waitresses know the regulars - a very large group of people.  It is a comfort food menu ... you won't find tofu or sushi here.  They also have a party room - meetings, wakes, card players.   Did I mention the 28 beers on tap?"}
{"text":"I found this place while searching for potato pancakes. I looked at the menu online and was really excited to go there. I wanted the 14 oz ribeye with potato pancakes, apple sauce and soup of the day. I was with my daughter and we ordered the ranch dry rub wings as an app. Service was excellent. However the wings were super salty. The salt overpowered the ranch flavor and the chicken. When we started to order we were informed that the dinner menu isn't available until after 4 pm and it was only 2:30. They were also out of potato pancakes. I was very disappointed and suggested they put that time limitation on their website and menu as it was not listed anywhere. We drove 30 minutes to try this place out. I doubt we will make the trip again."}
{"text":"I was not able to place a Togo order at the bar. Bartender told me she was \"slammed\". I had to walk to togo area to place order. I have never experienced this in any restaurant before. Server was rude and not very welcoming as well. I did not receive a thank you for stopping in or anything. Food was good, but the hospitality was not there from the bartender-3/30/18"}
{"text":"The soup was the best part.  I was disappointed to see that this was not a place to get German cuisine.   Misleading."}
{"text":"Being a Catholic from Pittsburgh, I absolutely love going to new locations on Fridays during Lent to try different fish fry options. With that being said, I've been to quite a few places over the years, and I was really looking forward to trying Kretzler's, as the parking lot is always packed to the gills (no pun intended) on Lenten Fridays. It didn't give a very good first impression, because I waited at least 10 minutes before someone came to get drink orders. I understand it was their lunch rush, but 10 minutes just to get a water is a bit much in my opinion. As for the food, I ordered fried fish, macaroni and cheese, and stewed tomatoes. It was another bit of a wait, maybe 20-30 minutes, but that one I can understand since they have to put out a large quantity of fish in a short amount of time. The macaroni and cheese was decent. It wasn't out of this world, but it was definitely something I could eat again. The stewed tomatoes were pretty good--also something I could see myself getting again. The tomatoes were unique in the sense that they had croutons in them, and, though I could see why that would be off-putting for some, I actually thought it made them tasty and gave them a nice bit of flavor. The fish, which was the entire reason for going there, was just average. Nothing really was terrible or stood out to me. Overall, I feel that Kretzler's is a place I could visit again to try their other food options, but probably not fish on Lenten Fridays. In my opinion, with Kretzler's, the old saying, \"it was well worth the wait\" did not hold true for Fish Fry Friday, but it did show a bit of promise because it was what I would call \"a hair above average\"."}
{"text":"They had the meatloaf special on Wednesday, 3-28-2018 so I decided to get that.  Meatloaf was so hard that my fork could barely puncture it.  It was over done and I guess I got the burnt ends.  I usually get good meals there, but on this day, it was the worst."}
{"text":"Kretzler's Tavern has been part of the North Hills dining and drinking scene for as long as I can remember (40+ years).  The place has continued to evolve over time but maintained their German slant on beer and food.  I enjoyed a nice cold Hacker Pschorr Munich Gold draft on tap tonight with my fish sandwich and perfectly seasoned potato cake with applesauce.  They feature more than 27 beers on tap which is nice and have a full bar area with high top tables and some games.   Their fish batter is a tad bland but the fish was white, fresh, and meaty so that sort of made up for the batter.  The potato pancakes were exactly like my dear Mother used to make: shredded potatoes with minced onion and egg that is formed into a cake and pan fried on high heat to give the outside that crispy texture and keep the inside moist.  My partner loved the coleslaw too.   The chairs and tables are beautiful rustic wood with a dark stain that must have recently been refinished.  Business was brisk with many casual diners still streaming in as we finished up around 8:45PM.  We love to find places that will accommodate some later dining so this one goes onto the short list of North Hills restaurants with later dinner bells.   Our waitress was very attentive and courteous which created a nice dining experience. The rest of the menu is staple diner/home cooked food like steaks/chops, sandwiches, burgers, and appetizers."}
{"text":"Not so good. We went here to get dinner but after looking at a few other people's dinner we decided to just do a few appetizers. The fried ravioli tasted almost freezer burned. The spinach artichoke dip was not bad. Very very cheesy. BUT because it was so cheesy it was super greasy. We actually had to spill the grease out of it before we ate it. They were out of pita chips so we had to get it with Italian bread. The bread was probably the best part of our meal."}
{"text":"Kretzler's has become my family's go-to stop for Good Friday fish sandwiches for years though I find myself there a few other times throughout the year.  I find I'm either here for the bar/drinks or here for the food/restaurant, depending on the group I'm with.  Family, friends, co-workers, drinking buddies?  It doesn't matter, Kretzler's will please any crowd.    Surprisingly diverse list of beers on tap, including a few craft brews along side your Coors and Miller Lite.  They'll let you order food at the bar which I've never done however I have noticed that food seems to be served faster at the bar.  The hostess may not seem like the friendliest person when you first arrive for the restaurant side, especially when it's busy.  But when that place is hopping she keeps things organized and moving efficiently.  Wait staff is friendly.  I've had several food items on the menu over my many visits including the Tavern Salad (stacked with veggies and mixed greens), always satisfying appetizers and munchies, and several sandwiches and hoagies (turkey club, reuben, classic burger and of course the fish sandwich).  The portions will not leave you hungry and if you doubt that, just know that they have a new burger challenge called the Buzzy Dunkle Schnitzel Burger.  This menu item is described as an \"obnoxious\" two 8 oz burger patties, two fried eggs, cheese, bacon, fries and slaw.  I'm very tempted by the challenge and reward of a free t-shirt if I consume this hefty burger.  Stay tuned for updates."}
{"text":"I cannot say enough good things about this place. It is my frequent \"go to\" place. Separate dining area from the bar so you can go for a family dinner or a fun happy hour. This is my favorite place. Comfort food at its best. Oh and during lent such an awesome fish sandwich."}
{"text":"Best thing about this place- food prices. I had a pretty good italian wedding soup, not bad at all. Private parking lot and easy to find.  Not a bad place to eat for someone on the go (like me) from out of town."}
{"text":"I was working at our sub-office, filling in for the site manager and a couple of the contract staff members and I decided to head out to lunch.  They recommended Kretzlers.  Kretzlers is another one of those hidden little Pittsburgh gems.  Yes the place has been around for awhile.  Yes the menu is out of the '70s.  Ain't nuthin' wrong with that!  As far as I'm concerned, if a place can do a great BLT, then it's aces in my book!  And boy can Kretzlers do a great BLT.  This was better than any I'd ever had at Eat-n-Park!  And I'm a huge fan of Eat-n-Park's BLTs!  I'd even have to say that it was better than any I'd ever had at a Chicago Greek joint.   How does a great BLT taste?  The toast has to go \"ka-runch\" when I bite into it; the lettuce and tomato has to be fresh, and the bacon has to be crispy.  Was this ever!  Mmmmm!   Next time I'll have to try it with the fried egg on top.  And the prices here are dirt cheap too.  $4.29 for my BLT including fries or soup."}
{"text":"Potato pancakes and chicken strips TO DIE FOR!!!!!  Great service, fun bar, a must on Steeler Sundays."}
{"text":"I want to love this place especially since our friends all rave about it but every time we decide to give it a go, we are disappointed. The food is decent but it always seems to be an issue getting exactly what we ordered. The service, although friendly, is painfully slow. It took 15 plus minutes to get a draft beer on a slow Wednesday evening during dinner. Even though this isn't our all time favorite place, we still end up frequenting it every two months or so."}
{"text":"Great fish sandwich.   Good service.   Fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great family restaurant!  By far the best fried fish sandwiches in all Pittsburgh!  Quick service for the relatively large amount of people that are always there.  Be wary if you are going on a Friday during Lent- there will be a ton of people there!"}
{"text":"I often drive past this place and always thought that it looks more like a bar then a restaurant from the outside. However, during my first visit here last night I found out that this is not the case.  You do , however, enter the bar area to go into the rather large sized dining room. The first thing that caught my attention  was the unique looking  dining room chairs.  They appear to be custom made and tree branches were used to form the backs of the chairs. Further beyond the main dining room is another separate, more private dining room for parties etc.. I also noticed a door in the rear of the building allowing access to both the main dining room and the private one.  The menu looked very inviting with plenty of good options.  I finally decided to try their fish sandwich since this is one of their known specialties  and my friend decided on the Reuben.  We ended up splitting our sandwiches and both were of good quality and very filling. The server mentioned that they offer homemade soups on a regular basis but it is hard to know which soup will be featured on any given day.  Last night featured a hearty navy bean soup. The prices are very reasonable and we look forward to another visit."}
{"text":"I went there for a lunch with my parents during the week, as it is one of my parents favorite places and they have been talking it up for quite a while.  We were sat immediately and they easily accommodated our request to have a booth even though we were first brought to a table.  I had the hot sausage sandwich which comes with grilled onions and peppers, and melted provolone cheese on an Italian roll.  This thing was tastyyyyyy!  I definitely recommend a little marinara sauce either on it or on the side, because you just can't have hot sausage without some sauce in my humble partially Italian opinion.  I really enjoyed how the sausage was a patty so there was no biting into a link and having it shoot out the back end of the sandwich or that gross snap of biting into casing.  I had the potato pancakes as my side (I know, weird combo but I was told I had to try them).  They were good, but a little too thick and a little bland.  Not really a reason to come here, but definitely not a reason to avoid the place.  My mom had the fries which were quite tasty.  The service was very friendly in the classic Pittsburgh fashion.  My drink was always filled and I left well caffeinated after my many glasses of Pepsi.  The wait for the food was a little longer than average, but didn't leave me hungry for too long.  I'll definitely be back here when I'm in the mood for some tasty, no frills kind of food."}
{"text":"Absolutely love the atmosphere and food here! Potato pancakes are life here  definitely going back asap!"}
{"text":"Horrible experience today. Ordered at the bar. Great service, but food straight up SUCKED. Fried mushrooms undercooked, qusadilla stuffed with crap that doesn't belong in a quesadilla (black olives, tomatoes, etc.) So-called Buffalo wings dry to the bone and seven teeny, tiny sorry little shrimp in the shrimp \"basket\".  Having previously had absolutely fantastic meals in the dining room in the evenings, this visit was a complete disappointment.  Somebody please call the police.....Kretzler's just ROBBED me for $52.15 !!!!! (App wouldn't let me post ZERO stars)"}
{"text":"When you have a family that consist of multiple teenage boys sometimes you settle for quantity over quality, here we found both. My husband and I took the boys out after a game of laser tag to feed them at their normal feeding times of every 4 hours. I am not kidding these monsters (boys) eat several meals a day if we let them.  The menu is larger than what I thought and contain things like Devinshire over toast, Pittsburgh best fish sandwich and A few different clubs. We went old school and all ordered different types of sandwiches. One son got the classic cheeseburger and it was freshly made cheeseburger with fresh toppings. Another got the fiesta burger and it was he being high with topping. Another got the Philly cheesesteak and onion rings both were delicious! My husband picked the Rachael and he did not even offer me a bite. From the lack of conversation that happened at the table I would say this place is a winner among all of the men.  I was super pleased with a bill that was just at 40 bucks for five people! So no this place is not hip and the crowd does contain lots of folks over 70 but we will return again because of the value, customer service and the overall down-home feeling."}
{"text":"First, this is a great fish sandwich! Best in North Hills, had potato pancake as the side, delicious. But , service at the bar is best described as 'indifferent.' Seem to have an adequate beer selection, but wait staff don't seem to be that interested."}
{"text":"Big menu, decent to very good food, big bar, efficient service, and reasonable prices.  I went with one other person, but I feel like this might be a perfect place to go with a group.  It's hard to imagine someone not finding something they like on the menu; it fits any budget; and the dining room is spacious.  Nothing struck me as particularly wonderful about this local mainstay--so I'm not sure I'd go out of my way for a second visit--but if I'm hungry and in the neighborhood, I'll definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"Worst. Food. Ever. I can't explain how awful this place is - however let me begin: -dirty: seriously? You can't wipe your menus?  -staff: forgot EVERYTHING  -food: was cold, greasy, and literally looked like a frozen meal - expensive - for the food their serving, they should charge WAY less"}
{"text":"Want to check out a local blue collar tavern in Pittsburgh's North Hills that serves excellent fare? Then try Kretzler's!    Kretzler's has been around forever.  The menu is right out of the '70s, with period appetizers such as \"spinach artichoke dip\", \"potato skins\",and  \"wing dings\".  A typical meat and seafood heavy menu, the quality of food is anything but typical!    Reasonable prices, good Pittsburgh-style food, heaps of local \"color\", and a friendly staff makes Kretzler's a great place for families and friends.  And, as always, a satisfying and uniquely Pittsburgh dining experience.  Note: Hands down, best fish sandwich in town!"}
{"text":"In my office, Kretzler's is the only place we go during Lent. Their fish sandwiches are delicious, french dips are great (just not on Fridays!), and their Macaroni and Cheese (offered only on Friday, I think) is beyond delicious. Honestly, I have never been disappointed in a meal from this place. Between the food quality and the low prices, it's a tough one to beat."}
{"text":"Doors were confusing but once inside it looked like reclaimed birch furniture from Bavaria.  Rustic and good sized meals.  Mother's Day was a treat and for mothers free dessert.  $ is the price I would definitely go back because there was no air of pretension in this place.  No fancy fusion stuff, just good old starch an protein fair."}
{"text":"Restaurant full of regulars, but welcoming of new customers! We stopped in for a Friday lunch and surprised by how busy it was! On this day, it seemed everyone was enjoying a meatless Friday with plenty of fish and seafood options. We were seated quickly, and warmly welcomed.   I came for the sole purpose of trying the legendary fish sandwich - which did not disappoint. It was good to know we could sub out bun/bread options (if food allergies are a concern ie: sesame seed buns aplenty on the menu.) My husband had the chicken breast sandwich (batter dipped) and added buffalo hot sauce for $1. I liked chicken, however, it did get a bit lost on the hoagie bun so try for the suggested sesame bun or perhaps the white, wheat, or tortilla wrap. Potato pancakes were a hit!  They had a nice selection of over twenty beers on draft, but the list was written on a white board with a few letters missing.  Definitely look forward to coming back with the kids!"}
{"text":"I'm done with this place.  No wonder it's only half full on Friday at 8:00pm.  I just left because I wanted for 15 minutes for a waitress that never showed up, while a gaggle of them sat at a corner table gabbing.  I waived at them a few times and was ignored.  TJE FOOD IS GOOD HERE, but the service is usually slow and bad.  Mr. Kretzler, fire the dead wait, you'd be better off.  Especially since you're in an area where there's TONS OF competition.  I went to Montecellos a block away, got greeted, got drinks and an appetizer in the same amount of time it took me not to get service at Kretzlers."}
{"text":"My friend and I had heard about this place that has been here for many years.. it was a halfway point between our houses. I got a coupon in my coupon clipper so we said why not?! We came for a fairly early dinner on a Thursday night. Place was busy parking lot crowded.. good sign. I was seated promptly. My friend arrived shortly. I ordered. Really nice mild Belgian weisbeer. We got pretzel sticks with dips. Soft warm delicious. I got the Rueben .. one of the best I've had with a side of yummy cole slaw. My friend got the fish sandwich on a pretzel roll. Generous portions and delicious!! Potato pancake like my hone made ones. Definitely plan on frequent long this place.  Oh and btw totally forgot about my coupon so I HAVE to come back soon!!"}
{"text":"Don't expect 4* service. But you can expect one of the most delicious fried fish sandwiches you'll ever taste. A thick piece of cod or haddock, not breaded but dipped in a light beer batter and fried to golden perfection and served on a soft sesame bun. The coleslaw is fresh and chilled. The beer selection is nice and delivered cold. EAT LOTSA FISH..."}
{"text":"Good food, Great prices, Huge bar. Lots of seating for the bar and dining areas. It's a bit out of the way, but well worth it if your in the area. 4 people can easily eat for under $50"}
{"text":"On our way back home from some house hunting my wife and I passed Kretlzers and figured, \"lets give it a shot, something new!\"  We started with a stuffed pretzel, which was merely a pretzel roll cut in half and less than half way melted cheese set in the middle... It wasn't bad, but not what one would expect when they see \"stuffed pretzel\".  My wife ordered the meatball hoagie with potato pancakes, and me, the beef and cheddar melt.  The meatball, my wife said, was just average, but the potato pancakes, we both agreed, were pretty darn good.  The beef and cheddar, oh the beef and cheddar... AWFUL! It was tasteless and so dry that I could barely swallow it... I asked for some au jus thinking it would help... It didn't, mainly because the au jus sucked as well.  Our waitress was nice, no overly personable, but nice, young and a bit shy I believe.  She apologized for the sandwich and took it off the bill...  I don't see any reason to ever go back..."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner and a drink with my husband. Nice place, large selection of beer on tap, good food including traditional German food (braunschweiger sandwich!!!) and a large shuffleboard table. Bartender was friendly enough and the place wasn't too crowded.  Update: came here again for dinner on a Sunday evening and got the prime rib special and a glass of red wine. It was very good! Lots of options for sides and a large amount of food for the price. The waitress was attentive and the prime was cooked to the right temp."}
{"text":"I decided on Kretzlers for my family birthday celebration. We have been loyal patrons for many years and multiple family members have been employed here in the past. Apparently the times have changed. Tonight our party of 18 (yes a reservation was made) was subjected to some of the worst service and food I've ever had the displeasure of experiencing. We waited patiently for an hour for our house salads, which were still subpar. When my New York Strip came another 30 minutes or so later, it was well done, no where close to the medium I ordered. The list of problems, including the fact that twice I went without a refill for over half an hour,  is too long to take even take the time to write here, but I will be emailing the owner with a detailed complaint. It saddens me to take this off of my list of one of my favorite places to eat in the North Hills, but after tonight's complete debacle, I have no choice."}
{"text":"I've heard great things about this restaurants fish sandwich so I came here on a Friday around 6:00 during Lent with my husband. There was not a parking space anywhere, we actually had to drive around behind the building and park in a tight spot next to a dumpster. Walked in the door and we weren't even greeted, the hostess didn't ask how many were in our party or tell us how long of a wait it would be or say two words to us. I couldn't tell you what the fish tastes like because we turned around and walked out after 15 minutes of standing in the entrance next to the \"please wait to be seated\" sign while at least 3 staff members walked past us. I understand we came at a busy time but they could have at least acknowledge someone waiting to be seated. Maybe if we came at a different time we would have received better service, but after reading other reviews it doesn't sound like there's better service at any time."}
{"text":"It was a steelers gameday, not packed at all. Ordered the meatball hoagie with fries and the chicken parm sandwich. The fries were crispy and tasty. The meatball hoagie was really nicely made, enough meatballs and cheese and sauce as well. I would recommend it. The chicken parm sandwich comes open faced on toasted garlic bread which was different but tasted awesome that way. Good draft choices and service at the bar was quick and cordial."}
{"text":"Kretzlers brings me back to my childhood in Northwest PA - true comfort food. Please note, you're not coming here for a gluten-free, kale-pureed, quinoa-crusted foo foo meal. No, my friends, this is Western PA cookin' at its finest. The fried fish is perfect, and huge. Frighteningly so. But it's delicious. The sandwiches are fuel for the defensive line of an upstate, redneck football team, and they are spectacular. The French Onion Soup is blanketed in a thick, delicious drape of warm, bubbly cheese. The waitresses are total chocolate covered pretzel ladies - a little sweet, a little salty. The decor is nonexistent, and I'm ok with that. Bring a sweater and pants with elastic, it's freezing in there and the portions are gargantuan."}
