{"text":"Très bien comme resto de type \"diner\" américain pour un repas réconfortant.  Le smoked meat est très bon."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery from there tonight. Good, tasty, a ton of fries (more than I can eat but my roommate is going to be a happy man because of it) and well cooked chicken.   My only complaint, which is a fairly big one, is that I ordered mozzarella sticks for 6,95 and they arrived cold, hard and were somehow accompanied with a piece of banana, cantaloupe, and orange. Having mozzarella sticks that taste like orange was not enjoyable whatsoever and just really bizarre. I wouldn't have ordered them had I known.  Quick delivery, the guy was really nice."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here today. The staff was wonderfully friendly and accommodating. The menu is standard diner food and moderately priced. We ordered the mushroom omelette  and it was generously portioned to share with my toddler and still had leftovers. The potatoes were so crispy ad my favorite item. The fresh fruit was perfectly ripe and refreshing. The omelette was overcooked but edible and not too bad. This place is open 24/7 which is always a plus in my book :)"}
{"text":"Totally worth it for the tacky nautical decor and friendly,  though (unintentionally) comedically disgruntled waitresses. It's a great diner with great greasy food. I recommend the Americana poutine and anything off the breakfast menu. They have a fairly large parking lot and are within walking distance of a metro- though it's uphill and super slippery in the winter. Word of caution if you're ordering take-out: be careful when ordering a Gyros, the teenage receptionist tends to mix that up with Jello. No joke. It's happened on a couple of occasions. Good news is, the jello is surprisingly delicious even when you're upset about not getting the tasty sandwich you actually ordered."}
{"text":"Best place for breakfast all day and night."}
{"text":"N'accepte aucune carte de crédit après 23h... Et ce n'est pas écrit . Aucune carte de débit non plus . Ce n'est même pas spécifier par le serveur. Pogner a retirer un ATM avec frais . Le serveur était complètement mêlé dans ses commandes ."}
{"text":"They are quite convenient (24/7), you just need to survive the initial shock when you get it. Their deco reminded me of those Brazilian Carnival parades."}
{"text":"I normaly get the subs, their always yummy. The pizza is kinda pricy but its very well made, depending your budget it can be well worth it. The deco is, interesting loll the service is fast, same with their delivery. And i mean open 24hs!! As a late nighter, i end up ordering here way to often lol"}
{"text":"Le restaurant parfait pour manger un snack en sortant d'un bar à 3h du matin !!  Juste entrer dans le Miami Deli c'est une expérience ! Bienvenu au musé du poisson en plastique haha !   La bouffe n'est pas exceptionnelle, mais rater une poutine c'est bien dur donc prend le temps d'arrêter si tu as faim à 3h30 du matin !!"}
{"text":"Bon pour le général, débordé un samedi a 11h , omelette correcte sans plus , patate petite quantité et tranchée. Ambiance d'un deli regulier .... a retourner pour etre sur"}
{"text":"Great little breakfast spot we found while walking around dying of thirst and hunger. Interesting to see a Miami themed restaurant in Canada with everyone speaking French lol."}
{"text":"Super bon restaurant pour déjeuners et il est 24 heures! Service est lent parfois, mais c'est aussi du au fait que c'est pratiquement toujours occupé.  Très beau décor, un peu quétaine, mais qui n'aime pas ça! Pas cher non plus, essayez le spécial Miami et pour 9$ une super belle assiette! Les fruits inclus dans les assiettes ne sont pas toujours frais.  Café à volonté avec tous les plats et si vous manger à l'imtérieur, ils vous laissent la carafe :-) Ils ne prennent pas Interac, mais acceptent Visa ou Mastercard"}
{"text":"Fait le travail à 3 am après une sortie entre amis, mais je n'y vois rien de particulier. Le décor est exotique, le service rapide et correct, mais le café est imbuvable et les jus d'orange sont presque du vol."}
{"text":"This place has my favourite sous-marins in town, love that they serve them with French dressing, all sandwiches should come with French dressing. Been a customer for around 4 years now. It's nothing fancy, but it's a diner, it shouldn't be. All in all: Thumbs up."}
{"text":"Great place to eat when everything is closed around as this place is open 24/7! Greek chicken souvlaki was great, came with a big side plate of salad, potatoes and rice."}
{"text":"Been coming here for about 6 years. Bright and spacious diner with a ton of comfortable booths. Their specialty is breakfast although they have all you could dream of for lunch and diner... wait did I mention it's open 24hrs! Yes you can have breakfast here anytime of the day you want! The staff are experienced and friendly... pretty smooth joint. The decor is fun tropical flowers and trees + a waterfall are hanging everywhere and different fish and sharks hang from the ceiling... not your avg cookie cutter diner. If you're with your kids try to sit near the giant fish tank. Tropical colorful fish will amuse you all! Pay cash or credit. No debit. Great value."}
{"text":"The food was good. The service was a bit spotty but we did come again for breakfast while in Montreal a few times. We had omelette which was good, over easy eggs, pancakes and crepes, as well as fruits, french toast and other item. Overall it was good enough spot for us to come almost everyday during out stay in Montreal."}
{"text":"We came here on a Saturday evening looking for a dinner place and spotted this diner. The diner is 24 hours/7 days a week. This restaurant is not your typical diner as their menu is quite extensive with an assortment of sandwiches, pastas, burgers, pizza, steak, and they even have Chinese food!! I ordered the fettucine fruits de mar which comes with mushroom, scallops, shrimp and crab in a béchamel sauce. Fettucine was alright- I felt it was too much sauce in the dish. Seasoning was good and the portion is quite big. The dish also comes with garlic bread and a garden salad with this Thousand Island dressing. Both were okay. Our server was alright but kept forgetting parts of our order. The good part of this place is that they definitely have a huge menu of foods to choose from. Overall, a decent place to grab some grub for dinner or a late night snack."}
{"text":"C'est un deli...ne vous attendez pas à de la grande gastronomie.  Les serveuses sont vieilles et se chicanent devant vous... La bouffe est bien ordinaire...mais pas dégueux.  Petit plus: le resto est ouvert 24h...belle alternative au McDo..."}
{"text":"When you walk in you will be taken back to Miami in the 80's. This dive of a spot actually has great Greek food. We had the chicken dish and it was amazing. They also have freshly squeezed OJ. It's not a Michelin star restaurant but a cozy diner with condom dispensers. It is what it is, if you catch yourself walking in a shady neighborhood on the way to the botanical garden stop by."}
{"text":"This restaurant on the border of Rosemont and Hochelaga has been around for decades, having seen several name changes and facelifts over the years.  But it remains, in my opinion, a Montreal classic.    Styled after US diners, they offer a variety of Quebecois, Italian and Greek dishes -- your typical diner foods like pizzas, subs, poutine, club sandwiches, gyros, souvlaki, etc -- as well as all day breakfasts (complete with your own thermos pitcher of coffee).    The breakfasts are great and reasonably priced, and there's an impressive variety to choose from.  They also have one of my favourite pizzas in town.    Nothing fancy but the food is good, the portions hardy and the place is clean.  Parking is sometimes packed but you can also park at the mall across the street.  The fact it's one of the few non-fast-food places open 24h also makes it a good place to remember!"}
{"text":"Les serveuses très sympathique et le décor très invitant. Par contre niveau nourriture je ne peux pas donner 3 étoiles.  Le café goûte l'eau une chance qu'il est gratuit. On voit vraiment que le propriétaire essaie de sauver de l'argent un peu partout et à oublier de satisfaire les papilles gustatives de ses clients. La priorité c'est de faire de l'argent ici."}
{"text":"Standard greasy spoon. Some discounts if you sign up online for their newsletter and on your birthday. I ate there for breakfast, which was tasty.  Upside is that it's open 24 hours and serves breakfast all day. There is also a terrace in the summer, but people usually smoke. The inside of the restaurant looks like a scene taken from the 1970s, once brightly coloured but now faded."}
{"text":"Un restaurant qui offre de TOUT! Parfait pour passer une commande un vendredi soir ou vous ne voulez pas vous casser la tête! Le restaurant est à voir aussi au moins une fois dans sa vie ne serait-ce que pour les multiples décorations de poissons!   Sans être de la grande cuisine, ça fait du bien de manger un sous-marin avec une poutine une fois de temps en temps! Les prix sont bas alors vous pourrez être saturé de gras de patates sans vous ruiner!"}
{"text":"Le Miami Déli, qu'en dire, on se sent vraiment comme en Floride où les serveuses avec un suprlus de SprayNet vous serve avec des blagues un peu (trop) grivoises. Pour un oeufs-bacon-rôties où une pizza bien grasse vous serez satisfait mais honnêtement, c'est plus pour le décor ou l'expérience qu'on y va.  Pour ces durs lendemains: ils servent les déjeuners toute la journée :)"}
{"text":"Unexpectedly delicious. Great value for some delicious breakfast food. Nice outdoor seating. We passed this place while on our 3 mile walk to the Botanical Gardens and were starving. We were pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"Large Menu, Check. Angry waiters, Check. Huge Portions, Check...you are at a diner.  The food is good, the coffee is strong as hell, the waiters are super busy at all times.   I love that they served fruit with all of the breakfasts, the potatoes are awesome, the omelettes were cooked just enough, not dry. I love that they also serve beans.  Worth trying for a cheap meal, great outdoor seating."}
{"text":"First impression walking into this establishment was that it needs a major makeover, from the outdated fake flowers to the hanging Sharks. The menu isn't anything special, typical diner food from burgers to subs to breakfast, what really stands out here is the service, very nice waitress. I had a breakfast plate and it was okay, someone took the smoked meat platter and it looked really good. Can't go wrong with smoke meat in Montreal. Would come back."}
{"text":"The Miami Deli is really close to me and delivers so I thought it would be a good option when I didn't want to cook.  The takeout menu is pretty standard and features pizza, burgers and other staples of fast food.  Once you have placed your order the food comes pretty quickly.   When talkig food the pizzas are a little overpriced and just not very good.  I find that there are way too many toppings which makes the crust very soggy and consequently it is messy to eat.  That being said I still have yet to try other things on the takeout menu so I would be inclined to give it another chance because they did seem more reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Love this place! I've been ordering take out for a while now and no matter what I try, it's always delicious. I love comfort food and classic staples, so a good poutine, club sandwich, gyro, smoked meat or pizza for example are excellent choices. The menu selection is huge, delivery is fast and portions are large too. This place is open 24 hours but does not deliver 24 hours, so just be aware if you are hungry in the middle of the night.  One of my favorite items is the \"chinese chicken fried rice\". It's not really chinese food, but it's awesome. There are big chunks of chicken, tomatoes, and green onions which make it super flavorful. For around 10$, it's plenty enough for a meal or to share as many sides.  I recently went for breakfast and was not disappointed either. I had their \"miami omelette\" which again was very generous with the toppings and portion. Compared to other breakfast chains, I feel like I'm getting my money's worth here.  The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is the price of their pizzas. I wish I could make this my go to place for pizzas, but their prices are a little steep. There are numerous joints offering 2 for 1 type deals, but almost every pizza at Miami Deli is 20$ or upwards for just one.   Worth a visit, there's something for everyone!"}
{"text":"Greasy food, massive portions, and an odd Florida-theme in the middle of Montreal. We came here because there was really nowhere else open at the time in the area. We were not disappointed. The waitresses seem stressed and unfriendly, but I can't complain. It's a deli not fine dining. I ordered the souvlaki dish, which was actually pretty decent. At least as good as fast food-style greek food. The one major oddity was that the feta cheese was in the form of a solid block on top of the salad, which I haven't seen before but after some Googling, it's apparently a thing."}
{"text":"On choisit le Miami pour sa commodité en pleine nuit lorsqu'on a un crave de soupe à l'oignon ou de smoked meat. Pas beaucoup de restos à déjeuner dans le coin non plus, donc ça dépanne. Les toasts sont \"beurrées\" avec de la margarine, mais à quoi d'autre pourrait-on s'attendre? C'est le Miami."}
{"text":"Looking for a breakfast spot on our way back. It was recommended to us. Nothing too special, your regular no frills breakfast spot. It was very affordable and amazingly quick. Good size portions. Free parking. Simple breakfast with \"Miami\" decor."}
{"text":"Typical deli style food. Nothing to fall of your chair for. Good food done right! Breakfast served 24hrs/7. Huge portions. Did i mention that this place is always opened? 24/7. The staff is super helpful and friendly! Prices are bit higher then other places similar to this."}
