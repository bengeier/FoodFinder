{"text":"I was craving tacos for some odd reason and had previously read other Yelpers reviews of this place.      I just had some of the BEST tacos EVER!  The place was completely empty  when I arrived at 6p.m.  I wanted to try the al pastor tacos but in a crispy shell not soft.   No problem .  My custom -made crispy fried tacos arrive just a few minutes later  hot and crisp  but not greasy- with the pastor (pork and onions) meat inside topped  with shredded lettuce , a little sour cream and and queso blanco .  A large thin tomato slice sat  atop the whole thing.  I was in taco heaven!   Both a spicy  red and green salsa was brought to my table.  The flavors of both salsas were awesome but the consistency was a bit too watery for me. (Ok - I'll live.) The homemade guacamole was also very good  simply made with chumks of avacado and bits of tomato.

These tacos were so good I asked if they could add these to their regular menu.   Elena  said that she and the cook had been talking about doing just that!  Elena's brother is the owner and she said that  she would encourage him to do so and call them Tacos Dorados  I hope they do so and soon~! .  I think I'll return tomorrow and try their  tortas.  If they are as good as their tacos I'll rate this place a 5.  (From a 4.5) 
If you go tell them Renee sent you to try her custom-made Dorado tacos!
Beverages offered include soda, beer and horchata .  Gracias Elena!"}
{"text":"Tried this place on a lazy Sunday evening at the recommendation of other reviews, and I would say what others have said is pretty accurate. It is very authentic, looks like a total dive from the outside, and it's in a Hispanic neighborhood. But, the tacos here are great! Now, just to be clear, these are street style tacos, they are small, but they are only $0.99/each, which seems pretty reasonable. 

I ordered an adobada, al pastor, carnitas, and a shredded beef with red chiles. Each were very good in their own unique ways, the meat was good quality and everything had the appropriate amounts of seasoning and flavor. The adobada was the standout in my mouth, so much that I had to go back and order another one! I also had a side of rice and beans, which were good, but nothing out of the ordinary. 

So far so good, right? The only slip up this place maybe has, is that my girlfriend, that was with me, who doesn't eat meat, was not overly impressed. She got a bean and cheese burrito and a shrimp taco. The shrimp taco looked good, and she said everything tasted alright, but she was not wowed, like I was, about the quality of the tacos. She did enjoy the beans and rice though. So, this place might not be the best veg friendly location, but I'm not really going to take off for that, because it is very authentic, and veg friendly isn't necessarily what they are trying to do. They are trying to make good, traditional tacos, and that they do that very well. 

They also serve beer here, and I love the way it's served. Your bottle or can is brought out with a mug that is frosted, salted, and has lime juice in the bottom. Speaking of bringing you the glass, the service is wonderful. Our server was very friendly, patient, nice and helpful. 

All in all, if you are looking for a good taco shop, nothing fancy, and authentic, this might be your best bet. Or at least it is from the places I have been so far..."}
{"text":"I have been here before the food is really good, with a convenient location just walking distance from my home. However, when I arrived today the hostess was rude and I waited 40 minutes and I still had not been served, for no apparent reason. I asked to cancel my order and the hostess simply stated \"okay\" which makes me believe the prolonged wait time may have been done purposely. I will never visit this place again."}
{"text":"$0.99 tacos - generously sized and very tasty.  The fact that you can sit down at this price is amazing - who cares about the lack of decor.  To top, service was very friendly.   

We went for lunch on a Sunday and it was packed.  Lamb's the weekend special so we order the lamb soup and the grilled lamb taco.  The shredded lamb in the taco tasted more boiled than grilled - we surmised that this was the reason for the tasty lamby soup.  

We ordered a few tacos and liked the al pastor the best.  The dry-rubed spices had completely infused into the meat which combined with the smokiness of the charcoal grill made it one of the best al pastor we'd had.

Also liked the horchata - most places make it too sweet - this one was just right allowing other flavors to come through.

If you want more details, Seth has a great review with pictures on his blog \"Feasting in Phoenix\":

{"text":"Service and food is excellent.  $3.99 for a good sized burrito served with rice and beans on the side is a great deal.  Or 99 cent tacos (these are the Mexico \"street\" style ones served on a soft flat corn tortilla).  All their food is very authentic.

The Al Pastor (seasoned grilled pork and onions) is my favorite and is the best I've ever had.  Whether it's in a burrito, taco or torta, I absolutely love it.  The sodas are the kind you'd get in Mexico.. they import them in the glass bottles.  I've always liked these better than the plastic bottle type you get in the states. The Mexican ones are sweeter and less carbonated.

Great place, and they have beer too."}
{"text":"I have lived here my whole life.  And for most of that time I have pretty much eaten gringocized Mexican food.  You know, Ajo Al's, Macayo's, Garcia's, etc.  At this point, it is still a treat for me, but I would rather eat at the authentic Mexican dive with actual Spanish on the menu, dishes I don't recognize and very few white people in the place.  El Nopalito fits the bill perfectly.  This place first popped up on my radar after seeing frequent mentions on Chowhound.  It was right in my neighborhood, but I never got around to trying it until last week. 

We showed up on a Friday night starving and exhausted from teaching small children and, sadly, laying off employees.  Ick.  We started with two Cokes and some homemade chips with both a green and red salsa.  Both salsas were outstanding, which in my experience is rare.  Generally if you get two salsas on the table, one is terrible and one is at least decent.  And Mexican cokes in the cool bottles?  Yay!  Then we ordered a bowl of tortilla soup to share.  This was flavorful and the tortilla strips were nice and crispy.  We only ordered one portion to share but the server brought us two full bowls and charged us for one.  Generous.  The only room for improvement was temperature.  The soup could have been hotter.  Next, we ordered green chile chicken enchiladas and...and...and I forgot the name of my entree.  It was, however, the server's recommendation and she didn't let me down.  My dish was steak with bacon, green peppers, onions and cheese melted over the top.  All of this was served over two corn tortillas.  Super good.  Everything was cooked to perfection.  The green chile chicken enchiladas were outstanding and the green chile was the best my boyfriend has ever had.  The rice was flavorful and tender and beans great as well.  I had the leftover enchiladas today for lunch and they were awesome all over again.  We'll be back to El Nopalito often.  I'm excited to try the 99 cent street tacos."}
{"text":"Small hole in the wall but very good food.  I got both red and green salsas for my chips.  Both were very tasty and spicy.  I'd go back just for the salsa's alone, but I also enjoyed the enchilladas suizas I had.  I also experimented with a side dish (chiles *something*), which turned out to be small chiles sauteed with sliced onions.  I loved the onions but couldn't finish more than one or two of the chiles, my bad.  Accordingly, I'd be interested in trying other items on the menu that I couldn't figure out."}
{"text":"I thought the food was pretty darn good, especially for the price.

I got 3 tacos (cabeza, al pastor y adobada) and a carne asada sope.  Wife got something very similar.  All that plus a beer for $16.  

The waitress was really nice, I mean service wasn't 5 stars but didn't expect it to be when you pull up to this joint.  Nothing to complain about except the smelly rags they used to wipe the tables next to us."}
{"text":"Got the Assad tacos with rice and beans. Excellent! Courteous servers. I will definitely return."}
{"text":"This place is cheap and great!  Best pastor tacos in Phoenix for the money!"}
{"text":"If you want to try one of teh best home-made mole negro dishes in town, this is the place. The food is outstanding. Only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because it's a tiny hole in the wall that tends to be crowded and very noisy at peak hours. If you like great, real Mexican food, though, this place is hard to beat. So are the prices, by the way."}
{"text":"Repeat after me: you are here for the street tacos. Street. Tacos. 
All of the small, dollar tacos are not only a steal but some of the savoriest, juiciest tacos in the Valley. This gem was pointed out by a Mexican local, for which this gringo is eternally grateful: we eat here almost once a week!
Newcomers to Mexican cuisine may be surprised to find cabeza (server said it is cow cheeck?) as an option, but it's our favorite by a mile. Others include the shredded pork and shredded beef. Although not explicitly on the menu, you may be able to order shrimp tacos for a few dollars more. If you can, you MUST. Then prepare for the revelation of your life as you enjoy the juiciest grilled shrimp you never knew you could have. 
 
Helpings are generous and staff is curteous. You can easily gobble 4 as a meal, though the men like to indulge in 6-9...in any case, it's easy enough to order a sampling and find your groove. Bonus: Complementary salsa verde is a nice kick with the right amount of lime."}
{"text":"I eat here 2-3 times a week. Been coming here since I was 13. Favorite place for tacos"}
{"text":"Good place for lunch. The street tacos are a buck each and there are several different types of meat. El pastor and carnitas are delicious. Apparently there are a few different cooks and when you get the grilled tortillas, you are in for some good food."}
{"text":"So my friend and I stumbled upon this place on our way to Barb's bakery but WOW I have never had a better taco in my life. The carne asada street tacos are freaking amazing. They also have the bottled cokes from mexico that for some reason taste sweeter than cokes bottled here. The waitress was also extremely friendly when we were checking out we asked how to pronounce the name of the restaurant and she started teaching us some Spanish."}
{"text":"Whenever we are in Phoenix to visit relatives we must stop in, usually on our way north from the airport.  The neighborhood holds childhood memories for us.  Disclaimer: We go to restaurants for the food, not the decor.  I've tried a number of different things here over the years and never been disappointed (love the sopes), and it's clean and very welcoming.  Everything tastes fresh and homemade with love."}
{"text":"Terrible Meal!!!! Me And My Girl Had The Huaraches. Traditional Mexican Confort Food. First Off The Huarache Is Supposed To Be Fried, It Wasn't. Second The Meat Is Supposed To Be Suculently Delicious It Wasn't, For The Amount Of Time It Took To Cook, It Should Have. Third Is You Have To Pay Per Drink. The Drinks They Have For Sale Are Not Very Big What Ever They May Be, Water, Soda Or Haguas Frescas Like The Horchata. Fourth Service Was Mediocre And Last We Got Overcharged Even With The 20% Discount This App Offers. NEVER GOING BACK!!!!!"}
{"text":"I love Mexico City, and good tacos are hard to come by here in the states. The al pastor was really good, and I will definitely be coming back for the tacos! 

They had some of the best horchata I've had in Phoenix, make sure you try it. I ordered the huarache, but was not too impressed. It was a little bland for being a specialty item. If you've ever eaten a huarache in DF, you might be disappointed in that dish. Overall, this place was great and I will be back again."}
{"text":"Pricier than your standard Mexican comfort food place, but still on the cheaper side.  Burritoes come with a little salad and rice.  I had the best bean and cheese burrito of my life here.  And, they serve coke in glass bottles, from Mexico!

Definitely recommended if you are in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Have eaten here many times. the most recent visit was just last nite. myself and two friends, we were warmly greeted. Our drink order taken and without hesitation fresh totopos(corn chips) and two fresh salsas were brought to our table. Their salsas are always very good,.flavourful with a good amount of kick and not overly salty. one friend ordered chicken tacos with rice and beans, the other ordered steak burro with a side of beans, I ordered bean sopes..two of us ordered jaimiaca  for  beverages.my friend says his chicken tacos were fine, but that they were smaller then usual and that the amount of rice and beans on his plate was also small. my friend said his steak burro was very good. just that it was lacking any thing interesting. their was only meat in the burro no tomatoes no onions said it tasted good it could have had some thing else. my sopes were very good but on the small side. this place gets a extra star from me because they always grill my sopes instead of frying them and not all restaurants will do that. I must say this time the sopes were smaller and they did not have much beans on them in fact they didn't put much on them at all. usually they are topped with beans lettuce oinons and shredded cheese this time it was just a small  amount of beans, and just a tiny amount of lettuce. I also orderd chillis torreados with onions. the chillis  are always perfect here they don't over cook them. the onions on the other hand are always very oily and over cooked. Over all I like this place and would recommend.  the fact that they have sopes and huaraches. Because if you look most Mexican restaurants don't have sopes, gorditas or huaraches. At least on my local restaurant search. their are just a handful of restaurants that offer this on the menu. 

The staff here is always accommodating and friendly.  the price is average and just about what you would pay at any other Mexican restaurant. 

have yet to find...... Does anybody know a good Mexican restaurant that makes the corn tortillas fresh daily, and a big plus if they make them by hand .  just the best so delicious, theirs nothing better."}
{"text":"Disappointing. I've been to lots of taquerias in Mexico, St. Louis and California, and this one was way below average. As much as I like authentic Mexican food, I'd prefer a big chain over this place. Not recommended."}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times and am overdue on writing a review. GREAT tacos but all the food I've had here is delicious. 
It looks like a little hole in the wall but you'll be happy to dive in"}
{"text":"Came to this restaurant a few months ago for the first time me and my cousin were eating there I ordered 5 pastor tacos. Overall pretty good but they didn't give me red and green salsa only the chip salsa that you get when you're waiting for your actual food to arrive. Anyway I told my wife about the place so we ended up getting it but pick up this time I got the same thing my wife got a burrito this time my tacos had almost no meat compared to the first time where they were packed and my wife's burrito was so skinny it was pathetic my advice is to just eat at the place avoid takeout."}
{"text":"Ordene Los chilaquiles rojos y me dieron una cochinada. La mesera no  saven como tratar a las personas"}
{"text":"Excellent tacos.  Tacos here are small but only .99$ so try a bunch.  Service is super friendly and fast."}
{"text":"I jumped in for a quick bite to eat. Quick and easy. The sauces were hot (a little too hot for me, but hey I am white) but good.

Would definitely come back. Felt authentic as well. +5"}
{"text":"Stumbled into this Establishment as motel hotel was nearby and I did not want the standard fast food joints.

I had there tacos. They are like street Tacos at $1.25 each. They were absolutely delicious. I ordered a couple more after my first four. So good.

Just the basics on the inside, nothing special but nothing needed to be either. 

The waitress was very attentive during the entire time.

Go enjoy this place."}
{"text":"Wanted to check this place out.   They have hours posted as closing at 8 pm.   
Lights are out.  No Bueno"}
{"text":"It bothers me to see that someone reviewed this Mexican food spot and claimed that the rice has no flavor.  Totally false.  For authentic Mexican rice, it's on point.  You want 30 ingredients in your rice like Chilis, go to Chilis.

If you want straight-forward, great tasting Mexican food, you go to El Nopalito.  I had the dorado chicken tacos (fried corn tortilla to make hard shell tacos) rice, beans, salsa and paid under $7.  The tacos were perfectly crispy, simple flavor in the chicken and topped with a shredded lettuce/tomato salad with quest freso and drizzled sour cream.  Just like my mama would serve it.  The food is always consistently good, prices are right, and the ladies are always so hospitable.  It is an easy go-to for me, when I'm missing my mama's rice and beans.

The place is small, but it was full of taco lovers of all kinds.  All I've enjoyed my 4 visits at El Nopalito were the street tacos & dorados - I'll try the enchiladas on the next run."}
{"text":"I've been to Nopalito several times.  The food is okay.  The price on the burritos went up a buck to 4.99 for lunch specials.  They have cleaned up the look of the place a bit from when I first started going.  They have a couple flat screens and decent looking paint on the walls.  Some of the times I've went the food wasn't fresh and tasted like it had been recooked a couple times.  Still for a buck a taco it is not bad but does leave some to be desired with the quality.  

I will probably be back again sometime but not anytime soon.  I hope the quality gets better and fresher."}
{"text":"Super low prices for yummy, authentic food. Nice servers. The only downside is the less than lovely location in a blah stripmall, but it also kind of adds to the charm of this place."}
{"text":"Everything is made from scratch  Salsa, tortillas all the meats!! This women put her heart and soul into every dish ..The place doesn't look like much from the outside... So stop in you'll be glad you did... Real Mexico city style.
Don't forget the street tacos maybe the Best in town"}
{"text":"Just finished my lunch (chicharron gordita/1 carne asada and 1 pastor taco), it was yummy yummy. You know it's good if an older person is in the back cooking. Definitely going back"}
{"text":"I am debating  between 3 and 4 stars for El Nopalito.  I think it settles perfectly on 3.5 at least for right now.  

The Good:
* The tacos were very good - whether they warrant the prestigious New Times best of PHX?  I have to disagree on that.
* Service was quick, our food came fast and it was fairly busy at the time.
* Their menu has an English side for those who are less adept at differing Sopas and Sopes.
* It's CHEAP!  Two very full people left only spending a total of ten bucks.
* The salsa was SPICY.  Sometimes it seems to be tough to find places that take the risk of offending people with sensitive taste buds.

The Meh:
* Maybe it was just b/c it was Sunday, but our server didn't really seem happy that we, nor she, were in El Nopalito
* They may have been the smallest tacos I've ever had.  That being said, they were only a buck.
* El Nopalito is located so close to so many great restaurants that it'll be tough to justify skipping some of those.
* The chips for the salsa were lackluster at best.

Overall I had a good experience.  I think the description of the three-star review as being \"A-OK\" is perfect for El Nopalito.  I'd return, but there are a few spots that I would have to give my return business to first!"}
{"text":"Holy crap this place is good!
So good, it may have taken my new #1 spot (in my heart) for my favorite Mexican Food Place. 

Pros:
- Spicy is actually really spicy. 
- Food is really good!
- Service is very good too.

Already making plans to come back..."}
{"text":"Tacos were tasty, but very small. I'm used to LA tacos, where 3 tacos is a decent meal so we ordered 15 tacos for 5 people assuming that would we be enough. But 2 bites and the taco is gone. We would need to have ordered 25-30. Not the best value."}
{"text":"Who wouldn't want to try a restaurant that has been designated Best of Phoenix for tacos by the Phoenix New Times, with tacos that cost only 99 cents each? I came to this small restaurant one mid-afternoon to sample four of their taco offerings: pastor, asada, longanisa, and carnitas. A complimentary small basket of tortilla chips and two bowls of salsa (red and green) preceded my sampling, and these were pretty generic. The tacos were tasty but a bit on the dry side, except for the moist carnitas. I washed these down with iced horchata; it was mild and pleasant. Not spectacular, but not a bad meal either, and all for only $6.50. I'd definitely come here again if I'm in a taco mood and find myself in the area."}
{"text":"best all around tacos i've had in a while.  firstly the ingredients are fresh fresh.  secondly they are really tasty.  and lastly its just a buck for a one of em.

i'm usualy a fan of carnita but they really make a good al pastor here.

some of the best mole sauce i've ever had anywhere.  very well rounded flavor - almost like an indian curry dish.

just one complaint - if they call the place nopalito they should be serving nopal.  and why dont they have tamales?"}
{"text":"Green burrito enchilada style   yum, intriguing flaver but delicious,will be returning in spite of tacky plastic plates and  bland chips."}
{"text":"so heads up on this place - it is TRULY a hole in the wall....stuck in a small strip mall, it doesn't look like much of anything.

But OH man is it good and authentic.  Their tacos are divine!  Microscopic, but divine.  Their mole is in the top two in the US.   Their chips weren't as fresh as I'd have liked, but their homemade salsa actually had kick (something that restaurants in the Bay Area are afraid of....it's almost like being in Utah sometimes) (ok, vague....anyone who's had salsa in UT will get that).

Their beer is cold. Their service is friendly.  A definite thumbs up, and a definite fan."}
{"text":"I have to agree with Dan in saying that the staff didn't seem too excited to be here on the weekend. I came in on a Saturday for a quick lunch before running errands and I was pretty excited after the rave reviews that I read. Unfortunately, as soon as I was seated and started munching on the chips, I was disappointed. They were bland and a bit cold. I didn't let that totally bash my excitement though; I just salted them a little and enjoyed. The salsas were interesting; they were very fresh tasting, but lacked any sort of explosive flavor that I was expecting (The red is much better than the green). With the bland chips, it wasn't much of a pairing, but with the salted chips, I was pleased. 

For lunch I ordered an al pastor burrito and a barbacoa sope. The burrito was awesome! I actually really liked that it wasn't huge. What it lacked in size, it made up for in flavor. The barbacoa on the other hand, wasn't as good. On the menu it says that barbacoa is only served on Saturday and Sunday. This is apparently because El Napolito's barbacoa is made with lamb. I've had plenty of barbacoa before and I was expecting to be blown away...especially after having some great al pastor, but I wasn't. The meat was really gamy, like really gamy. Salsa and a little salt were needed to make my sope enjoyable, and that was a shame.

I would return to El Napolito, but there are loads of great little Mexican places in the area that I'll be stopping by first."}
{"text":"One of if not the best torta Cubana in town. For a little coin it's almost to much food to finish."}
{"text":"The beans were really good, the rice had no flavor and  my red chili burrito was alright. I looked up the menu online and when I got to the restaurant is was over charged about 4 bucks. When I asked the lady why so much she responded with \"we changed the prices\" I let her know that the online menu was showing something different. She said \"well our in store menu is updated\". I won't be going back. she should've honed what I seen online... the burrito wasn't big so it's definitely not worth 8 bucks"}
{"text":"Incredibly disappointed in this place. After a few recommendations, we decided to try it for take out. We wanted a good variety of foods, so we ordered cheese enmoladas, a gordita, a chile relleno combo, a pastor burrito combo, chilaquiles verdes and a pambazo. All of this food for us to share and the best part of it was the salsa, which they happened to charge us for. 

The cheese enmoladas were stuffed with a dry, flavorless shredded chicken. The gordita wasn't too horrible, but was definitely understuffed. The chile relleno seemed as if it was stuffed a few days prior. The cheese had a brownish color and was slimy with a gritty texture when rubbed between the fingers. The pastor burrito was very small, understuffed and was served on a cold tortilla. The tortilla was actually still ice cold on the bottom of the burrito by the time we got home, so the filling must have not been very hot either. 
Chilaquiles verdes were a complete joke. It was seriously a handful of chips, a small spoonful of green salsa and a tiny sprinkling of cheese. It did come with some sort of a pollo asado on top, which is unique and it was flavorful, but it was very old and dry. It is served with just beans and some iceberg lettuce, but for $8, this is no bueno. Something also caused the bottom of the container to melt, so I had to transfer it to another plate, but I still found pieces of styrofoam in my food. The pambazo was flavorful and pretty decent. The filling (chorizo and potatoes) had some sort of a bitterness to it. I think maybe the potatoes or chorizo were burnt, but it was one of the better dishes. The combos were also served with rice and beans. The rice was old and hard. I'm certain that it had been out the entire day. The beans served on all of our dishes were entirely inedible. They had a really funky sour taste, so they were either spoiled or just plain bad. Either way, discarded all of them. The salsa that we were given and charged for was really great! It was a red salsa and tasted like it was homemade. 

We did order 30 minutes prior to closing, so we figured that a lot of the issues were due to the late order, but the food was really unacceptable. If they didn't have quality food to serve or it was ready to be thrown out, just tell us that you're not longer taking orders. It really sucks to pay for something and then have to discard at least a 1/3 of it. After all of this, we would still try El Nopalito again because of people's recommendations, but only if someone else was paying. Not happy."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I love tacos. I eat lots of tacos. When I get hungry one of the first things to cross my mind is tacos. That said, I love El Nopalito for their tacos. I'm pretty picky about my tacos. I don't really like dumb-ass flour tortillas, dry tacos, unseasoned meat in a taco, taco bell is not tacos, the list goes on. I prefer authentic Mexican street tacos.

That being said, El Nopalito is the one place in town I feel like I am getting the most authentic street taco that I have been able to find in Phoenix. The only reason I am not here more often is the commute is a bit much as I live in the East Valley.  However, if I am anywhere near the area it is almost mandatory to stop and have at least a taco or two. I recommend trying all of the tacos though my favourite has to be the cabeza (it sounds creepy but is buttery and delicious).

It does help if you speak Spanish as it will make ordering and asking any questions you may have easier."}
{"text":"Napolitos is awesome, and one of my most frequented dining places.  They have a chicken mole plate here that I'm just addicted to (the mole enchiladas are good too).  The Tortas were also awesome in the past, but I'm gluten free these days, and the Mole dishes with corn tortillas hit the gluten free mark for me.

The place is small, and in a pretty basic strip mall, but they've done some remodeling / refreshing lately, and it is nice and comfortable for us.  Not fancy, but plenty comfortable. 

I'll agree with other reviewers, the chips aren't the most awesome, but the salsas are plenty good, and the staff knows me well, and are always highly attentive and pretty proficient.

Bottom line, this isn't a fancy outing for me, but I love this place, and it will never fall off my list of regular dining venues.  At least once a week I'm there!"}
{"text":"This is authentic Mexican food. Do authentic the menus was in Spanish. Had to ask for a translation to order. No fountain drinks. $2.50 for a small bottle of soda. Not coming back."}
{"text":"New in town from San Diego, I've struggled to find \"hole in the wall\" mexican places in Phoenix...or at least in Scottsdale where I live.  Luckily I found El Napalito near my work.   This place was great, very authentic Mexican.  The 99 cent \"chili rojo\" beef taco I got was small, like the \"street tacos\" you get in Mexico, but very very good (and only 99 cents).  Three of these on an elaborately decorated plate in a Scottsdale restaurant would be 13 - 16 bucks.  And the al pastor burrito was very good.  The burrito was also authentic mexican...on the small side, no frills, just meat and sauce, but only $3.99 and it came with rice and beans on the side.  The food alone would probably deserve a four star rating (the taco was better than the burrito), but considering I sat down, was given free chips and salsa, had a taco and burrito with rice and beans for a total of $5.44 (with tax), five stars it is."}
{"text":"I think I'm addicted.  It's got three awesome attributes: it's authentic, it's good, and it's cheap.  99 cent street tacos and the 2.99 gordito are amazing.  It looks like a greasy spoon outside, but inside this small joint is clean and friendly.   I've now gone back 4 times in the past 4 weeks."}
{"text":"This is fantastic!   Very simple,  great recipes and wonderful.   You'll swear you are in old Mexico.   Ceviche and small tacos was great!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite Mexican spots. They give chips and salsa with red and green salsa!! I normally get horchata which is like any other horchata. Kind of a limited drink selection with bottled soda. I normally get the Mole the first time I went it was good but lately it's been kind of skimpy piece of chicken and brothy mole sauce so I decided to try the Cubana Torta usually comes with fries but the beans are my favorite thing about this place so went for the beans and rice instead. They normally give me a plate of rice and beans for my little one as well without asking I think is nice. Place is always filled with it's regulars, everyone is always happy and smiling too. Def is a nice hole in the wall. Don't let the outside discourage you. Street tacos are good! Chicken well and marinaded as well."}
{"text":"I stopped in here during a lunch break at a nearby work conference. It was 10am and I was jonesing for a breakfast burrito. The atmosphere is nothing fancy but it was clean. The lady at the counter was very nice. I ordered a breakfast burrito without meat. It took a little longer than I thought it would, but they make everything super fresh. The potatoes in the burrito tasted freshly cut. The burrito itself was scrumptious and hit the spot, even though it was just a little greasy. If I lived closer I would definitely return for a hangover burrito. ;)"}
{"text":"Wow!  What a find!  My good friend Rob was to drunk to drive after 5 free rum and cokes from the Embassy Suites Managers Reception...we used Yelp and found this place.  It was 0.1 miles from the hotel.  The food rocked!  Carne Asada, Guac, Beer and Flan...this is living!  Rob upset me though by eating my last bite of Chicken Encihlada...jerk!!!  That was so uncool!  I now have trust issues with Rob! If you are looking for good cheap Mexican and staying at the Embassy Suites this is the place to eat!"}
{"text":"My husband had been craving tacos. Cheapie little street tacos that remind us of California. We've lived in Arizona 6 years, and never found any that really hit the spot...till now. I found El Nopalito on yelp, less than a mile from my work. Husband met me for \"linner\" on a Thursday, and the place was empty. We ordered tacos al pastor, tacos de cabeza (for the hubby), a burrito al pastor, rice and beans. Our server told us the al pastor is the most popular, and I can see why. I liked it better in the burrito than in the taco, maybe because you get more flavor from a big bite of just the meat. Husband loved the tacos de cabeza. He said they remind him so much of the ones he used to get from a street vendor in his parents' hometown in Mexico. Rice and beans were great as well. The salsas were good (I like the green more), but the chips were meh. We will definitely be back, to try the rest of the menu. Our server was telling my husband about their huaraches in Spanish. I barely speak any Spanish, but I know that's what I want to try next time!"}
{"text":"Nopalito is a great little taco shop that is cheap cheap cheap. The chips and salsa are AMAZING, quite possibly best in the valley. Mehi cokes are also muy delicioso.

But for a taco shop that is based solely on it's meat, Nopalito falls a bit short. This place is super authentic and their burritos are a tortilla filled with meat and.....meat. Beans and rice on the side. Super authentic sure, but not so great if the meat in the burrito, or the taco for that matter, isn't the greatest. If Nopa invested a bit more time into their preparation, and the meat they served was better, this place would easily be 5 stars.

I will however, eat here again."}
{"text":"Let me tell you a story about a time i went down to Mexico... eh maybe not... not appropriate for yelp

But let me do tell you about taking a venture through Mexico right here in phoenix. I love and I mean I LOVE tacos. I enjoyed lunch here today with some coworkers and had the al pastor burrito and al pastor tacos. Holly goodness batman!! 

Tacos are like right from the streets of Mexico, they are delicious! The al pastor was awesome flavor and really good. The burrito was also very good, the handmade light flour tortilla was perfect. 

The only problem? 
I couldnt eat more...

I will definitely be back and

My search for a great taco has come to end end"}
{"text":"Very inexpensive and tasty, but very TINY tacos al pastor. I mean hobbit-baby sized. Think if White Castle made tacos.  

They were good at least. Everything else was bland; particularly the not-at-all spicy salsa. My Mexican associate gave it a 5 out of 10 for taste and authenticity. Not being Mexican, I can't speak to authenticity, but I can say I don't like boring food, no matter if it's authentic."}
{"text":"No. Just... NO.

I was in a hurry and remembered something about el Nopalito having 99 cent tacos. Awesome! No. Horrible. Epically horrible.

My server was sweet, but as I was waiting for my food, I couldn't help but notice a sour smell. I couldn't figure out where it was coming from, so I thought, oh, maybe it's the guy at the next table. As I munched on the free chips and salsa (yay!) I noticed they both tasted odd. Not like they were going to make me sick, but just.. something was off about them. The red salsa literally tasted like tamarind (love tamarind, but not in my salsa) and the green salsa had an almost cheesy flavor (like cotija).

And then came my tacos. 99 cents each. They were so bad, I couldn't even force myself to finish them. The asada was in big, tough pieces. Pastor was literally chunks of ground pork. Green chile beef was practically inedible. The seasoning was so off on everything, and the salsas they provided just made it worse. As I was trying to choke it down anyway, I noticed a sour smell coming off the plate my tacos were on. Nah, it couldn't be, I thought. Then I smelled the plate. OMFG. No... No... I can't. 

Never again. Spare yourself. It's not worth it, even for 99 cent tacos!"}
{"text":"While my friends were in Rocky Point for spring break (yes, this still happens after college), me and my man were having some serious taco stand cravings.  There's this place I have been meaning to try forever, I tell him.  As soon as I said \"Hole in the wall mex joint\" he was enthusiastically driving in their direction.  As soon as we stepped in and we were the only gringos in there, I knew we were in for a treat.  The senoras who were working were so sweet to us, brought us out the complimentary chips and salsa, and guided us on what tacos were the best.  We each got 3 different ones to try, and my favorite that day was the cabeza (who would have thought!).  After an order of guac, 2 drinks, I was almost embarrassed that the bill was so cheap - like I was getting away with some kind of crime by not paying more.  It was more than reasonable.  

The man was so impressed that he went back the following weekend to surprise me with takeout breakfast in bed.  The senoras recognized him and made him feel so welcome and special.  On weekends, they serve this lamb soup, in fact I saw a few familias feasting on the soup the prior weekend, and she sat him down and gave him a hefty sampling complete with all the fixings on the side, along with chips and salsa while he waited for his takeout order.  He brought me chilaquiles which were awesome, and he had a breakfast burrito which was not as fat as your typical drive by, but I thought that the ingredients tasted fresher.  Either way, this has become a place in the rotation for sure."}
{"text":"Boy am I glad I went here!

Don't let the modest store front fool you. Not only was the feel inside the seven-table dining room intimate, but it also made you feel like a local who was in-the know. It's one of those places that feels like a hidden secret from the never ending rush of the city. 

Our waitress was very sweet and greeted us promptly as we entered through the glass door. We sat right up front, and were brought simple paper menus displaying the myriad of authentic Mexican dishes available at El Napolito. The highly affordable, and seemingly endless choices between 'a-la carte' tacos and burritos, and combination dishes could be smelt cooking in the tucked away kitchen as we perused the menu. 

We started with something to drink. I ordered the Apple Soda which is imported from Mexico and was absolutely AMAZING. I wasn't in the mood for an alcoholic beverage, but there was a variety of  bottled beers that I could see in the stand up cooler behind the cash-wrap for those wishing to imbibe. 

I ordered the Rolled Taco combination plate. I had three rolled tacos (basically chimichangas). They were filled with shredded chicken and deep-fried, then covered with cheese sauce, and lettuce. Rice and re-fried beans were served as sides, and a slice of avocado was the garnish. It was an amazing, authentic meal for a truly outstanding price. 

The waitress was very attentive throughout our whole meal, and made us feel as if we were in her family kitchen. 

I would recommend this place to anyone and everyone. Truly a five star experience!"}
{"text":"Really good 99 cent street size tacos.  The chicken nachos were amazing!  Cannot wait to go back :)"}
{"text":"I love this place. I've traveled throughout Mexico quite a bit and can say these are the most authentic tacos I've had in Phoenix.  You can even order a michelada. 
Yum yum yum."}
{"text":"Not sure what changed. Oh yes I do know what changed. The nice lady who used to greet me every time I came through the door at El Napalito  is no longer there. Clearly she was the center of what made this a great place. 30 minutes to get all of our food to the table. The food was OK but unfortunately when it's cold because you waited to eat with the rest of your family it takes a lot away from it. Perhaps they'll get over it. Perhaps not!"}
{"text":"This has to be one of the BEST Mexican places in Phoenix.  The service is excellent and the food is awesome!"}
{"text":"This place had a few awards/articles about how they were the best Mexican food around.  All of them were from 2006-2007.  I think they may be when the meat was from as well.  I ordered a the tacos and the first few bites were pretty good.  Then I got a bite of grizzle.  I spit it out (it's impossible to eat unless you are a dog maybe) and decided it was a fluke and kept eating.  After about the 4th bite of grizzle, I decided this place sucked and I would never eat here again.  Too bad, I think they have a good cook, but need to use higher quality meats.  Also wouldn't hurt to move into a nicer facility if you're going to continue with the upgrades.  Although I really wouldnt' have cared about the decor if the food was edible."}
{"text":"First of all, the poor woman the owner has at the front desk is so old she can barely move. 
I stood there for almost ten minutes, in front of the register before someone said anything to me.
Their prices are ridiculous for the portion sizes I was seeing.
I asked the woman if I could have chicken put in a reano and she proceeded to scoff at me and that's where it all started.
She (I'm assuming she is the owner) was beyond rude.
The reano is 7.99 and she wanted to charge me 14 dollars to have the reano and a side of chicken .
I walked out.
Not only were they rude but their service is HORRIBLE."}
