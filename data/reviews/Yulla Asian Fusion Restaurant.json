{"text":"Unfortunately shut down now.  I really wanted to like this restaurant, but I found many oddities about it. The lunch specials were quite expensive at over $10. I had a roll special for $10 - the spicy salmon was quite odd, they used sriracha sauce on top, and nothing really memorable. I remember they also charged for green tea.  Not really satisfying, I don't think I would return."}
{"text":"If I going to rate Yulla on the food I had this evening.... I would give this place a 2 star or less and recommend people never to go! But I know it is a little unfair.. as I didn't have any cooked food at all, all I had was some sushi.....   Sushi & Maki Platter ($14.99) with Miso Soup and Salad  - Shari rice was bland  - Fish was not fresh and the selections was boring with half of it being Salmon  - Miso Soup was super salty, I could not even drink that!   Decoration is nice with high ceiling.. At late night this place probably changed to a lounge or something as there are tons of tables at the back and a piano set up with a mic stand.   Aside from sushi, there are some cooked Korean/Indian/Japanese dishes. Lunch Specials are not cheap, they are $10 and up for most of the bento boxes...   I would suggest stay away from their sushi as their quality is in line with AYCE quality.. maybe try ordering the hot dishes instead!"}
{"text":"Excellent Asian fusion (Japanese -Korean ) restaurant located just south of the Bay store on Richmond. Small menu - all dishes are well executed  and excellent service. Reasonably priced, Yulla is definitely worth a visit (or two...). It has become our neighbourhood favourite."}
