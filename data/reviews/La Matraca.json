{"text":"It sucks , the meat is full of fat , and it is expensive for what they offer. I do not recommend at all."}
{"text":"The guy kept us waiting by the door for more than 10min, just to clean a table for two people... on a half-empty restaurant.

We inquired about the status of the table in French. He didn't even looked at us. Tried again in English later... same... tried Spanish; nada. He just totally ignored us.

We ended up going somewhere else for pasta. Bummer, since I really wanted to try this place :-("}
{"text":"Pretty expensive I cannot believe that they even charge for a pice of lemon, the tacos are really small maybe the half than other Mexican restaurants and the prices are twice more expensive, the quality not that bad but still expensive for what you get. I Never come-back at least you don't know an other Mexican restaurant or \" taqueria\" but there is a Lot much better in Montreal"}
{"text":"Super tacos, staff sympa, bien situé :-)"}
{"text":"The place isn't fancy, but there's nothing fancy about tacos anyways.. and that's exactly what you want. Tortilla, meat, cheese, hot sauce and the proper eating position so that you don't need to be breaking out a Tide-to-go stick in the middle of a taqueria. Prices are reasonable, so it'll be easy for you to try at least a few items on the menu."}
{"text":"These are the best tacos I have ever eaten.  I'm not kidding.  The pastor and suadero are my favorites, but nothing beats the flautitas.  Great people who work there too.  We don't leave close enough to go as often as we would like."}
{"text":"I was really happy as I realized that this restaurant actually served real tacos al pastor!! I've been here a few times and have tried a few things and everything tastes like Mexico. While I've never had any problems with the service some of my friends, to whom I recommended this restaurant to, have and that disappointed me a bit."}
{"text":"Su-per De-lish-ish! I went to this place with some friends with no expectations and was really happy! I really don't know much about Mexican food so my descriptions are for the lay-men to this cuisine... they make this little tacos and mine had chorizo in it - how can you go wrong?! Also, I got horchata which I had only known about because vampire weekend makes catchy songs and it was also very good - think eggnog for the vegan (it is actually a rice-based milk drink with cinnamon and things!). Anyway, I will definitely go back!! The tacos are supah cheap and it is the type of restaurant where you can say \"give me one of everything!\" and actually afford it!"}
{"text":"The tacos here are amazing. Especially the campechano and suadero. The choriqueso is also one of my favourites. My husband and I have been coming here for the last 3-4 years. The staff is friendly and we haven't had any issues at all. I don't really consider this place a 'restaurant' it is more of a Mexican fast food, taqueria. 

If you tend to eat a lot, the prices can really add up and it's a bit expensive but for more conservative eaters it is pretty affordable!"}
{"text":"Having grown up in Southern California, I'm a bit of a Mexican food snob, to put it lightly. I had been trying to find good, \"authentic\" Mexican food in Montreal during the three years I've been living here, with little luck, until I finally found La Metraca while wandering along St. Denis. I began to get my hopes up after reading the menu (which was actually in Spanish!), and the food did not disappoint! Absolutely delicious tacos, and I'm dying to go back.

The service was a bit slow, but the terrace outside was packed with people. Still gets my 5 stars. This place definitely deserves a higher yelp rating than it currently has."}
{"text":"La Matraca est la plus authentique taqueria à Montréal pour manger des tacos à un prix abordable, tout simplement délicieux. :)"}
{"text":"Hubby and I really like this place but are aware that it might not be everyone's cup of tea. Sure prices seem reasonable (one taco for ~$2-3? Pile them on!) but I can easily eat 5 tacos and that's before I venture into the appetizers and sandwich territory. We don't order drinks and we have yet to eat there for less than $45 for two people. It's tricky because you feel like you should be paying half that price for food and atmosphere that's basically fast-food, but there are not a lot of Mexican-style taco (soft shell, not hard shell) options around here so you take what you can get. 

We've probably tried all the taco varieties and usually get a bunch of those (~10? can't go wrong with any of them, although personally I'm a fan of the pastor, and hubby loves the chorizo) plus a torta and appetizer to split, and we need to be rolled out the door when we're done."}
{"text":"Reasonably-priced a la carte Mexican.  Decent little terrace.  Weak selection of vegetarian.  Be prepared for a massive dose of cheese."}
{"text":"If you're looking for authentic Mexican food at a great price, this is the place! Awesome."}
{"text":"Not many mexican restaurants here in the neighborhood, finally found one nearby and gave it a try. We like the place very much. Tacos are small but delicious at great price I could easily eat 10 of them myself. They serve tacos with homemade sauce (3 kinds) and they taste very authentic. Even their sandwiches are great. Take a sip of mexican beer and a bite of beef taco, it will send you to heaven."}
{"text":"La Matraca is a good place casual place to grab some Mexican soft shell tacos for lunch or dinner.  With higher quality and authentic ingredients, you're also going to pay a bit more than a standard fast food taco spot.  4 medium sized tacos and a beer will set you back in the neighborhood of $16.

On my trips to La Matraca I stick to the carnitas tacos with cheese and haven't been disappointed.  The variety of salsas served with the meal add some great flavors to the meal.

If you're looking for tortilla chips, nachos, salsa, or guacamole, you've come to the wrong place.  La Matraca takes pride in their authenticity.

The waitstaff is helpful and kind.  Be sure to calculate your bill and ask for a printed receipt.  I've had an issue a couple of time where they were $5-7 off on my order.  It's enough of an annoyance that I bumped them down from 4 to 3 stars.  

Even with that issue, if  I'm in the mood for taco, La Matraca is the place in the neighborhood to get my fix."}
{"text":"Très sympathique comme endroit. J'y suis allé à quelques reprises voir des matchs du Mexique pendant la Coupe du monde - super ambiance, rempli à craquer très tôt et c'est chaleureux. J'y suis aussi allé en soirée avant de sortir pour manger des délicieux petits tacos bien épicés. Les serveuses sont gentilles et suffisamment patientes pour me laisser pratiquer mon espagnol qui mélange encore les temps de verbe et hésite parfois dans sa syntaxe approximative. J'aime particulièrement deux trucs de cet endroit : 
1) les tacos sont plus \" vrais \", plus typiques, si on veut, moins américanisés que ce qu'on goûte dans les chaînes connues ; 
2) les petits dessins expliquant comment manger un taco avec classe sont très drôles et bien faits.

Bref, ça vaut le coup de l'essayer et d'y retourner assez régulièrement."}
{"text":"I glad that my friend recommended me this place! otherwise i will forget. The place is not fancy and it is not a tex-mex restaurant. The tacos are very good. My favorite is al pastor! Even my sister and my so love the al pastor. I read some review that the tacos are small. I don't know what the size usually is, but for me it was good size and good portion. I ate an entree and 7 tacos and i was full. The price is not expensive, very reasonably. The service is a bit slow, like one server, but she is friendly. Expect no guacamole, no sour cream and no margarita because usually? taqueria don't have these. And more important, it is cash only."}
{"text":"Good olace, good tacos, a bit over price for what you get but stil afordable, the service is ok, but sucks that they dont accept any debit or credit cards, Also the food took really long time to come out even there was only 3 tables by the time we were there."}
{"text":"The most authentic Mexican place in town. Hands down. 

You won't find valet, table cloths, D-D waitresses, or champagne here. Instead, you will find some very authentic mexican tacos with good queso, pasztor, and all other goodies. 

Drinks are simple. You get your standard Mexican Jumex, Jarritos, and other Mexican drinks as well as some Mexican beers. 

Food is great. All tacos are awesome. Pasztor is properly done. La Gringa deserves special mention. La Matraca sandwich is mind-blowing. Especially combined with one of their 3 signature sauces (which I literally spooned). 

Their terrace is not bad, however it is facing busy St. Denis. Good for watching your car not to get a ticket. Bad to relax. Oh, and they should definitely throw out those disgustingly uncomfortable wooden terrace chairs. 

All in all - great mexican food, cheap, and authentic. I understand it is hard for Mexicans to get to Montreal (2 borders to cross is much harder than 1). Finally some arrived ;-)"}
{"text":"I went to La Matraca with my friends who are from Mexico. They told me that this was the way Mexican food is in Mexico and I was NOT disappointed! I was delicious and not expensive. It is a fast-food kind of place, so not a very fancy place, but it was perfect for a casual dining experience!"}
{"text":"I was referred here by a Mexican guy that swore the flavors of this restaurant are exactly like home and since I'm not from there I'll have to take his word. 
On the plus side ..
Great selection, friendly staff , quick service and great taste. 
On the minus side (like many latin restos)..decor..decor..decor but they DO have a great terrasse to enjoy the good meal"}
{"text":"I had SUCH high hopes for this place. Just moved here from the states and so far have not found good, authentic Mexican food in Montreal. La Matraca was suggested to me so I tried it out. No salsa? No chips and salsa? And the tacos were sub-par. All the flavors were off and the quality of the beef was poor- fatty and chewy."}
{"text":"I clearly missed something when I went to La Matraca over the past weekend..

The menu was very affordable and the place was packed which is always a great sight! 
After looking over the menu, I asked about chicken, not available - ok. Next, I asked for some gauc, and again - no. I said can you bring some avocado and she said ok definitely can be done - awesome! They charge for cilantro.. which is just ODD!

I got barely quarter of an avocado for $1.25?!?!?! Are you actually serious??

The food was kind of mediocre, felt much to be desired AND I was still hungry afterwards."}
{"text":"Truly an authentic Mexican restaurant the service was fast and attentive and you can watch as the chefs prepare and cook your meal,the place was very clean and homey as well,we tried a selection of tacos,gringas,Mexican sandwich,and two entrees,the waitress brought three sauces to add,a hot,medium,and green sauce(not guacamole)"}
{"text":"Très bonne bouffe les tacos traditionnel son bien fait avec les sauces qui accompagne . Adore les petites entrées les flautas et le guacamole. Je n'ai pas gouter les tortas mais la portions est énorme. À chaque fois que je vais à la matraca je commande un peu de tout et ressort remplie à souhait, les portions on l'air petites mais ce n'est qu'une illusion. Je recommande les tacos al pastor mes préfere et mon go-to meal pour chaque restaurant mexicain que j'essaye."}
{"text":"This is an authentic mexican restaurant not a Carlos and Pepe !

The tacos here are really good, there's nothing fancy here but the food is like you're eating in Mexico (i asked the 2 mexicans friends that were with me and they agree !).

I suggest you eat there at least once and see if you like it, as for me it was good but i won't eat there every week !


Français : 

La matraca est un restaurant mexicain authentique et pas un Carlos and Pepe !

Les Tacos ici sont très bon, tout est simple dans ce restaurant et la nourriture est identique à ce  que vous pourriez manger au Mexique ( j'ai demandé à 2 amis mexicains qui étaient avec moi, et ils sont d'accord avec ça !).

Je suggère que vous mangiez ici au moins une fois afin de voir si ça vous convient, pour ma part c'était bon mais je ne mangerais pas ici chaque semaine !"}
{"text":"Nice Mexican food, I liked it. Reasonable price. They say they want to be as close as possible to a Mexican taqueria, so there are no chips with guac or salsa, which are not traditional Mexican. The ambiance is very casual; would be nice if it were just a bit fancier. Service was pretty good. They charged us too much at first but my husband noticed so they recomputed and gave us the correct amount of change afterwards."}
{"text":"The most authentic tacos and tortas I've had in Montreal! If you have a craving for delicious Mexican food at reasonable prices, this is the place to come. Does not compare with all Those Tex-Mex restaurants wanna be!"}
{"text":"I've never been much fan of tacos but this place made me love tacos! I tried their pasteur and loved it. The meats in it are super tender and well marinated. Combined with their choices of spicey sauce and it simply makes it more tasty. I'd recommand using the least spicy sauce because althought the most spicy sauce is great but it kind of overshadows the taste of tacos. 

Out of curiousity, I tried the Chaparritas drink, and really loved the soft taste of it. 

Definitely would recommand this. The only inconvinience is that they only take cash. They do have an ATM but the fees :'(

100% coming back... with wacks of cash in hand to try all their tacos :)"}
{"text":"TACOS TACOS TACOS J'EN VEUX ENCORE. J'ai connu cet endroit cet été, car je cherchais des toilettes sur St-Denis...quand je suis rentrée à cet endroit...l'odeur m'a dit...que je devais revenir très prochainement....ET BON PROCHAINEMENT FÛT LE 30 NOVEMBRE 2016. wow...c'était bon! Le truc de fromage, chorizo dans un petit plat en terre cuite et EXCELLENT...c'est à essayer. J'ai bien aimé les taquitos frits aussi offert en entrée. J'ai pris des tacos al Pastor...ils sont 3 pour 6$, un bon prix :) j'ai pris de l'extra avocat...malheureusement...ce n'est pas le meilleur avocat que j'ai mangé de ma vie...il était ben ben pâle et les tranches étaient ben ben minces. Les 3 sauces servient avec tout sont bonnes...par contre j'aurai aimé avoir des tortillas ou quelque chose pour les essayer toutes.

Mon ami m'a donné un de ses tacos...je ne me souviens plus c'était lequel...c'était du porc..mais il était dûr..pas trop triper. Bref, au prix qu'on paix et à la déco qui est offerte...on y va pas pour le service....Il est minime....ahhh et PAS D'INTERAC!! (Ça vient de perdre 1 étoiles...pas d'Interac en 2016...c'est poche)"}
{"text":"I love this place and go as often as I can, real authentic tacos. Closest to those I had when visiting mexico city and Aguascalientes"}
{"text":"Really liked La Matraca for the simplicity of the place and authenticity of their tacos! Will be back :-)"}
{"text":"Their tacos and tortas are exactly what you could eat in Mexico. The staff is very nice and courteous and  the place is nice too. I particularly liked the posters explaining the proper taco etiquette.

Good place to practice your Spanish too."}
{"text":"I am obsessed with tacos and this is my go-to spot in Montreal, which is not a small thing. A bit pricey in my opinion, but this is as close to Mexico as you can get in terms of flavor. Suadero and al pastor are very tasty. My only problem with the place is they are cash only."}
{"text":"great cj-style tacos with df-style tortas thrown in.  my pal and i wandered in on their second day to satisfy my desperate desire for tasty pastor, and i was shocked at how well these guys delivered.  in numerous subsequent visits, the same.  and already, the place is very popular, which pleases me for suggesting staying power.  i've tried everything on the (rather short, as it should be) menu, and everything is worthwhile.  torta la matraca almost makes me cry for reminding me of home.  ¡auténticos tacos y tortas de recetas mexicanas!"}
{"text":"Cette place se veut être ce qui ressemble le plus à une taqueria, soit un taco shop.

C'est très typique, sans y aller dans l'artificiel mexicain qu'on peut trouver chez les très amigos avec les gros daiquiris. C'est du mexicain, du maudit bon mexicain.

J'ai été là un midi pour combler mon craving de mexicain, je n'ai pas été déçu. Il faut par contre noter que le temps pour que le lunch soit prêt est d'au moins 15 minutes. Je conseillerais d'appeler d'avance pour peut-être préparer le menu avant.

Vous ne penserez plus jamais que le taco de Ol Del Paso est un taco après avoir manger là-bas. Gros wow."}
{"text":"If you want to tried the closes thing to Mexican tacos, this is the place. They have some of the typical tacos you'd find in a place in mexico. The horchata water hit the spot too, its a thing to tried. 
We tried tortas too,  (Mexican sandwich) and it deserve an opportunity too.

I gave them 4 stars just because they didn't accept card, all must to be in cash. But the service is very good and the decoration is nice too."}
{"text":"De la vraie bonne bouffe mexicaine! Excellent! Ambiance sans prétention, menu très complet, service hyper sympathique et efficace. Attention cependant: n'accepte que l'argent comptant alors, préparez-vous en conséquence!"}
{"text":"Me encanta!!! Voy alla por lo menos una a dos veces al mes, es el mejor lugar de tacos auténticos mexicanos aquí en Montreal se los recomiendo al 100%. Los tacos al pastor son increíble, sin olvidar las flautistas. La mayoría de los precios están bien según las proporciones y calidad. No pidan las quesadillas es una decepción a parte de eso ... todo MUY RICOO!!  


Love iitttt!!!! One of my favorite Mexicans food in Montreal, totally a place to go, the tacos are amazing, should try tacos al pastor those are my favourite and the entree flautitas they're AWSOME!!!! The price is okay for the quality and quantity, don't order the quesadillas!! Beside that ITS ALL DELICIOUS !!!"}
{"text":"J'ai  déguster un bon  repas  .c'était  des enchilada .  La  texture de  la  nourriture  était  agréable  et le goût  était  vraiment bon.  Je  trouve  que   c'est  une   belle   ambiance  . J'y  retournerai  pour  m'acheter  d'autre  chose"}
{"text":"A friend recommended this place to us. It looks scratchy like a fast food joint but it was a bang for your bucks and packed with flavours. 
The server was very friendly and made some really good recommendations to us. 
Their tacos, sandwiches were so good. Same as their sauces. Beware that the most spicy one is really spicy! The medium one worked the best for me as a accompany to all of my dishes. 
However, their desserts were very disappointing. The pudding was very bitter and the cheesecake was rock hard. 
But it worth the long walk from dt Montreal to mt royal."}
{"text":"You have to assume this place is authentic Mexican when everyone in the restaurant is Mexican except yourself. The food is great, the service is friendly and the ambience is inviting. This is definitely a spot I will visit again. The only reason I give 4 stars instead of 5 is simply because there is absolutely no English in the restaurant which is typically ok because I have a good understanding of French however, when I asked the waiter and waitress to explain a few ingredients to me they had a lot of trouble. Another knock would be that when I ordered 2 different styles of tacos, they tasted very similar and finally they do not accept credit cards. Other than that I have to say the place is great and I also think that the sauces that they give are amazing. I will be back!"}
{"text":"We tried this place on our jaunt around Mont Royal. The food was decent, and the sauces/salsas they serve are pretty good. The oxcacan cheese quesadillas  are some of our favorite (we make them at home), so we were glad to see them on the menu. I tried a torta with 3 meats. It was good, but the bread wasn't very tasty. My husband had the pastor tacos and thought they were good, but the raw onions and pineapple overpowered the flavor of the meat."}
{"text":"I happened to pass by with a couple of friends for a quick bite and a refreshing beer. We ordered a couple of different things to give it a try and let me tell you, we were NOT disappointed. We tried the Pastor, Bistek and Chorizo. Hands down, Chorizo (although a tad too salty) was the absolute best! This place really reminds me of authentic Mexican food. You will not be disappointed. A must try!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican restaurant BY FAR I have tried in Montreal. The tacos taste exactly like they do in Mexico, the salsa is delicious, the tortillas couldn't be better, they also have some mexican sodas and candies. The service is also very good. Simply amazing!"}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican street foot in a thoroughly unpretentious atmosphere. The sauces are lovely, although the wooden spoons in the salsa jars are a health code violation waiting to happen (See Checkpoint Charlie's circa 2003). That said, the food is wonderful. Great service."}
{"text":"My partner and I went to La Matraca on a Saturday afternoon, and the food and service were amazing. Mind you, the place was pretty dead when we got there and slowly picked up for the dinner rush. 

I ordered the marinated pork tacos, as they state that they are known for their tacos, and boy oh boy! As a die-hard Mexican food snob, I'm happy to say that La Matraca is authentic, delicious, and well priced. Quite easily, the best tacos in Montreal. 

Forget the imitators, for real tacos, this is the place to beat!"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch with my girlfriend. The waitress was really nice and helpful. We got the pork quesadillas. Didn't taste that Mexican but still really delicious. The entrées are also really good. Good restaurant if you want to try a couple of different things on the menu because they're decent portions for pretty cheap. It's a good fast Mexican restaurant, I'd recommend it."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff i see regulars coming here, we were here for the traditional breakfast it was satisfying, high protein breakfast. Nothing extraordinary just a change from the fancy brunches on plateau. Will be back to try the tacos for sure."}
{"text":"I loooove tacos. And I've had tacos in many different places in Mexico. La Matraca is pretty authentic, as far as I'm concerned. Extremely efficient and fast service (like a real taqueria), great and cheap food. Do yourself a favor, order some tacos al pastor, some horchata, and enjoy Mexico in Montreal :)"}
{"text":"My go-to taqueria in Montreal. Authentic Mexican tacos. No old el passo b.s. 
My gfs and I come to this place on a monthly basis almost. Not much decor or ambiance; it's a chill, unpretentious place. 
The tacos are simple; 3-4 ingredients at most. Just the way a taco is meant to be. And the sauces are to die for! My mouth just watered..."}
{"text":"Delicious tacos. I got the pineapple one, waited around 7-8 mins. I was not full but it's not what they a promising I guess.

Tacos + hibiscus drink = around $15. I would go there for special occasions because for that price you can easily have a good dinner somewhere else. 

But again this is street food, more of a tasting and enjoying spot than. Getting full."}
{"text":"J'ai trouvé des bons saveurs avec leur tacos variés mais ils n'ont pas au poulet. Pas de nachos pour accompagner les spicy sauces offertes à chaque table mais vous pouvez acheter des tortillas à 0,50c pour tremper dans les sauces. La deco un peu negligé mais on mange bien. La horchata bien sucrée comme j'aime ;)"}
