{"text":"Oh Faustos... This place has some amazing food, from bean and cheese burritos to enchiladas to chili relleno to super nachos that truly are \"super\". The food is filling and well priced, with a salsa bar featuring spicy carrots and onions, cucumbers, a red and green salsa, and basket of limes. 

Beware, vegetarians, the beans do have lard in them. 

My favorite item is an Egg-Potato-Cheese breakfast burrito that will keep you full for breakfast AND lunch :)"}
{"text":"Man, this place has been awesome for the last 8+ years since I began working nearby.  NOT fancy or by any means high class Mexican cuisine, but if you want fast, great tasting inexpensive mexican without fearing the \"aftershock\", this place is it.  I have been to all 3 locations many times over the years, and IMO the College location seems to be the best (then Gibson, and last Eastern), but the are ALL good."}
{"text":"I think the cashier woman there needs to take a course on customer service. My wife had mentioned that the last time she went there that the woman was very unfriendly if you ask any questions and I'm pretty sure I had this same woman tonight. She was only mildly annoyed when I asked if there was sour cream in the burrito but then when I went to pick up the order and asked her which one is the \"steak\" burrito she responded snidely that I could \"just look in the boxes and you'll see which one is not in there and then you'll know, Obviously\"... Then she turned to continue cashiering.   What the...? Has this woman never heard of customer service or at least the idea of being polite? I won't be returning ever. There are enough restaurants in Henderson that have cashiers that treat their customers with respect. She pretty much made the dinner an awkward experience. Also since there only a few tables in this place your likely to be eating a burrito with people standing in line right up against you or bumping into you. No reason to return."}
{"text":"Randomly found this place as we drove through Henderson to avoid the traffic on the 15 on the way back to San Diego from Vegas.  It was a very pleasant find.  $4 fish burritos which was the size of a petite woman's arm with nice crunchy fish and the perfect amount of fixings.  The added bonus was the spicy carrots & jalape√±os that are readily available for the taking.  Carrots were crunchy and flavorful which is a must!  Next time I go to Vegas, there will be a small part of me that would wish for bad traffic on the 15 so I can head over to Henderson!"}
{"text":"I love this location, all the employees are very friendly and they get your food out quickly without the usual hiccups and mistakes that other high-volume places make. The food is great for what it is, tacos that aren't soaked in grease, cheese that doesn't turn to rubber the second it cools down, tortillas to die for, etc... Great experience every time!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Lots of selections, but one of my favorites is the California burrito with no rice."}
{"text":"This is a great place to go for quick Mexican food that doesn't taste like fast food! My favorite is the rolled tacos with guacamole. They also have great breakfast burritos!"}
{"text":"Fausto's is a great place for Mexican food at a decent price. They a pretty quick at getting it ready, which is good because the place is fairly small and there is not much room to wait around. In the peak hours, expect to stand in a corner or possibly share a table where others may be waiting for to go orders. Other than that, it is worth the small inconvenience."}
{"text":"When people say \"that place is just like Roberto's\" I just want to high five them, in the face, with a chair. No. This place is so much better! Decently authentic Mexican food, for cheap. Nailed it!"}
{"text":"Good, fast food. Got the chorizo breakfast burrito. Pretty good, especially considering it was only $4."}
{"text":"California burrito is excellent. Authentic little dive with great food and cheap prices."}
{"text":"Fausto's is the best. It's always delicious and fresh whether I get a burrito, nachos, or carne asada fries. My only regret is I don't live closer lol ;)"}
{"text":"Faustos let's me get the taco shop fix I miss from growing up in So Cal. Their service isn't the best but it's a taco shop...get over it. The best part about Faustos is their beans. The BEST I've had...and I'm a refried beans snob. The carne asada super nachos are pretty awesome too. Though I must say that rice in a California burrito is just wrong....where are the French fries Faustos?! Overall, blah service, excellent food, and great prices."}
{"text":"Hubby says this is one of the best bean and cheese burritos he has had in a long time. Only second to La Posta in San Diego. Portions are awesome and price follows. Love the veggie bar. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Not fancy, but oh so good and soooo cheap! My family of 4 usually gets out of there for right around twenty-five bucks, sometimes less.  

Carne asada is delicious and huge. The chile rellanos are so good. Burritos are giant and also delicious, and like another reviewer mentioned, the quesedillas are ginormous. BUT... what's really cool is that as busy as this joint is, the lovely lady that takes the orders remembers what my kids order better than I do!  And frequently we come with 2 families together, a total of 8 kids... she makes it so easy. She reminds me of my friend's son, \"that one likes his carne asada plain.\"  Gotta love it!

Another reviewer noted great food but not that clean... we're frequent customers.. 3 to 4 times a month for the last 3 years...and we've never seen it dirty in the least. Don't mistake plain for dirty."}
{"text":"Have been a customer since opening! great food portions, the environment has much improved since opening as well, nice flat screen for tv viewing while you dine, the chairs and tables are nice and the restaurant is clean! the food is also very yummy i always get the steak tacos or breakfast burrito! the one thing that is a bummer is there sin;t enough seating :/ the place is always busy busy but never enough seating so there is always people standing and a few times people sat at the empty chairs at my table which made me feel a bit uncomfortable :/ other than that i give faustos a 5 star gold rating i dine here once every two weeks atleast! 

Thank you"}
{"text":"I prefer this over Roberto's. Great sauces and excellent food. Plus I always love when a fast food joint is setup so you can easily see all of your food being made."}
{"text":"I ordered the special combo and asked them make it wet style.  Nothing special.  The beans and rice were both tasteless and the sprinkle of cheese on top was a pathetic afterthought."}
{"text":"Ok this place gets a 3 star why? The food is pretty good the prices are not bad the service is not so great they have a lady at the register that needs a attitude adjustment 
If I'm spending money there. Especially a lot of money I should at least be kindly greeted and at least be politely spoken too."}
{"text":"All I can say is mmmmh! Mmmmmmh! MMMMMMMMH! Wow for a \"chain\" this is soooo good!"}
{"text":"Faustos always has great service and amazing food. I'm glad so many others like it as well."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Mexican food in Vegas. I want to roll up in one of their homemade tortillas and live there. Very good prices very good food and the girls at the cash register are polite. Open early and open late. Not a restaurant."}
{"text":"The food lacked seasoning. Not very good in my opinion. I don't understand how it has a four star rating. In a town full of Mexican restaurant options don't bother wasting your money here. I was very disappointed. Tasted like Mexican hospital food."}
{"text":"I wrestled with what rating to give them. I decided on 3 just because while the food was excellent, the service took away from that. Very slow, disorganization handling multiple orders, and last, no hello,goodbye, kiss my grits! Cashier just stares, like I am suppose to read her soul. When I have an extra 40 minutes to spare waiting for the food, I will go back. Authentic and worth the price."}
{"text":"Good, cheap Mexican food! The lady at the counter can seem distracted at times which is annoying but other than that it is great."}
{"text":"Fausto's has good food and it's a fun environment to hangout in. If you're looking for some quick good food Fausto's is always a good place to check out."}
{"text":"This is a good fast food Mexican place. I usually get dinner here every other week, Carne Asada plate, delicious. They are very popular , every time you walk in line is long. But they cook pretty fast and cooks well. Price is very reasonable too. I am going to be their competition soon lol. Off the street beside the taco bell , we are opening a similar restaurant in new Chevron gas station."}
{"text":"Been coming here foreverrrrrr! Not my favorite type of Mexican food, but it's very affordable and pretty good. It opens at 5:20 am so if you need something early morning, you could totally stop here and get one of their yummy breakfast burritos! That's my favorite item on the menu"}
{"text":"Always amazing!!! Never had anything come out that i wasnt satisfied with. Way better then Robertos"}
{"text":"Great mexican food here! My usuals... carne asada fries & the chimichanga.  VERY BIG portions! They also have a free salad bar.  Staff here are really nice.  They also can get very busy @ times so what I normally do is call it in & just pick it up.  This place opens late as well.  Cheap eats!"}
{"text":"Is it hard to get hot meat on your nachos. Even requested to have the meat cooked to well done. The carne asada never touched the grill as I watched them prepare my meal from start to finish."}
{"text":"WoW, Fausto's is good.  everything is made fresh, and it is always busy."}
{"text":"So good...cheap....and huge portions....delicious.chimichanga and nachos rock.  go there."}
{"text":"I think Fausto's is delicious and you can't beat the prices!! My favorites are the California burrito & their Carne Asada plates. Everything I've tried has been very good & they are quick too!! Even though there is almost always a line out the door, the wait is minimal, from the time you start in line, to when you receive your food. I highly recommend Fausto's!!"}
{"text":"Omg! My first time here and was hard to choose what I wanted to try. The portions are huge and the food was delicious. I got the chicken burrito and carne asada fries. Didn't even come close to finishing them. Super fast service as well even though there was a long line! I will definitely go back to try more items."}
{"text":"i don't know why there are so many reviews speaking badly of the woman at the register? she's always been really nice to me maybe yall just need to approach her differently? she is there literally all day everyday on her feet for hours, what is she supposed to do greet you with a hug? give her a break she's tired as hell.

anyways i come in here like once a month to order the same thing for my family every time we don't feel like cooking. my moms half mexican and we all think this place is great. me and my sister get fish burritos and my parents get carnitas burrito combo plates, it's always amazing and they make it so fast even when it's really busy it never takes more than 10 minutes. also the burritos are gigantic, especially for the price, and there's an area to get free salsas and limes and stuff.

i really love this place AND the woman at the register, 10/10 :)"}
{"text":"Been going here for about 12 years or so. Most of the original staff is still their which has helped build a real fun bond every time you go pick up food or decide to dine in.
The atmosphere has always been lively, especially if you dare to go immediately after school gets out! Over the years they've also upgraded the inside decor of the restaurant which has been nice if your a long time customer. Goes to show they care about us feeling comfortable and enjoying our short stay while there. Another thing I'm quite pleased about is a simple thing, the TV! Im a long time soccer fan so coming in to watch the game or to have my food which was to go become a stay in lunch is always awesome when I can watch the games! 

Now for the food, what can I say? It's good, it's consistent and the portions are unreal. I've tried numerous things from Chicken Tacos, Carne Asda Fries, Henderson burrito, Toritos, breakfast burritos and so on. All; absolutely delicious. If your a fan of hard shell tacos then this is your spot; I highly recommend their pulled chicken tacos! Today I decided to go for the carne asada fries and the portion was MASSIVE (which lead me to write this review). Every time I go their I leave satisfied and stuffed. Not once have I had a bad experience, like literally; in 12 years, NOT ONCE. You can't beat that!

So take a stroll down here and check t out yourself. Chances are you won't be disappointed and you'll be happy you found yourself a new Mexican food restaurant."}
{"text":"Love that they remember a face. Always check in on the family. They also remember what we order and know our voices. Great food good company. My favorite by far."}
{"text":"Fausto's in general is damn good.  This location is no different.

It can get a tad busy at times which makes for cramped quarters inside.

I called in my last order over the phone.  Imagine my surprise when the lady taking my order said, \" five minutes.\"

I hustled there in my vehicle and my food was already to go.

Calling in the order will be the way to go from here on out."}
{"text":"We came here with our good friends and was very much impressed. I mean hand made flour tortillas Yummy and the Menudo was a hit. I normally do not order this anywhere since it is normally and I am convinced that no one can make it like my mom. But I quickly came to realize that no shortcuts were taken to make this Menudo. We ended up being the last bowls served, it was completely gone. Can't wait till Sunday for my Menudo fixin.  Thanks Judd and Lynn!!"}
{"text":"You cant go wrong with any Faustos. Actual Mexican food made by Mexicans. The green sauce is better than the red. 
And the three taquitos with guacamole and cheese are awesome, and cheap."}
{"text":"BEST chicken taco ever.

Cheese quesadillas are a whole meal. Amazing.

BUT...whenever I want a breakfast burrito when they open, they are NOT OPEN. This is really early in the morning, but if you post the time you open, you should be open and ready to go, right?

Have left without breakfast a number of times due to this.

Carne asada / carnitas anything is to die for. Cheap and yummy."}
{"text":"i just love this place for a quick breakfast burrito or dinner on the way home. they always get the order right and the food is yummy. #nocaps"}
{"text":"Meh, it's fine for what it is. A hole in the wall taqueria chain with cheap prices and lower quality food. I don't understand those who scoff at Roberto's, but act like Fausto's is some Michelin 3 star restaurant in comparison. They're practically identical in the crap they serve you. Carne Asada burrito is usually really dry unless you ask for it to be loaded up with guac and sour cream. Chicken enchiladas are edible, but I hate the taste of their tortilla and generally just extract the chicken and drench it in Cholula because it is always THAT dry. Also, if you're raving about carne asada fries...I mean what kind of culinary feat is throwing together bunch of fattening food and mixing it together. OF COURSE it's going to taste good. The lady working the front is cordial enough. The other night I asked her for a water cup while I wait for my food. She said they no longer offer courtesy cups because 95% of people lied and got soda. PROTECT YOUR SYRUP AT ALL COSTS."}
{"text":"Amazing place.. We enjoyed a very nice food here. Me and my friends were on a long drive to hover dam. We all were so hungry and trying to find the best place on the way. Finally found this little town center that has few restaurants and we decided to go to Fausto's Mexican Grill.. food is really good. so much food for just $10, thats one of the really good thing about this restaurant."}
{"text":"It's all about the Super Nachos with steak from here. When we order take out, I know which container it's in because they pack it up with chips, cheeses, guac, sour cream, peppers and a huge amount of grilled seasoned chopped steak. That Styrofoam dish weighs about a ton!

I like that they open real early so I can get their breakfast burritos. Pretty filling and a hearty breakfast.  I can rely on the eggs, bacon and potatoes packed in a flour tortilla to fill my belly and  get me thru the morning. Chile Relleno and their beef tacos are good fast food bets also. Other than that, I'm not too impressed with the other items they serve.  My taste buds are so spoiled by the home cooks that have their hole in the wall diners in my former home town.  Alot of the cuisine around here,the foods are more westernized, but heck it beats Taco Bell for sure when I'm feeling Mexican fast food. The place is fairly clean, the food is cheap, and tastes good for what it's worth. 

Morning, noon and dinner hours is always the rush hour here with the line sometimes to the door. But they got the system down so there's hardly ever a long wait to ordering and getting your food. Only drawback, there's no drive thru and finding parking spaces close by can sometimes be a pain."}
{"text":"Have been coming to this Stephanie location for over ten years. They never disappoint. Huge breakfast burritos for four dollars. That are always fresh and never taste like fast food."}
{"text":"No matter what I have ordered, it's always been good. My family and I have been going to Fausto ' s for about 10years. We have never been dissapointed. 
I didn't give 5 stars because the place is pretty small and the line gets pretty long making it super crowded inside. 

I'm not a fan of cooked green bell peppers, so when I order Chicken Taco Salad, I order it plain chicken, they season it perfectly. Plus you get your fill of the carrots, cucumbers and limes. And the pin√£ drink is the best. 
I'm in my car writing this waiting for my son to bring out the goodies .Dear Lord, Hurry!!  My mouth is watering...my order is up, time to enjoy my food now."}
{"text":"BEST CHURROS EVER!! Most of the time the churros have caramel on the inside. It's always pretty busy when I've been but they're quick and the food has always been good. I can't wait to go back and try more!"}
{"text":"I always have a great experience at fausto's, UNTIL TODAY. food was bomb, the customer service deserved some work! we love fausto's, until the hostess proceeded to raise her voice at my children. no thank you! she pressed my whole family and husband about ordering for to go. not happy. we will not be returning until our go to fast food mex restaurant."}
{"text":"I love Fausto's!!  I know it's pretty much the same as almost every other quick Mexican food place there is, but I think the quality of food here is a step up.  I usually go with the carne adada plate which also comes with rice, beans, pico, and two huge tortillas.  The Carne Asada is delicious.  As expected they have a salsa bar with a few selections and some vegetables.  I believe the cost is about the same as Roberto's or again any other similar places.  If Fausto's was closer to my house I would probably eat here more than all the others.  Unfortunately it's not too close to my house so I only eat here when in the area.  Also, it's a small dining area, so don't expect to comfortably eat with larger parties.  If you can take it to go, that would be the best options."}
{"text":"My number one cheat meal is the Nevada Burrito. Anything I try never fails to impress me!"}
{"text":"I'm from Cali and my expectations with Mexican food are high. This place is no king taco but it's a good sub when you not in Cali. Definitely better than Roberto's."}
{"text":"I've only managed to eat here twice, and after the second time, I was reminded why. 

The decor is good, the service is friendly and the food is very tasty. Unfortunately, I happen to need to use the restroom in a VERY urgent way after eating here. 

So, for me, although it's good - the after effects just aren't worth it for me to continue to eat here regularly."}
{"text":"Love this place, great food always hot and fresh! The cashier is always super nice and helpful and the food comes out fast. Done in or take out I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"All I have to say is Chicken Super Nachos and Steak and Egg breakfast burrito!!!!!!    PAPOW!!!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed with this place today. Never a hi or what can i get you, just a blank stare so i was like ok ill just order and then the lady just turns around and talks to her coworkers in spanish. Im bilingual so i understand whats shes saying. And it had nothing to do with there job. She was very rude. Finally i get my food she just shoves it all in the bag no thank you, here you go, or just nothing she just practically throws it at me. Just so she can turn around and keep talking about how great the party was. Wth.. I get home and my order just sucked so bad i got the carne asada nachos and it was i had order chips with bean dip :/ i just ended up throwing it away"}
{"text":"This is Fausto's, the original.  I feel like I shouldn't even review it because it is such a staple in my and many of my friends' diets.  Everything is good here, just try it, love it, and go back constantly.  There is no point reviewing specific food items because if I did, I would end up typing out the whole menu.  They recently raised their prices but everything is still priced reasonably."}
{"text":"My hubby and I wanted a good carne asada burrito like we often get in San Diego...thought we'd give Fausto's on College Drive in Henderson a try tonight.  We were very pleasantly surprised!  Very good carne, tender and with just the right kick! Will go back again- I want to try the camarones mojo de ajo......best part is that they are just down the street from our house!"}
{"text":"They have this salad of sorts in the self serve thingie, made of carrots, whole pickled jalepenos, and onions, all in vinegar; it's really good.

Good Mexican fast food: your usual styrofoam plate of one third rice, one third refried beans, one third the item you ordered (chicken taco, in my case). Got out of there for under eight bucks."}
{"text":"Delicious and inexpensive Mexican food!  Fausto's is similar to Roberto's taco shops, but for some reason... their food tastes a little bit better!  I especially love the bar filled with salsas and different yummy things.  I always wondered why cucumbers were a part of the bar area until my friend taught me to put them in a bag with salt, lime juice and salsa.  So good!"}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times. Food is good and the prices are decent. They are usually crowded during dinnertime with a line out the door so expect a little wait during peak hours."}
{"text":"good cheap what we call \"durty mexican food.\" hits the spot when you want big plates of carne asada w/ homemade tortillas."}
{"text":"My favorite quick Mexican food in the valley. Their salsa is great! The guys are very accommodating for special orders. Their breakfast burritos are great. I love this joint. Always clean, very friendly, fresh and fast"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying we HAD been eating at fausto's for the past 2 years, until new years eve 2011, both my husband and i got the WORST food poisoning from here that you can imagine, shooting out both ends for 8 hours straight, twice an hour.  As much as we enjoyed fausto's (went there sometimes three times a week) we will never be returning, obviously they have some cleanliness issues, oh and i had a vegetarian meal and my husband had the #5, so obviously it was a wide spread issue not just one item."}
{"text":"When I worked in this area of town, Fausto's was a favorite for lunch.  It's one of the only authentic taquerias in this part of Henderson.  It's clean, always busy, and totally yum.

I always enjoyed their cheese enchiladas.  They have a pretty awesome enchilada sauce."}
{"text":"Mexican fast food but really great!  We were craving Mexican after long Sunday on Havasu and needing to nurse some hangovers . This fit the bill perfectly.  We tried the chicken burrito, taco al pastor, guacamole and chips and cheese stuffed chile poblano.  Everything was great and much more authentic than a Taco Bell."}
{"text":"Before I moved to Las Vegas, all I ever had was Taco Bell if I felt like eating Mexican food.  Then I had this and now I'm a fan of better Mexican Food.  Their menu is pretty awesome, really big pictures to show what you going eat.  Carne Asada Fries! Carne Asada Chimchangas! Oh My! That's the best, top it off with spices they have!  I love this place!"}
{"text":"If i could them zero stars i would. I've tried it like 10 times just to be sure it sucks lol. There tortillas are soggy and they never put any bacon in the breakfast burritos. I got like 2 pieces in my whole burrito. How anyone could think this is better than Robertos is beyond me. I'm never going back. I'll drive ten minutes further just for Robertos."}
{"text":"This has always been my go-to spot whenever I felt the need to fulfill my craving for carne asada fries. Hands down, they will always be the best to me. Im sure there are other great options to be had, but you'd have to know where to look. In my case, it's a quick drive for a quick fix. Carne asada isn't my only favorite but the Nevada burrito will give you such a satisfying bite, it'll have you coming back in no time! It doesn't get better then your carne asada fries wrapped in a tortilla, so you can enjoy the mouthwatering goodness as a whole. There food is definitely enough to satisfy you, and your friend."}
{"text":"Perfect for those late night hunger pangs. The quality is just better than those Robertos and Don Tortaco places. Salsa is meh which sucks because the food is so good! Al  pastor isn't the traditional pastor off the vertical spit but it's decent enough. Staff isn't all that friendly but I don't care too much about that when allz I want is a giant burrito and no eye contact."}
{"text":"We carry out from here often. For 6 years we have enjoyed many meals
from here. People, food, and service are all great."}
{"text":"Best authentic Mexican food around. The staff is great and the food is always done in 5 minutes. They have excellent flavor in all their food. And the carrots are to die for. If you want a great, fast, Mexican meal, go here. And the portions are a great size, so you won't leave feeling let down."}
{"text":"Always amazing food! Adequate service.  Super Nachos are to die for and feed a small country.  Good job!"}
{"text":"Great food at good prices.  Carne Asada burrito is very good as are the fish tacos.  Reason for leaving off two stars was the unfriendliness of the employees.  Seems they are doing you a favor and don't want to be there.  The carne asada quality is so much better than Roberto's.  Much less fat."}
{"text":"I agree with a previous reviewer that when the food is on, it's amazing. But when the food is off, it's pretty gross. I probably would've given fausto's 4 stars if the lady at the front greeted and said she'd be right with me when I walked in. 

Fausto's is one of my favorite fast food Mexican places in Las Vegas. I had to go in when I visited a week ago. I just wish the service was better. My personal favorite location is the one on Stephanie and Warm Springs. 

Whatever you do, get the guacamole and chips as a side. And get their red salsa."}
{"text":"I was a customer out of arizona. I come to Nevada very frequent and this place has always been a must. Until recently. The 45 some year old lady who works the register has always become very rude to me each time and today I had my last meal here. My family ordered and then It was my turn and she somehow managed to mess up my order and gave me attitude for trying to fix it. I paid and she only gave me 1 of 2 drink I ordered and she leaned over the counter and actually yelled at me saying I owed her a dollar, for what? Idk and she made a whole scene grabbing the attention of all the customers in the restaurant. And while we were finishing up she had her bus boy clean up the tables and he literally stood over us while we ate and then he sat down and was watching us trying to hurry us out. But it doesn't stop there. As we were exiting I was walking out and all her employees were glaring at me TALKING SHIT ABOUT ME IN SPANISH. HELLO! IT'S 2017 I live in AZ were 90% of the language is Spanish. And I knew exactly what they were saying."}
{"text":"Great chow.  We wanted a quick breakfast before leaving Henderson for LA. This place hit the mark perfectly.  Less than $20 for 4 burritos.  And they are big.  Did not eat till dinner."}
{"text":"I can eat here everyday every week. The food is amazing, the staff are friendly and nice, the place is always kept clean. I could not imagine going a week without this food. Been coming here since it opened over ten years ago. Favorite spot for food by far."}
{"text":"I'm currently staying in Henderson for job training for a few months. Visiting from Southern California, there are tons of Mexican joints all over the place; so I've had good and bad. Finding out this place was only 5 minutes from where I was staying has been a great find. 

I've been here three times so far. The first time: As soon as I walked in on a Sunday night around 10 pm, I was surprised to see a lot of people here.  I ordered the Super Nachos with Carne Asada. The chips were fresh and crisp, the meat tasted very good and off the grill; plenty of REAL shredded cheese to go around, too. (If the cheese comes in a can, they are not real nachos). It's a good deal as you get a ton of of food for what you pay for. 

The second time, I wanted to stay simple and ordered a Bean and Cheese Burrito. Beans were definitely made from scratch, could have used a little more salt, but creamy and fresh and plenty of cheese in the burrito. Typically, if a Mexican restaurant screws up a Bean and Cheese a burrito, then you know its bad. Fortunately, it was great and well worth it. 

The last time I came here, I ordered the Taquitos (rolled tacos). Crunch tortilla good amount of meat. My complaint comes from the guacamole, though; a little too much lime for my taste. 

Overall, a great place for a quick Mexican Food fix. I will continue to be a customer so long as I am in Henderson."}
{"text":"I ordered a beef quesadilla and they sent me cheese. Fine no big deal. I called to have him fix it and he refused. Very rude service. Super agitated and just to show because he said I ordered cheese I did in fact order beef. Will not be eating Fausto's again!"}
{"text":"I make a point of not eating Mexican food in Vegas (my high-maintenance taste buds only accept Mexican food in LA or Houston), but when I do, this is the spot. Although I'm not a fan of their chile relleno (which defines all of my Mexican dining experiences), I am having an explicit affair with their Carne Asada Super Nachos. It blows my mind every time, and I find myself thinking about it late at night while I'm in bed. To me, it's just that good. It sets me back $6.95, but it's worth it every time.

I think customer service is good here. It gets real busy at night though, so I usually take my order to go for a more intimate encounter with my beloved nachos. 

I wouldn't recommend this place for dates, but it's a great place to head over to after several rounds of drinks. However, they close at midnight so make sure you have a designated driver pick up your food while you down your last couple of beers/body shots/whatever."}
{"text":"Great food!! Large portions! Small casual atmosphere. Excellent choice as you're driving back to Vegas from Hoover Dam."}
{"text":"Just moved in the area and wanted to find good places to eat and stumbled upon this place. Service was great and so was the food. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I've been to this location a few times and it's never very impressive, but the food comes quickly and it isn't over priced. I went in last night and ordered a bean & cheese burrito with rice (I know, super plain). I saved half of it for lunch today. A couple bites in, I bit into something extremely hard. Of course I had to spit my food out and upon further inspection, I found a rock in my food. It's more like a pebble size... but regardless. I bit into a pebble in my burrito, and it just makes me wonder about their cleanliness in the kitchen. I won't be back."}
{"text":"I have eaten at all 3 locations and all 3 times, the food is great. I usually refer to all my friends... However, I highly recommend you do NOT go to the College/Horizon location. If you can, go to the on on Stephanie/Trail Canyon. It's not the food... it's the customer service. The girl working the counter is mean as hell. always is. Always has been. Every time I go in there, she is a B**** to someone. I used to go there often for years. I have never seen anyone else work the counter. Today was no different. After letting my order sit for almost 30 minutes, I figured it was time to write a review and share my experience. 

Don't let her cute looks deceive you. She's having a bad day. Maybe she is one of those people who is constantly in pain or is hiding something horrible that brings out the worst in her. If that's the case, I hope that what ever is plaguing her gets better, but in the meantime, keep her in the back!!!!

So... thanks for the cold food!! It was okay. Not worth the attitude. This place has permanently lost my business. I'll go to the other location from now on. It's not that far. My review won't hurt them. They are always packed. And for good reason. Excellent food. But the customer service this lady brings (or what she doesn't bring) is definitely worth mentioning. Bye Fausto's #3!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing. Their pollo asado was unbelievably good! Tacos were legit, enchiladas were amazing, and was left so full I couldn't even finish the rice. Only complaint was there were so many people you couldn't even sit down. This is seriously an oasis in the desert."}
{"text":"Muchos Mahalos to LL and Big Trouble for the intro!!!

This place was JUMPIN' when we arrived....Big portions, reasonably priced, Fausto's definitely delivers.

Lots of selections-from tacos, nachos, and burritos, to cocktails and combo plates.....I narrowed it down to the Chile Relleno/Enchilada Combo Plate and the Camarones a la Diablo plate but I couldn't narrow it down any further, so I had to get 'em both(heh heh)

The FRESH Flour Tortillas are the BOMB DIGGITS!!! we usually get corn tortillas, but these are too good to pass up! 

The Menudo here is very good too. The Super Nachos are super huge and tasty, and so is the Al Pastor...Now they need to open one up in our side of town...ALOHA!!!"}
{"text":"It really doesn't get much better than this. I could probably survive on their condiments alone, with the mountain of jalapeno carrots, cucumber slices, and delicious salsas! I remember coming here in high school after class and finding the place packed with people, all lined up for the California burrito, carne asada fries, and the carne asada super nachos. 

The California burrito has to be my kryptonite. Every bite has the perfect combination of carne asada, cheese, rice, sour cream, and guacamole. Everything else on the menu holds a special place in my heart as well, and it is often difficult to decide between chicken tacos, fajitas, or the savory menudo they serve every weekend. And the horchata is something to be loved as well!

All in all, the homey atmosphere of this establishment, as well as the friendly staff, make me feel welcome anytime, even up until closing time at midnight. Fausto's definitely beats out Roberto's in my book any day of the week. I only wish they served elote."}
{"text":"If my girlfriend could eat only one food for the rest of her life, it would be this place. Every time we visit from Arizona, we have to eat here. The flour tortillas are the best *drool* Not only that but the locals who grew up here all make a stop when they come to town."}
{"text":"It id usually on point but my burrito today wasnt hot .just meat cheese the cheese is still cold.not a good experience probably wont come back for awhile if ever"}
{"text":"I can't believe I've lived up here for almost 10 years and my first Fausto's visit was a few weeks ago.  Needless to say, I'm already a repeat customer.  I don't recall anything that would qualify as health food on the menu, so I wouldn't recommend stopping by when you want a lo-cal salad with clean protien.  But if you're looking for flavorful indulgent treats like nachos, rolled tacos, or churros you have come to the right place.  Their menu is pretty large for a walk up place, but you'll likely get plenty of time to peruse it.  On my three visits here the line was actually out the door.  They only have one cash register, so waiting to order can take some time.

Thus far we have been tempted by an assortment of items.  
Super Nachos with Steak $7.50 (tortilla chips, seasoned steak, guac, sour cream, cheese, jalape√±os) 5/5
Carne Asada fries $7.50 (fries, Carne Asada, guac, sour cream, cheese) 3/5. The nachos are superior IMO

#20 chicken burrito combo plate $6.75 (shredded chicken, onions, peppers, in a fantastic house made flour tortilla) this comes with rice and beans that can be passed on, in my opinion.  The rice was okay, but dry and the beans had no flavor. burrito 5/5, rice 2/5, bean 1/5.
5 rolled chicken taquitos with cream & cheese $4.25.  Crispy and delicious 5/5

Churros.  I was not prepared for them to have a filling.  Apple maybe?  I prefer plain, but they were okay. 3/5

The condiment bar has good stuff to grab whilst wating for your order to be prepared in Styrofoam containers :(   Cucumbers, carrots, peppers, salsa, limes, etc.
Fountain drinks: Pepsi, TV: yes, restroom: yes"}
{"text":"This place is ALWAYS stuffed with customers; and it's because the food is great! It's authentic Mexican food (my fav) and it's fast! Not to mention the portions are big enough to fill AND have leftovers :). They also have a condiment bar with some delicious peppers and sauces to take your meal to the next level. The scene is pretty indicative of a fast food Mexican joint, people are always rushing in and out but I was surprised to see they have a TV in the back that usually has a game on."}
{"text":"Have been going to this location for several years now and it's always been good.  Cashier ladies are always friendly(to me at least.)   It just seems like the food is prepared better at this one in comparison to similar joints in the area.  My go-to item is the carnitas burrito.  Bonus is that they are open late."}
{"text":"So disappointed in the customer service! The lady who works behind the counter taking orders is so rude and abrasive! With all the New Mexican restaurants around she is losing valuable customers! We use to frequent this establishment for years several times a week, but her being so rude to my son and his friend we won't be going back! Good thing they have some competition! There bottom line will be hurting!
HIRE SOME NICE CASHIER MAYBE WE WILL COME BACK!"}
{"text":"Love the flavors and the food! Decent prices, recommend to everyone"}
{"text":"I have lived around the same area my whole life and it's a disgrace I didn't start coming here earlier! I haven't really tried a lot of things on the menu, I'm usually ordering the same things but from what I've gotten, I usually come here often because it's so good."}
{"text":"The chicken Asada burrito is really good. I wish they used a different cheese on their nachos like liquid cheese would be good. Down side on my 1st visit is that I felt very rushed when ordering and finding a spot to wait for food is rough when it's crowded."}
{"text":"In the middle of my break between classes (life tip: NEVER take three 6 week summer courses. Unless you don't like sleeping ad want to be BFF's with coffee), my mom and I stopped by Fausto's from a referral from one of her coworkers. We saw some very hit or mss reviews, so we wanted to try the food out for ourselves. My mom and I were lucky enough to have arrived when there wasn't a long line because there is only one register. But, by the time we were eating, the line was out the door! I did notice that even though they were busy, food seemed to be ready and served fairly quickly.

Going in, you're immediately hit with the smell of cooking meat. There is a very wide selection of food, from tortas to tacos to nachos. After much deliberation, my mom got the chicken tacos in corn tortillas (around $8) and I opted for the al pastor taco combination with flour tortillas (same price). There is a soft drink fountain right to the side, along with a salsa bar that included some picked carrots, onions, etc.

I thought the prices were a bit expensive before I saw how big the portions were! My dish was only halfway finished before my stomach couldn't take anymore. The beans and rice were a bit bland for my taste, but the meat was to die for! My mom seemed to love her tacos, considering she finished all of them lol!

Although not truly authentic Mexican food, it is better than other Mexican restaurants, like Roberto's, by a long shot. I became a fan after the first bite and I can't wait to go again (which, by my cravings, seems like it'll be tomorrow). Be prepared though, because you'll leave smelling like the restaurant itself!"}
{"text":"had a bad experience here too small of a restraunt, and when it busy do not expect clean tables. THE STAFF THERE ARE UNDER TRAINED AND CANT HANDLE PRESSURE SITUATIONS. The guy could not control or take orders properly because on  how many customers he had. I will never come back here again I'd rather go to Roberto's bigger restraint and better food."}
{"text":"Went today and the front cashier lady was so rude. She was being rude to me and I heard her being rude to another customer. Not sure what her problem is but it makes me not want to go there any more. Once Don Tortaco opens, I will take my business there just because of this lady. No one wants to be treated rudely for no reason at all."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Restaurant until they gave me spoiled burritos. Went back right away just to let them know that the food was spoiled after I bought it 5 minutes but got denied rudely by the lady that works there and got told to leave. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Love faustos! When me and the hubs are hungry and grumpy we go there and get carne asada fries. They put us in a good mood again! My only problem with this place is their quality of beef. A lot of times I'm chewing on gristle. But it's a small price to pay for A LOT of awesome food at at a great price!"}
{"text":"Has anyone noticed that the quality has gone WAY down recently? The carne asada has almost no flavor. The chips taste like they've been cooked in old, stale oil. The meat is either undercooked, or past its prime. Chicken in the tacos tasted like jerky, with a stale shell. I LOVE this place. I love the people that work there. This needs to get better."}
{"text":"It was our first time at this location. The Chile rellano was not as good here as it is at the other 2 locations that I've to. My family enjoyed their entrees with consisted of Al pastor tacos, rolled chicken tacos and carnitas tacos. I'm sure we'll be back since it's really close to the Heritage soccer parks but I'll just remember not to order the Chile rellano and opt for something else. 
The location seemed smaller than the other locations we've been to but the service was just as fast."}
{"text":"Faustos is perfect if you're looking for comfort Mexican food. Often greasy and loaded with cheese and fried in oil, this place isn't for those on a diet. 

That being said, Faustos is a favorite among the locals and is always busy because their food comes at a great price and is always consistently yummy! They get four stars because of their cleanliness, courtesy, and consistency. The reason they don't get five stars is their lack of a healthy option (they could easily do a taco or chicken salad here) and because of their sometimes long wait times."}
{"text":"Chile relleno burrito is Sooo Good. I order it without rice, watching my carbs a bit"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mexican place. I have to literally hold myself back from eating here every day. Anything I order is perfect and delicious! If quick and authentic Mexican food is what you're looking for, this is it! Love this place!"}
{"text":"The staff is always nice when I come in. The place is clean. They get really busy but this never effects the taste of my food. No matter if the line is out the door I will never wait longer then 5-10 minutes. Salsa bar is always clean and salsa is so yummy!"}
{"text":"Fausto's is the absolute best place for Mexican food in Henderson. I go to Fausto's all the time, whether on the way home or just to suffice my ocassional late-night Mexican food craving. They do burrittos the way they're supposed to, and not surprisingly as I am a burritto lover, my favorite item on the menu is a buritto. So the next time you ever come around College and Horizon, be sure to stop by Fausto's and get my all-time favorite - the Nevada burrito. It's basically a California burritto, but packed with so much meat, sauce, and everything you love about a buritto done to near-perfection. Go to Fausto's now! But be prepared, sometimes there can be a line out the door!"}
{"text":"Fausto's is a great place that serves up quality Mexican food. You can try to phone them up for a take out order, but your order is unlikely to be understood on the other end of the line, and when you show up to grab your goods you might have a little surprise waiting for you. Just being honest.

Fausto's is NOT a sit down type of Mexican restaurant. It's more of a taqueria. I suggest the flautas and the carne asada, personally."}
{"text":"The food here is good, but the best food in the world wouldn't outweigh the horrendous service I experienced here. I've never EVER been spoken to the way I was here, and over simply not knowing that a burrito came with guacamole. I spoke with a woman who I believe was the manager, and she was the rudest, most condescending person I have ever met. I just moved to town and Fausto's is walking distance from my house, so I was excited to be able to walk to get Mexican food all the time. They've lost out on a lot of business from me, because I would have been coming on a very regular basis. Will not return. Especially with Roberto's only a few minutes away."}
{"text":"While I'm sure Fausto's has many other great things on their menu I keep coming back here for one thing...and one thing only. Carne Asada super nachos. While others in my family ask me to pick up Taco Bell stuff down the street,(It's a Saturday tradition around here) I'll swing by Fausto's and order my nachos first. Then when I get home I set their Nacho Bell Grande on the table, then I pull out my Super Nachos which lands on the table with a satisfying thud. Then I open the container and let others bask in the glory of piled high nachos with carne asada steak, piled with guacamole and salsa and cheese and it all has an aroma that quickly overpowers the smell coming from any of the Taco Bell stuff on the table.... 

4 Strong Stars for one menu item? Yeah, it's that good. 

Parking can be a zoo, service is fast and usually friendly too. Definitely worth checking out. 

(Yelp 100 in 2013 Challenge #3)"}
{"text":"Large portions, friendly staff and fresh food. This location has been our go to place for fresh Mexican. The Carne Asada super nachos are so good. Prices are fair food is always good. The staff keeps the restaurant clean and that's not an easy task when you see how many orders come in. This place is busy and they always serve good food with a smile."}
{"text":"This restaurant offers barrio food in the burbs.We shared a chile relleno burrito and large diet coke in addition to a complimentary salad mix of carrots and jalapenos.  Pretty good for inexpensive fast food."}
{"text":"I do prefer Fausto's over Roberto's, but it's still hit or miss. Sometimes, the food is delicious and other times, it SUCKS. I usually rave about the food, especially the Al Pastor, but during my most recent visit, the pork was not flavorful and so, so fatty. It was a real bummer since that's what I order on everything. It's my favorite choice of meat.

The good: Prices. Large portions. Pastor (sometimes).

The bad: Crowded. Inconsistent food quality and service. SOGGY FRIES.

The parking lot is terrible. Fausto's is located at the end of a shopping center corner with awkward lot positioning. That added to the rush of people in and out of this fast food joint, it's a mess. Just be careful.

Overall, mixed feelings. I won't go out of my way to visit, but if I get a hankering for Pastor Tacos, I'll consider a visit if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Loved the food! After a long day this was the best find. Little bit of attitude from the cashier at first but nothing crazy. She was fine by the time we left. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I really enjoy Faustos. Their taste is superior to Roberto's. It's not authentic Mexican people, as good as it might be, there is no cheddar cheese or french fries in authentic Mexican food. 

The carnitas tacos are really good but I recommend ordering them without tomato. By far my favorite is the Nevada Burrito and I would recommend everyone to try it. It is a carne asada burrito with cheese, guacamole, sour cream, and the awesome kick are the french fries inside the burrito. 

The restaurant is a little cram and they are super popular so their flow is pretty constant. You are better off ordering ahead or ordering to go. The parking lot is a bit of a hassle especially during dinner time because of their close proximity to Panda Express and Subway. My biggest issue though is the rude staff unfortunately, my rating is based on taste and food quality. I really don't appreciate it when the cashier lady is talking about \"poison\" and \"what's good for them\" in Spanish, not cool in my book when you're ordering food."}
{"text":"This Cali girl has been away from the west coast for going on 6 years.

It was like being home again. 

Best.Mexican.food.ever.

And they are super nice. 

If you're used to SoCal style taquitos (guacamole and cheese on top) they have them here. So good. And their burritos taste like home.

Can't wait to go back and visit my sister. Need to stay longer so I can eat more often. I have a lot of years to make up for!"}
{"text":"Faustos is just all around great. If you've never been there you're totally missing out. They stay open until midnight which is awesome, and great for drunk munchies. It's cheap and you get a lot of food. Go now, right now. Stop reading and drive to Faustos."}
{"text":"We stop here often
They are relatively quick
The food tastes good and poetions are great
Now if we could only solve the my nachos get soggy in take out"}
{"text":"Great service, always quick and accurate on orders. I've been here at 6am and 11pm and the quality and service were equal...well priced for the portion. I had the carne asada burrito and it looked so good I took a bite before I snapped a picture.  It was stuffed and seasoned well. Would recommend"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch around 12:45 and there was a long line. We waited about 15 minutes to put in our order and sit. I was not in a hurry so I decided to wait, but I did alder people leaving to go eat and the Panda Express next door. I think the food was worth the wait. I had a chile relleno and my hubby had a chimichanga. The portions were big! When I visit again I will just order one dish and share it.

There is also a 'salad bar' that has lime, salsa and cucumbers. I think this was a nice addition for building tacos. 

I would consider this not to be super authentic Mexican food but it does have good quality ingredients and good flavor. I would visit again."}
{"text":"I had breakfast at Fausto's Mexican Grill #3.  The great thing about this joint is that it opens BEFORE 6 AM.  This is huge.  I had the ham/potato/cheese/egg breakfast burrito.  This is enormous and is only $3.95.  Also, the burrito was grilled after, which gives it a little crust on the tortilla.  I love this.  The burrito itself was good, but there was nothing that stood out about it.  It's basic scrambled eggs, cheddar cheese, potatoes and sliced ham.  The potatoes weren't grilled or fried, so they were just kind of mushy in there.  No texture.  That being said, it was good, I'll just try the chorizo next time.

Fausto's has a pretty standard salsa bar.  I had the green, which was good.  It didn't have pico, I'll ask for some next time.  From the reviews, it appears as though I should come for lunch or dinner.  I'll be back..."}
{"text":"Don't go here. They will rip you off. Dude tried charging me $8.00 for a cheese quesadilla. Not a menu item. He just made up that amount probably to put in his pocket. What a thief!!"}
{"text":"Love this place. I'm never disappointed with my food.  Been going here for years! Beats robertos without a doubt."}
{"text":"2016 Yelp 100 Review Challenge -     45/100

The rating and review is based on this location, the quality and flavor of food is the same as other locations. I stopped in after my trek to Boulder City. I was craving Carne Asada Fries. I haven't been to this location or this area (College Drive) in years. I usually go to the one closest to me on Eastern & Horizon Ridge. One thing that stands out about this location is the bold red walls. I like it. 

The carne asada and all ingredients are the same and I'm pleased with what I got. Still the best Carne Asada Fries in Vegas. The portion size for the fries was slightly smaller than the Horizon Ridge location. I say slightly smaller because I managed to eat 3/4 of it, at the other locations I can barely finish half of it, usually it's packed to the brim, you can barely close the styrofoam take out box. 

The service was okay too, the cashier guy didn't respond much but he got my order exactly the way I wanted it, Carne Asada Fries with guacamole and sour cream on the side. The price if I'm not mistaken is a few dollars cheaper too. It was $7.75 here, from what I remember the last time I ordered this it was $10.75? at the other location. So I can't complain. 

Service was quick, my order was out before I finished getting my green and red sauce."}
{"text":"Since moving back from Vegas I miss this place.  Their burritos rival El Gallo in the south suburbs.  Best Mexican food anywhere in Vegas.  Burritos, tacos, tortas, enchiladas, you name it!  It's all good.  Always crowded but they move fast.  Get people in and out.  I love the carrots and jalape√±o pepper station!  The best!"}
{"text":"Love the carne asada fries. Honestly everything we have ever eaten here is good. Service is always quick, even when there is a line."}
{"text":"Service with a smile it ain't. The food was decent, but not leaps or bounds above Roberto's, which is about 30% less. The service needs help. Not a welcome, not a thanks, and the guy who took the order looks annoyed we were taking a while to decide. There was nobody else in line. Probably not coming back to this location. Was also not real clean. Several tables were never cleared the entire time, and the crap on the floor never picked up."}
{"text":"Tried it again, still no meat in the tacos! And sadly it's not as busy as it is historically. I hope they listen and get better."}
{"text":"I've come here a few times and it's always pretty good. The food seems like authentic Mexican to an extent. 

The only downfall is it's always so busy and I have to wait a long time for my order which is kinda a bummer. 

But I always come back! Better than Roberto's."}
{"text":"The best Carne ASada and the best Al Pastor that you will find. Top notch food in a dive restaurant.

Don't miss it!"}
{"text":"I love Faustos for the great mexican food and the price.  This place is always busy with lines sometimes out the door.  What I like best is the chicken tacos and California burrito.  I love the free salad bar that has peppers, carrots and green onions.  The staff are very nice."}
{"text":"This review is not about the food, it is about the horrible, vulgar treatment from an employee.  My boyfriend has lived in Henderson and frequents his location pretty much weekly.  Two of our kids and I arrived at 1152pm to order food. I was told they were open 24 hours( they close at midnight).  When we arrived they had cleaned the grill and looked a little irritated that we were ordering. I apologized for coming in so late and thanked them for preparing our order Nonetheless they took our order and we're preparing our meals. We had just landed at the airport after 3 weeks of visiting my ill father in law who passed away this week.  The only female worker at the time was irritated as she was sweeping and cleaning up mumbling to her coworkers in Spanish how she couldn't finish or lock up because we were there. When our order was ready we went to the counter to pick up food. I told the gentleman thank you and before leaving the counter I said oh is the salsa in the bag?  Obviously this irritated the \"lady\" as she stopped sweeping and said why didn't you ask for it earlier we already put it away. No there's no salsa. I replied no salsa?  She replies you people. We already made your order and you couldn't ask for salsa.  Now excuse my error here but I wasn't asking for additional food to be cooked I was asking for a condiment. Which was put away before I got there. See I went and got a drink and the salsa bar was empty except for the carrots so there wasn't self serve available. I explained this to the lady and she replied it doesn't matter no, no salsa.  The gentleman at the counter went to get some which took all of about a minute. She tells him just give her the damn salsa. She then tells me we are here past closing time because of you people. I asked for the owners name and she refused to give it to me saying he's not here so oh well that's your problem. I told her I would like the owners name and phone number as well as your name. She replied too bad you're not going to get it.  She finally told the cashier to give me a business menu.  Then proceeded to tell me you people ( again with the you people) come in here and threaten the staff by wanting to speak to the owner. We are here past work hours and unlike you we don't get paid past midnight. She also stated there were cameras and that she was a 14 year employee and good luck getting her in trouble. I replied to her I could not believe she could be an employee there that long with that attitude. I explained the situation as she was doing this in front of my kids and told her I would contact management so they could review these tapes.  She began shouting again I have witnesses. You damn white people with your attitudes.  I never realized requesting a condiment was an entitlement especially since I paid for my order.  This continued with her coming out of the front door while I was in my car backing out telling me to kiss her ass. I am requesting that management contact me as I will be looking into some some of resolve since that's what \" you people do\". Also I am curious as to her comment that they do not receive additional pay for staying past midnight?  Isn't that a violation ??? Sadly I don't think I would ever come back to this location because I am not willing to spend my money supporting such horrible behavior. The food is good, the value is good and the other employees were just fine and without issues.  This female really needs to be terminated immediately."}
{"text":"Yummy! Food is always great, portions are good. Long line at times. I will say their prices keep going up."}
{"text":"Never again! There's no need to take rudeness from the man taking the food orders. He made a mistake and charged the wrong amount. When questioned said it was right. We added the amounts and he had gotten the order wrong. When asked about it said \"I'm not deaf\" you ordered wrong. Not the case, but even if it was, that's not the way to handle customers."}
{"text":"It's time for me to update this review.....

I've been eating at Fausto's for years now, and I've never had any complaints.  Other than it can get pretty crowded in the evenings....but I would just suggest calling ahead your order and BOOM! Problem solved.

I am adding another star based off of the addition of the \"Nevada Burrito\" to their menu.  It's their own version of a California Burrito, except with all of the good stuff (guac, sour cream, etc).  I usually find CAB's too dry, but the NVB is freaking delicious.  I've also always been a fan of their carne asada fries and rolled tacos.

The portions are big and the prices are decent.  The service is generally friendly.  Parking is tight, because it's a small area of the center."}
{"text":"I adore Mexican food. I'm not Mexican, but it's my favorite food to eat and really the only food I have a serious craving for.

I grew up eating well because both of my parents were from the South and were great cooks. I think my Mexican food addiction developed because my parents prepared delicious barbecue, fried chicken, steak, mashed potatoes, macaroni, ham, pies, cakes, etc, but I ate Mexican food \"only every now and then\" through our Mexican friends and neighbors who lived on both sides of us in Orange County.

I have been ordering take-out at this Fausto's for approximately 9 years. I don't care if they raise their prices. I don't understand why that bothers anyone. Prices rise. It's a fact of life.

I have also never had one problem with this restaurant. I always order from Fausto's (or any fast-food chain) during a decent earlier hour, during somewhat busier times when the food is fresh and hot. I have my few favorite dishes and have never had a bad meal. I'm also prepared to order. I don't stand at the counter, asking the cashier a dozen questions about the food or what I should buy. He is not a waiter, and other customers are usually lining up. Besides, anyone can find answers and see food photos right here on Yelp.  

In addition, I have NEVER had a problem with the woman at the counter. Surprised? I go to Fausto's regularly and I don't personally know her--or any of the workers. I'm just ordering my food. The pretty lady has never acted rudely toward me. I don't get twisted out of shape because the workers are not smiling and joking and \"doing a song and dance\" with me. I get in and get out. I don't care about the petty stuff that some folks are complaining about. And if I had a problem, I would not make a scene. I might call them later or talk to someone when other customers are not around. 

What irritates me about a lot of the customers at Fausto's is when they DO NOT TIP. So, this isn't a big restaurant, but it's also not a drive-thru. And Fausto's food sure beats Taco Bell any day. It's a tiny kitchen to work in, but those workers HUSTLE to get the orders fulfilled. They probably get depressed when they see their tips at the end of the day. I see many people ordering A LOT of food at Fausto's. They don't look poor to me. Why do they not leave a little tip? I bet you most of those folks wouldn't think twice about walking thru a casino to a buffet, stopping along the way, and carelessly wasting $5 in a losing slot machine. What is a dollar? Seriously, folks!

There is a bakery in quaint downtown Henderson that basically \"tells\" its customers to tip, and I bet that place takes in good tips for donuts, cakes, cookies, etc. It's just a bakery! Fausto's is food. Good, substantial Mexican food for your belly. 

If Fausto's was closing at midnight and I walked in at that late hour while they were cleaning up, storing and tossing out food, and preparing to leave, I would have apologized profusely and shown a lot of gratitude and left them the most \"generous tip\" I could afford. That is exactly what I would have done. 

I'll bet that many customers have given Fausto's workers a lot of headaches, but they never leave the workers a tip. It's not nice to do that here in the Las Vegas area. I can't name anybody, nor would I, but it seems like people are so greedy--yet cheap! We should all know better and do better.

As for me, well, I'm just so thankful that I have found such decent Mexican fast food closer to my home in Henderson."}
{"text":"WOW, I have been coming to this location for the past 5 years.   I have never had a problem.  food has always been awesome no complaints.   After a long day at work i was starving.... so ether IN n Out or tacos.... well decided with fausto's instead of roberto\"s because they are usually  less busy.  I call this location round 11pm  asked if they were closed.  woman said they don't close til midnight.   My first thought is YAY after a 13 hour work day on a airplane.   made my order she said 5 mins.    perfect I thought as i am only 5-10 mins away.   I drive straight there and walk in and it is extremely busy.    there are two cooks calling out orders.  being proactive and patient... I stood at register for about 3minutes ..no help.... I decided I will just grab my salsa and let them catch up.   As I  am filling up salsa the cashier \"rosio\"  leaned over and yelled from counter \"did you have a to go order\"   Me : yes be just a second i have to put some lids on the salsa.. as others were waiting behind me . immediately rosio  shouts  from register in front of everyone ... you need to pay right now!!!   ok give me just a second.   i get to register i told her sorry i walked in they were busy. she said she closes in 45 minutes    i said well why are you being so assertive to me i was only being proactive as there was no one to ring me up.   said its only 11.20 heres my money but I don't deserve to be yelled at .  I told her she was being a asshole and unprofessional  she said well i was busy doing other work... so is it not ok to be patient and get my condiments while i wait my turn to pay..... as she was not there .   She got  very irate in front of other customers because i told her she was being unprofessional and an ass to me for no reason its was only 11.20pm  told her she continued to yell at me i would take my business elsewhere.  I  did pay for my food but will never ever return to that location.   but she  continued and continued to be mad in front of other customers.  i asked for managers name and she refused.     As much as I love their food and the breakfast ¬†as long as she is in charge of orders i will never come here as I have been in the service industry for 15 years."}
{"text":"The cashier took our order of a 2 taco combo for $5 and did not give us a receipt. When I got my food it was not the combo. I brought it up, and he said no I didn't. I pointed out that he'd even handed me a small drink that comes with the combo, and he continued to fight me over the rice and beans. I left without the rest of my food. 

The friend that I was with was charged $6.50 and he entered $2.50. She confirmed that she wanted the burrito and he said yes, $6.50. The cash register still said $2.50. No receipt to confirm."}
{"text":"This Faustos location has always been my favorite in the city. I have been coming to this one since 06-07 and it never lets me down! I love the fact that they are adding new things to the menu as well! This is one of my Go-To spots in town. My favorite thing on their menu, and also the item I recommend to everyone who is trying this location for the first time, is the Nevada burrito. It is nice in size and the ingredients are always fresh."}
