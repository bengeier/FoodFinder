{"text":"Came for lunch after a visit at the bio dome.  Loved the general mao poutine.  The place is very kids friendly and managed to find street parking on the side street."}
{"text":"Great restaurant.  The place is outdated and the Air Conditioner was put, but the food was so good and the waitress was so nice and accommodating.  Had the cheese pizza (so good) and the fish and chips.  Love their crunchy batter.  I would make it a regular stop, if it wasn't 600 miles away from home."}
{"text":"An epic gut bomb, not too far from the Olympic Park.  Not the cheapest fancy french fries in the world, but worth a splurge."}
{"text":"Bon accueil, en tant que touriste qui voulait un plat authentique, j'ai pas été déçu. Les frites sont des frites fraiches et non surgelé et ce détail fait la différence.
La carte était diversifié et proposait autre chose que des poutines. Des sièges pour bébé étaient disponible ce qui en fait un établissement adapté pour une petite famille.
Une bonne poutine pour tout le monde, c'est cool. Satisfait :)"}
{"text":"The poutine was good. Expensive for what it was though. A clever menu, a cool motif and helpful staff kicked this from a two-star to a three-star review. If you're in Hochelaga you could do worse."}
{"text":"poutins are good, especially the butter chicken poutin. the fried pickles on the other hand are to die for! make sure you try them! good spot, service is a bit slow, but overall good food. i've been back a few times already, and it never disappoints."}
{"text":"My daughter and I tried poutine for the first time here, and we have really been enjoying it. Went to this place twice in one week. Good food, nice decor, laid-back atmosphere, fast service."}
{"text":"J'ai été manger là rien avoir avec le p'tit resto du coin ennuient et bien au contraire une belle hambiance et une variété de potine et des prix intéressant pour ma part je l'ai  adopté..."}
{"text":"NIce poutine. Had the Steak and Black pepper. Awesome! Great service and great food!"}
{"text":"I came across this place after staying at a friend's place nearby. She recommended that I go to this place if I wanted really good authentic poutine. I am so glad I got the chance to. I stopped by here on a Saturday night. Located in the Hochelaga neighbourhood, you will miss it if you aren't looking carefully. 

This place offers a wide variety of different poutines. I tried the small buffalo chicken poutine. It was amazing. The small portion in my opinion was a meal itself. It came out steamy and hot. Fries were thickly cut and smothered in delicious gravy. Cheesecurds seemed fresh as you could hear the squeaky sounds as you devoured every bite. Buffalo chicken was a hit in my books. I also sampled some of my friend's smoked meat poutine, which was equally as good, sweet Montreal smoked meat covered with melted cheesecurds and gravy. This place also serves beer as well, I would have sampled some, but I was too full from the small poutine.

I will say that this place is fairly pricey for a poutine place, for two small poutines, and a soft drink will run you about $25. But I think it is a treat if you go here once in a while. Most of their poutines will average about $8-11 for a small size.

The ambiance itself is pretty modern and laid back. We both sat along the front as people watched as we devoured our poutine. Would recommend stopping by and checking this place out."}
{"text":"Great burgers and very nice staff.  Great atmosphere too.  Pretty easy walk from the biodome."}
{"text":"Delicious, and such a friendly place. They even humored my terrible French. Merci bien!"}
{"text":"Very great place. Easy to find.  Right on the corner. Had the special falafel sandwich and a pulled pork sandwich. One of the better sandwiches we have had. Well worth it. Even if your not in the area. Search the place out."}
{"text":"Really good poutine, but beware of the large size, it is much bigger than you think. Nice atmosphere and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Really expensive for what it is. Nice decor , ok food.  
The staff are great ... But yeah I'm not paying 8.50 $ for a chicken sandwich made with two chicken-fingers... Great sauce , nice bread ... But 850$ it wasn't sauce from heaven . I might try the homemade pogo but that's it , unfortunately I can't justify the price .and I'm not that cheap of a person"}
{"text":"C'est le meilleure Poutine en ville. La salade de choux maison est divine. 

Best Poutine in town. The homemade coleslaw is out of this world."}
{"text":"I'll keep this simple, like the menu: Best. Poutine. Ever. 

Got a large of the smoked meat, and it was literally the best poutine I've eaten--and I've had a few. The gravy, curds, and meat were all balanced in perfect proportions so that you got a little of each down to the last bite.

I ALSO had the best corndogs (or pogos as they call them here) I've ever eaten, with a house-made batter that's simply to die for and a seasoned mayo or ketchup for dipping (both are good).

A little pricey, but worth going out of the way for. Be sure to check for FB or Yelp check-in promotions for a free drink or such before you order."}
{"text":"Ambiance agréable, Poutine Centrale offre une très large sélection de... poutines !!! J'ai goûté à la simple Galvaude (poulet & pois verts) et elle était bien bonne ! Ils offrent une poutine au poulet au beurre, une autre au bacon & oignons, etc. La petite poutine est bien assez grosse pour un repas !!! Mes amies étaient, elles aussi, très satisfaites de leur sortie."}
{"text":"This attractive, industrial-style restaurant had a wide variety of interesting poutines. We went for the steak-au-poivre and Szechuan style -- both came out quickly and were delicious!

This is a great place to sneak away from the stadium or gardens for a quick snack; we'd definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Quel beau choix de poutines! On en retrouve au général tao, au steak au poivre, au boeuf à la séchoinaise, etc... Les frites sont bonnes et recouverte de juste assez de sauce. 

Ma suggestion: la spéciale Noël à la tourtière avec ketchup aux fruits et betteraves. le mélange des saveurs est parfait. 

Petit conseil: La petite est amplement suffisante! Le bol a l'air petit à première vue, mais avec la montagne de garniture servie sur le dessus, c'est bien assez! 

La salade de chou vaut également la peine. En fait, elle est exactement comme je les aime! 

Le décor est assez original. L'endroit est décoré de sac de patates à l'effigie du restaurant. Les bancs sont de gros rectangles en bois fixés au sol. Les tables sont en métal. J'aime beaucoup.

C'est le restaurant parfait pour écouter un match de sport entre amis sur les télévisions accrochées au mur ou simplement pour rassasier l'envie d'une bonne poutine."}
{"text":"Meilleur poutine en ville, ca fait des année que je viens ici moi et ma blonde, tu peu vraiment pas te tanner ici. Jai essayer toute les sortes mais la reguliere est ma préferé"}
{"text":"Really great poutine. Best I've ever had. Creative choices and specials, good ingredients, nice big portions, great prices, and a really cool little spot with plenty of tables."}
{"text":"Our first ever poutine. The counter staff was friendly and very knowledgeable and helpful regarding the menu. We opted for the original poutine. The fries were crispy, gravy was hot and the cheese curds were fresh."}
{"text":"D'excellentes poutines dans le quartier Hochelaga ! Vous devez essayer la poutine au poulet au beurre ou la Jacqueline !"}
{"text":"Another local spot in Montréal... Very good food! You must try it! You just can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Our first time to eat Poutine, like fries on steroids, yum!  We liked the sloppy Joe better than original/classified but both great!"}
{"text":"Crispy thin fries and chunky bits of cheese curds. Gravy is clearly not actual gravy but rather thinned out powder based beef flavour. Pogos sausages have a good satisfying snap and the batter is on point. Be careful not to poke your mouth inside with the stick though, as they use wood skewers instead of the traditional and much safer popsicle stick."}
{"text":"While waiting for our show at the Planetarium, we decided we were too hungry to wait til after the show. The food court options were dismal so with the help of Yelp, we found this little gem. Two pithers of Cheval Blanc and some yummy poutine later, we were back in time for our show and loving life. we were pretty much the only people eating here at that time, but everything was made to order and delicious. Portions are generous, I wanted a large but got talked into a small bowl and that was more than enough."}
{"text":"Butter chicken poutine was delicious.  Nice and saucy, not spicy served hot and location is tucked away from the crowds.
Very friendly staff.
We had a great experience."}
{"text":"Finally a great quality pouting in HoMa. Decor is super cool industrial. The poutines are excellent. Personally the small was too small for my appetite and the large is a little more than i need so I usually go for the large. I tried the Szechwan poutine which was thankfully not spicy but very unique. The italian spaghetti sauce is home made so it has nice big chunks of tomatoes and onions. I am yet try the indian butter chicken poutine....I'll post pics of that..."}
{"text":"had late dinner, escaping from cooking by myself. restaurant was so empty but fries were fresh and poutine was gooood. 

but since it has quality, we need to pay for it. its ok for normal dish but pricy as a poutine. if your definition of poutine includes \"cheap\", maybe its not your favorite. but they do serve \"fast\" and \"yummy\" for sure."}
{"text":"Small is too small for my appetite while large too big to finish. So go there not so hungry or starving. Regardless of their size and portion the poutine there are amazing. It doesn't matter what kind of meat or topping you want on it all works well with their potatoes, poutine sauce and cheese. You save a lot of you share a large and don't forget to check in to get your free soda. So brings you friends! 
The homemade corn dogs are good too try it!"}
{"text":"Very good poutine. They have many different choices of poutine to choose from and they make the food very quickly"}
{"text":"Wonderful food, quick service, lots of interesting specialty poutine. Very unique interior makes for a cool atmosphere. Staff was bilingual and courteous. Parking was slightly tricky, we had to park down the street and walk a ways to get there."}
{"text":"My favorite poutine place in the city. Great, interesting menu. Good service, good beer. Lots of fun people watching too!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful place tucked away in the city.  Walked there from botanical garden.  A bit long but well worth the trip for down home cooking.  Down with the commercial burger!  No competition."}
{"text":"Bloody good poutine! I ordered the smoked meat poutine and a corndog, both were amazing. The corndogs are made with a in house batter that is nice and fluffy resembling the texture of a donut. But be warned only order a large poutine if you are prepared for war! The large poutine is simply massive, I had a hard time putting it all away. I could not stop eating it because it was soooo good! The staff there was super welcoming and friendly. If you are visiting the Olympic Parc you absolutely must stop here!"}
{"text":"My wife and I got lunch here after our visit to the botanical garden. If you're looking for lunch around that area I highly recommend Poutine Centrale!! She got a burger and I got the pulled pork and it was some of the best sandwiches I've had. The employees were extremely friendly. The food took a little while to prepare but it was obvious that was because they really care to make every order just right. Will definitely come back whenever we're in the area."}
{"text":"City of Poutine, and this restaurant is close to the botanical garden. I ordered the smoke meat flavor, very nice. Already recommended my friends to go there when travel at Montreal."}
{"text":"When visiting Montreal I highly recommend grabbing some Poutine. That being said, this place had one of the tastiest I've ever had. Not only did they serve traditional classic style Poutine, they also offered up goumet versions with a twist. We ordered the La Smoked Meat (smoked meat, curds, gravy) and the La Merguez  (merguez sausage, onions, curds, gravy). Both were super yummy, perfectly seasoned, and had a good cheese-to-fries ratio. Service was fast and friendly, highly recommended, would love to go back."}
{"text":"Went here with my daughter and her friend on a day trip to Montreal to see the biodome and science centre. Thank you for having \"mini\" sizes for the kids. My husband and I each got our own specialty creation.  The set up was a bit odd. Kinda a we put it at the front and you pick it up... oh and make sure you clear your own dishes. Which, I wouldn't have minded if the price were a bit lower. Other than that the fare was fabulous."}
{"text":"Ok, so I'm not sure I've ever been to a real poutine shop. I have been served it here and there but this place is only about it. 

I opted for the beef and onions and mushrooms. I was starving and saw the petit bowl and went for the gross size. Mistake. Petit is way more than enough. 

In any case, loved it. Absolutely loved it. I think in cold weather I might be here a lot more. But I really liked the space with the open windows and breeze which you wouldn't get if it were colder out. Anyway, my wife had the Mao chicken, and holy cow - super!!

I am not an expert but I'd be hard pressed to find another place better than this one."}
{"text":"I loved the \"pierogi wannabe\" poutine special. it was incredibly delicious. 

The place is cute, well-decorated, and they take cards. I'm not a poutine expert but this seems amazing!"}
{"text":"Wanna try other poutines but we needed English menu although one of the staffs explained in English at that time"}
{"text":"We were traveling in montreal and we had to try real poutine. We found this place while we were at the olympic park. The poutine was great, and sandwiches were awesome."}
{"text":"Anyone who likes poutine has got to try this Poutine Restaurant.

Very Welcoming and rustic  decor.  Staff was pleasant and attentive to our needs. ( we asked to put the pickles on the side and not in our smoked meat poutine)   Food (poutine) was amazing,  Five of us took 4 different styles of Poutine so we could try some of the varieties amongst ourselves.  I had the Smoked meat poutine, can't recall the name on the menu, but it was very  very good, a must try. 

 I had tasted the Pulled pork Poutine, honestly that is my next choice next time I go.  All and all a must stop for poutine lovers.

Bravo to the Staff."}
{"text":"Interesting poutinerie in HoMa. Industrial vibe pushed to its fullest - and it's gorgeous. The place tries a little hard with the bottles of Sriracha everywhere, almost screaming \"we'd never be so uncool as to have ketchup around\".  

But right to business: When your business name is Poutine Centrale, you got to deliver one darn good poutine. Good fries, the right curds, and a good gravy. Then, you can think about all the \"toppings\" and sides. 

The fries were excellent, \"blanched\", hot, and a bit serving. Likewise the cheese was fresh, in small chucks. The gravy was rather unimpressive, with no taste. I wondered whether it's just a powder base - which would be surprising given that it's should be able to make their gravy from scratch considering the amount they sell. The smoked meat version was excellent, with LOTS of meat that we couldn't finish.  

All in all, an excellent addition to the neighborhood. Other than their gravy needing some love, I think it's an excellent poutine spot if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Une nouvelle poutinerie dans mon quartier a ouvert ses portes, il n'y a pas très longtemps.  Le choix de poutines est assez grand.  J'y suis allé à 2 reprises.

La première fois, J'ai pu goûté à celle sichuannaise (boxeur, poivron, oignon et poivre de sichuanne) avec un pogo maison.  La poutine était bonne et le goût du poivre juste assez subtil pour lui donner un peu de mordant.  Le pogo était croustillant et très bon.  Après cette première visite, je trouvais que l'endroit avait du potentiel.

La deuxième fois, j'ai pris celle au poulet au beurre et j'ai eu la chance de goûter également à la poutine bourguignonne.  Ma première surprise fût celle au poulet au beurre.  Elle était savoureuse et les épices juste assez dosées.  Le mariage avec le fromage et les frites était réussi.  Mais, mon coup de coeur va à la bourguignonne.  Le boeuf effiloché était savoureux et fondant en bouche.  Vraiment, j'étais jaloux de la personne qui l'avait commandée.

Bref, si vous êtes dans Hochelaga ou ailleurs et que vous avez envie d'une poutine, c'est vraiment un incontournable.  Le service est rapide et les cuisiniers sont tout à fait sympathiques.  Une visite s'impose!"}
{"text":"After visiting the botanic garden, we took a 5-min bus ride to this cozy place. 
Ordered the smoked meet poutine and La Jacqueline. Both were very good. Plus, we checked in here in Yelp, and guess what, we got some free soft drinks!! 
Better value than the other top ranked poutineries in Montreal!"}
{"text":"Wow! Is what I have to say about this place. I wasn't expecting the quality of their burgers and other items on the menu to be of this high standard.

The burgers are excellent. The fries are freshly cut and the atmosphere is cool! 

Good joint! Better than a typical fast food restaurant."}
{"text":"A poutine é muito boa e fomos muito bem atendidos. A porção grande serve bem duas pessoas e o preço muito justo. Uma boa dica para quem visita o Jardim Botânico de Montreal."}
{"text":"3.5 Stars!

UYE with Adam and Julia!! I've had this place in my bookmarks for a while but it's a bit out of my way so never thought I'd go. 

I ordered the regular poutine and was a bit disappointed there was so little cheese but the appeal of this place is to get their speciality poutines. Adam got the bs which is bason sausage and it was delicious. 

They have lots of seating but not in a organized ways. They're mostly tables for groups. I also found that since the seating was only stools, it was uncomfortable. 

But even then the place is great! A really great neighbourhood joint. I think it's great for takeouts or group hangouts at lunch."}
{"text":"Pretty authentic, higher-quality poutinerie in the French section of town - so authentic, in fact, that the servers could barely speak passable English when I visited. Heureusement, j'ai etudié un peu de français en lycée. 

There are a lot of toppings and varieties to choose from, and the combos (which come with a soda) are a decent value. The meat toppings are fairly good quality and pretty tasty, unlike generic poutine, so you feel as if you're eating something that's somewhat upscale instead of the plebeian comfort food that it's made out to be. 

Even my picky parents of Chinese descent, who usually gripe endlessly if we're not going out for Chinese food, sucked it up and said that they actually enjoyed the opportunity to \"eat like locals.\" Now that says a lot. C'est bon / not bad!"}
{"text":"Loved the smoked meat poutine!
Took my mom here when she visited Montral for her first poutine ever. 
Now the smoked meat will forever be assosiated with poutine in her mind:).
Nice place!"}
{"text":"We live not far away from this so we decided we just had to try it and we were really pleasantly surprised. Service was fast and friendly.  And the poutines were delicious. We tried the 'Boeuf braisé à l'érable' which was just maple-y enough, and the Sussi with smoked sausages just smoked the way I like it. I also tried a home made Pogo, really good with the curry sauce, and not greasy at all as they usually are. We had the small poutines and it was definitely enough, and the prices are not too expensive as well. If you don't want to queue outside waiting for a table at La banquise but still want a nice atmosphere while eating a good poutine, this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"Cool vibe. Friendly staff.  Funky music.  Good food. Poutine Jacqueline was everyone's favorite.  Definitely worthwhile."}
{"text":"Absolutely a must go for some delish Poutine. Place made us feel at home, rustic and charming. Servers were the French version of the Brooklyn servers for brunch. A nice flare of French feel while enjoying this house specialty. My son had a Corn Dog, batter made in House and not from a frozen bag. Nice! A great spot to visit while visiting Montreal from NYC."}
{"text":"Good service.  We are poutine novices, but as a family of eight, we all enjoyed the poutine.  We also had hamburgers and pogos another night, which were excellent.   Try the curried ketchup and the harrisa mayo for dipping your fries.  We liked them both!"}
{"text":"We had the poutine here and liked the ratio of fries to toppings. It was a rainy Sunday, not sure if that was the reason but there were very few people there. It is accessible by Metro and had great poutine and friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Excellent poutine. Lots of variety for everyone's different tastes. Friendly service. No complaints!"}
{"text":"Nous sommes allé à ce restaurant après une visite au jardin botanique et à l'Insectarium. Nous voulions essayer quelque chose de différent des restaurants de l'Espace pour la vie. Nous n'avons pas été déçus. Un très grand choix de poutines originales dans un décor urbain/rétro. Le service est fait au comptoir comme dans une cafétéria dans des plateaux d'aluminium. Il y a une grande table, des comptoirs et une terrasse derrière. Un peu petit comme espace. Le resto était vide quand nous y sommes allés, mais j'imagine que le soir ça doit être bondé. 
J'ai adoré ma poutine au sloppy Joe. Très goûteuse. Par contre, les frites au centre étaient un peu molles.
Mon copain à essayé la BS (bacon et saucisses). Le bacon était délicieux!
Ma soeur a pris la porc effiloché. Un bon goût de barbecue fumé. Je les recommande toutes!
La petite portion était juste parfaite pour une collation d'après-midi, surtout considérant son prix. J'y retournerai définitivement. La canette de soda gratuite contre un check-in a été très appréciée par la grande chaleur d'été."}
{"text":"Belle liste de poutines.
Sauce brune fade.
Frites OK, sans de wow.
Prix: chère pour peu de goût 

La Jacqueline est, selon moi, la meilleure.
Nous avons aussi essayer la poutine du temps des fêtes (viandes haché style tourtière avec ketchup maison). Belle idée, mais en bouche très décevant. 

Pour une poutine traditionnelle, un endroit comme la belle province serait un meilleur choix."}
{"text":"This was my second time coming to Canada. The first time, I wanted to make sure we got proper poutine while in Toronto. Unfortunately, the only poutine we had was at a chain restaurant and it came as a side with our food. It was not that great. My poutine meter had not been filled properly. This time I wanted to make sure we did it right. After walking around the Biodome that afternoon, we decided to walk around the neighborhood looking for lunch. We found this place and I knew right away that we needed to eat here. I ordered the poutine la chou chou and my boyfriend had the poutine la Jacqueline. Sarah was at the register and helped me figure out what everything was in English as my French is not that great. (Merci, Sarah!) After taking that first bite of poutine I knew we had made a wise decision to stop here. The atmosphere was fun, the food was incredible and the beer was good too! I also finished my entire petite bowl of la chou chou poutine and I don't regret a thing. I kind of wish there was a way to bring them to NYC. Thank you, Poutine Centrale!"}
{"text":"Went to the Planetarium last night and used Yelp to find somewhere local and interesting to eat. Can't go wrong with a poutine place!

To start with, the service was great. My friend and I couldn't decide what to order and they were patient and helpful.

We ordered a large Hochelaga poutine with bacon, onions and mushrooms, and a small General Mao poutine with chicken and green onions.

First of all, they get the basics right. The cheese was squeaky good and the fries were fresh cut. My only criticism would be that the large size poutine has so many fries underneath that it's almost impossible not to end up with a big bowl of soggy fries left over by the time the toppings are done - which we were too full to finish. I guess we should have ordered two smalls.

The bacon was crisp and delicious, though I would have liked to have seen them left cut a bit larger. The mushrooms and onions were caramelized and so flavourful that I almost forgot about the bacon. The best part was the General Mao chicken, which was crisp on the outside, tender on the inside, and coated in a sweet, sticky sauce that would fit in at a good Chinese restaurant. The only thing missing was some heat, which is usually expected with a Mao style preparation.

This was definitely a pleasant surprise and I would go again if I was in the area."}
{"text":"Uh, this place is awesome. Super friendly and helpful staff since we are ignorant Americans that speak zero French.  Poutine was out this world and the veg burger was the jam. Def check It out"}
{"text":"On vacation after a bus and train ride. Would have been appropriate to post a notice on the website instead of the door of the establishment."}
{"text":"Delicious poutine, very casual atmosphere, great choices and decent prices! Great option if you visited the Montreal botanical gardens and want a lunch option. My friend and I took the bus there and it was easy enough to find. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Excellent poutine! Lots of selections. It wasn't busy when we came here for an early dinner, so we were served very quickly.

The price is decent for what you get. Would recommend this place :)"}
{"text":"We wanted to try this place before the Women's World Cup Semi Final match.  Apparently we weren't the only ones who had this idea.  Place was full of soccer fans and they had nothing left from the menu except poutine.  We'd had our fill of fries, however, so we struck out for options.  Looked like a place worth trying, but when 51,000 people show up for an event two blocks away, it is understandable that they sold out of some items."}
{"text":"Even though I'm not absolutely in love with poutine, I'll give this place 5 stars for..
 
1. the best of the 3 \"poutines\" I had while in Montreal
2. really chill friendly service (in English, cuz my French is rudimentary at best)
3. A really good burger for my wife who is even less keen on poutine than I am (aka, good options for any companions who may not want the iconic dish).

As for poutine in general?  I like french fries.  I like cheese.  Gravy is ok with me. BUT I don't like soggy fries, which is what the bottom half of poutine is because it's drenched in gravy.

They have lots of options for poutine toppings though, so if you really want to try it while you're in Montreal, I'd highly recommend this place. A 5-ish minute walk from the Viau station, which is on the northern end of the Olympic Park/Biodome area"}
{"text":"This is the one restaurant I find myself going to every other day. Great tasting for. Just wish the fires tasted fresher and less oily more often"}
{"text":"This was a great find! My son & I were on a Spring Break road trip & found this Nirvana of poutine. Many variations on the original, all generous & delicious."}
{"text":"C'est grâce à Yelp et aux yelpeurs que j'ai découvert Poutine Centrale ! Merci !
Après une visite de la tour de Montréal et de marche dans la neige, besoin de manger une bonne poutine et d'être au chaud.
On arrive à Poutine Centrale, la serveuse très sympa nous explique les différents choix de poutine, on se décidé pour une grosse Jacqueline avec un pogo et un burger.
Miam ! La poutine est vraiment bonne avec ses petits oignons verts, on a même pas réussi à la finir à deux !
Le bon plan Yelp, c'est qu'avec le check-in, ils nous offrent un soda gratuit, c'est très sympa !
Le décor est chouette et on a vraiment passé un bon moment.
Si vous êtes dans le quartier, c'est LA bonne place pour une poutine, que vous l'aimiez classique ou fancy."}
{"text":"Vivant à Québec depuis maintenant 10 mois, en terme de poutine je ne connais de \"bonne\" que celle de chez Ashton ... J'en ai goûté certaines dans des restaurants, mais aucune n'étaient pourtant à la hauteur de la poutine que propose Ashton's. Alors quand, lors d'un passage à Montréal nos amis nous proposent d'aller manger une poutine à Poutine Centrale, j'en ai été ravie ! Et en effet, je n'ai pas été déçue. Les frites maisons sont très bonnes, la sauce et le fromage également. De plus, prendre la \"petite\" poutine est déjà bien consistante, nul besoin donc (à moins d'avoir un appétit d'ogre) de se précipiter vers la grande. J'ai donc choisi La vache qui rit et mon chum a eu la mauvaise surprise de prendre une grande poutine la Jacqueline. Je dis mauvaise expérience non pas à cause du plat en lui même (qui était très bon) mais à cause de la taille ! Il ne s'attendait pas à en avoir autant.
Le lieu est sympathique, l'organisation de la salle, avec son côté rustique, rend le lieu pas mal chaleureux et convivial. Le prix est très abordable par rapport à la qualité des produits. Le personnel est accueillant. 
Très belle surprise, moi qui ne suis pas une fan de poutine, mais je crois que j'y retournerais bien volontiers de temps en temps lors de mes passages à Montréal !"}
{"text":"Traveling through Montreal and had to get a fix of poutine. What better place than this!  We decided to try two of their dozens of options and we ended up with La Général Mao (nice and spicy), and La Jacqueline (can't go wrong with bacon). There are two sizes. The small one will absolutely fill you up and then some - fortunately our waitress kept me from making the mistake of ordering two larges for the two of us! The large is really only for sharing. Fun place - would love to go back."}
{"text":"Excellent resto de cartier. Peut même déjà dire que j'en suis un habitué! Beau décort. Frites sublime. Que dire des hamberger ! Mmm! Et bien sur,LA poutine! Un pure délice. Une excellente sauce. Terasse a l'arrière, tv pour un bon match de hockey! Bref, un sublime petit resto de cartier!:-)"}
{"text":"Great selection. 
Yelp wants me to write more, but we are talking about poutine...
The cheese could have been more fresh, compared to other places, but it was as expected.
 :)"}
{"text":"Quelle surprise à une si courte de distance de marche de mon appartement!

Tout d'abord, le décor industriel, avec ses surfaces de métal, son éclairage cru par endroits, ses bancs bien carrés, et la disposition des lieux montrent un souci réel du détail, ce qui est étonnant venant d'une poutinerie.

Ensuite, le choix. Une vingtaine de poutines, une dizaine de sandwiches, des pogos maison (hummm!). 

En deux visites, on a essayé quatre poutines, toutes très bonnes (surtout celle au poulet au beurre, une spécialité, et la Jacqueline). La général Mao m'a un peu déçu, c'était un peu confus dans mon bol. Et les pogos sont délicieux.

On commande à la caisse, et c'est la cuisine qui appelle notre nom quand c'est prêt. La portion est généreuse (une petite poutine et un pogo c'est suffisant), et c'est servi dans de beaux bols creux (pas d'assiette où les frites s'échappent sur les côtés ni de plats jetables) déposés dans un plateau style cafétéria de prison (j'adore!).

Bémol: la rapidité du service. À ma dernière visite il y avait quelques clients devant nous, et ça ne sortait pas assez rapidement. Pourtant, il y avait quatre cuisiniers qui s'affairaient et semblaient très efficaces, mais ce fut très très long.

Surprise, une petite terrasse à l'arrière (à la succursale Hochelaga) offre un petit havre de tranquillité!"}
{"text":"Mon copain m'a fait découvrir cet endroit et je doit dire que j'ai tout simplement adoré! Le service est super agréable et la poutine est ma foi hallucinante! Des combinaisons que l'on ne retrouve pas dans tous les fast-food (exemple: poutine général tao, poulet au beurre et même au pâte chinois!) 
Bref ce resto de quartier hochelaga vaut le détour!"}
{"text":"A place specializing in poutine is probably the best way to try the Canadian national cuisine. This place has everything - from your classic potato gravy and cheese poutine to much more complex variants of this \"can you really go wrong?\" dish. Had mine with bacon and eggs and it was delicious. Word of advice though - portion sizes are pretty big so be careful before taking on a large poutine all by yourself"}
{"text":"Yum!!!! Fast, friendly service, nice atmosphere and decor, free parking on street, DELICIOUS Poutine!! Can't go wrong! (Summer bonus: super pleasant patio with partial sun/partial shade!)"}
{"text":"Stomach was growling after a morning of walking through Jardin Bontanique. Luckily Poutine Centrale was just a quick Bixi ride away.

My sister and I shared the grosse size of La Sautée (onions, mushrooms, herbs and more) and it was the perfect portion. 

The cheese curds were squeaky and we liked that the gravy wasn't too salty or greasy. Pricing was also reasonable, although I was bummed they didn't take MasterCard (Visa or cash only).

While we were stuffing our faces, there was a delivery guy bringing in sacks and sacks of potatoes. Good to know they use real, fresh potatoes!

Definitely come here if you're in the area and craving some poutine! Happy Grubbin'! :)

{"text":"Mi figue, mi raisin. 

Ma première visite chez Poutine Centrale ne m'a pas renversé. La poutine est correcte oui, mais pour un resto qui en fait sa spécialité, elle pourrait être meilleure. Mes papilles de québécois n'ont pas été séduites par la sauce qui ne goûte à peu près rien. L'autre problème, est que le service n'est pas très rapide. Les deux seuls cuisiniers avaient de la difficulté à répondre à la demande. Pour un Pogo maison et une petite poutine aux légumes, j'ai attendu pas loin de 15 minutes. Même pour l'heure du diner, ce n'est pas une excuse. Un resto de ce genre se doit d'être plus rapide. De plus, lors de ma première visite ici, l'endroit était emboucané, à un point tel que les yeux m'en piquait à la fin de mon repas. Un problème de ventilation aux cuisines ? Surement. 

Les points positifs : Les pogos maison sont carrément délicieux et croustillants. Je les recommande. Le menu de poutine est très varié et offre plus d'une vingtaine de choix différents. On gagne donc à revenir et tenter d'autres poutines. C'est d'ailleurs ce que je vais faire car je m'attendais à bien plus de ce sympathique resto de quartier."}
{"text":"Service was great. Workers were really nice. Burger and fries were good. Drinks were canned."}
{"text":"Some of my out of town friends who dearly love poutine and constantly ask me to bring them to new poutine locations that they read about online brought me to Poutine Centrale to try out their poutine.

Esthetically the place looks quaint with their wooden tables and chairs. You'll order from a huge counter and then the food is brought to you and while it looks quaint enough one thing is pretty apparently after some time after sitting... it's simply not comfortable seating. There are no \"banquets\" or any seats of any sort that provide back support and thus if you want to sit back and enjoy your meal and chat with your friends you'll be mistaken. Perhaps this is a strategy of sorts to make sure that their customers don't tend to sit about too longer after they eat but all in all, it definitely took away from the dining experience. It simply wasn't comfortable beyond 15-20 minutes.

As for the poutine itself, I went with a small \"Le Gros Pork\" which is basically a classic poutine with bacon. Overall, it was a decent poutine with good fries, good gravy and a decent number of curds but nothing outstanding. It could have been far better if there was a more generous amount of curds and if the bacon was at least chopped and put within the poutine itself instead of having a couple whole slices of bacon on top of my poutine? It felt really anti-climatic to order a bacon poutine and not see the synergy of your poutine craving come together. You eat the bacon slices and you have a classic poutine.

Boring.

It's like wanting a spork but all you get is a spoon and a fork. Yes, I kinda got what I ordered but honestly? I wanted my spork.

All in all, a decent experience but nothing to write home about. The price-tag is about average."}
{"text":"Solid service and many kinds of poutine in a gastro-pub sort of atmosphere.

I really enjoyed the smoked meat poutine although the smoked meat itself was not as good as the smoked meat from Schwartz's.

Portions are pretty big and filling - consider sharing.

Please pardon my poor French


Un service solide et de nombreux types de poutine dans une ambiance gastro-pub.

J'ai vraiment apprécié la poutine de viande fumée, même si la viande fumée n'était pas aussi bonne que la viande fumée de Schwartz.

Les portions sont plutôt grandes et copieuses - pensez à partager.

S'il vous plaît pardonnez mon pauvre français."}
{"text":"Excellente poutine au poulet buffalo épicé! Très bon service en soirée et les prix sont très raisonnables. Effectivement, ce serait à l'avantage du restaurant d'être ouvert plus tard les fins de semaine, mais sinon, c'est un bel endroit à essayer!"}
{"text":"Had high expectations when we ordered from here. There was barely any gravy so the cheese ended up staying lukewarm. Price is also extremely high for the small portion. I couldn't get over how disappointed I was over the price I paid as it was the first time I have ever not finished a meal I ordered. I sent a complaint by email and the response I was given was their poutine isn't as delicious when it's take out rather than eating there.... 
Will definitely not be returning to place"}
{"text":"Trop Bon! Un choix varié de plats une poutine trop bonne et un personnel au top. Je recommande!"}
{"text":"While I don't eat poutine often every once in a while I get a major craving for it.  When that happens it means it's time to check out one of Montreal's many poutine places.  On this latest quest in search of a good poutine I found myself at Poutine Centrale, in HoMa.  This is a small poutinerie located on Hochelaga street, a short walk from Pie-IX metro.  On my most recent visit parking was terrible because of construction on the street so you are best off taking public transit.

Poutine Centrale is on the small side and is a pretty casual place.  You order at the cash and your food is brought out to you when it is ready.  The woman who served me was exceptionally friendly and even bothered to check on me while I was eating to see if I was enjoying the food.  

Now let's discuss the goods here: the poutine.  I got a small poutine, which was more than enough, with ground beef, mushrooms and onions.  Everything was well-seasoned and the fries were golden and crispy.  The curds could have been a little squeakier but as a whole it was a good poutine.  At around $10 the price was fairly reasonable.  I was pretty full so I felt like I got my money's worth.  It is definitely an excellent poutine option in the HoMa area!"}
{"text":"What in the hell just happened?

Last thing I remember, we were at the Jardin Botanical figuring out where to get some grub and then.....

Oh wait, it's starting to come back to me. Yes. Poutine Centrale. It was within walking distance (v. important). It specializes in a distinctly Montrealese cuisine (v. important). Sold.

Once we got there, we of course ordered a ton of poutine because we definitely wanted to try everything. The fiancé was insisting on a variation that had bacon and vienna sausages. That was not up my alley at all, so I didn't touch it, but he enjoyed it.

The regular poutine was tasty, but as other reviewers have mentioned, the gravy could use a little lovin'. Cheese curds were where it's at, though. They were super fresh, and thereby super squeaky!

But I decided to get something a bit different. And I knew The Boy was going to want to eat most of it, so I sprung for the large. Of a General Mao Poutine. Holy god. Who even came up with this combination? It's French fries, k? Rolled around in Szechuan sauce, k? With melty cheese curds, k? TOPPED WITH GENERAL TSO CHICKEN, SESAME, AND CHIVES. Like, holy WTF? But out of the three dishes we sampled, this one was by far our favorite. What a weird and delicious combination. Whomever came up with it deserves an award. I kind of wish we had gone when we were perhaps under the influence of assorted fun-makers, because I probably would have had something resembling a foodgasm. I almost passed out on my bench. My only negative comment would be that the pommes frites could have been crispier. But everything was super fresh and high-quality, so it can easily be overlooked.

We somehow made it through my man's dish, and the entire bowl of General Mao. (By the by, portions are generous, but judging by the small vs. large, it's always going to be a much better deal to buy the large, especially if sharing. Large is easily two or three times the size of the small.) We barely touched the regular poutine because we were so full. Which actually ended up being good, as we packed it up, and were about to take it back to our hotel, but then we ran into a very nice, very hungry young panhandler, and we gave him the poutine. And he immediately started chowing down, so we think he liked it, too.

Only bad news is you definitely won't want to be doing anything after eating here, so it's probably a good thing we had to walk to the Pie IX Metro, a few blocks from the restaurant.

Service was quick, staff was friendly, decor was modern. If we lived around here, we'd most certainly be back."}
{"text":"This place is well worth the walk from the Olympic park. It is only a few blocks away and so much better than the food options there. I had the poutine with smoked meat and it was amazing! The smaller size is more than enough for one person. Such a great little place!"}
{"text":"It was great, good and fast service, the prices were right and the poutine was good. Hamburger was small, but heavy and the pogo was served with a curried ketchup, mmmm mmmm good!!!"}
{"text":"Holy Cheese Curds, Batman, the best poutine I've ever had. A long block down and a couple of short blocks over from Pie IX metro, and a great option if you're in the neighborhood for the touristy stuff, as we were.

The classic has just the right combination of gravy and fries were  fresh and not overcooked at all. The menu has a great set of unusual combinations - the veggie poutine with mushrooms was rich and delicious, as was the smoked meat bowl - and they have sriracha on the table! Good but small selection of mostly local beers available. 

The portions are gigantic in the large - if you're really hungry, I suggest ordering two small bowls of different types, and/or sharing to get a great variety. I heroically finished my large but then I had to sleep off the meal for three days.

Now, the decor is a fabulous industrial design, with repurposed wood railroad ties for seats and laser-cut metal for tables, and it is very attractive. But it's also hideously uncomfortable. Maybe younger people can tolerate it more, but even my kids were complaining about how much it hurt to sit there. I honestly am tempted to shave off a star for my sore butt, but the food was so good I can't bring myself to do it.

Service as prompt and very friendly; you order at the counter and they bring it out, possibly the best of all possible worlds.

Update: an earlier version of this review opined the potatoes might not have been cut fresh even though they tasted that way, but the owner wrote to me and corrected that. Fresh cut! Should have known! Fantastique!"}
{"text":"Pretty good poutine. I went with the pulled pork and onions one. It was good, but I'm not sure if it was anything special.

The fried pickles were not that good."}
{"text":"Good. Solid. Not great, not bad. Wanted more from the toppings - like the chicken should be fried, the sauce was a little bland."}
{"text":"Je pense avoir trouvé ma poutine favorite. Oui, 5 étoiles! Pourquoi? Parce que c'est le parfait équilibre entre la poutine typiquement québécoise qui vient d'un \"camion à patate\" dans un plat en styromousse, et la poutine une peu plus élaborée qu'on retrouve dans des restos qui aiment bien être créatifs avec les garnitures qu'ils ajoutent.

J'ai pris la \"Hochelaga\" qui vient avec du bacon, des oignions et des champignons. Miam! Et même si les garnitures sont seulement sur le dessus, la portion (régulière) est juste bien pour un appétit comme le mien et le fromage et la sauce de sont rendus jusque dans le fond. Au départ, ça faisait \"squeak-squeak\" et vers la fin ça fondait avec les frites. Mon amie a pris celle au smoked meat et j'ai été surprise de voir combien les ingrédients ont changé le goût de la poutine et combien nos deux options étaient vraiment différentes. On a aussi partagé un pogo maison avec le ketchup au curry. Mmmm...

J'aime bien le décor et l'ambiance de l'endroit - ça m'a surpris en fait parce qu'à partir de la rue, ça n'a pas l'air de grand chose et c'est sur un coin un peu en plein milieu d'Homa. Je pense bien que cet endroit est de même niveau que La Banquise et Poutineville, et possiblement meilleur! À votre tour de l'essayer."}
{"text":"Having grew up in Canada, i was introduced to poutine at an early age. When i came to the state, I could not find it anywhere and the only thing remotely close to it was \"cheese fries\". Now if you grew up on poutine, \"cheese fries\" is blah. Then i discovered \"disco fries\" which is the American version of poutine. It made due for the moment until i got back to Canada and got the
 real thing. 

I've been telling my lady about poutine for months and anything with cheese on it, shes sold on it. LOL. So we took a trip and the first order of business as we got there was poutine. I had the poutine with veggies while she had a General Tsao chicken poutine.... She was hooked. She loved it, So much so, that she demanded we come back to this restaurant before we left Canada. Lol. The cheese, the flavours, the heat... it worked really well. It was just as good now as i remembered it to be then."}
{"text":"So. Overpriced.
Seriously, $30+ for 2 small poutines and a can of soda is insane for Montreal.
Plus, the debit machine brings up the tip screen even though you order and pay at the counter and then pick up your order on a tray when they call it out. Seriously.

The poutine is good, but definitely not enough to justify these prices.
The topping we both had was the General Tao, and it was tasty, yes, and the chicken was tender, but it wasn't great General Tao on its own.

TL;DR: you will overpay for getting unusual toppings on an okay poutine.
Also, uncomfortable seating."}
{"text":"We spent a little over two weeks in a summer road trip from Miami to Chicago through Canada (Montreal and Toronto) and the poutine here was one of the highlights of the trip. 
They have a bunch of different varieties to make anyone happy. I went traditional and wasn't disappointed. 
Friendly service like Canadians do and you can pay in either dollar or whatever they take up there"}
{"text":"After a $170 ticket for an \"illegal\" right turn to get to this place you can say I had high expectations... They were definitely met! 

Don't get much poutine in the Philadelphia area so this was definitely a treat after my aunt insisted that we try this spot. 

Not a very busy spot which is a + when you're starving. Also the prices were fair for the portions you get. Ample seating for large crowds as well.

Would definitely recommend the place to anyone."}
{"text":"Good poutine. Lots of variety. Portions large. Big enough for my American appetite. It is near the Olympic stadium so a good option after walking around. 

The small portion is enough for a meal. I ordered a large portion cause I was super hungry and realized that my eyes were bigger than my stomach."}
{"text":"Wow, I never thought fries would taste so good!
We ordered the sesame chicken, buffalo chicken and the Jacqueline poutines. The small portions are big. All amazing. 
Good beer selection!
Amazing find thanks to yelp!!!!"}
{"text":"Deux formats: l'un trop petit pour être un repas, l'autre trop gros, même pour les bons appétits. Évidemment, lorsqu'on a faim, on est tentés de choisir la plus grande, plus dispendieuse et propice au gaspillage. Un format moyen serait apprécié!

Les frites sont cuites dans la graisse de boeuf, donc assez loin d'être friendly pour les végétariens. On ne va assurément pas à Poutine Centrale pour \"bien manger\". C'est gras et lourd, sans surprise.

La poutine poulet au beurre est surchargée de sauce et généreuse côté poulet, mais la qualité du goût n'y est pas, j'ai dû ajouter de la sauce piquante pour pallier au manque d'assaisonnement.

Bref, j'ai été déçue. Mais sinon l'endroit est joli et le personnel est aimable."}
{"text":"Nice selection of classic and non-classic poutine.  There is a good amount of tasty gravy and the cheese curds are yummy and give a great \"squeaky\" mouth feel.  Layout is nice, clean with urban rustic decor.  Definitely worth a walk/visit if you're in the area of the Olympic stadium."}
{"text":"Just like the name suggests...Poutine, Poutine, Poutine. So tasty! It was my first taste of anything Poutine and I was not disappointed. A small hip atmosphere! The service was friendly to us Americans and simple to order. Order at the counter, when it's ready they ding the bell or call your name. Done. BE AWARE...PORTIONS AREA HUGE! The smaller, petite size is the way to go. It was more than enough for me, who has a large appetite. My friend ordered the large and was barely able to finish half. Everything was delicious, friend ordered the vegetable poutine which he said was nice and fresh. I ordered the Poutine with Egg, bacon and sausage with gravy and cheese curds (obviously). Sooo good. If you're in the area, this is a must try for delicious and authentic Poutine."}
{"text":"Delicious poutinery in the neighborhood we are staying in. Definitely worth the walk! We got the classics & the Jacqueline and 2 wheat beers. Reasonably priced. You can get small orders so you can try a couple too!"}
{"text":"After a long stroll in the nearby Jardin Bontanique, it just makes sense to eat poutine!! Or pay the ridiculous $10 sandwich at the garden.

Poutine Centrale is a quiet little poutine shop with fast-working staff who makes food and takes your money in an instant. Which is great, I mean, poutine customers are hungry. The time it took to pay/sit/served was shorter than me standing in front of the menu.

But it's not my fault!! How do you pick when every option sound so delicious!???? That is why I came with two other people so I end up trying 3 poutines, which were all freaking flavourful and I love love love the gravy. 

They also have 5 daily specials which just adds more delicious choices. Argh!!! Just take my money!!! I wish it was closer to me!"}
