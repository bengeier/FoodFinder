{"text":"The people that hang out here are pretty sketchy. But the staff is incredible! Everyone is so nice and polite. They really try hard to make sure everything is exactly the way you want it. I don't expect much walking into a fast food place but they really go above and beyond! The manager should be proud or their staff!"}
{"text":"I work nights and every time I go there she tells me they have no coffee. I've complained before and was told they are supposed to sell coffee at all times! Well, it isn't true! So this time I ordered a bacon cheeseburger, fries and a drink. The burger was burnt and she was very rude! This location and the overnight staff sucks! I don't even want to give it 1 star!"}
{"text":"I'm not really a big fan of Jack in the Box's food, but the service here makes up for the food quality.  The staff is very friendly and the location is very clean and the food is prepared well.  They serve breakfast all day, so it's a really good option if you have a hunkering for some breakfast food on a Saturday or Sunday afternoon.  My only wish is that they had more breakfast carb offerings like cinnamon buns, waffles, french toast sticks or something."}
{"text":"Service is terrible.. 15 minutes and still no food.. Come to find out that only 2 people are working?? Nice way to run a \"fast food\" joint."}
{"text":"If I could give this store no stars I would and its not because of the food or the employees its because of the franchisee and or the Manager.  This store is not located in the best part of town and I understand that but the people they allow to congregate on the outside patio and in the store sometimes is disgusting.  I work up the street and stop here one or twice a week.  Every time I'm accosted by homeless people looking for handouts, I've seen prostitutes and last night there were actual drug deals going down on the patio.  Its like this every time.  The employees tend to ignore it although I noticed their quick glances to each other almost acting like they have been warned not to get involved.  

Last night the \"Supervisor\" I spoke to didn't know the Franchisee's name or the Managers.  He quickly dismissed me by saying he had to go wait on someone in the drive thru.  Again his canned response felt like he was saying something he was told to say.  I don't understand why these people are allowed to sit and stay when all they are doing is running off paying customers.  I also observed three different people with non Jack In the Box cups just walk in and get soda.  

Either this location needs to hire some night time security to start running non paying customers off the property or just take out the tables and benches in the front and concentrate on your drive thru and eat in business.  Take the pressure off your employees who shouldn't be concerned with their own safety and the safety of their paying customers.  

I for one will go a little further down the street from now on to the Wendys.  At least I've seen the night Manager there take care of biz and deals with all his customers in an appropriate way."}
{"text":"This is the worst jack in a box, hell worst fast food restaurant i have ever been too.  It took over 25 minutes for order to get our food(and it was busy at all) then when we got our food, everything was cold on top of the fries tasted old, the tacos was stale, chicken sandwich's bun was old and had no mayo.  I had the worst experience ever.  I will definitely be telling everyone i know or talk to how bad it is.  Only giving it 1 star because i cant select zero"}
{"text":"I ordered a chicken teriyaki bowl and fish sandwich and some other things. I paid at the window and then the lady comes to the window and says \"the rice for the teriyaki bowl is not good, do you want something else?\" So I got a chicken sandwich instead which cost the same amount.  But as I'm typing this, I'm sitting in front of the store waiting for them to make my fish sandwich. It's been 20mins... the service is bad. I haven't even tasted my food yet."}
{"text":"This was my first experience eating Jack in the Box since I moved from GA to AZ 2 days ago. The service was horrible! Cashier had attitude when I told her I was still reviewing the menu. When I was ready to place my order she was very rude & sighing as if she needed me to speed up. Then I watched as she prepared her food, placed it on a tray & walked off as my food sat in the window. The drive-thru person came to see if I had been helped & proceeded to bag my food after I told him I was waiting. This place needs better service."}
{"text":"Their service is terrible. The drive thru takes forever. Instead of taking your order, they say, \"Hold please\". Then they disappear forever. Their excuse is they are short staffed. This has happened several times. Once it was early in the morning on my way to work. The employee acted like I had all the time in the world! Hire some competent employees and teach them to move faster."}
{"text":"It makes no sense to have to wait 20 minutes in a fast food drive-thru. It is utterly ridiculous."}
{"text":"I realize you can't set your expectations too high for fast food but today I came home with a bag full of grease."}
{"text":"Best fast food joint around. Bring one to Florida!!"}
{"text":"I am 33 years old and this is the first time I've eaten at Jack-in-the-Box. Up til now I wasn't sure they really existed. I'd seen the commercials on TV, but I had never seen one in real life. So when I found one next to my hotel I had to give it a shot. I got the spicy chicken sandwich combo. The chicken patty looks like a waffle fry. It has fins on it like a radiator and it's pretty thin. There was more lettuce by volume than chicken. Otherwise it was not bad. Not real good, but not bad. Same for the curly fries. There was no brewed ice tea which is weird, but maybe because it was late Sunday night. On a positive note, the food was cheap and the service was friendly. All in all it's about what I expect of a fast food restaurant."}
{"text":"The only reason I stopped here is because my son wanted curly fries Service here is so freaking slow. Waited for forever in the Drive-Thru only to get the wrong order and had to go back"}
{"text":"This is the place I always used to go to after I left the bars when I was younger.  I remember being so absolutely plastered one afternoon that I sat down and to this day am certain I had two big macs there.  (Any doubt why I quite drinking twenty five years ago???)  Fortunately a professor from ASU wouldn't let me drive for another two hours.

The location is convenient for getting in and out of late at night.

What really makes it interesting is the people from the neighborhood around it. If you are a people watcher you might really like it here.  You just never know what you'll see from the man who regularly parks his wheelchair by the drive through and solicits money to... 

It's nothing special but holds some memories for me."}
{"text":"Those were the worst sandwiches I've ever had. A bacon Jack and a Fish sandwich. Burger was thin, pieces, overdone, and dry. Buns were old and crisp. Fish was fried in old oil and tasted bad. Never eat here again."}
{"text":"Still the best Jack en le Box.  Thank you for keeping the tacos at a reasonable price. The egg roll is still the best but you raised the price so high I REFUSE to pay that price.  The malted milk shake is the best shake you have ever had!  Get my fat French fries back or the natural cut fries, I hate those skinny shoe string fries, they are hard and not good hot or cold.  Thanks for you dollar menu offerings!"}
{"text":"Similar to the most recent review, I have to preface this with a \"I know you're reading this and thinking 'why the heck did this person give a fast food chain restaurant a good review'\"... There's always a reason behind the madness.

I dined here late-night after getting into Phoenix later-than-expected, due to a flight delay. With apparently nothing else in the vicinity open after 9:50pm on a Friday night, I strutted down Central towards JITB and got there at 10:01pm... their drive through was open, but I did not have a car and the employees were in the process of locking the front doors. One woman responded to my dad's and my attempts to get the attention of the staff and was kind enough to let us in and order some much-needed artery-clogging goodness. 

As if this weren't enough, 4 nights later, our post All-Star Game hunger set in. Again, we arrived at JITB as they were closing up, but upon recognizing us as those lame Californians without a car, the staff let us in once more.

SUMMARY: Service was excellent, staff are all friendly and quality people. Food was typical JITB, but might I say that Sprite I had felt extra cool against that 10pm, 101 degree heat."}
{"text":"So had to stop in as these are not in Florida. Grabbed a breakfast burrito.  Very friendly people. Th smell in the place was not good. Something wrong in the bathroom I guess. The burrito was just ok but the breakfast sandwich was really good."}
{"text":"(08/26/16) I ordered  2 junior bacon cheese  burgers  and a large fries. The fries were good. Nice and hot and salty.

The burgers  weren't  even whole  patties, just pieces  shoved onto a bun. They  were  also dried out and tasteless. Both burgers  were that way and the large fries I ordered  seemed like a regular  sized serving. Why I keep coming  back  here is beyond me. There are so many dining  choices that are better than this."}
{"text":"Delicious food and great menu. I ordered the Chicken Fajita/ Pitta and it's really very healthy. Taste is much better then other Fast Food joints."}
{"text":"Do not purchase from this location if you want quality food. They always mess up my order and are very rude when you call them out on it. It's sad because their menu has many options and it actually sounds appetizing. 

The night staff doesn't seem to care at all it seems like. They rudely greet you at the window when you pick up your order and there seems to be too much drama going on in the back. There seems to be constant shouting between the staff members. Very unnecessary when you are just trying to pickup food. 

I will not be purchasing anything from Jack In The Box again because to be honest it's a hassle and there is too much drama involved. I will be taking my business elsewhere where I am respected for the business that I bring."}
{"text":"Sat in drive thru line for almost 25 mins on a Sunday morning ! Service was super slow . There was about 3-4 cars that just kept going passed the pick up window . Whatever manager was on duty this morning lost a lot of customers . Probably won't be returning"}
{"text":"I can get over a wrong order, but the attitude here about them getting my order wrong really makes me hostel. Yes it's midnight on a Sunday. Yes I ordered a chicken club with no bacon. And yes my sandwich came with bacon. But I can move past all of that if they where courteous. A poor attitude really makes things worse . I hope that management works on it."}
{"text":"This place is super ghetto, it's 830 on a Sunday night and the cashier is rude and slow. I do not recommend this particular jack in the box."}
{"text":"I have to call this place out, because I drive entirely out of my way to get food from here, and have never gotten a bad meal.  The seasoned burger and curly fry combination is delicious.  I used to go to the Hardee's in Huntersville (known for inconsistent service) for my Burger & Curlies, but for some reason they dropped the curly fries from the menu.  I'm glad they did, because it forced me to look elsewhere, and elsewhere I found an even better meal.  Also worth mentioning is the excellent staff - other than the guy that listens to his earbuds at the register, everyone here is noticeably friendly, and eager to please... like it should be.

Bye bye Hardee's, Jack's got you beat."}
{"text":"Love JIB.  After a day of draining my savings account at the local amusement park we stopped here for a drink on the drive home.  Open at 11:15 pm we ordered two tacos (yum),  two bacon cheeseburgers,  and two large sodas.  Total $5.50.  I smiled as I paid.  Ive been a fan of the 2/99 tacos for years and the burgers were great.  Wish there was one in winston salem."}
{"text":"Fish sandwish was hot and pretty good, no complaints. The fries had so much salt i spit it out, ridiculous!!! I thought McDonald's had the saltest fries nope this place does. Yuck and they were lukewarm. The diet dr pepper strawberry was my 1st time having and it was really good. Drive thru sucks. Customer service sucks.  They need a take a page out of chickfila book gor fast and courteous service. Oh by the way, they hiring LOL"}
{"text":"I ordered value fries and curly fries with my meal and instead of saying it will be a few minutes because fries aren't ready, they just didn't put it in the bag and said nothing. I looked in the bag to check my order before leaving they were both missing. I went into the store to get them and they didn't even have any fries made and laughed when I said I was missing them like they already knew it....lazy...."}
{"text":"JITB in Vegas is amazing. Like, ALL of the locations in Vegas. This JITB is HORRIBLE. It wouldn't be so bad if the people were nice and acted like they wanted to take your order, but they can't even do that. Literally the laziest service and food ever."}
{"text":"I know. You are reading this and wanting to ridicule me for giving a high rating to a big box chain fast food joint. But before you judge I want you to think about having late meetings, or a busy night where you're at work, then the gym, then off to meet friends. Before you know it, it's late and you haven't had some food. Jack in the Box is the cure to this. Bonus is they don't have a specific time for breakfast or lunch... they offer curly fries and they have plenty of offerings that I don't have to specify no tomato on. This isn't by any means my favorite place, but at 3am, it's a great option."}
{"text":"I wish this place was as good as most Jack in the Box restaurants. It's not. Neither the food nor the service. I've had so many problems here I wouldn't know where to begin describing them.

Do yourself a favor. There are dozens of other places around this place. Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Nothin much to say. It's like any Jack In The Crack. Open 24 hrs I think. JITB always has different items than Mickey Death. Their tacos suck and I wish they had lemon pies like before."}
{"text":"You can get your burgers however you like.  That means lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, mustard, ketchup, mayonnaise.

This is better than your average j in b, but the four stars is a relative rating, relative to other jack in the box locations, not relative to non-franchise restaurants."}
{"text":"OMG!  
How awful can this be!
Two tacos (deep fried, no less) - 99 cents 



And I looooo v v v eeeeddddd them!



I know...

I'm going to hell."}
{"text":"I always wonder whether I should bother writing up fast food places.  But in this case, I decided I should.  This is for two reasons.

One is because Jack has a great menu.  It just sounds so good - all those things on the menu just make the mouth water.  No \"double cheeseburger\" here (or McDouble as it's called now).  Instead you get a BBQ Bacon Sirloin Burger.  With curly fries.  I love curly fries.

Anyway - the other reason is the staff.  At least one member of the staff.  I think her name was Shelia.  She was just a bundle of joy, and this was at a fast food place, during the lunch hour, when she was absolutely slammed (and the people behind her were a bit on the slow side).

She would make a note of people's names, rather than calling them by number, and as people left - at least as we left - she would even remember their name.  How impressive is that?"}
{"text":"TERRIBLE SERVICE, TERRIBLE FOOD!!!! I had a horrible experience. I will never ever waste my money here again!"}
{"text":"This Jack in the Box is a pleasant reminder of how Jack in the Box used to be, years ago, when fast food was pitched primarily as a wholesome family dinner, rather than as something to quell the \"munchies.\"

The restaurant is always clean and non-rowdy. The staff is always nice and patient. I don't go there terribly often, but my order is always correct, hot, and looks remarkably like the product photo. Hours are more limited than for other JitBs in the region, so check their web site before going -- but they're open when they say they'll be.

If you're from a region that doesn't have JitB, it's your basic burger chain, only it serves breakfast all day, and the menu runs toward the daring side, with occasional forays into WTH? territory. (Protip: You don't want the standard two-taco set. They're not kidding about sticking a slice of American cheese in there.) You will not experience revelations on the scale of Smashburger, and these really aren't \"better burgers\" so much as \"way more out there burgers.\" So go with it firmly in mind that this is a restaurant that does well *for fast food*, not one that aspires to more.

(Also, don't generalize the recommendation to other JitB locations, as they vary from equally ept but packed with tweaking meth heads to staffed with utter apathy and confusion.)"}
{"text":"The past three or four experiences at this Jack in the Box haven't really been that good, especially when I go through the drive-through window. It takes forever to order, it's an attitude or like today, they get your order wrong AND have an attitude about it. Today was the absolute worst, which ended up with me asking for my money back. When I first pulled in line, I noticed there were several cars but I thought they may move quickly. Until I got to the box and the girl told me to hold on, which took about 5 to 6 minutes to take my order. Once I did finally order and arrived to the window, I knew the price she told me sounded different then normal. Luckily I looked in my bag and saw that I had a burrito instead of the breakfast sandwich that I ordered. I immediately told the girl (I believe her name was April) working the window and she immediately went in on how she asked me twice if my order was correct when I ordered. When I said to her \"I know what I asked for, and I never asked for any burrito\", she immediately turned to her manager and told her \"Come get this window, and do your manager thing!!\" To which I was shocked and didn't even think I was being difficult. The manager did try to assist me, but instead of having to repeat my order and deal with the chance of something happening to my food, I just ask for a refund. I doubt I'll be going back, I rather pay a little bit more to Chick-fil-A and gave great customer service. As I told the manager, customer service is a lost art in today's world."}
{"text":"Let's fast forward to now 7/6/2016 @1:15am, first I was waiting for approx. 6 minutes to have someone even take my order, which the large SUV behind me got tired of waiting and drove off, when I finally did order the young lady says\"Is that all?.. drive around for your total\".  At 1:28am still waiting behind two cars that have not moved since I finally got my order taken, and a male with short hair was having a full conversation with the car in front of the maroon caravan, just laughing and talking.  So the lady in the caravan says hey we have been waiting in the line for over 10 minutes this is ridiculous, the gentleman smiles and says so, and keeps laughing and talking to the individual in the front car.  So I yelled out my window, and said hey sir, we have been waiting for a long time, He yells shut the hell up!  So I backed my car out of the drive thru and called the restaurant to speak to the manager(Ciara).  Never in my life have I experienced this kind of conduct in a drive through.  I will never go there again"}
{"text":"This location is conveniently located right off the light rail and a few other places I frequent. So, there are times when I need to grab a quick lunch and be on my way.

The food is nothing to write home about, but it's fresh and fills my stomach."}
{"text":"I come here once or twice a week for lunch. They are always pleasant, service is fast and the foods good. Today they did something that really made my day....  They were really busy so when I finally got to order I was offered a large drink (I ordered a small) which I declined but the sandwich I ordered had some tomato/basil sauce on it that I didn't care for. When I asked about the sauce the same lady who offered me the large drink had them remake the sandwich for me for free. That my friends is exceptional customer service!  :D

I wish I could give them 6 stars!"}
{"text":"I go to this location frequently. I'm in rough circumstances and they take EBT with the Hot Meals program. I always fill out their survey on the receipt, which gives a code I can use for a BOGO Jumbo Jack or a breakfast sandwich. Cheap eats are a good thing.

The morning crew here is always fantastic. Louretta, a high-energy, relentlessly cheerful crew leader, is a delight. No one else calls me \"sweetie\"; she does this with all the customers. She works twice as hard and goes four times as fast as the younger workers, though none of them are slow. I get free coffee refills (one is usually all I can take or my heart starts wanting to come out of my chest; there's serious caffeine in their brew). On the rare occasion there's been a problem with my order (for instance, a couple of times there's been an issue with sub-par salad ingredients), it's replaced immediately and courteously.

 A couple of times I've been a little short of funds and been given a drink on the house, or an upgrade on fries or such. A couple of times bacon has made a surprise appearance on my burger. I didn't order it and it wasn't on my receipt. Maybe they use secret hand signals or something. I am not one to look a gift horse in the mouth. Or pig, as the case may be.

Yes, the customers can be a little dodgy, sometimes. Street people and shelter residents frequent this place, but the management rides herd on disruptive behavior and has really gotten on top of abuse of the bathrooms as well as the dining area and drink machine. It's heartwarming to see marginalized people who just want to get something decent to eat treated humanely and served professionally. There are also customers from the nearby neighborhood and regular visits by Valley Metro Security personnel and construction workers from The Edison project across the street. Families with kids pop in. So it's a cross-section of Phoenix in the dining room.

There's free WiFi. Not blazing speed, but more than adequate just to check email or headlines while eating, which of course one is not supposed to do. Mindfulness and all that, ya know.

Nice job at this location, JITB!"}
{"text":"As much as I'd like to give this more stars I won't... food is usually great and the morning workers are great. However more than once we have arrived at 9:45 and they have it locked and refuse to let us in. If you have hours then stay open for them. Don't just stand there and let your friend in to order and goof off with them. Honestly it's tempting to give one star for the bad service."}
{"text":"Jack in the box eh? I have to agree with Chad; Jack in the box is worth a review. They have an item on the menu that I just can't get enough of. Call me crazy, but trust me on this. =) 

So, every every Chinese restaurant here in Charlotte that I've tried has the worst, egg rolls in the history of egg rolls. They all seem to have the same bland flavor followed by a strange odor. Even the great House of Leng in which I enjoy oh so much has weird egg rolls. If I want a good egg roll, I will either go to a Thai restaurant or a Vietnamese restaurant. They are fresher and actually flavorful. 

If a Vietnamese or Thai restaurant isn't in the vicinity of my cravings though, Jack in the Box is the next best thing. They offer crispy egg rolls, with plenty of meat. It isn't all filling and their sweet and sour sauce is much tastier then the traditional duck sauce offered at most Chinese places. As far as the meat in the egg roll, lol excuse my ignorance but its like a mystery meat for me. It's a white meat and I always thought it was chicken, but I think its pork. They can be purchased individually or in a three pack. 

Another reason I praise Jack in the Box is because I and many friends practically lived off this place back in high school and college. They've had a dollar menu for quite a while and their two tacos for a dollar is the greatest deal in the world, especially after a late night of drinking. 

If you've been searching for a good egg roll, look no further. Jack in the Box is the place to get em!!! I'm sure you have your reservations about it, but as you can see, they have a very eclectic menu. Their egg rolls are fantastic and I'm sure they won't disappoint. Please give them a try!

Did I really just write a review on egg rolls? Yes sir I did! =)"}
{"text":"All I wanted for x mas was a cheeseburger and fries.
Thanks to Jack in The Box for being open. Dreams do come true...
Thanks to the staff who came to work today to make my cheeseburger.
Jack,you get 4 stars just for being open!"}
