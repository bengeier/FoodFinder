{"text":"This place has re-opened.  
If you are 85+years old you might enjoy this place.  Had dinner tonight with my in-laws and was stunned by how bad the food was.  My wife and mother -in -law both had salmon that was dried out AND whitish-grey.  Sent wife's back and was replaced by a less cooked but still inedible small piece of fish...definitely not salmon on either plate.  Vegetables were good, however.  Salad bar is tired looking with cheap ingrediants; the lowest quality of everything.  Soups were old and looked like they were sitting out for hours.  Garlic bread with NO garlic.  Very nice waitress named Rachel.
NEVER AGAIN!!!"}
{"text":"We love the breakfast buffet. Service is excellent. I love the eggs, bacon, sausage, briskest and gravy, French toast, waffles, and especially the many fruits, and sides for a salad, and especially the banana bread pudding. Amazingly fresh and tasty!  
You need anything, just ask. In fact. The price is reasonable and on top of that, they have surprised us with a discount.  
Thanks JB's!! See you real soon!"}
{"text":"After four hours in the car we stopped to use the bathroom at the nearby BurgerKing when we saw JBs. Was enticed by the specials painted on the windows. Got lost between the club sandwich and shrimp plate on the menu, when two retirees at the next table compared Obama to Hilter and recommended the BLT. Add the salad bar for $1.99 more and then out da' do'."}
{"text":"Great food I ordered the all you can fish wow, it was good I would recommend this to anyone who looking for something to eat"}
{"text":"I have been here about 3 times, twice  for the weekend breakfast buffet and once for lunch. The food is similar to Denny's, so nothing special here. Everything here feels dingy and dirty, there was hair in one of the dishes in the buffet. Service is average, but employees are just as dirty looking as the restaurant..will not be coming here anymore."}
{"text":"Came here last Wednesday with my uncle and his friend as we went to get breakfast before going to a baseball game. I went to the location on Bell Rd. before but that location had since closed.

This location seems to be a little roomier and cleaner. You can't beat the all-you-can-eat breakfast, that is a fact. Bacon, biscuit and gravy, pancakes, scrambled eggs, fruit, and much more to choose from. 

Don't try to re-use your plate like I did though because they will take it away from you! Just go back and fill yourself up a new plate and they will come by to pick up the old one. 

They give you a bill when you are done eating and you pay at the front register.  Nobody showed up at the front register to ring us up for a good five minutes or so. We could have easily left without paying but we didn't.

Looking forward to coming back for breakfast next time I'm in Arizona...this one better no close down too!"}
{"text":"Didn't expect to come here, but we're glad that we did.  This is good, down-home cookin'.  It's similar in some ways to Denny's and similar restaurants, but more inviting and significantly less \"corporate\" in feel.  You won't find \"The Bite\" on a monitor here.

I had a simple burger and fries.  It was $5.99 and yummy.  I was tempted to get a dessert, but I was completely stuffed.  Service was friendly and attentive, and the place was spotless.  Taking a look on the internet, I found this place to be operating in Arizona, Utah, Idaho, Montana, New Mexico, and Wyoming.  There's nothing like it out here in the Bay.  That's too bad, but the next time I'm in Arizona, I'll be sure to pay this place another visit."}
{"text":"Great service and food was delicious.  I had the fish and wife had soup and sandwich.  Price was better than average. We definitely will be back."}
