{"text":"Terrific, Rush Hour is serving breakfast again. Stop by with my wife and had a super omelette. My wife ordered a basic breakfast and enjoyed every bite. Service was fast and the coffee hot."}
{"text":"Don't be intimidated by the weird look of the outside because this place is great. When we pulled in it looked like an old dive bar but the inside was great. It's rustic look was great. I got the nachos as an appetizer and they where great. For my entree I got the blt with egg. The egg was perfect and the bacon was as well. I would definitely go here again and try their wings with the crazy sauces."}
{"text":"I used to visit the rush hour in Parma years ago and was excited to eat at rush hour again. The food however was not how I remembered it and was meh. The burger was mediocre and forgetable. Prices are fair but I wouldn't go out of my way to go back."}
{"text":"Drinks are reasonably priced and staff is always nice, however, the quality and value of the food have fell off.  Sorry, but your business will not survive when your wings cost just as much as Bw3's.  Note to the owners, \"You're a local bar, stop price  gouging!\""}
{"text":"Great place for a cold beer and a good sandwich. Checking out the new location tonight. So far looks good. !!"}
{"text":"BREAKFAST REVIEW. This is just for breakfast, not speaking on nightlife or anything else cause I was just here for their new breakfast and I haven't had any other meals either. I've been meaning to head here for a while because it's close to home and I knew they were serving new breakfast. Been seeing delicious pictures on Facebook so we came in. There was only one other table seated. Our server was super friendly and was conversational, suggested items, and was accommodating for substitutions. They had the today show on their what feels like 50 TV's. That was a nice touch. Makes you feel like you're just relaxing-helps to take away from the fact that it's a bar. It's definitely a bar, so expect that coming in. But it DID NOT smell like you'd imagine a bar the morning after a long night. I promise, they definitely clean well! 

The food was really good. Came out quick, was just what we ordered, cooked perfectly, and tasty. We also ordered bloody Mary's which were sooo good. The best part: REASONABLE PRICES. $5 Bloody Mary and less than $10 meals. IM IN, especially when food quality is good! Portion sizes were generous as well. Boyfriend ordered take out the next day too and it was just as good as dine in. He orders a breakfast burrito with bacon instead of ham (not on the menu but they'll make it) Check it out if you're in the area-We'll go back!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, fun atmosphere, really cool decor. Drinks and service are good too. Love the new location"}
{"text":"OK so the front door is a little creepy. it has no windows, and it's reminiscent of an old titty bar. But once inside it is very well lit!

Previously I had only gone here for the bar scene. However I ended up here for breakfast due to the outstanding reviews! I was definitely not disappointed with my southwest breakfast bowl and my friend seemed more than happy with her French toast. The gravy was a little watery/thin. Not much to say! Food was good, service was OK. But honestly it was like nine in the morning so maybe she was still drunk (hahah just kidding). She was very nice! Just slightly unfocused. I would return if I'm in the area so early in the morning again."}
{"text":"First time here on a Sunday. I love it here. $5 Pitchers, and the FOOD!!! So good. Great service. Good times."}
{"text":"I was at Rush Hour Grille on 10/14/2017 for their \"soft re-opening\".  I arrived at there at around 10:30 so it was extra packed.  One of my girlfriend's arrived early and got a table so I was able to sit in the back by the DJ and dance floor.  I liked the look of the bar and it has great potential but I didn't think the space was utilized properly in order to cater to a dance crowd.  The table didn't allow for enough room on the floor to move around but it really wasn't a lot of people dancing anyway so that's was not my biggest issue of the night.  

Issues:

1.  I couldn't get a server/barmaid to save my life.  It was only 1 barmaid on the floor taking drink orders for approximately 400 ppl (the manager's count) and only 3 at the bar.  It took me at least an hour to order a drink.  When I asked one of the girls (only 2 bringing food out) working as servers if they can take drink orders I was told no, not even the \"so-called\" hostess would take any orders.  

2.  After ordering our drinks (5 drinks) and food, we waited a very long time until I asked the barmaid where our drinks were?  She took a few more orders and came back and asked if we rec'd our drinks yet and we replied no we didn't have them yet.  It was now over an hour (2 hours total) and we finally got our watered down, no alcohol drinks.  I don't know how a Cosmo can taste like water.  I understand the Long Island Ice tea because it's usually a pre-mix but whomever made the mix add too much water so it was very little favor to the drink.  

3.  The food came out at least 30 minutes before the drinks.  We ordered Lemon Pepper Chicken and Fries.  Just to be fair, the fries were home cut plus I was starving by the time the food came out anyway.  However, the fries were just above too cold to eat and the chicken had Lemon Pepper dumped on top.  The chicken tasted so much like you were eating a fresh lemon on your plate.  After 3 people tried the chicken we sent it back because it was unbearable to eat.  Fast forward, 15 minutes later the 'not as much' lemony chicken was still too much for me so we passed on it and asked for the manager which the barmaid said was the cook to come out.  He admitted that the fries had sat around too long because there was no one to pick them up due to shortage of staff and he was solid that the lemony chicken was to taste like a lemon-I beg to differ.  Nonetheless, he removed the meal from our tap and explained why the night as brief as he could.  Truthfully, I almost felt bad because he seemed overwhelmed and understaffed.  I asked why he didn't have more people working tonight because that seemed to be the bulk of the issues and he said that he didn't have enough employees.  I think he should have done a job fair at his location before re-opening to be fully staff for the crowd but in my opinion, it was the same at the last location but instead of waiting 2 hours it was more like 30 minutes to get a drink.  Btw, I asked for ranch dressing and it was spoiled.  :(

4.  Our barmaid Kelly was nice and needed help, bad!  There was no way she could have worked that entire floor and expect to get everyone taken care of...it was impossible.  But I will say this, she never was mad or nasty and she maintained a great attitude while working the room.  I don't know how she did it but however she did it, she never changed and continued to smile throughout our service.  #Kudostoyou.

5.  The \"so-called\" hostess did nothing to rectify any issues at the table which left the barmaid to play duo roles (customer service, barmaid, hostess, etc)  Not only did she have thee worst disposition, she had a snippy attitude to match (not good for business or a disgruntled customer) so she never came back to solution anything.

6.  As I watched the \"security\" guy move and clean tables randomly throughout the night (I stayed until 1:30a) he found time to play \"social worker\" for the hostess with the bad attitude.  Claiming she was a high school kid or just graduate from HS so she is still learning and she's a bit sensitive.  We all were thinking \"what is she doing in the bar if she is a HS'er\"  and if she's that sensitive working in a bar they may want to keep her in the kitchen on dishwashing duties or something cause my theory is \"don't dish it out, if you can't take it\" .  Bad, bad, all bad.

In closing, I will said the music was good and it was a good comfortable crowd of people.  Parking is in the plaza so no worries there.  Police periodically rode thru to wait on giving drunk drivers a ticket (it's Twinsburg, what do you expect?).  I think the owner was nice just stressed out that night.  I would not made this a regular spot for me and I rather go to a chicken shack to order wings.  Oh, my girlfriend's ordered pizza which they said was good so it wasn't a total loss that night but I will not go out of my way to go again.  Jon Taffer, one of the country's top restaurant and bar consultants, would not be proud of

DJ Rel was pretty darn good"}
{"text":"Great Local Establishment!  Always good to see smiling faces and staff working hard to make the visit positive.  Food has been upgraded since their move.  Owners support the community and are always willing to help out.  Kind of place every community should be lucky to have!"}
