{"text":"Can be kinda pricey. You do get a good portion. I wasn't particularly impressed with the pork. I've had better and it kinda bummed me out. I was expecting to have it knock me off my feet good."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of places that decide to do one thing and do it the right way. This place does pork very well and I love their beans too. I usually have their pulled pork sandwich and my husband loves their brisket. They have a small selection of beers that go great with their menu options, which is an added benefit that many small shops don't have. Bacon on a stick is a must try although it's slightly over priced. We plan to keep going back again and again and again."}
{"text":"Great brisket and ribs.  I've just had the Cleveland Crusher as my second meal here.    The brisket was great, but the sausage was dry, and the side of potato salad was very bland.  They're doing a great job on the \"meat end\" of the restaurant, but they need to evaluate their side dishes and make some improvements."}
{"text":"Thrilled to have this kind of barbecue in Lakewood, the focus is certainly on the meat which is appropriate. Tried everything but the ribs and its hard to pick a favorite.

Its certainly a takeout kind of place which is fine if you don't expect more. The beans are good but the sides are limited and pretty run of the mill. Baked Mac & Cheese would be an upgrade.

I'd recommend getting the meat to go and taking care of your own sides and sandwich materials. Its worth it!"}
{"text":"Sad! Ribs needed another 30 mins on the grill. Potato salad - tasteless.  Brisket not bad but 40% fat. Carolina Que in Strongsville is much better. Still can't get over raw ribs - my daughter with her $60 smoker would shut them down in a head to head competition."}
{"text":"I have been going there at least 1x a week since it opened. Best BBQ in Cleveland. I get a half Slab of ribs and 1/2 # of brisket at least once a week. This is true authentic Texas BBQ."}
{"text":"I went here in search of some proper barbeque. I've had a really hard time finding any that is consistently delicious.  Any hoo, this is pretty good. I wasn't a fan of the ribs, be ribs used was really good; peppery and smokey. I lived the brisket and peeled pork though...So good, though I was annoyed I was given a bunch of fat with the pulled pork. That's what knocked off a star for my review. Even after asking to buy be given all the what I could clearly see was just fat, not attached to any meat. I will give it another visit though, 'cause i can ask taste that tender brisket."}
{"text":"1. Food should not be served lukewarm.  Mine was.  2.  The meat had charred, black ends, like a tire.  3. Trestle tables?  Ugh.  4.  The worst:  they actually have the nerve to charge you, after YOU stand in line and your sale gets rung up, a damn tip!  Yes, you read that correctly. For handing you your food and a drink (the absolute basic of basics), they expect a tip!!  YOU stood in line; YOU carted your food to an unoccupied seat that YOU found; and if you needed napkins or something YOU had to get it.  And then, YOU cleared your own damn table!!!  What was the tip for???? Worse, they had it programmed, so that you shelled out at least 15% BEFORE they handed you the food!
Never, ever going back.  Lakewood has some great places.  This one is a scam."}
{"text":"I had my first taste of The Proper Pig at an event they catered for my work. I actually only had the banana pudding my first time around, but I was instantly hooked...and I don't even like bananas. 

I decided to visit their storefront about a week later to try some of their BBQ and I was not disappointed. Their pork is perfectly seasoned and tender, the potato salad was on point and once again, the banana pudding stole my heart. 

I love the fast casual concept, got my food and was out the door in about five minutes.

Lots of BBQ places are popping up in CLE, but this is one you should definitely check out!"}
{"text":"Don't waste your money. Way too much fat on the meat, the meat was burnt and dry with no flavor. The only flavor was the bbq sauce which was ok. We had beef brisket,  pulled pork and Turkey. The turkey was the only edible meet and was not bad. The coleslaw was tasteless. The beans were watered down and looked like poured out of a can. 
Way too expensive for what you get."}
{"text":"Very good service..I had the brisket which seemed fairly dry.  I needed plenty of sauce, overall I don't think I would revisit"}
{"text":"So bummed about this one, since we had high hopes. Several mistakes in order that had to be fixed while waiting, and we still came home missing beans, bread and onions. Aside from the disorganization of the joint, the food was so, so bland. Between the three of us we tried smoked turkey, ribs, brisket, pulled pork, potato salad and coleslaw. Barbecue sauce was meh, too. And only one sauce option. Can't imagine we'd try this place again."}
{"text":"Okay, I realize that we're not in Memphis.  I'm a Clevelander, but having lived in Memphis for a few years, I know that for $6.50 you get a pulled pork bbq sandwich that is piled high, with coleslaw piled on that (customary, but optional), a side of beans and chips.  And, it's mouthwateringly delicious.  This is not what you get at Proper Pig.  I was disappointed.  For $9, you get a sandwich and a side.  Coleslaw, in quantity and quality a lot less than any self-respecting joint in Memphis would provide for free is your side.  The stingy portion of pulled pork was okay, not much better than you buy at Heinen's or Giant Eagle.  The sauce was limited in choice and not special.  Is that all you get for your money?  Not worth a second visit."}
{"text":"Overall I like Proper Pig.   I think people get a little crazy with their gushing reviews.  It's good but not some once in a lifetime experience. 

In my opinion, the absolute stellar all-star is the beef brisket.   I think it is 100% on point.  While I like the pork, I find the turkey to be serviceable but not worth getting again.  

The ribs are good, but not great nor crave-worthy to me.   

Sides are ok.   Beans are the best.  

The banana pudding can be skipped."}
{"text":"\"These are the best ribs I have ever had!!!\" Said my daughter at least a dozen times tonight...and I will agree. If you live in Lakewood you should make this your regular stop, if you don't live in Lakewood I highly recommend you make the drive you will not be disappointed. We bought a slab of ribs and 1/2 pound of pulled pork - the rub on the ribs rocks! I forgot to ask if they make their own sauce but am thinking they do cuz it was yummy. The pulled pork with a bit of the bbq sauce is being used in our steamed buns :)  
Thanks guys for the great food we will be back!"}
{"text":"We love the Proper Pig food truck and their new brick and mortar restaurant is a very welcome addition to the chain restaurant meca that is Mentor!

Service was spot on and we thoroughly enjoyed the pulled pork sandwich and bacon on a stick!  Washed down with a Lone Star beer and a Cheerwine on their small but cozy patio it was perfect from start to finish! We'll be back many many times!"}
{"text":"Good sized portions with the two or three meet combo. Brisket is always my favorite in BBQ joints, and there's is too DRY. I thought the smoked turkey was perfect."}
{"text":"Expensive. And while even though the food is good. I'm not sure if it worth getting there to find out that they're always out of everything."}
{"text":"So good!  Great fast casual restaurant with reasonable prices.  I love their bbq sauce and pull pork sandwich.  I've been there a few times now and plan to go back."}
{"text":"Great Texas style BBQ that is really well cooked. Very authentic and highly recommend!! Fast service that makes a great place to stop in to eat or stop in to go. Either way no need to order ahead."}
{"text":"Really wanted to like this place, but was a little disappointed ... the brisket was well seasoned and well smoked but i had a big glob of fat in the middle of my serving.  The pork was basically tasteless.  The sauces were good and inused a healthy dose of one to try to breathe some flavor nto the pork.  That helped some.

The staff was not particularly professional or friendly.  

In contrast, inthoygh the sides were good.

Meh!"}
{"text":"Amazing!! Everything abt this place was delicious! The brisket and beans were best I've ever had. A must try and def will be returning!"}

in the last week

If you have a taste for dried out meat and terrible service, look no further because Proper Pig is your spot.

I hate to write a negative review for a neighbourhood business, but I would hate for someone else to waste their money.

We ordered the brisket and pulled pork. Both were VERY dry and lacked flavour (maybe they forgot to use the dry rub). The sides were mediocre at best. The service however was even worse than the food. Even though the restaurant was empty, it was made clear that we were an inconvenience. 

Gave them a bonus star since we didn't get food poisoning; small wins, but I am skeptical of the positive reviews given to this place."}
{"text":"I love this place. They have the best beef brisket, barbecue ribs and pulled pork. The meats are always juicy and fresh cooked. Ribs are so tender and have tasty smell. The personnel are very friendly and happy to answer to any questions regarding to the nutritional facts. I recommend this place."}
{"text":"I really like the simplicity of this restaurant. You walk in, look at the menu, order at the counter, grab your tray of food, take a seat wherever you want and chow down. 

The menu is pretty simple and you basically get to choose which meats and which sides you want to eat. I choose the 2 meats and 1 side meal for $12. I got the brisket and turkey with coleslaw. My meal was great! They also have a decent beer list for being a small establishment."}
{"text":"Came in on a Friday for dinner. Very casual, almost cafeteria style. Ordered the 2 meat platter with brisket and pulled pork. Also had a side of baked beans.  

The beans were outstanding. The meats were good, but I'm partial to my own smoked meat. I didn't see a very noticeable smoke ring, nor taste (or smell) a lot of smoke. The bark was very good, and the BBQ sauce was decent. 

The service was very quick. They toss everything on a tray for you when you order and we were in and out in 20 minutes."}
{"text":"Well, we decided to try this place and my review will be strictly based on my experience and NOT one of those
 \" this was one of the worst experience, my life is ruined...waaaa\" reviews. Every time I read those I want to reply ok great, wipe your tears because the 3 yr old behind you wants to ride the horsey. 

I ordered the Proper Slopper and my wife ordered the 2 meat plate with 2 sodas in a glass bottle. All of the meat in my sandwich was room temperature to cool. The same with my wife's 2 meat plate. She makes insane homemade southern banana pudding. So she ordered theirs to compare a BBQ place to hers. She took one bite and stopped. Their banana pudding was more like banana flavored Cool Whip with Nilla Wafer cookies on top. It was disappointing. 

So we go to clean out table and asked \"where Do we put the bottles for recycle?\" We were told \"we don't recycle here\" What?! All of those bottles they sell, all plastic they serve. All goes in the trash. Lakewood recycles. They make it easy. Just put it in the blue recycle bin.. But nope, they don't recycle there.

That night both of out stomachs were a little off. They just didn't feel right, just a little queasy for the rest of the night. Next time we want BBQ, we'll go back to Dickey's in Parma."}
{"text":"This is a relaxing place to dine, focused on the food and not big screens and loud music.   Simple but well done food accented by seemingly innocent toppings of pickles & thinly sliced onions - I like a place that doesn't feel the need to overwhelm one with condiments or too many side dishes.   We especially enjoyed the freshly carved smoked turkey sandwich platter and will be back soon."}
{"text":"The pulled pork is my staple!  I've been back twice for the sandwich.  The sides could use a little help, but I try to fill up on the meat.  I'm told the Brisket is awesome, but that would be no surprise since the pork is good.  I will continue to go back, but I wish the menu offered more!"}
{"text":"Visiting Cleveland from New Jersey and a friend recommended this place. Simple, rustic, cool place to eat. The vibe kind of reminded me of chipotle of you were to replace all the metal with wood. Unfortunately they were out of brisket at the time, but i tried the pulled pork and a half-slab of ribs. The pulled pork was pretty good but the ribs were amazingly juicy and delicious. Will come again."}
{"text":"The bbq here is so good. Although you can usually find a line, it moves fast so don't be turned off by waiting in line. The bbq sauce is so yummy. So happy Lakewood finally has a good bbq place."}
{"text":"The meat tastes like its been slow cooked for hours! Service is quick and efficient. I got the sampler with ribs, brisket and pulled pork with a side of baked beans. The ribs were my favorite but each selection was tasty! The beans were better than I could have imagined, they're cooked with pulled pork, making it a hearty addition to the meal. The only complaint is that their sides are very limited. Will come back!"}
{"text":"This place does what it sets out to do perfectly, and for that it gets 5 stars. If you want more of a \"dining\" experience you may be a bit disappointed at the very casual feel. I went in knowing it was an order at the counter establishment.  Being a Mom, major kudos to the kids corner. I almost ate there just because the boys were properly distracted...eh hem...entertained...for the duration of my ordering, waiting, and paying. The two staff members were very friendly and fast without rushing anyone, which is tough to do! I ordered a bit of everything but the sausage. BEST smoked turkey I ever had. Brisket was awesome too, it is the shredded variety, but still has a nice crust you usually only find with the sliced prep. The only thing that was just \"good\" were the beans. Potato salad was very enjoyable, not too creamy, with actual flavor. If you are a bbq fan you will be happy. One more thing...i have no idea how people complained about portions. Ive paid twice as much for half the food at some places."}
{"text":"First visit to the new Proper Pig in Mentor was so-so. The wait staff is very nice and attentive. I was greeted and handed a menu to look at while I waited to order. They were busy since it was the grand opening, but the wait was short to place my carryout order. I ordered the 4 meat plate with double brisket, pulled pork, smoked turkey and a hot link sausage. My sides were beans, slaw and CLE potato salad. I also ordered a half rack of ribs. As far as the food goes I had very high expectations, most of the food items delivered but some fell very short. 
I'll start with the good - the sides all were very delicious and over-delivered on my expectations. The beans had a nice tang, with a little sweetness, cant forget to mention some nice pieces of meat in them as well. The potato salad was also good, it has a nice kick from the stadium mustard and crunch from the veggies. The slaw had a good balance of flavor and good crunch.
Now we come to the meats where there were some issues. The good news first - my favorite was the smoked turkey. It was moist and tender with a nice slightly smoky flavor that did not over power the meat.  The pulled pork came in as my second favorite with a nice bark and smoke ring - the meat was not quite as moist as the turkey but still as delicious.
The hot links came in third, they had a nice snap and the flavor was ok but nothing too special with a nice subtle smoke flavor and some spice.  Fourth place was the brisket and 1/3rd of the reason for the 3 stars. The brisket looked very good, it had a nice bark and great smoke flavor. They have what seems similar to a Dalmatian rub flavor which was heavy in black pepper, my favorite type of rub. Now here is where I ran into some issues - the meat was quite dry, the bites with the thin layer of fat cap were ok but there were some pieces with an inch plus of fat that were not edible.  Between the dry meat and excess fat I was pretty disappointed with the brisket. The fifth place goes to the ribs and where things went wrong and the main reason for 3 stars. The membrane was still on the ribs which when smoked, makes a leather skin that can't be bitten through or eaten. The real problem was after I bit them and removed the membrane, I still could not get a clean bite as the ribs were so very tough!!!
This was just my first visit and will not be my last, it was still better then any other bbq joint/smokehouse in Mentor. It was only their first day open, so hopefully this review is helpful and they can iron out some of the dissapointments with their brisket and ribs. Overall, glad to have The Proper Pig in Mentor and am looking forward to trying it again."}
{"text":"A gem stuck away in the Diamond Center off of Heisley Rd. In Mentor, just down from BW3's. Flavors are great, sizes are great, and prices are good! Have been back and will be back for more!"}
{"text":"Excellent seasoning, smoke and flavor of the ribs and brisket! Get there early before they sell out!"}
{"text":"I've found this place to be hit or miss.    It missed the first and most recently the last time.    First off, ribs were not so great...Heavy on the seasoning (same with turkey).   Brisket has been pretty good to me, but I don't even know why'd you'd serve parts of the meat that they serve.   Also weighing every crappy slice of meat makes it apparent profit is more important than the slice of meat that is served.       Finally, let's talk about BBQ joints serving white bread.   Maybe it's a tradition, but it's a more crappy tradition than peeps at Easter.  Any other bread in the world is better than some cheap ass white bread."}
{"text":"First time. Not what I expected at all! Not in a bad way, just not what I expected. I thought it was going to be a regular sized restaurant but it's just a small quant little corner place in Lakewood. Served Chipotle style. Had 3 meats... pulled pork, smoked turkey, brisket, sauce, 2 sides... baked beans, potato salad, bread and shaved onions and pickles. (I thought the pulled pork was a little dry but not bad.) Good portions for a fair price at $16. Really tired of places over charging like crazy!! I either don't go back or just never go at all. I will go back here. They have a jar of fire ball candy near the self serve cutlery which was a nice touch!"}
{"text":"Had the 3 meat platter of brisket, turkey, and pork. The meat was great and it was enough for 2 people. My only criticism is the sides. The potato salad was not good, and the beans were ok. If they had halfway decent fried okra and some mac&cheese I would easily have this place as a 5 star. 

I'll be back."}
{"text":"I've tried every meat on the menu (tie between the brisket and the ribs for the best), and while they're outstanding, the real stand-out is the Baked Beans. OMG. Try 'em."}
{"text":"Holy, this place is good.  Cleveland has been missing a great brisket joint and this place makes up for it.  We came and ordered the 3 meats combo (only $16) with brisket, hot sausage, and pulled pork.  Brisket was amazing-great seasoning and perfect fattiness.  The Texas hot sausage definitely had a kick but still good.  The pulled pork was a little dry but we used their bbq sauce so we were all good.  The sides we got were great too, the only thing I would advise, is that they add some salt to the potato salad, it seemed a little boring.  We will definitely come back, but maybe a little earlier.  This place gets packed quickly and there aren't many tables AND we have heard that they can run out of food.."}
{"text":"Wow, talk about taking a restaurant experience down to the bare basics -- good food. 

Seating? There's a few regular tables and a long hightop bisecting the smallish dining room.
Wait staff? Nope
Menus? Nope, the listings are on a large chalkboard right behind two smiling people ready to take your order and dish out your food.
Fanciful plating? Nope. You get a metal lunch tray with a paper plate. You can grab your plastic utensils as you fill up your disposable cup with your favorite soft drink (or buy a bottle of beer).
Good food? Absolutely fantastic. I had the pulled pork sandwich and bag of chips for $9 and the pork was succulent,and smokey and had a tasty rub on it. And the barbecue sauce that sits on the table in a nondescript jar puts it over the top. The starch white bun is quite simple but it fits the traditional BBQ vibe.

Jeannene had the Chopped Beef Brisket  with a side of potato salad ($10) and she saw the same attributes that I had with the pulled pork. The restaurant also has \"Texas-sized\" sandwiches as well as several combo platters.

We then split the one dessert on the menu -- banana pudding with Nilla wafers ($3). The traditional southern dessert had a surprisingly subtle banana taste and I also was pleasantly surprised the the pudding had a consistency more like a mousse.

Already thinking about going back for lunch next weekend."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a quick and delicious meal, Proper Pig has both! The portions are big and their homemade potato salad is unreal. The rub used on their brisket and bacon on a stick is absolutely unique. Highly recommend and cannot wait to go back."}
{"text":"I show up just before close on a Saturday (literally like 2 minuets before close.) I was greeted by friendly staff. Even though I was \"that guy\", they answered my questions about the smoking process and the ingredients with pride and a smile. Then I was delivered the most flavorful plate of pork and beans. Simple, delicious, filling, amazing."}
{"text":"We stopped at the Proper Pig for carry out tonight. We were bummed to find out they were out of all sides except chips and cole slaw. The beans looked good but it was a 10 or so minute wait and we just wanted to get home. 
So husband and I decided to get the 4 meat plate, and we chose brisket, turkey, hot links, and ribs. Ribs were an up charge but we were ok with that. My favorite was the turkey - juicy, good crust on the outside, great flavor. Hot links were delicious too, a little spicy but so good. Ribs were really good, and husband said when we return, he'll just get ribs. The brisket was good, but it was a little dry. We added a bunch of BBQ sauce and it made it better. 
So it's opening weekend for them, and we will return, but I'm hoping they can keep more sides ready to go. Husband and I both thought a mac and cheese would be a great addition to the menu."}
{"text":"This is a very inexpensive place for good barbecue. The atmosphere is casual. It's nice how you can just walk in and order and sit where you want. I do wish they had more options on their menu in terms of entrees and sides. Otherwise what they have to offer is great. All of their food is quality. The meat is tender and smoked perfectly. I think the pork pairs great with their potato salad."}
{"text":"Nice and simple. Casual seating, a few 4 top tables, and a long many seat high top. 

Walk up to the counter, and order from the nice guy. I chose the brisket and pulled pork. I had coleslaw on side with pickles and onions. 

The brisket was perfect. Beautifully tender, perfect balance of lean and fat for flavor. I was sorry I didn't have more. The pulled pork was tasty, but I felt it wasn't nearly as good as the brisket. Coleslaw was not too creamy, and I liked it. I heard other tables raving about the beans, and I will try them next time. 

I would have loved if the onions had been pickled, but that's a pretty small complaint. 

I look forward to returning."}
{"text":"Twice now the brisket was as dry and tough as cardboard. It was inedible - we had to throw it away. And it was cut in 1 inch slices -- who does that? I had high hopes for this place. Truly I did. Bacon on a stick - yummy. Pork is good **IF** you don't get just one big hunk of fat with very little meat. One of our Pork orders had mostly fat. But the other serving was mostly meat - it was juicy and good."}
{"text":"This is definitely a place worth going to. The food was delicious and the service was quick. The potato salad alone is worth trying this restaurant for--it was by far the best I've ever had. The pulled pork was a little more fatty than I'd prefer, but the taste made up for it. They have decent specials throughout the week, but even without it the prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Food was really good. You walk up and order then carry the food back to your seat. They had some cool bottle beers and the sauce is the bees knees."}
{"text":"So normally I try only to leave positive reviews.  But this is an insult to Texas style.  My wife and her mother went ate in and brought me Togo.  They had the too dry pulled pork and the turkey and ribs.  They said the turkey was ok.  They got me the turkey and brisket as I love good brisket; I was in Nashville last week and the stockyards last year in Fort Worth.  This was not even brisket... it was like eating a blackened pot roast.  I couldn't believe that people are commenting how good the brisket is, apparently they never have had real before.  The beans were decent not over smoked but some smoke would have been nice.  The turkey was decent nothing great nothing horrible.  This was a one and done with a non recommendation to anyone I know that likes good food.  At least City BBQ will be opening soon so there is a chain that is better than anything else in the area...."}
{"text":"had dry/unflavored meat. We've heard nothing but great things but I honestly wasn't impressed. We're (my family) from the south (Louisiana/Texas) and I was super excited to try this place but ended up with meat that I had to smother with bbq sauce. It was dry and chewy as well. And please warm the buns, it doesn't seem like a lot but it makes the sandwich so much better."}
{"text":"Love the hotlinks, ribs are probably the best in Cleveland; firm and come cleanly off the bone without falling off.  The pork is right up there, but I have to say the brisket needs a bit of work.  I went for the point side (the fatter of the cuts), but the whole thing wound up looking like shredded beef and the bark was more like jerky than crust, still a solid effort to be sure. I'm confident that they'll get everything honed in once the initial rush dies down. Definitely still gets my approval."}
{"text":"I would qualify The Proper Pig Smokehouse as a \"fast food\" BBQ restaurant though on the pricey side. My wife & I were greeted by the friendly counter staff. I really liked that you could sample the entrees which greatly helped me make my decision. I was disappointed all three staff members were unsure if the side dishes were gluten free. This is the 21st century. The days of being able to just 'smile & serve' while not knowing your products are over.

The smoked turkey is fantastic! The chopped beef brisket is also very good. The sauce was very good though I would have liked to have had a variety from which to choose. The sides of CLE potato salad & smokehouse baked beans were served in ample portions but were bland. I even added BBQ sauce to the baked beans but that didn't seem to improve the flavor. Fountain soft drinks are significantly overpriced. 

I'm still not sure what The Proper Pig Smokehouse aspires to be. Is this an over-priced lunch option or a \"too casual\" dinner venue? I was prepared to rate it only 3 stars but the entrees I had, particularly the smoked turkey, swayed me to err on the positive side. Overall, The Proper Pig Smokehouse is a decent choice for quick BBQ but I fear location & competition for dining in Mentor may make for difficult times."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place and it may take a second visit to bump up the star rating.  The atmosphere is traditional family BBQ, so points for that.  Unpretentious with fast service.  About six or seven small tables and a long table that sits about ten or more diners.  I had the three meat combo with ribs, brisket, and the Texas sausage.  The latter was nice and spicy.  The ribs had a dry rub which is the style I prefer.  They were tasty but pretty spare meat-wise.  The brisket bark and rub was excellent but unfortunately the interior was drier than expected.  Brisket is probably one of the trickiest meats to smoke so perhaps I just lucked out (the wrong way).  The beans could have benefited from some burnt ends as they didn't have much flavor--Bush's Baked Beans weren't that far off.  We came on Beef Ribs Thursday and I definitely want to come back to have a taste of those."}
{"text":"Preface: I'm a bbq snob. Which means I am a brisket snob. I think most brisket outside of Texas is terrible, and if I happen to come across non-Texas brisket that is good I am impressed. Well this place has damn good brisket. Tender, well-seasoned, with the kind of soft texture that comes from quality cookery. The smoked turkey was a fantastic surprise as well. It was moist and delicious. 

Granted, the music was god-awful (corny country tunes), the atmosphere lacking, and the beer 2 months beyond the best-by date, but I'll take the food any day of the week. I don't live in Cleveland any more, but when I come back I'll stop in!"}
{"text":"I'm unsure what to think of The Proper Pig. Cool name, and it benefits from being one of the few BBQ places in the area (all of Cleveland really lacks an authentic, truly Southern-style BBQ). 

The meats are decent, but nothing compared to places in the south. I had the brisket and turkey. Both good, just lacking anything that make this place unique. Seems a little pricier than it should be. 

Service was good (no table service, just ordering from the main area). The place is a bit small, which is completely understandable for a place this new. However, if you're going with a large group, or during peak times, you'll have a hard time finding an open table. It seems like this location is set up as an afterthought for dining in, and is set up mostly as a carry out location."}
{"text":"Picked up takeout from here on a Sunday evening. My guy got the Proper Slopper and I tried the 2 meat combo with a side of the potato salad. I'm not a huge fan of BBQ so I loved that they offered a variety of meats. I had the the smoked turkey & brisket. I did try a little of the BBQ sauce and it was very good. Not too sweet, a little vinegary. Excellent! The potato salad was awesome!!! Different from whatever I've had before, I'd love to try and copy the recipe for our next backyard BBQ. I think I read somewhere they use Cleveland's Stadium Mustard, very cool!

My BF loved his sandwich! Basically had every meat on the menu and their homemade slaw. Portions were very generous and we both had leftovers to enjoy the next evening. THANK YOU Proper Pig, we'll be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"How do you drag an east-sider to the west side? BBQ!

The Proper Pig does a nice job with almost all of the meats we tried. Top, surprisingly was the smoked turkey (who' a thought?) Totally enjoyable and very good in all respects. The soft spot here was the sides. OK coleslaw and an interesting potato salad (with Stadium Mustard) appealed to one of us, but not the other.

Go here for the meat. Carnivores will not be disappointed. Those who need more will be left wanting."}
{"text":"We were greeted by a friendly, energized staff. The setup is very similar to that of Dickey's BBQ in Mentor with the exception that you also have some outdoor patio seating here. I ordered the Lake Erie Crusher sandwich ($11) which features pulled pork, Texas hot link sausage, BBQ sauce and coleslaw on a sub bun. The sauce was the highlight for me. Pulled pork was average, sausage seemed a bit over cooked and the bun was a bit stale. It also came was a side and I chose the potato salad was I thought was far below average. It was crunchy with little flavor. My friend ordered the combo meal (2 meats and a side for $12). He liked the smoked turkey a lot, but was not impressed by the pulled pork. In summary, it seemed a bit overpriced with average quality. To be fair though, this location has only been open for a few days, so maybe they have some kinks to work out. For the Money, Dickey's offers better value, more choices and better quality food."}
{"text":"This place is just the best.  I've tried a few of the \"staple\" BBQ places in Cleveland and they were just eh.. Went to Proper Pig the day after they opened and my husband has been back twice.  In fact, we just ate there for dinner tonight.  Everyone there is just so nice and asks you how you're doing and the BBQ.  Oh, the BBQ.. It's so freaking good.  I usually am a BBQ snob and I base it off of my Dad's cooking and, Sorry, Dad.. The Proper Pig is edging you out.  I recommend the Proper Slopper (get a side of pickles too) and shove it down with more meat a'la the bacon on a stick.  Just go earlier, they might sell out because it is so delicious!!"}
{"text":"Me and my husband split a 4 meats 2 sides, we got two drinks plus an extra side and it was about 33 bucks. I have to say that we really enjoyed this! This isn't something we would get all the time but it was so much food for even two people. The only down side was I didn't care for the baked beans which I can admit I am pretty picky about so it may be me. The thing I thought I wouldn't like was the potato salad and I loved it I would go there and just buy the potato salad it was awesome and I'm been pickier about potato salads then I am with beans! Would totally go again and I suggest trying it for yourself."}

{"text":"Ohio generally doesn't favor barbecue restaurants it's more of a southern thing. However I needed to try the proper Pig Smokehouse. My wife and I went there for lunch today and she ordered the pulled pork sandwich with that you get one side she chose coleslaw I ordered the two meat platter with one side I also chose coleslaw. For my to meet I chose turkey and brisket. The turkey they pulled out and sliced up right in front of me and you have an option of Dipping the turkey in butter. I'm in Lipitor so I figured what the heck why not.

The brisket had a nice bark and fell apart and was easily eating with a fork the turkey I did have to cut but it was still exceptionally tender. My wife advised that her pulled pork sandwich was delicious. All that was the good. Now here's the not so good.

Price. For two people to have lunch it was $26. Well I know barbecue can be a little pricey I felt this was a little too high to repeat on a normal basis.

Barbecue joints typically have at the table more than one barbecue sauce. A sweet spicy or hot and a regular ketchup you barbecue sauce. You only had a choice of one barbecue sauce I don't know if it was housemaid or Heinz.

Lastly, cleanliness. The floor was so greasy you could almost see the word lawsuit written in it. All you need is some people to come in with wet shoes and down the floor they'll go. It was greasy in the bathroom, greasy by the drink dispenser, greasy everywhere. They need some severe hardcore mopping and grease cutting in order to keep this place safe for its patrons.

Also on a personal note I hate that when you check out with a debit card they hand you the iPad which asks you if you want to tip the cashier. $26 for counter service is pretty hefty and I'm not quite sure I need to tip."}
{"text":"Juicy, slow cooked and easy to pull-apart pork topped with homemade BBQ sauce. Paired with some beans and a nice Lonestar beer. I've left this place clutching my stomach and yet still begging for more. No place makes my mouth water quite like The Proper Pig. The only thing I can do to show my love is to simply tell everyone I know about how good it is and continue to go there as often as I can. Oh, and they make the best banana pudding that you'll find outside of the south. Hands down, best BBQ in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Everything about the Proper Pig Smokehouse is excellent. Simple dinning experience and great food. What more could you possibly need in a local BBQ place, So if its mouth watering finger licking good BBQ your looking for in Lakewood there's only one place to go the Proper Pig Smokehouse."}
{"text":"There isnt anything proper about this pig. The baked beans were sweet and tasted like uncooked bbq sauce. All the meats were over peppered. Nothing special about this place and the potato salad was undercooked. The Proper Pig is overrated."}
{"text":"I am upgrading my review to 3 stars solely on account of the pulled pork, which was excellent. I had returned with my wife and was all but ready this write the place off after tasting the lackluster ribs; but after trying the pulled pork (from my wife's sandwich), I will be back for that and only that. 

It is a shame that The Proper Pig is so overpriced, and the buns so cheap and stale, but if they keep selling pulled pork by the half pound then I will actually have a reason to return."}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite place to get BBQ in Cleveland. Having gone to school in AL I have had my fair share BBQ and Proper Pig nails it every time. If you are going with another person I would suggest getting the platter and splitting so you can try a variety of the meats. My personal favorites are the brisket & smoked turkey. Their ribs come off the bone easily without falling off the bone, meaning they're not overcooked (which is rare to find a place who does it right)! 

I also ordered catering for a company event and everyone RAVED about all the food, including the wings. They also started doing beef rib on Thursdays so add another thing to your list to try from this fabulous BBQ joint!!!!"}
{"text":"Texas style slow cooking? Sign me up!

Dry rubbed meat cooked in a smoker for hours. This is the closest thing to Austin BBQ this side of the country. The pulled pork sandwich is killer. The smokey salty flavors are awesome. And the spicy hot link is great too. 

But the real treat is the bacon on a stick. Ou guessed it, it's bacon on a stick. But it is worth it. Glazed in maple and pepper and slow smoked. Absolutely killer. 

It is also kind of cool cause it's a family-run operation pretty chilled guys."}
{"text":"Horrible. The food was lukewarm. Brisket was tough and fatty. Ribs were just ok. Proper Sloper was cold and bun was dry. Potatoes were not cooked all the way in the potatoe salad which is a pet peeve of mine. Then when checking out they require you to tip when I stood in line, poured my own drink and got my own utensils AND cleaned up my own table. Ridiculous. I will never return."}
{"text":"I had the brisket sandwich. Tasty meat, albeit on the dry/tough side in patches. BBQ sauce on the table. Side of beans was awesome. Companions had the turkey sandwich (\"really good\")and another brisket sandwich. Sides were reported as \"very good\" (cole slaw) and \"unbelievably bland\" (Cleveland potato salad).

Tables for four have legs on the outside ends of the tables (as opposed to one metal leg in the middle), making it quite difficult for two adults to sit side-by-side with any level of comfort.

As others have noted, it's set up like a fast-food joint -- place your order, wait, get your own drink. Service was friendly and efficient. I'd definitely give it another try."}
{"text":"It's great to have great BBQ in Lakewood. I've been in a couple of times since they opened, and was highly impressed with the food and atmosphere! Love it! 
I recommend either coming in really hungry and trying the 4 meat platter, or bring a buddy to share it with. 
The brisket, pork, sausage, turkey are all excellent. I didn't care for the sides as much, but the meat makes up for it."}
{"text":"The Proper Pig doesn't need to have a warehouse location with seating for 400 people. It doesn't need to be an echo chamber or a converted barn.  The physical location it's currently in is perfect for it's shop.  

I was having a bad day. I was down in the dumps, low on energy, and in need of an overall attitude adjustment. I drove an hour north to get a Cleveland fix.  I'm sure there are studies, (if not, we can start one), but 10 out of 10 pseudoscientists agree that BBQ probably is the best food to fix the blues. So, knowing this in my head, I set out for Proper Pig. 

Instead of being behind a desk for 8 hours, filing some report, I found myself eating a giant brisket sandwich, drinking a fine, fine beer, and taking spoonfuls of stadium mustard potato salad.  And, the Tribe game was on the TV's too.  It was pretty close to a perfect day. 

The brisket has a great smoke ring and is buttery smooth in texture.  The BBQ sauce had a richness paired with a little spicy zing.  The two worked in perfect harmony to deliver a healthy shot of \"cheer up juice\" to me.  

I'm looking forward to adding a 5th star after trying a few more things on the menu.  I've toyed with the idea of getting some catering so I can have the full array of their BBQ goodness.  Maybe when the summer rolls around..."}
{"text":"This is my favorite BBQ joint in town, yes... over Mabel's. Although, very very close. The location is small on the inside so not convenient for big parties but if you want to just pick up some BBQ to go or come with a couple friends, this is the place to go. It is also not a sit down service restaurant. You walk up and order and usually get your food immediately, unless they are preparing more. If you are planning a party any time soon and like BBQ, they cater! I have had pretty much every thing on the menu and everything is incredibly flavorful! Even the turkey! Make sure to get there early if you want the ribs! They go fast."}
{"text":"Coming from the Southern States (NC, GA, TN, MS) I have a pretty high standard for smoked meats and barbecue. The Proper Pig hits the nail on the head with a great smokey flavor, tender meat, and full flavored house BBQ sauces. I've tried the brisket and pulled pork both of which were delicious. Looking forward to trying the Beef Rib Thursday special! 

The food is reasonably priced, service was quick, and the selection was good. I do wish they would offer some additional side options but overall I give this 5 stars."}
{"text":"NO FRILLS BBQ, GO HERE.
thought we'd try this place, newer restaurant recently opened. I ordered a slab of ribs, brisket and bacon on a stick. Everything was excellent, cooked to perfection. I am a BBQ fan and as very impressed. I took plenty of food home. Don't miss the bacon on a stick, meal in itself."}
{"text":"I lived in Houston Texas for ten years before returning home to Ohio. I have eaten BBQ, I know BBQ, and this is it!  I have not eaten brisket this good since leaving Texas. 
The brisket is great. 
The beans are very very good. 
The potato salad is bet good. 
The sole slaw is so so. 
I will be back again, and again, and . . . 
If you go to The Proper Pig, don't be one, a pig that is. Leave some BBQ for me."}
{"text":"These guys just get it. As a smoker of meat at home, this becomes a passion. The love that these folks put into their product is evident from the very beginning. I appreciate the science, the passion, and the execution that they put forth on a daily basis. The bacon on a stick is truly a work of art. The brisket is Magic as well. My wife said their pulled pork is better than she's ever had, and I've dragged her to many a barbecue places across the country.. I've had great experience with their truck and their brick and mortar store. I'm still trying to figure out how they can sell their brisket at a profit , as I have been unable to make it reasonably affordable at home. I guess I'm just stuck going there for brisket instead!"}
{"text":"smoked turkey was on point! pulled pork is pretty amazing as well. great spot to check out if you're in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"The Proper Pig was our choice for April's supper club event, and boy it did not disappoint! Thankfully I had contacted the owner in advance to discuss the details and let him know a group of ten was coming in, otherwise I don't think we would have gotten to taste that glorious BBQ! At 6:30 on a Wednesday evening they already had a long line and were sold out of a some major items! For us we did this special family style where Shane brought out a big tray of ribs, brisket, pulled pork, and turkey. We also got a tray of the fixin's like white bread, raw onion, and pickles to compliment our bbq (I used it all to make a sandwich). Oh and not to forget the sides of potato salad, coleslaw, and baked beans! 

We sat at the two long tables in the middle of the restaurant and our plates were thicker strips of paper and the silverware was plastic, but it all worked and was easy to clean up! On the tables were large shareable jars of sauce and rolls of paper for napkins. For drinks you got your own from a soda fountain, but I think they have beer as well. 

Food:
Ribs were amazing! They had this great black pepper rub, but adding the bbq sauce really did it for me. There was definitely meat on the bone and it was cooked perfectly, nothing dry here! The brisket was delicious as well! Tender and a little moist with a lovely little layer of fat. The turkey and pulled pork were A-Okay, the later was just a little dry but the sauce and eating it sandwich style with coleslaw on top made it taste just fine for me. I did taste a bite of their sausage, it was spicy but a little too greasy for me. As for the sides, they were simple, nothing special, but I had no real complaints. I did like that the coleslaw was not in a bath of salad dressing. Ahhh and we got a little cup of banana pudding for dessert which I thought was a perfect finish to the meal!

Overall I enjoyed what The Proper Pig had to offer and I will be returning! The stars of the show are definitely the meats, but I would not mind if they perked up the sides a little, maybe added some gooey mac & cheese and cornbread mmm. Shane really did an excellent job with our group especially considering they were so busy! Stop by early and give them a try!"}
{"text":"I'd heard about this place since seeing them compete on Cleveland Hustles, seeing their food truck around town (Edgewater Live maybe?) and seeing them listed under \"Hot & New\" So we finally checked it out last night. 
We were the only ones there and it had some cool rustic decor inside.

After much deliberation on whether we ought to get the brisket, ribs or \"others\", my friend and I decided on the beef brisket and ribs (as per the very helpful employee's recommendation). I've gotta say that after a cold night in NEO, I don't think there was anything that could have hit the spot more than this BBQ-slathered smokey-meat. The photos definitely don't do it justice, but just know that it was immensely satisfying, and for $15 it was quite the generous portion, leaving us both stuffed with BBQ pleasure. The brisket had a crispy, smokey outer layer that was amazing and the meat was extra tender and juicy. We are both hard-to-please individuals at times so take our word on this it was the best brisket I've ever had (and yes I've been to Texas, CO, NC, SC, etc). We will most definitely be back to try the rest of the meat offerings. 

The sides seem limited but it was all about the meat anyways. If it were closer to us in Cleveland I'd be there weekly for sure!!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  Very dangerous for me seeing how it's at the top of my street.  I've had the pulled pork, brisket, hot link sausage, ribs, and bacon on a stick.  All of the BBQ is incredible, very tender and tasty.  The staff is very friendly as well.  Lakewood really needed a BBQ joint like this.  Proper Pig will be around for a long time."}
{"text":"It is unfortunate but it still difficult if not impossible to find even decent BBQ in Ohio. I've spent a lot of time in Texas, much of it eating BBQ, and can tell you that The Proper Pig isn't worth your time or money. 

The brisket was simply awful. First, there was no smoke flavor to the food at all, and the brisket was served in nearly inch-thick slices (should normally be 1/8th of an inch). This is done to mask the fact that the BBQ has been insanely overcooked. The bark had no real flavor to it at all, as if there was no rub used, or a very bad rub had been used. You would get a better result throwing a brisket in your oven. 

The turkey was a similar story - no smoke flavor at all, incredibly bland. 

When it comes to the sides, the potato salad was the most bland I've ever had. The cole slaw was the highlight of the meal, and it was simply OK. 

I suppose it is possible that the pork (shoulder, or ribs) is much better than the turkey or brisket, but if you're going to call yourself a \"Texas BBQ\" restaurant, the brisket should be your #1 meat. 

My wife and I threw away 80% of the food we purchased, it was that bad. I've NEVER done that at a restaurant in my life. 

I guarantee that the positive reviews are coming from people who've never had real BBQ. 

Please do yourself a favor - visit Texas, and stop by one of the many BBQ joints in the state, and avoid The Proper Pig."}
{"text":"Waited in line outside on a sunny Sunday morning! Purchased 1/2 pound each: turkey, brisket, pulled pork; also got 2 Texas hot links (all to go, I love me some meat, but I had to share!). My car smelled like heaven on the way home, and that mouth-watering scent was just the start! Absolutely loved everything... Saving the 5th star for when the ribs are available!"}
{"text":"Welcome to Ohio, Texas BBQ. Living in the lone Star state for over 6 years and hitting up over a dozen texas bbq joints ...I had to check this out. Happy to see nestled in my homeland of CLE this proper pig is LEGIT yall. After testing my pallet it's got everything great Texas brisket is praised for and sought after. Smoke ring -covetted burnt end crunch- melt in your mouth tenderness- flavor- smoke. No sauce needed. It's good to know you don't need to travel far for the good stuff ;-)"}
{"text":"I hit up their food truck at Walnut Wednesday and got the brisket sandwich. It was underwhelming. The meat was bland, the bbq sauce was bland, the slaw was incredibly bland, and the bread was, well, bread. For $9, the portion of brisket was a joke, with most of it being fat. I really hope the restaurant is better, because I had high hopes for this place.

Oh, and they sell bacon on a stick for $5. 

A slice. 

Of bacon. 

On a stick. 

No I didn't get it, but several people ahead of me who still think it's 2013 when the bacon craze was at its peak did."}
{"text":"Wow! Awesome bbq! Had the Slopper, which was just meat heaven on a bun. My wife had the smoked turkey, which was absolitely perfect!  If you like Q, this is an excellent place to go for brisket, pulled pork, sausages, etc."}
{"text":"So, I don't get to Cleveland often, and I'm certainly no expert on their culinary scene.  I trust Yelp.  So, when I was looking for dinner, this place popped up - solid rating, many reviews, I decided it was worth the risk.  Off I went!

First, parking.  It's on the street.  And, you need to keep your eyes open, as I passed it the first time.  It sits on a corner, very unassuming exterior.

I opted to try one of the two-meat plates- I tried the brisket and the smoked turkey.  I love brisket, and this was great - just the right amount of char on the exterior, and a great smoked flavor.  And the smoked turkey.....WOW.  Best I've ever had.  Seriously, I loved it more than the brisket, and I didn't think that was possible.  I also tried their bacon on a stick - nice thick cut of bacon, with a really great maple flavor ( some people might call this candied bacon).   Get it for an appetizer.  

For my sides, I just did a bag of chips and some bread - the meat was the star of this show.  If I'm up this way again, I'll definitely try the hot link sausage and the ribs.  You can't go wrong with this place!"}
{"text":"I finally made it to the proper pig smokehouse. I was underwhelmed. First, they tout Texas BBQ but they are called the \"Proper Pig Smokehouse.\" They cook pig in Tennessee not TX so that really makes no sense at all but we from the South know that, not so much Clevelanders. Anyway, on to the food. The Brisket was not bad but was as other reviewers stated fatty and not warm. The pulled pork was better and the ribs were all salty. Way too salty, almost not good at all. The sides tasted bland as if scooped out of a five gallon bucket and their beer was kind of way too expensive for a 12 ounce can or bottle. The space inside is pretty small. When i was there, there was a small line and not too many places to comfortably sit unless you wanted to be bumped into by the people in line. I would equate the experience to a stationary food truck because as i understand, that is what it is. Also, this was the 3rd time I went there with my 17 year old son and yes finally they were not sold out or closed. Overall, I probably wont be back for the quality of food i recieved. And if you run a restaurant then you need to have the food people come to eat instead of always being closed or sold out."}
{"text":"Ordered catering delivered to our home for 30 people.  We chose the chicken thighs/brisket meat option and two sides.  Our guests raved about how good the food was.  The delivery arrived about 15 minutes early and was efficiently delivered.  Our sides were baked beans/coleslaw."}
{"text":"The brisket is pretty good, the woman had the whole slab on the counter and cut it to order right in front of me. It had good flavor and was juicy. The barbecue sauce is good too. I got the beef brisket sandwich. However the bun was absolutely a disappointment and basically un-edible.  It was literally just some dry cold bun the person making my food pulled out of some bag. You can't have a good barbecue place and serve barbecue sandwiches on shitty, generic dry bread buns. 

The atmosphere wasn't bad, and I even got a cookie which was delicious. The baked beans were also pretty darn good. I might come back, however it was a bit overpriced. Not sure how long this place will last with delicious meats served in between two large pieces of dry giant eagle burger buns. 

3.5/5"}
{"text":"There's something about BBQ that makes a man feel like a man. Meaty, saucy, fatty, crunchy, messy - the proper pig brought out my inner cave man. ROAR. I ordered the combo with 2 meats (brisket + pulled pork) and 1 side (potato salad). 

The meats were tender, melt in your mouth. I really enjoyed the house bbq sauce - a bit thicker than Mabel's - and slathered onto my meats to provide the necessary lubrication to devour it in a matter of minutes. The side potato salad was also tasty - definitely not as good as Mabel's - but it had an interesting take with a chipotle-esque mayo that added a bit more flavor than expected. 

The Proper Pig is a good 2nd piggy to Mabel's in terms of the Cleveland BBQ scene. Will definitely go back especially for the comparative price - $12 for the combo versus ~$20+ for something similar at Mabel's."}
{"text":"First, let me say that BBQ is my passion and I've had it A LOT (from all over the country); my favorite being Louis Meullers in Texas.  I haven't seen beef ribs on a menu outside of Texas but they had them at The Proper Pig (on Thursdays at least, when we stopped in).  I was very excited and mentioned Louis Meuller's to the owner who said that's who inspired their beef ribs (BTW - we got one of the last beef ribs - they sold out before 5 on this day)

We got a beef rib (about 1 1/2 pounds of meet on the bone), brisket, pulled pork, slaw, potato salad, and baked beans.  The rib was VERY tender and tasty, not as pepper forward as LM but had a really delicious crust (all of their meat did - I'n not sure if they sell their rub but I'd buy it.  Brisket was well cooked and tender with a nice smoke ring and the pork was also tender.  Their sauce (on the tables) was also delicious and well balanced.  We were pleased with all the sides as well.  Not a dud in the bunch.  

I know how difficult it is to have consistent BBQ but this place was firing on all cylinders.  We were very happy with everything"}
{"text":"As someone who claims to be the \"best bbq in cleveland\" it doesn't even come close. The ribs were not fall off the bone, the sausage was subpar at best, and worst of all the brisket was just a dry piece of bark. There was a sliver of fat but the rest was like eating sandpaper.(you can see in the picture) 

I highly recommend against going here. I spent $19 for a 2 meat combo with ribs/1 side and an extra piece of sausage. 

You can go to Dickey's 5 min away and get a 3 meat combo (ribs and brisket included) with 2 sides for $12:50 and their meat is actually presentable. If you're looking for a quick BBQ fix in the area, go to Dickey's. If you're willing to make the drive go to Mission BBQ in Parma for the best BBQ in cleveland and at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Delicious brisket and pulled pork! I've ate at the proper pig four times now. I've tried all four of their main meats. Although nothing was bad the pulled pork and brisket are my favorites. The last time I ordered the brisket it was way too fatty (over half of the serving) but knowing the great brisket I've had there before I'm sure I will order it again. Other than the meats nothing is that amazing. I was nervous to try the proper pig after a disappointing meal from their food truck but I'm glad I took the chance. That's all I can say about the food, the service however is 3 star at best. Good luck finding a time they are not sold out of something. In addition to the four times I have ate at proper pig there is an equal 4 times I have tried to and found the door locked with a sold out sign hanging up. I get that its smoked meat and you don't want to cook more than will be used, but after 3 weeks of selling out of product hours before you close every day you'd like to think someone would get the hint. The staff always looks exhausted, inexpressive and like they would rather be anywhere else but there (including one guy who I assume is the owner). I don't mean to be picky but it really gives the place a dull/dead vibe. Over all the food is pretty good, but service needs an upgrade."}
{"text":"Just moved here after 35 years in Texas and being a Texas bbq aficionado I've had the best- Franklin, Krutz, Brooks, etc and also I also smoke my own.
I'm not an expert, but I know real Texas bbq...
The Proper Pig is modeled after Franklin in Austin Texas they say but it's no where near as good.
(Proper Pig is an odd name for TX bbq where in TX it's beef, rarely Pig, but it's just a name.)
Anyway, with much anticipation I ordered the chopped beef and was asked if I wanted fatty or lean. Fatty of course, and the ONLY way to go, but alas it wasn't even close to fatty. Good bark and good taste but very dry and  not chopped but chunks. Really a poor imitation of Texas bbq, and not even close to Franklin.
Franklin uses Creekstone  brisket and this was not the big juicy hunk of cow you get from Creekstone.
I don't mind paying $10 for a bbq sandwich if it's like Franklin, but this isnt. Good try and the people there were nice, and it's a nice place but these guys need to work a little harder and buy better beef. It's not easy making great bbq day after day, but that's what makes the great ones great.
Keep working guys, I know you can do it.
Oh yes, I'll be back but I'm going to be expecting better next time."}
{"text":"environment: small. feels like a fast food joint. order your food at the counter, pick up your food, and pay, then pick a place to sit and eat.

staff: friendly

price: i feel a little bit above average

food: average - above average

first time i came here, it was not what i expected. i was expecting a restaurant type place but it seemed more like a fast food bbq place, like dickey's bbq. the menu was a bit confusing for me at first ad i felt the price is a little bit high for what you get. the first time i went i had the pulled pork and i loved it because i got a fatty and flavorful chunk. it comes with bread, unions, and pickles which compliments the bbq very nicely. the second time i went, the pulled pork was not as enjoyable. it was a bit more dry and not fatty. the ribs are good, but nothing special. their sauce however, was very good. i loved their bbq sauce as well as their pope's hot sauce. it is actually pretty spicy so dont add too much."}
{"text":"This was my first visit and the food was amazing!  I had the brisket sandwich.  The meat had an excellent smokey flavor but was a little fatty.  The fat just made the meat melt in my mouth.  The sauce at the table was amazing.  I want to drink a glass of it!
The only negative is that the menu is a little confusing and the hipster douchebag that waited on me was none too helpful with deciphering the menu.  I'm sorry that I don't have your menu memorized and know all of the nuances to ordering.  I rate the food 5 stars and the hipster meathead a 3 so I rounded up to a solid 4 stars.  I will definitely go back and will study the menu so as not to bother the staff having them explain how things come."}
{"text":"The brisket at Proper Pig is every bit as good as anything you'll find in Texas outside of Central Texas itself (the home for this style). The brisket here is not quite up to par with the Austin, Lockhart, Tyler and other Central Texas places, but no one else can match them either. If this restaurant was in Houston or Dallas it would be 4 stars. They get a bonus star for doing proper brisket this far north!"}
{"text":"Best barbecue spot so far in Lakewood. Good Texas style barbecue. Great price. Great atmosphere. 

I got the two meat tray with one side with ribs added on and an extra side. I chose brisket, their sausage, and the ribs with beans and coleslaw. First off it all appears to be house made. Which is a plus! The brisket was good, a tad on the dryer side than I prefer, but the char was spot on and the fat melted away in your mouth as it should. The sausage was delicious and the ribs were not my favorite. The turkey my girlfriend got was killer. Definitely recommending that. The beans were probably my favorite beans of all. Great flavor and not overly sweet. The coleslaw was good. The only bad thing I had was a bite of my girlfriends potato salad. It had little flavor other than potatoes. The barbecue sauce was tasty, but if it's truly Texas style, which this was, it's not needed. Onions, pickles and bread were included! Overall it was good. Best in Lakewood for sure, but not my fav in NEO.

As for the atmosphere, it was cool inside there. There is a big table down the Center for people to share. Other four tops off to the side. You order at the counter. The guy taking our order was nice. The rest of the staff stood behind him in the back and didn't say much. It was close to closing so I get the not talking much part. Still kind of awkward though.

Price was great. A hair under what you'd expect for good barbecue. 

I'll definitely be coming back when I'm around Lakewood."}
{"text":"The baked beans are smokey and more savory rather than sweet which I liked. The potato salad was good, but didn't have a ton of flavor. The beef brisket and pulled pork we're solid. The ribs were over seasoned, smaller, and tougher than others I've had. The customer service was ok. When I went to pay the cashier commented about tipping and then made it clear she was watching what I tipped which was uncomfortable."}
{"text":"Incredible BBQ.  So glad they got that second smoker so they can stay open longer and have more food."}
{"text":"Went for lunch, party of 3. Got a platter with smoked brisket and pork with potato salad, a half slab of ribs and a smoked turkey sandwich with coleslaw. Food was fast at the counter and service was good. With tip and one adult beverage the meal came to $50. So for that price I was expected to be blown away. None of the meat tasted especially fresh. Biggest disappointment was the ribs, best item was the brisket. The turkey was dry and the pork had a lot of inedible fat on it. And you have to bus your own table. Food did not measure up to expectations based on price."}
{"text":"Service was awkward we were stared at while we ate. The food I was ok but is a pricey. No kids menu or really anything kid friendly. Overall it was ok."}
{"text":"Took my husband, 3.5 year old and 5 month old here today for my husbands birthday. I checked to see when they were not busy and got there at the right time where was a table free. 
I honestly wanted to see how 'kid friendly' it is because the general Yelp info says Good for kids. No kid menu. Though a milk crate filled with 80s era wrestling dolls was pretty rad! Especially the Junkyard Dog which was my fav growing up ;)
I got the Pulled Pork sandwich with potato salad and split it with my daughter. My husband got the mammoth Proper Slopper with a side of beans. Two IBC Rootbeers, a bottled water and two bags of chips. $32. 
My sandwich was pulled pork perfection and I even loved the vinegar-heavy sauce at the table. My husband loved his massive sandwich as well. We both felt luke warm on the beans and potato salad though. The potato salad was just flavorless. I added salt and pepper but nada. Anyway, we definitely plan on bringing BBQ lovers to this place. I would bring the kids again but carry the baby in and leave the carrier in the car. All in all a successful birthday trip!"}
{"text":"The Meat was Ok,The sides were bland and everything was way too expensive. 40$ for 3 people and it was the cheapest sandwiches there. It'll be out of business just like every other place before it like the old Quiznos location in diamond center. I'll give it a year or so before it's gone too.

My advice,clean up the seating and add booths. Get more sides on the menu and make the place look like a \"Real\" sit down place instead of just an overpriced BBQ Sub place. Oh and take the \"Tip\" thing off of the IPad. No servers/no Tip"}
{"text":"Stop by today for brisket and a beer.  Proper pig did not disappoint!! Brisket was outstanding. Beer was cold and slaw was great.  If it's as good on next visit as it was today I will give it five stars.  Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I originally gave the restaurant 1 star - due to being upset about the price/quality of their food. I was shocked and pleasantly surprised at the quick reaction and rectification of the situation by the management of Proper Pig. Hands down - the BEST customer service I have come across. Everyone has a bad day and based on the customer service alone, I will definitely give them another try."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying this is REAL BBQ.  The BBQ you see down south.  Smoked meat that doesn't need sauce.  The Proper pig is a quaint little spot that sits on the corner of Detroit Ave in Lakewood.  It has 5 tables that seat 4 people and one large community table.  *If they're busy get your food to-go*

I had the pulled pork sandwich.  It was seasoned well, but didn't have a lot of bark. *that smoked outside of the meat that turns black*  This sandwich is on a hamburger bun so you can imagine the size.  

Overall, the portions are decent, and the prices are low, and the meat is well seasoned.  Southern BBQ has landed in cleveland, but don't get too excited.  I had higher expectations.

Cons *I know you're wondering why 3 stars*
- the space is small meaning the kitchen is small.  They run out of food often.  My only options were ribs or pulled pork. I really wanted the brisket or hot links.

- they run out of sides too!  They were out of the baked beans everyone loves.

-banana pudding is their only desert
-extra lite on the bark.  You can tell the meat was smoked, but this isn't smokehouse meat."}
{"text":"I tried the turkey, brisket and ribs.  Both myself and my son thought it was too much pepper.   The bark on all of the meats was overpowered by the amount of pepper in the rub.  I Peeled off the bark and ate the meat, otherwise I couldn't finish it- especially the turkey.   I would have liked to have some juice to dip the brisket in because it was a bit dry, not much fat and I don't usually apply BBQ sauce.   The ribs were not fall off the bone ribs and the rub was too strong with pepper.  This is probably just a different style of bar b q I am not accustomed to.  I prefer vinegar base and I like a dry rub over BBQ sauce, just not so heavy with pepper.     Cost was $45  for (2) 1/2 lb portions of each (brisket / smoked turkey) and a full slab of ribs."}
{"text":"My parents took me here after they were excited to hear a BBQ place joint finally opened up by their home. When I walked in, I was so surprised by the atmosphere (in a great way!). 

To order, you go up to the counter and you tell them what you want, they prepare it right then and there, and then you choose an available seating area which ranges from tables to barstools. 

I got a half a rack of ribs with a side of beans and a large soda. My dad got a HUGEEEE Cleveland sandwich with a side of beans and a large soda. We broke the bank with $30!!!! I could not believe it. You think the price is good? Try the food!

The rack of ribs were so amazing loaded with flavor and the perfect amount of heat. The smoked beans had so much flavor with the variety of beans and you truly tasted the smoke that I actually got a side to go because I couldn't get enough. How was my dad's sandwich? Well, I was only three ribs in when I looked up and he had crushed the entire meal. To say he loves it is an understatement. He's been there three times in three weeks.......

I am a BBQ snob and I cannot get enough of this place. From the combination of the price, the food, and the atmosphere, this surprisingly perfect restaurant is my new favorite and must try for all!"}
{"text":"I would wait in line forever to eat at The Proper Pig, which is great because there is definitely a wait. So worth everything!!"}
{"text":"Hands down best BBQ in Cleveland. Texas style BBQ is great. Their brisket and bacon on a stick are a must. I always hit up their truck at the Cleveland Flea, and I'm excited they are opening in Lakewood."}
{"text":"We have been coming to Proper Pig since they opened the Lakewood location.
Absolutely phenomenal BBQ!
We love the pulled pork- tender flavorful and a nice health quantity.
Smoked Turkey just outstanding flavor. In fact not only do we order when we eat in but the past 2 years we have added a full order into our Thanksgiving tradition. Ordering ahead for Thanksgiving and Christmas are a must!
and our favorite meat is the Brisket, oh the brisket. So tender so flavorful so delicious. 
In fact if u could grade the Proper Pig solely on meats it would be a 5 but the sides are what bring them down for me.
I'm just not a huge fan of any of the sides.
Baked beans are so so, potato salad lacks flavor, and coleslaw is average. 
They just need a side dish makeover. 
But for the money you can't go wrong on any meat choices- outstanding!!"}
{"text":"We definitely visited here at the right time. We walked right up to the counter and ordered and got our food right away. We were able to snag the last table, but the line that formed behind us was not so lucky. The place is very small with just a few places to sit. The food however, is to die for. I ordered the brisket sandwich with a side of CLE potato salad. The meat was absolutely perfect, along with the sauce, which I think I could have drank. The potato salad, made with stadium mustard, was one of the best I've had. Overall, the meat was delicious and I will definitely be heading back soo"}
{"text":"First  day i had the brisket. Delicious. $10 for half pound of brisket. Came back the  next day and had the pulled pork and coleslaw.  Also delicious.  Reminded me of eating barbeque in texas, so they must be doing something right! No need to add any sauce. Their brisket and pork is simple and incredibly well done! I would highly recommend this place, although i will suggest to eat it up on the spot. When I reheated some leftovers the  next day it was just ok."}
{"text":"FINALLY. Barbecue in Cleveland that I actually want to eat again and again. This is one food genre I think is sorely lacking in CLE but thankfully, PP has stepped in and filled the hole in a big way. 

For me, the price seems on point. For example, the Proper Slopper sandwich: $12 seems steep until you realize it is E. NOUR. MOUS and comes with a side of your choice. I promise even if you have a big appetite, it'll be enough. Delicious, unique, and worth every penny.

One thing I really appreciate about this place is that the sides are well-portioned. I mean I know at barbecue places it's about the meat, but sometimes the size of the sides are just laughable. Not here. Very generous portions and all of them (cole slaw, beans, and stadium mustard potato salad) are very tasty. I also like that they don't try to have 12 different side choices as many places do and end up only having 3 of them that are decent anyway. Keeping it simple has served the Pig well there in my opinion. 

So the meat - all are very good. Pulled pork, hot link, brisket and smoked turkey are all well above average. The turkey is very flavorful and not dry at all. Definitely recommend you give that a shot. The meats here aren't best-ever good but in the barbecue world, that's almost an insurmountable bar.

Something I'd improve on would be offering more sauces - I like a thinner, spicier sauce so would be nice to have that as another option and maybe also a Carolina-style vinegar sauce too. But that's not what their focus is here and I respect that. I just love sauce! Also this is picky, but the sauce jars on the tables are extremely difficult to get sauce from; the nozzles just aren't that great so I wish they'd get different bottles. 

Overall, we love this place and will keep coming back - so grateful to finally have great barbecue in our neighborhood!"}
{"text":"my fiance picked up takeout from here last night. we only ordered ribs because we were making them at home and had a problem with our grill so we already had sides prepared. we had been wanting to try the lakewood location when we lived downtown but never got around to it and eventually moved to the east side so we were excited they opened a mentor location. 

i have to say these ribs are not very good at all. maybe a 5/10. they were pretty disappointing to say the least. i will say the serving sizes are large, we got two full slabs. however; the meat is extremely tough and chewy, they aren't fall off the bone ribs. not only that but they tasted very old and dry. they are the type of ribs that get stuck in your teeth due to lack of tenderness. i also found them to have little to no flavor regardless of the hefty amount of pepper present and if my memory serves me correct, they don't remove the membrane which is very inconvenient. they were a big let down for us. 

i will say my fiancé ordered the bacon on the stick and said it was incredible. i have heard people say these ribs are better than mabel's and that is just an absolute fallacy. i don't know that i would rush back right away but i'd like to give the other menu items a shot. i hope that we just caught them on a back night."}
{"text":"Nobody else in Cleveland knows barbeque like the Proper Pig. If you plan on stopping by for some finger lickin' good pork, you will be astounded to find out that this place is BIG on the PIG. Founded by Cleveland locals, this is a local establishment that is playing a big part in the Cleveland culinary scene. Be sure to get a Proper Slopper with your favorite Platform brew to wash it down!"}
{"text":"Hate to give a bad review, but the food was mediocre at best. The ribs were tough and very fatty. The brisket had no smoke flavor to speak of, and was the driest piece of brisket that i have ever had. The baked bean side would have been better out of a can from Bush's. My family and I eat BBQ whenever we travel so we have experience good quality, and this is not even close to what we have had."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place a 2 star because I liked the potato salad. The meat is extremely tough. We ordered the 4 meat platter.. the turkey is super dry, pulled pork is dry. The bacon is good though. The ribs are not fall off the bone! If I didn't have money left on a giftcard, I would not go back."}
{"text":"The food is fast but in no way is it fast food. Smokey flavor of meats very apparent and tasty. I was impressed with the brisket, very tender. Sausage was good. CLE potato salad, I was looking forward to (made with stadium mustard) sounded like a good idea. It was good but needed more kick. Surprised they didn't have mac and cheese or corn bread or biscuits. My $12 dinner came with two pieces of unimpressive white bread. But I'm planning on going back to try the ribs."}
{"text":"Outstanding barbeque, huge portions, and overall enjoyable experience for our group of three.  We enjoyed the \"Proper Slopper\" and its combination of beef brisket, pulled pork, Texas link sausage, and Cole slaw on top -- along with onions and pickles, the \"Erie Crusher\", and a two meat combo, where we had pulled pork and smoked turkey.  Give this neighborhood gem a try!  About half the customers on this early Sunday afternoon were taking the food for take out."}
{"text":"I have traveled throughout the US enjoying the best BBQ in the world. NC, Tennessee, Texas and KC with a ton of stops in between.

The Pig is the best in Cleveland (by a huge margin) and rates with the best in the US. Paying homage to the central Texas style, post oak smoke and salt & pepper rub, these guys are doing it right. 

The meat is flavorful and prepared correctly. The brisket is world class comparing favorably with Black's or Franklin in Texas. The pork ribs and pulled pork were cooked to perfection and had a great bark. The turkey is not to be missed, big flavor and moist.  The Hot links? MEH. 

The sides are well thought out, slaw was great, well balanced the beans were solid could use some pulled pork in them.  The potato salad was a game changer, made with stadium mustard. Don't miss it!

Good beer menu."}
{"text":"My son and I visited last night, our first time, and after reading the reviews, it seemed like a safe bet. We are both hard core BBQ enthusiasts, and were glad Lakewood had a highly rated place. The service, cafeteria style-common with many southern BBQ places-was good. I had a two meat combo platter, with pulled pork (surprisingly good) and brisket (40% fat & meh). I had beans as my side which were also good. My son had a half rack of ribs and bacon on a stick, both of which seemed pretty good to him. We loved the sauce on the table as well. We ate our meals and left, only to suffer \"stomach issues\" that lasted several hours, and we both complained of a nasty after-taste that lasted even longer. We're going to forget about Proper Pig, and at this point, gladly so."}
{"text":"We had the ribs and pulled pork sandwich with sides of potato salad and beans. The ribs were very tasty - perfectly smoked with nice black pepper rub. They were a tad salty. The barbecue sauce on the tables was good, but it was cumbersome to get it out of the bottle it's in. It also would be nice to have a variety of sauces. 

The potato salad wasn't good at all. It was totally bland, like putting mashed boiled potatoes in your mouth. 

The pulled pork sandwich and beans were fine. Nothing extraordinary.

I think much could be done to make the line move quicker. It was about a 15 minute wait to just get your order in. I realize it would be longer to eat at a sit down restaurant, but if your intention is to get people in-and-out, you gotta have more efficiency. It's already a pain in the ass to park to eat here, so don't give people more reasons to not come back. 

Ideas include:

- don't weigh every portion. By this point, staff should know what a half-pound looks like. And, so what if you accidentally give a little extra? I'm sure it will be appreciated.

-trays with torn paper should be pre-assembled so the person serving the meat doesn't have to do that step for every customer; it just slows things down

- the person serving the meat having to go to-and-from the CresCor heating unit depending on each individual order (for brisket and ribs, specifically) takes up a lot of time; not sure what can be done to maintain quality, but just pointing it out 

Lastly, staff needs to bus tables faster. With people waiting in line for 15+ minutes, the last thing they want to deal with are tables full of other people's trash. 

On the whole, we'll be back. As with all reviews, I want this place to succeed!"}
{"text":"This is a solid BBQ place that shouldn't be missed. The meat is all good- nicely flavored and beautifully cooked. I love the brisket and the smoked turkey, but I really love it all. 
The sides are perfect: not too heavy but a good compliment to the meat. I love that both the cole slaw and potato salad have mayo but also mustard/vinegar so they aren't heavy and overpowered by the mayo. Yum. The potato salad especially is delicious with a nice crunch added.

I don't even know how I feel about banana pudding but I know that not getting it here should be a sin. The owner (?) told me it's his secret recipe so I went for it. I only wish I had gotten a serving for all the people who wanted it- soooo good. So insanely good. It's like a frosting/pudding and not too sweet but the perfect finish to the BBQ meal."}
{"text":"I ordered a pulled pork sandwich with a side of cole slaw from the Proper Pig's food truck.  The sandwich was assembled and delivered in under five seconds!  The pork was soft, succulent, and deliciously smoked.  I found myself wanting more pork!  For nine dollars, they should give you a bigger bun and more pork, but I loved every bite of it.  The cole slaw was tasty too.  

I want to visit the restaurant so I can sit down and eat some pig properly."}
{"text":"Love this place best BBQ I have had since living in Houston Texas!
Be prepared to wait! It's worth it!"}
{"text":"I got the combination meal with pulled pork and smoked turkey breast as a side I got potato salad. The person I went with got the sausage and brisket. The pulled pork and brisket were the best of what we got. You order the food from the front then it is served on a cafeteria type tray. Then you pick your seat. When your done you clear your spot. So its more of a casual place. I can't say I'd return, I think it was more hype then actual flavor especially for the price."}
{"text":"Living in the south for an extended period of time, I have tried my fair share of BBQ places and this place really measured up. I had the pulled pork, which honestly, was some of the best I have had yet. The only complaint I have was their lack of side options. 

Even for that one fault, their pulled pork was good enough to merit 5 stars."}
{"text":"The food was fabulous sampled a few different items between our group & we loved every bite.  Cannot wait to go back:)"}
{"text":"The brisket is smoky, and juicy. Not too dry. Very flavorful. Definitely going to have to come back."}
{"text":"Finally made it to this place after hearing all bad reviews. We had to try for ourselves. We both ordered the Proper Slopper, which is all kinds of meat on a stale cold hamburger bun with the worst cole slaw ! The meat was all dry and over cooked with no flavor. One consolation was my husband liked the beans and the staff was friendly. Like one other review stated it is set up like Dickeys but much more expensive and food is tough, dry and tasteless. Should have listened to our friends."}
{"text":"Very close to true Texas brisket. I get to Austin a lot and eat a ton of Texas BBQ. The brisket had a good bark and was very tender. The pulled pork was well prepared but not real flavorful. The hot link was traditional and good. I enjoyed the service that included pickles and onions. I have to say my only problem was the brisket was cut improperly which left us with a bad slice. I would've asked for burnt ends, but it seemed a bit unorganized and I didn't want to cause a slow down. But all-and-all a solid BBQ."}
{"text":"Good food. Good smoke. Good service. Boring sides but sides really don't matter when it comes to bbq. All I need is good meat and some white bread"}
{"text":"Disappointed. I really wanted to like this place but unfortunately all the food was cold and very dry. Even more disappointing is that I tried the ribs, Turkey, brisket, and pulled pork and I didn't enjoy any of it. I think the food actually being hot would have made a great difference. The place is cute on the inside and the people are friendly, but it is very overpriced, spent almost $30 on two meals. On to the next BBQ place."}
{"text":"Similar in concept to another local BBQ restaurant. I'd have to say it is a tie. I wasn't able to discern too much of a difference, but I certainly had a great meal. 

You can get sandwiches or choose meats by the 1/2 pound. I got the pulled pork and the brisket. While there was no choice between lean or fatty brisket, the brisket I was served was lean, completely edible and delicious. 

When ordering meats by the 1/2 pound you also get a choice of a side. I chose potato salad. The potato salad was good, not too creamy, and made with stadium mustard I read. Meals also come with onions, pickles and that perplexing slice of white bread. 

I loved the Pope's branded hot sauce on the table. It was certainly flavorful, but not too hot. The house made BBQ sauce was good as well. It was just a bit thick, not too sweet and a great compliment to both the meats I ordered. The main difference between this place and competitors in my opinion was the sauce. I think this BBQ sauce has a slight edge over others. 

Also - bacon on a stick is amazing. It is thick cut candied bacon and absolutely delicious. Worth $5? Of course not, but order it anyways."}
{"text":"I picked up some takeout from here a few months back and forgot to write a review so I'm doing that now. I love the fact that I can order smoked meat by the pound and carry out. I got the pulled pork and the brisket. I remember them both being great. I think we got a little side of sauce. There could have been more BBQ sauce but that's easily remedied. The sides weren't very memorable either, but that's not what I came for. 

If you're looking for some real smoked BBQ and you live in the Lakewood area, this is the best place I know of."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time with this place, If you want good BBQ go some place else. Both the pulled pork and the brisket were super dry and bland. Way overpriced for what you get."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful to grab a quick place to grab sourthern style bbq in Lakewood.  Food and service are always great!"}
{"text":"The brisket is real good. The pulled pork was dry. We got there late in the evening and those were the only meats left (sausage as well.) I didn't  try the sausage.  I had the two meat platter $12 with potato salad. I didn't like the potato salad. They don't have salt, pepper, or any seasonings besides the bbq sauce which has a strong vinegar taste. I will go back again."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic, I stumbled upon this place on accident a few months ago and just had to go back. I'm a solid 40 minute drive and yet again, they did not disappoint. Brisket was tender, flavorful, and practically melts in your mouth. The pulled pork is absurdly good, I bought a whole pound to bring home with their delicious barbecue sauce. Got to meet Tom, or Tommy, couldn't remember which he preferred. Pretty cool dude who takes pride in his work and loved my positive feedback. He gave me a couple banana puddings complementary to try and they were also very good, if I'm honest, I'm eating it while typing this. The only downside is they need a bigger space because they should be packed every hour of every day!"}
{"text":"Being from Texas I am used to GREAT bbq, this was not it. There should not be meat stuck to the bone when you eat ribs... period. The turkey and pulled pork had little flavor. The potato salad was just ok. I wish I would've tried the bacon."}
{"text":"This place was awesome! Got the pulled pork sandwich with potato salad. Loved it! So glad there is finally a good bbq place in mentor! Can't wait to try everything on the menu!"}
{"text":"The Proper Pig is a food truck that only recently opened a dine-in location. Even if you didn't know that going in, you'd be able to tell once you were inside.

Before I get into my nitpickiness, I get that their thing is meat. The meat is their priority and everything else is an afterthought. And with that being said, the meat is good. Real good actually. Even though they were out of ribs (!), we were able to fill up like the carnivores that we are. But if you're going to make the leap to restaurant, you need to put in a little more effort.

I ordered the smoked turkey sandwich and that's what I got: turkey on a bun. There's nothing else on it, not even sauce. I got a side of pickles and stuck some on there along with some of the sauce on the table to jazz it up a bit. The pickles are probably the cheapest pickles you can get and were pretty blah as far as pickles go. I totally get that they want you to focus in the meat, but come on. Put something on there! Have like, a toppings bar or something. I assumed that all the bottles on the tables were barbeque sauce, this being a barbeque place and all, but labels would have been nice. I also would have appreciated more than one sauce option.

Now since this sandwich is just meat and a bun, you'd think the bun would be kind of important, right? Well, it was just a plain white bread bun that they literally pulled from the plastic bag that it came in. I think they could up their game and maybe hit up one of the local bakeries for something a bit tastier. Also, what about toasted or at least warmed buns? It was just sad and seemed disrespectful to the meat. Also, it was a $9 sandwich so I think it calls for better bread. The sauce just soaks into the bread and you wind up with bits and pieces of bun that you try to mush together to continue too support the oodles of delicious meat. 

The potato salad was okay. It was pretty unappealing, like something that came out of a huge tub in the back. Overall it was pretty bland. I'm not sure why they thought it was a big deal to advertise that it was made with stadium mustard...

I also wish they gave you plates and actual silverware. I get that they don't want to have to deal with dishes, but for the price, I'd like a plate. This isn't a food truck. I also wish they would use anything other than Styrofoam. All their takeout containers are Styrofoam and the cups for the soda fountain are Styrofoam too. It's soooo terrible for the environment. I also didn't notice a recycle bin despite all the bottles and canned beverages they have, but maybe I just missed it.

The staff wasn't particularly friendly either. No one greeted us or acknowledged or presence while we read the menu and we were the only ones in line. I was trying to figure out what drinks they had in the cooler and the woman at the register just stared at me instead of offering to help and no one was wiping down tables and they were all dirty. 

If meat is your thing go for it, but maybe just get some meat to-go and make your own sandwich."}
{"text":"I tried Proper Pig for the first time last night and was blown away.  It's hard to find good BBQ this far north of the Mason-Dixon Line, but this place surpassed expectations and is a new favorite.  The meat is incredibly tender and falls apart in your mouth, the portions are generous, and the beer selection is diverse and satisfying to any tastebud.

If you want an evening to relax, drink a cold one, and eat effortlessly good food, do yourself a favor and go to the Proper Pig.  Get some pickles, too."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed. 
Tried the brisket, pulled pork, and turkey. The only one that had any flavor was the turkey, but it was pre-sliced sitting in some sauce/juice. There was no smoke flavor in any of the meats. They also need to be introduced to Salt, it is a key component when your smoking meats."}
{"text":"It's always a good sign when the line is nearly to the door! I visited the Proper Pig with several other Yelpers and had a great experience. What stood out to me the most were the quality of service and the tenderness of the meats.

The Proper Pig has a casual feel that's ideal for a smokehouse: rolls of paper towels and big bottles of BBQ sauce adorn the tables. We sidled up to one of the large tables in the center of the room and were presented with a delicious-looking platter of ribs, pulled pork, brisket, and turkey and several sides including baked beans, coleslaw, and potato salad. The meat was served with white sandwich bread, pickles, and fresh white onions. The menu also includes other options, like sandwiches a bacon on a stick.

All of the meats were succulent and tender, even the turkey. The ribs had a good amount of meat on them and the brisket had a beautiful smoke ring. All of the meats had a peppery rub on them and the sauce that accompanied them was a sweet and tangy Midwestern style. For me the sides were just okay. If I could see any area of improvement, it would be in the sides, but I was more than happy with the smoked selections and those alone would bring me back.

I do have to say that Shane, one of the owners, was an excellent host. Hats off to him for treating us so well and allowing us to sample what the Proper Pig has to offer. His passion for what he does is evident and he truly cares about his customers. I'm looking forward to coming back here the next time I have a hankering for BBQ."}
{"text":"Wednesday evening walk in. Just one other couple. Well lit. Clean. Great brisket and pulled pork. My wife is a serious brisket eater from San Antonio and got her authentic smoked meat fix. The beans were excellent, smokey and saucy with brisket ends. 

Solid beer selection in bottled and cans. Great place to get solid smoked meat.  

Potato salad \"cle\" style with stadium mustard was a disappointment. No flavor. Couldn't taste mustard, but there wasn't any flavor, even salt. I'm left complimenting the well cooked potatoes. Not where you want to be with potato salad. Hopefully this was a one day mixup or something. 

A little pricey for Lakewood but the quality delivers. Can definitely bring someone who expects quality smoked BBQ and not disappoint them."}
{"text":"I came to Proper Pig with a group of 10 Yelpers to try out some tasty barbeque and it was absolutely delicious!

It's a nice little place with tasteful wood décor, nice lighting, ample seating, and a few TVs mounted on the walls.  You just walk up to order from the counter with a blackboard menu behind it.

It was pretty busy at the time, as it was their grand opening week, they were selling out of some items, and the line was half way to the door!  Luckily, Sheena W had messaged Shane, one of the owners, in advance and mentioned that we would be coming with a large group, so they prepared a nice sampler platter for us.  Shane was really cool and made all of us feel welcome in his restaurant.

We all sat a communal table in the middle of the dining room and Shane brought out the goods.  The sampler tray was huge and it included a little bit of everything!  The ribs were fall-off-the-bone tender and the brisket was nicely smoked and juicy with not a lot of fat! So damned good!  The barbecue sauce provided at each table was really good paired well with the meat. The smoked turkey breast was surprisingly cooked really well and not dried out which can easily happen if you don't cook it right.  The pulled pork was nicely seasoned and made for a nice little sandwich using the platter of white bread, onions, and pickles that were provided.  We also had some tasty sides of potato salad, baked beans, and coleslaw and then some banana cream pudding dessert cups!
For beverages, they have a soda fountain, an iced tea machine, and also a nice selection of local bottled brews.  

We were stuffed and very satisfied at the end.  Definitely some of the best barbecue I've had in a loooong time.  I'll definitely be back!  Thanks again, Shane!"}
{"text":"Tried Proper Pig for the first time last night. It was good, but not great. I have heard good things so I am hoping it was an anomaly.

My girlfriend and I ordered a four-meat platter with Brisket, Turkey, hot links, and pulled pork. 

The brisket had a beautiful smoke ring but was really dry. It was also pretty lean so I'm hoping we just got the wrong end of the meat. 

The Turkey was really good. You could taste the smokiness and my piece was pretty moist. My girlfriend said hers was dry. 

The hot links were good. Again, the smoke was definitely prevalent and the sausage had a nice heat but not overwhelming. One of the better things on the platter, though I'd fiddle with the spice levels because it comes off a little one-note. Just smoke and a little heat is really all I tasted.

The pulled pork was disappointing. It was extremely dry, and while I could pick up the smoke, the dryness made it taste more like ash.  My girlfriend loves to judge BBQ places by their pulled pork. I always tell her that's not a good way to judge because they're usually drowned in BBQ sauce. This one had no sauce, and while I appreciate that, it needed some sauce.

We also got 3 sides. Potato salad, beans, and slaw. All were terrible.

The potato salad tasted like nothing, not even potato. I've seen other people comment on how the potato salad is stadium mustard based. I'm not sure how they could tell... Or maybe they just call it that so people think they can taste it.

The beans were also lacking flavor. Better than the potato salad and I appreciate that they don't just taste like beans in barbecue sauce, but still pretty bland.

The slaw was also lacking flavor. If there was any dressing on it you couldn't tell. The freshness and crispness of the cabbage was a welcome addition, but it needed something tart to cut through all the smoke. Some simple oil and vinegar would have been nice.

All in all, I was not impressed. I'm still holding out hope that we just got unlucky cause I have heard great things and it is ridiculously affordable. I'll be back again for a shot at redemption."}
{"text":"I honestly really like the Proper Pig, and I wish I could give them a higher rating than I am, however the bottom line is that they need to up their sides game. What I mean by this is that The Proper Pig has everything going for it. The meats are fantastic, really smoky flavor. I've tried the brisket, the smoked turkey, the pulled pork and the ribs and all are really tasty. The brisket is a bit on the fatty side, even for brisket in general, but I still really enjoy it. I also feel like the location makes it an ideal spot to revisit, and the service has been nothing but friendly when I've come in. The prices are creeping up to the high end, but I will say it's comparable to other BBQ places that are similar. I'm a bit annoyed that they haven't updated their website to reflect the fact that they doubled the cost to add ribs to a combo platter from $3 to $6, but regardless, the cost alone wouldn't deter me from coming here. I also love how all of their BBQ is served to order and the wait time is really quick, yet the BBQ is never dry. However, what really bugs me is how limited their side choices are. Anyone who loves BBQ knows that half the battle is nailing the sides to compliment the BBQ itself. The Proper Pig offers just potato salad, coleslaw, baked beans and chips (which aren't fresh chips, but rather bagged chips). The sides at that are paltry and disappointing. The cole slaw reminds me of the kind that comes in the huge tubs from a cafeteria. They don't offer cornbread or mac and cheese, what kind of BBQ restaurant doesn't have cornbread? I sort of pushed this off as a \"maybe it will come later\" when they first opened, but it's been nearly 2 years and they still haven't expanded this portion of the menu. I don't want to be critical, because there's a lot I love about The Proper Pig, and I will continue to order from them, but I have to admit that I'm likely to choose other BBQ restaurants over this one, even if the BBQ itself isn't as good, simply because there are more options for sides. Here's hoping they will expand this part of the menu in the future!"}
