{"text":"Although the menu has changed and seems more refined and sophisticated from my previous visits, my third visit here was a bit of a disappointment.    I ordered a table d'hote type of meal, which consisted of a miso soup (tasty, but a bit too much broth and not enough veggies/tofu inside), a salad (a bit of a disappointment compared to the other salads I had here), 17 pieces of sushi/maki, and ice cream for dessert.  The nigiri I had were all excellent, even the scallop which I usually dislike.  One of the rolls I had was lobster with apples and a mango sauce.  My friends really liked that one, and while I was pleased by the interesting combination, the flavours didn't really hit the right note with me.  It seemed a little too cold, as well.  The other roll I received was a cooked and tempura-covered salmon roll.  I prefer my rolls/sushi to be uncooked, so I wasn't as excited by this one.    Also at the table was a side of agedashi tofu, which was covered in too much batter, and the dipping sauce lacked bonito flakes.  The sashimi was excellent, and the katsu chicken bowl was quite good. The bowl came with a do-it-yourself dipping sauce, where the patron is provided with her own bowl of mixed toasted sesame seeds, which she must grind with mortar and pestle, and mix with a sauce.  The prices are higher than other sushi restaurants on the south shore, and though the quality is better than other restaurants, I think I'll reserve this spot as a lunch locale, since the specials are pretty good and there's plenty of variety."}
{"text":"My favorite Sushi place in Brossard.  While you can order anything off the menu for take out, they also have a SPECIAL take out menu of combos for up to 5 people, a very good price.  My fav for two people is Combo for 2 people F that has lots of goodies including their Dragon Eye which is Fried Salmon Sushi...yum!  Another fav of mine is the Tuna Tuna that has red tuna.  The tempura is good also if you are into fried foods :)  The chef knows what he's doing, rice is well made, he cares for the product he puts out.  I haven't had any bad fish here.  The mall is pretty dead except for a few restaurants and offices, so no problem for parking.  The restaurant is a little small so I would call ahead if you are large group."}
{"text":"Nois sommes aller un lundi donc plutôt très calme. Le bon côté? Service excellent et attentionné. Soupe, crevette tempura et sushi. C'était excellent et la présentation était originale. Nous recommandons !"}
{"text":"Raku Izakaya is by no means a cheap restaurant. Its upscale decor and price point write a check that surprisingly its food quality does cash. I particularly liked the attractive presentation and subtle flavours. The waitress explained that the ingredients are carefully selected, even acquired tastes like natto are surprisingly good. The japanophiles among you will know how tricky natto can be, take it from someone who's had the real deal in Japan, these guys know what they're doing. This is the kind of place you reserve with a group of ten - and yes, they do accept special orders if placed in advanced. The friendly staff at Raku will even go as far as special order chuutoro fatty tuna if you're willing to foot the bill. A fine establishment for discerning palettes."}
{"text":"I love this place. But you kind of have to know your food. Don't order a lunch special, or a combo and expect to be amazed. It is a izakaya so enjoy some appetizers and drinks. O and don't forget the sake ice cream!"}
{"text":"I recently discovered this hidden sushis place in Brossard.   Restaurant itself is clean and nice, nothing special though.   Service was amazing and quite fast. When we got there, it was already late (9:50PM) and they let us sit and eat.  Sushis were not the best I've had, but they were good and most important, fish was fresh. I'd recommend creative sushis.  They also offer an exhaustive sake list."}
