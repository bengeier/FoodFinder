{"text":"Awesome cafeteria style restaurant.  Food was great at a fair price.  Just moved from Georgia and was hoping to find a good restaurant with home cooked food. Had the special country fried chicken and Mac and cheese."}
{"text":"My first trip (and last one) there was for lunch yesterday. Whoever told these people you could cook chicken breast country style and call it country fried steak!?! I discovered my 'steak' was actually chicken when I peeled back the breaking and according to a staff member, they choose to pass poultry off for beef and no one complains! The only dish on my plate and my dining companion's plate that wasn't so salty that it was practically inedible was the gelatin salad I chose for desert and even that was not what it appeared to be. I do not understand the accolades from others but I won't waste any more time or money there. I gave it one star because there was no zero available."}
{"text":"I had a Greek salad and it was OK, but who ever told these people to put a Greek salad in a crunchy edible bowl? It could have used a little more feta cheese too. luckily I was in good company so I had a fine time"}
{"text":"Love this place.  They have the best vegetable plate in gastonia!  The cabbage is to die for!  All in all, they have good home cooked food at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"I am a fan of cafeterias, but I rank this one below most others.  Some items were good, but others tasted odd."}
{"text":"I remember when my parents used to love this place and I turned my nose up at it. That was as recently as about 2 years ago and now I can't get enough.  I don't think it's the restaurant that changed,  it was my appreciation for homestyle food. 

Grab a tray and some silverware and slide down the line making your selections like you did in school, only with far more and better choices.  
First are salads...garden, macaroni,  weird pea salad...all kinds of salad.
 Next in line are desserts.  Yeah it's a little weird layout.  There are several different pies including sugar free,  cakes, banana pudding, and cobblers. If they have strawberry cobbler you should get that.
 Next up are the meats. Everything rotates but you can usually expect a meatloaf, some sort of fried chicken, both fried and baked fish, and maybe some spaghetti or chicken n dumplings.  
My favorite - the side dishes. Mac and cheese, creamed corn,  carrots,  pintos, green beans, fried okra, dressing,  mashed potatoes and gravy, cabbage and probably twice that. 
Finally we have breads. I always say I'm not going to get bread because I already got so much but it calls my name. They have rolls the size of my head that glisten with butter, really good mexican cornbread,  and other assorted breads that I never choose because those I mentioned are so good. 

Highlights: strawberry cobbler, mac and cheese,  dressing, okra, and chicken with white gravy. Omg last time I had it, it was better than my momma's fried chicken."}
{"text":"Pulled off the highway on a road trip from New York to Georgia and found myself at Jackson's Cafeteria. Certainly an experience for a Yankee. The environment reminded me of a school cafeteria, fully equipped with chubby children and hungry locals. I ate a huge thanksgiving sized portion of turkey (maybe it was chicken?), potatoes and veggies and washed it down with the best pecan pie I've ever had. I would recommend it to any out-of-towner looking for a meal and a show, but I wouldn't recommend it for a first date."}
{"text":"I try and take my Mom out to eat once a week and I let her choose where we go. More often than I care for, we end up at Jacksons Cafeteria. Now don't get me wrong, I like cafeteria food, just not Jacksons. I don't know what people see in this place as every time I go there, its busy.
The food is really not that good, I always end up sending something back because its over cooked, to salty ect. And as far as prices, I think its a little over priced for cafeteria food. The only reason I ever go here is because Mom likes to eat here. If it were up to me, I would never set foot in this place.
I think the next time we go out to eat, I'll choose where we go, and it aint gonna be Jacksons!"}
{"text":"It is a good place to eat. The jalape√±o corn bread is really good. I think they have one of the best broccoli casserole. The atmosphere is not the best... Tends to be depressing a times. I think is best to take out"}
{"text":"It smells like old people and diareah. If you can stomach that while eating this place is for you. I've heard it's fantastic and wanted to grab a bite to eat here, but the minute I walked in the door I turned away and left. The stench in here is HORRIBLE. I seriously almost vomited before I left."}
{"text":"Not sure why so many bad reviews. I think people hear cafeteria and are immediately closed off to the idea of it. This place has great \"home cooked\" food. I feel like I'm at my grandma's house when I eat here. Great veggies and different meat options. So many choices! Staff is always very friendly. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Awesome home cooked food!

This is a Gastonia institution and has remained consistently good over the years.

You have the choice of several entrees, always roast beef or pork, fried chicken or fish.

A great selection of fresh veggies including lima beans and fried okra!
For all around selection of home cooked favorites,  it just doesn't get much better."}
