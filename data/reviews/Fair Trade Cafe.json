{"text":"You never know with this place. Today it was, \"We're out of that right now.\" I mean, they only have two type of house coffee and one is out. The pumpkin chocolate chip cake was oily, yeah, oily and with the light coffee I settled for, it was all half and half nutmeg taste in my mouth.
Oh and its also one of those places, people with no wi-fi sit around at ;)"}
{"text":"I'm guessing they turned this place around again, based on previous reviews.  We went here the other morning and it was great.  Awesome, friendly barista, and a good atmosphere overall.  Nice places to sit both inside and outside.  I think the most awesome part is they serve Almond Milk!  Woohoo!  My Veggie Panini was as delicious as described, and the coffee was just shy of perfect."}
{"text":"Fair Trade, I wanted to love you. I really did. I came back even after I paid almost $5 (including student discount) for my soy vanilla latte only to leave because it was too pack to find a comfortable seat. The downtown location brought me back and this time I was lucky to find a seat right next to the front door where I could see the Roosevelt portion of the light rail. Definitely the downtown feel. I ordered a soy latte and I almost asked for more espresso with my soy because it tasted more like coffee flavored milk than anything else. After a few hours of studying I ordered a turkey sandwich which wasn't too bad but couldn't make up for the lack of caffeine in my system. Sorry, fair trade but I tried. Until we meet again."}
{"text":"Wow. All I can say is wow. My favorite coffee shop downtown! Friendly staff, strong coffee, and cute decorations make this place a must go too in the future."}
{"text":"An oasis in the desert!  Fair trade coffee has great mochas.  You can even have it made with almond milk!  Wonderful coffee house feel (take it from a Seattlite)."}
{"text":"Really good coffee. Nice people!! Compfy."}
{"text":"Their lemon bars and fresh teas are delicious. The environment is laid back and great for enjoying good food and tea/coffee"}
{"text":"Pleasant and comfortable atmosphere. Tasty treats and delicious coffee! right by the light rail! The coffee menu is pretty basic so don't come here looking for a complicated frappacino type of thing, but they have a bunch of milk alternatives!"}
{"text":"Sort of late hours, acceptable coffee, a good playlist, and close to the light rail!"}
{"text":"The coffee is fine and I like the fact that they feature fair trade coffee, which they now serve it in espresso cups rather than paper when requested. 

I was disappointed when a customer smoked indoors while sitting on the couch by the front counter and no one stopped him.  I thought that's what the outdoor tables are for..."}
{"text":"Free wifi and this place accepts the belly card rewards. They have ice cream, sandwiches, coffee,tea and pastries. Their coffee is good and so are their brownies."}
{"text":"I would never have been driven to write but after being charged $5.95 for a blended chai with soy milk and *after* having a conversation initiated by the barista of whether consistency or taste being more important, taste being key, I ended up with a milky beverage that was closer to a diluted chai tea bag than it was an enjoyable beverage. I'm sorry that the long wait, the exorbitant price, inconvenient location and bad beverage has swayed me from ever considering them again but when I can get a better tasting blended at half the price in a place like Coffee Bean then it doesn't really pay to go local."}
{"text":"Love the coffee and art here! Have been a regular since moving to AZ and the service staff all know my drink and always have a smile! Plus, in addition to all the usual suspects for dressing up your drink they offer stevia! They run great deals on Groupon so your dollar stretches. Stop in and get your coffee on!"}
{"text":"I came in to get some coffee or latte on the 23rd and I was greeted nicely and I spoke to the barista and the conversation was nice however when I order my Frapp and got it back it look like it was just thrown together without a care, concern or regard for quality. I do realize however that most coffee shops in the United States don't always have to give you the signature Frappuccino cappuccino or latte Leaf art that comes with traditional coffeehouse or shops. Even without a blessed are I would have at least considered that my coffee should look presentable which it was  not.  This is now  why i chose  to  move my purchases of coffee to Lolas next to Pita Jungle or now my NEW favorite  8th Day Coffee and Culture."}
{"text":"I am a fan of their iced coffee, seating availability and free wifi. The only issue is that they are SLOW. Like others have noted, I think they are understaffed. I can only come in on the weekend when I want to stay there and work. It's too unpredictable in terms of the time it takes to to receive your order for me to stop by before work."}
{"text":"If your like most folks and are tired of Starbucks. I must say this place is a breath of fresh air. They have great food, I have only tried their vanilla tea but let me tell you, it's the best thing since slice bread! Side-note, there is free wifi, the customer services is great also the atmosphere is perfect for meeting friends, getting work done and studying. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a change from your local Starbucks."}
{"text":"What happened to this place?  

They used to be so good, there were always nice and friendly baristas, the food was very simple, yet still very good.  But went in last time and I like to order the Veggie Hummus sandwich, but they forgot the cucumber and my bread stale and dry.  The sandwich was not worth my 7 bucks at all.  

Very disappointed Fair Trade."}
{"text":"This is a great place to have a meeting.  Best of all, lots of plugs for my lap top.  I love when you can easily find a plug.  The coffee and food was good.  The atmosphere was nice and calm."}
{"text":"I love Fair Trade .....treats are homemade and lunch menu is very big with salads, sandwich and soups. On weekends the breakfast choices are super yummy :)"}
{"text":"Pretty cool cafe with a mixed vibe.  Seems like a lot of the workers & patrons are feminists which is awesome (especially since I'm living in Utah right now with a SERIOUS dearth of feminists among other politically active people!), but on the other hand there is a pretty distinct yuppie feeling to the place - but that is probably due to it's downtown location.

The barista's were all very friendly & helpful. They pull good shots of espresso and are pretty attentive to details.  Odd detail I noticed and thought was pretty cool: their bathrooms are exceptionally clean, consistently.

There is a lot of local (assumption) artwork for sale in the cafe that is quite nice - adds a good feel to it having dresses, sculptures, etc on the walls that is not only pleasant to look at but available to buy.

PS - Free wireless."}
{"text":"Absolutely love the place. Food is great! Comfortable sitting and free wifi."}
{"text":"My brother and I had a great experience here last Wednesday while traveling in Phoenix.  Stopped by to take advantage of the free wifi, breakfast, and hot drinks.  I ordered the Tomato / Tom-ato egg sandwich (great vegetarian option with greens & protein) along with a cup of hot chai, and both were very tasty.  Comfortable atmosphere and seating, friendly service, clean facility, wifi worked great, no complaints!!  As an added bonus, our server handed out free baseball tickets to the D-backs / Pirates on a day when we actually could make the time to go!!! (How often does that happen??)"}
{"text":"Great choices of coffee, I come here often since I work down the street! Nice and cozy inside and the outside tables are enjoyable too. So good to have this Cafe in the downtown area!"}
{"text":"I like decaf and a good one can be hard to find. They made it fresh and it was excellent. Topped that off with a scope of coffee bean ice cream that had flecks of bean in it and a scoop of Mexican chocolate ice cream which had a nice hint of cinnamon, both were rich and creamy but not over the top with sweetness. They have a nice patio in the back away from the busy light rail stop, but too hot in the summer to sit back there.
A great casual hangout with students, older folks reading and a variety of seating options."}
{"text":"Fair trade cafe is at the top of my list when it comes to downtown urban cafes. Their croissants have melted cheese and the perfect flavors. I watched Viviane pull the shot of espresso for my favorite iced latte and she knows what she is doing. The atmosphere is techy and business like. However it  can be a little loud depending on what time you go. Some like a loud busy place so I will still give it the full 5 stars !"}
{"text":"Over the past couple years of my life, I have spent way, WAY too much time at fair trade. Reading books and drinking coffee is like my 3rd job, and I prefer to do it at my neighborhood cafe. 

If I want drip coffee (which is almost always) I will go out of my way to come here. It's simply delicious. If I want something else I might go elsewhere, but nothing else in central/uptown/downtown Phoenix can compare to a Fair Trade Iced coffee. 

The barista's are sweet, the live music on Saturday afternoons is a joy, the community computer has saved my ass at least a dozen times, it's \"coffee with a conscience\", and it's a 2 minute walk from my apartment. Of course it gets 5 stars!"}
{"text":"They changed their baker and the new one is just not as good as the previous one! Very disappointing as their baked goods are over $4 dollars a piece! Won't be buying any more goodies."}
{"text":"A fine place to hang out with friends. The music selection is upbeat. I like the decoration. It's not an ideal place for having a quiet conversation. You'll have to get used to the buzz and drone of the machines, it can easily drown out your conversation."}
{"text":"Love. Love. Fair Trade Cafe.  I am here every Sunday for a writing group and have been for years, so I do know this location quite well.

First, the staff is top-notch. The know us, they welcome us, and it is truly our Sunday group's home.

My favorites drinks are the almond milk vanilla latte, (my wake-up rock star) as well as the almond coconut tea, (for a relax chill). The smoothies are perfect for summer. (Purple Haze is popular in our group)

Don't miss the turkey and cheddar stuffed croissants. I am also partial to their home made egg salad and fresh bagels. Lots of delicious dessert choices.

Bottom line, this cafe provides perfectly brewed coffee, fresh food, comfortable seats, and goes far and beyond to make their customers feel welcome. The best of all worlds when looking for a cafe. Kudos."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, GREAT coffee, good conscience. May not have that fancy touch if you are bringing visitors for the first time but if you are a regular, you instantly see the charm in each visit.  Hummus & veggie plate = yummy-- along with an almond joy latte... (It's not on the menu, but they make a killer one)
Parking isn't too bad and theres often a spot in the parking garage for the church (located adjacent to the shop)-- would recommend if you are looking for a central coffee joint thats anything but stuffy."}
{"text":"I've tried it 3 times and I love the fact it's right off the light rail. It's kinda cool and funky inside and I love the back patio with the fountain. That all being said, I don't think I'll be back. Can't make an iced latte with actual ice in it at all. Yes I know, espresso should be drank straight and pure but I'm in Phoenix, it's hot, I like iced lattes.  Please please please, stop pouring hot shots over ice and handing me a watered down, lukewarm latte. Please."}
{"text":"Good solid cafe.  The employees are very friendly and their baked goods are quite tasty.  This is always an afternoon staple of mine. 

I appreciate the environment and I have found the people who frequent the place to be very friendly.  

Fair Trade is also open pretty late, so there is delicious coffee almost any time of day!!!"}
{"text":"The cold brew is always great. Try the yummy cookies or pastries also. I usually stop by at least 4 times a week. Must try if you haven't. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"OK, the coffee appears to be \"fair trade,\" but have you checked out everything else there?  Glance in the dumpster when you're leaving and see what you think."}
{"text":"Been here three or four times over the last year and all the coffee drinks I have had there were pretty good. Service has always been friendly. Never been there when it was busy so can not speak to how the service is in a pinch. They have been good when it was dead. Never had food. Nice atmosphere inside. I love that is it is not a major chain, which are dominant in PHX. This place is much better than any fast food coffee (starbuckle, etc.) and the basis of my review is comparing it to places like Intelligentsia or Blue Bottle or Stumptown.

Latte - 4 starts
Cappuccino - 2 stars (too milky)
Iced Coffee - 3 stars (a little bitter)
Iced Latte - 3 stars (a little too much milk)"}
{"text":"I really like this place, today is my second time here and used the free WiFi for first time and by the way is really fast.  The only thing that I didn't like was that after I order a coffee, tasted and didn't like it, went to get something else and they charge me again.  They have there way to do business but as a retail manager that I am, I think that was wrong.  The minimum I would have done it was offer a discount on my next drink or a discount card for my next visit.   I really like the place but next time I'll order water and won't take my chances to try something new."}
{"text":"Delicious pastries, good sandwiches, great drinks, free wifi, almost always open - this place is one of my favorites for a quick drink or a full meal. All their food is made fresh on site, and you can taste that."}
{"text":"The internet never works right and they jack you up bad for coffee prices. Their thieves and call it fair trade because they don't want to deal with your opinion on the subject. Its far from fair as I've ever been to for a coffee shop. Its a good try though"}
{"text":"I'm getting a little suspicious that they put something addictive into their tuna melt because I CRAVE this thing. The focaccia bread is superb with the right balance of simple tuna salad and cheddar cheese. It's so good, I don't even mind the grease factor. I've learned that I have to go early, though, because they have been known to run out of crack...I mean bread.

Sometimes I've had to wait a bit for my sandwich to be ready. At least the people watching makes the wait entertaining. Plus, you know I'm a sucker for China Mist tea."}
{"text":"Best coffee I've had in Arizona.  

I currently work in IT and need a remote place from home to get my work done.  Fair Trade is perfect.  The people are pleasent and I've always been treated with respect.

Come join me for a perfect cup. 

I love you guys and gals at FTC.  Keep doing it."}
{"text":"Yummy lattes, gluten-free options, wifi...i am in love..."}
{"text":"Good coffee, good service.  I have gone three times, and each visit has been great.  

However, they are too expensive.  I am willing to pay more for quality, and I do, but they are startlingly more expensive than any other coffee shop I've been to in Phoenix.  $6 & change for a medium latte?  Serious?  That's almost $2 more than Lux, you guys.  (edit: that's before the tip! cman! by the time I leave there, I've spent the better part of 10 bucks for a medium latte! do I look like Donald Trump to you? better not.)

It's really kind of outrageous.  Other than the weird location, I am sure the prices are why the place is always deadsville when I go."}
{"text":"This place is a bit difficult to find granted but well worth the effort. If you're shopping down at the farmer's market, need a place to study, or just want to plop down with a good book, Fair Trade will caffeinate you as well as  feed you such tasties as quiches, stuffed croissants, cookies, bagels, and sandwiches.  

The cafe was run by the church up until Julyish in answer to Mr. K's musing but they've been bought by a few of the regular customers and are enjoying a slow but steady revitalization along with a steady extension of hours.  They're also hopefully expanding they're menus to include more food food items as volume picks up. 

Additionally, they offer only fair trade coffee and teas so you can do your part to help fair trade just by sipping at a cup of coffee."}
{"text":"I like this place.  There's nothing particularly outstanding about it.  I'd rate any dimension \"fine.\"  But, somehow, all together, it works.  Homey and relaxed feel to it."}
{"text":"I eventually stopped going here: the service became extremely slow, and the quality of coffee declined. Found some better options in the neighbourhood too."}
{"text":"Better than any Starbucks u can get the staff is very friendly and it was located just steps from my hotel which was a plus they also have great ice cream that they sell until 2 in the morning great drunk impulse buy what sold me was the ice cream \"samiches\" made with freshly baked chocolate chip cookies definitely will be a regular stop on my future trips into town"}
{"text":"best coffee in phoenix (so far). experienced and friendly baristas, a large sitting area inside, nice decorations, community conscious, promotes local art and artists, outdoor sitting area, easily accessible location from the light rail and from the portland park neighborhood. 

i had a short vanilla cappuccino and the thing that made it the best insofar to my search for phoenix's best espresso was definitely the milk. it was properly steamed microfoam. the shots were right on, too.

the milk i've had elsewhere in phoenix doesn't compare. thumbs up to fair trade."}
{"text":"This is just a thank you to the staff for their kindness and always energetic attitude. I always feel comfortable when i am just reading or busy working on my computer. 

Thanks again keep up the good work.

Buddy"}
{"text":"As far as atmosphere goes, this is my favorite coffee shop. They've got a stereotypical hipster vibe with mismatched furniture, assorted lighting fixtures, rotating artists featured on the walls, beautiful murals--and they really pull it off!! 

Their raspberry honeybush iced tea is AMAZING, and if you pardon the weird description I also reccommend their sugar cookies that taste a little reminiscent of homemade playdough. (Don't let that make you doubt my iced tea rec. IT'S REALLY GOOD JUST TAKE A LEAP OF FAITH.)

I bumped them up from 4 to 5 stars because of their very clean and maintained gender neutral restrooms. Sincerely, thank you for that!"}
{"text":"This review is based on 50+ visits to Fair Trade.

Pro: It's a central meet up spot on Roosevelt Row. Lots of plugs, and non-distracting music. There are some larger tables, where groups love to convene.

Cons: Anything from the kitchen is over-priced, disappointing, and of such varying quality and portion. As a long-time supporter of downtown and a frequent patron of Fair Trade, I just need to be honest here. This is a frustrating reality. The veggie hummus plate regularly includes celery that has starting to become transparent (a clear sign that it should not be served to anyone). The cucumber is slimy (clearly not freshly cut, and starting to spoil). Also, an ice green ice tea and a \"tuna melt\" will cost you have $10, but there is often so little tuna and cheese that you can only taste the crumbling bread. I am hoping that Fair Trade reads this comment, and starts making half-decent quality food."}
{"text":"Great coffee and great prices!

I love that they are so close to the light rail. I will definitely be stopping by more often when I'm out running errands or strolling around Phoenix. 

I love that their menu isn't too complicated. What they do, they do well!"}
{"text":"Great coffee. Great atmosphere. Very nice people. Wonderful to get coffee somewhere other than a huge chain. Long live a hometown shop!!!"}
{"text":"Weak coffee, breakfast sandwich lackluster.  No friendly greeting when I entered nor a thank you when I left.  Overall not a pleasant experience.  Much better coffee options in the area."}
{"text":"I really like the location, the atmosphere, and the open hours of this cafe. It would probably be the one of few cafes open late in this neighborhood. Coffee/tea is not great but good enough!"}
{"text":"Cookies are amazing! Very nice place and food was so good! Definitely come back again and again. Big Fan!"}
{"text":"Given that I went to the Downtown Phoenix Public Market without any caffeination whatsoever, I was in a pretty gnarled state by the end of my tomato buying excursion. I wanted to sit and cool down somewhere and have some coffee. I immediately thought of all my regular coffee joints, but since I was already in this neck of the woods, I thought I'd check to see if Fair Trade was open.

Now, it's not the first time I've attempted to go to Fair Trade. I've tried several times before on weekends, and they've always been closed. And I'd forget their hours and then try again and...still closed.

But today? Open! So for all you people, at least at noon on Saturdays, this joint's doors are unlocked. 

I walked in and surveyed the scene. I definitely got a Berkeley earth mother vibe, which I didn't really expect to get in downtown Phoenix, but this town never ceases to surprise me one way or the other. I can't remember all the stuff they had to offer for sale besides their coffee products, but I do remember it appealing much to yogacentric ladies (not that there's anything wrong with that).

Ok, survey over, I still needed caffeine. I looked at their menu. The sizes for their coffee drinks: large, grande, venti. Are you kidding me? Why would a coffeehouse, called Fair Trade Cafe of all things, choose to label its cup sizes after Starbucks?  Beats me.

\"I'd like a small hot coffee and a large iced chai. And I want the chai with soy, if you can make it.\"

\"Sure, no prob.\"

Now I know it sounds bizzarre to you, but I needed the hot coffee to wake me up (iced coffee does nothing). But then I wanted something to cool me down. Plus I saw people drinking iced chai at the farmers market and it looked good. And I never drink chai at coffeehouses, hot or iced, so I thought why not today?

I then sat down with my two drinks on the couch and read the NY Times. In a relaxed state. And tasted my drinks.

I'd say the coffee was good, but the iced soy chai was excellent. I kept switching back between sips of each. I guess I'm weird. Or maybe I was just hot from walking around in 100 degrees for an hour. Who knows.

I sat there for a while reading, and I noticed out of 9 patrons there I was the only guy in the entire joint, so maybe it is an earth mother establishment after all. No Sarah Maclachlan on the soundsystem, though. Actually, no music at all. I know that there's no rule governing coffeehouses and whether they should have music (either live or on the stereo) on at all times, but it did seem a little silent, apart from the quiet chattering at the other tables.

I'd say all in all Fair Trade is a good place in a great location and uses best practices to obtain quality coffee (including Pura Vida Coffee and Just Coffee, which comes from a co-op of 50 families in Chiapas, Mexico), but man, if they were only open throughout the weekends and into the evenings, downtown would definitely benefit. I'm not sure if the adjacent Trinity Episcopal Cathedral actually owns the cafe or not, but I didn't get any religious vibe from the joint while I was there.

So, 3 stars for now. Maybe I'll bump up the star wattage in the future. Whenever I find them open again, that is."}
{"text":"Love this cafe, amazing food as well as beverages. I haven't had a single thing here that I haven't loved. Over the summer they do Agua Fresca with is beyond amazing. I love their baked goods, especially their cookies. They atmosphere is great and the service is awesome."}
{"text":"I tell you that this is the best coffee café in all of Phoenix! The place is always clean and tidy. I love their coffee because it does not taste like the typical coffee that you would find at convenience stores, and fast food restaurants. My favorite is the Sonrisa! It is superb! Also the staff is awesome. This is really keeps me coming back. Check it out today!"}
{"text":"I live not so close to Fair Trade, but I don't mind the commute.  The barista's are super chill and the coffee is always good.  The food is really good, too!  Shout out to Tricky for always being so nice!"}
{"text":"Great cafes are one of my favorite things. Good coffee is just one of the required features that these spots must have. There are relaxation factors, the accommodations themselves, the vibe, the clientele, etc. Fair Trade definitely has passed the test with most of these factors...therefore placing it high on my list of favorite things!

The cafe is located in the Arts District right along Roosevelt. It's right across the street from a train stop, so it's real convenient! Once inside, the vibe is pretty cool. There are plenty of tables and plenty of bars along the windows for a good view while you drink your espressos. Paintings line the walls sparingly, giving it a artsy kind of vibe, while at the same time not going overboard with it.

I ordered a vanilla latte with almond milk and stood around and waited. The menu looked real interesting, and when I go back, I'll definitely give some of their food a try. It seems as if they had a lot of veggie and vegan options which is always awesome. There were a few people scattered here and there around the place..I could totally see this spot being packed or close to being full on a regular basis. I got my beverage and headed outside to one of the many tables out front. They also have a back entrance which also has more outside seating as well. 

My latte had a nice, strong flavor balanced with the nice, sweet flavor of the almond milk. It was a perfect mix...not too much of either elements. I sat...relaxed....and watched the traffic pass by as I cleared my head. 

Nice location...nice coffee."}
{"text":"This little coffee kitchen serves up a nice cup of joe with my breakfast veggie burrito they also make smoothies, sandwiches, salads and all organic gluten free menu! What I like is the atmosphere located at ASU downtown campus in Phoenix between central & 1st. ave which is downstairs in a little cove across from campus post office. Now the folks are very friendly here and help me with my menu selection and to make you feel at home you can eat on the couch here! I will be coming back to chill and eat!"}
{"text":"Sunday brunch food is GREAT!  I'm a big fan of their toddy, but some of my coffee-snob friends aren't the biggest fans of the brew here.

Best environment in a coffee shop in the downtown area by far.  The staff is friendly, lots of comfy seating, free wi-fi."}
{"text":"Get a stuffed croissant! Yum! I also just had a cup of coffee which was pretty solid. They have all of your typical coffee and tea drinks plus breakfast and lunch fare. Prices seem to be comparable to other coffee shops. They have a variety of seating options (hang out or study/work) and a comfortable environment with free wifi."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff, great location and awesome that they serve organic, fair trade espresso and coffee plus offer fresh made vegan options for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Loud R&B music in the front competing with the loud rap music in the back I guess for the dishwasher. I even asked the barista to turn down the music. It's impossible to study here!"}
{"text":"Just went back to this place - I forgot how much I love it!  $1.80 for a large free trade coffee with free refills!  That's with the teacher discount.  Love.  Happy.  Hooray."}
{"text":"I love this Cafe. They always have 3 organic coffees to choose from. So if you desired a darker or lighter roast. You had your choice. They also have a nice selection of food;  sandwhiches, plates, soups and salads. And a liitle bit of some thing for every one. Meat eater or Vegan. They have a nice selection of bakery choices and again always some thing for vegans on offer. And very tastey. And if you werent wanting all the sugar they offer bagels. The place it self is very comfortable table seating or sofa recliner type seating. So if you wanted to get some work done you could or if you just wanted to relax you could do that as well. Inside seating as well as outside patio seating. 

We would go here a lot. It was a nice place to come to after work for a coffee and a chat. Before heading home.
Another really nice thing about Fair Trade Cafe. Very relaxing atmosphere. 

A big plus they always have vegan options avaible for all of their food choices. And it is never just toast and jam.  A well made thought out vegan sandwhich or salad or plate. And they serve a side item with your order at no extra charge. Refill coffees were if i remember correctly .75cents or 1dollar. 

Fair Trade Cafe is one of the best Cafes in Phoenix"}
{"text":"Disappointing cafe. I used to like it here because the environment is brightly lit and the music was tolerable, but they must have had some management changes. They brought in more uncomfortable furniture, took away the free WiFi (now you have to buy something every few hours and even then the WiFi is terribly slow) and they have marked up all the prices. Honestly, $4 for a tea bag in hot water is going a little far isn't it? The tea bag costs them .10 cents."}
{"text":"I love this place, the people here are great and they have better expresso than Starbucks. The snacks are awesome also.  I like to stop here on my way to Central Park Square Athletic Club"}
{"text":"Great coffee, food and staff! I go to FTC every Sunday for my writer's group and they have always been awesome in accommodating us. The staff rocks and I've never been served anything but high-quality coffee shop fare."}
{"text":"This is a great little joint to catch a quick meal. They offer tons of options and I love that they are vegan and vegetarian friendly. Although I am not  a vegan or vegetarian, it seems as though all of my friends choose to live the lifestyle and as long as the food is tasty I'm always up for something new. 

This morning me and a mate, Cole decided to stop in for some breakfast. We both ordered the vegetarian hummus sandwich. I definitely recommend it however after 8 months in Australia, Im continuously disappointed with what us American's consider black coffee. 

When simply ordering a long black in the states, it seems to be standard to get a cup of coffee from the pot when what I'm really looking for is a double shot of espresso with some extra water. This being said, food is great but coffee not so much. 

I've been living downtown for only a number of days but am starting to love my community and plan on making this spot a regular breakfast destination."}
{"text":"Fair Trade? More like unfairly priced, as in, ridiculously LOW prices when compared to Lux, Lola, Copper Star, et al.

My espresso macchiato today was going to cost $1.20, but then the kind barrista asked if I was a \"teacher or student.\"  When I said \"teacher\", she asked me for $.98.  I tipped over 100% and still had more money in pocket than had I gone elsewhere.

It tasted like $1.78."}
{"text":"I love Fair Trade! they make THE best blueberry mochas in the city. every time I order a blueberry mocha somewhere else, it just plain sucks, but I've never (never!!!!) had a bad one at FT. other wonderful things about FT include its proximity to the light rail, lovely outdoor seating, parking garage (if you drive), and student discount!"}
{"text":"I love Fair Trade for the studying space, the people and the sandwiches, unfortunately  not for the coffee. If you are looking for a place to get some work done and eat a snack with some iced tea - I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"It's an interesting place with a diverse crowd. The first time I went and the latte was excellent. The next time, the lady at the counter was doing something on the computer and couldn't be bothered to greet me or make eye contact with me at any point. $3.00 for a mug of mediocre coffee was a disappointing follow-up. The music in there is stale."}
{"text":"Fair Trade Cafe is renowned in Phoenix as the premiere coffee shop in Downtown: a place to meet friends or make new ones, hear the eclectic but usually superior music choices of the friendly and colorful staff, and find an office-away-from-the-office. Fair Trade is definitely the favorite (non-Starbucks) choice of the young professional class when they need a \"mobile command center.\" 

Any given day, a forest of open laptops can be found in the open and spacious interior, along with any number of business meetings in progress, lefty groups holding discussions and people just kicking back and having some really good coffee.

The drawbacks are a result of the success of Fair Trade - during the lunch rush, tables are at a premium, even those out front or in the courtyard it shares with the Portland Apartments. 

However, the benefits more than make up for this occasional inconvenience. Among the staff, which in a constant state of flux but retains many excellent people on a regular basis, Meghan is at the top of the heap. She has never failed to impress me or my friends with her effervescent attitude and dedication to customer service. A smile and ever-handy kind word from her always help to make up for a down day. And when she and Christina, another Fair Trader with skill and know-how to spare, are teamed up, it is a dynamic duo to satisfy even the most demanding customer.

All in all, Fair Trade deserves its place as being synonymous with the Downtown Phoenix young professional scene, and I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone who wants a laugh, great brew and relaxing ambiance served up together."}
{"text":"Fantastic place! I've been here twice & loved it both times. Even though I am a soy cappuccino whore, I keep getting their hot apple cider.

It is fantastic & delicious. One day soon I must take the light rail down there with a few mini bottles, meet a friend, & have a coffee house bonanza!

First time I went I met one of the owners & she was really friendly & open. I don't get down here as often as I'd like to, but i definitely plan to visit more in the future."}
{"text":"I'm not going to lie. I used to come here from time to time to mooch off of their wi-fi when it was just too packed to study down the road at Lux. It bothers me that this place is called Fair Trade Cafe, mostly because when I think Fair Trade...I think great, organic coffee with lots of depth and integrity...here, however...the coffee might as well be water. The baristas a little under-trained (full disclosure, I had a few friends work here at some point, but I still hated the coffee) and their food is just \"OK.\" I remember enjoying their baked goods though-- their cookies and their stuffed croissants were top notch. However, if you're a real coffee fan, make your way over to Lux or Cartel instead."}
{"text":"For a major metropolitan city, It's disappointing how hard it is to find an independent coffee shop around Phoenix/Scottsdale that's open on Sundays.  Fortunately, Fair Trade Cafe IS open on Sundays, and I appreciate that very much!

More than \"just\" being open on Sundays, there's free covered parking behind the building, they offer free wi-fi, and they make delicious almond milk mochas!

The service isn't as outstanding as I've come to expect at other local coffee shops, but it's still a great spot to enjoy a cup of joe inside or outside on their patio."}
{"text":"I love Fair Trade. That about sums it up. However, if I wrote this review a year ago, which I did but never posted, I would have given them 5 stars. I still love them though. 

It is located a stone's throw away from where I live and I can often be found there. I actually haven't sampled the coffee, I don't drink the stuff, but my husband enjoys it. I do love the iced tea, hot chocolate, and hot teas. The sandwiches are great and the baked goods are amazing, save the bagels. (They are from Chompie's) I love the filled croissants. In recent months, their quiches had begun to get really salty and they took them off the menu and replaced them with frittatas, which look exactly like the quiches. I actually asked where the egg was when I ordered my first one. Their Sunday brunch is great (love the chili cheese egg puff or whatever its called and the sweet potatoes mixed in with the side of potatoes is great!) when I don't feel like going out to a sit down brunch and just want to run and get something quickly, they are the only place in this neighborhood that provides that on a Sunday morning...there are no bagel shops or anything. What I like most about Fair Trade is that if you are there to do work you can literally sit there all day and be able to have lunch, unlike at other coffee shops where the food sampling is limited to various baked goods. With the soups, salads, and sandwiches Fair Trade really functions more as a cafe. 

Service is always friendly; however, lately it hasn't been as on point as it once was. I wonder if they sent the more experience people to the new location and have all the newbies at this location. The rotating art is fun and a great resource for local artists to get their work out there. The new furniture they have put in is a little out of place and does make it feel overly cramped and hot at times though. 

They participate in First Fridays and host poetry slams and sushi nights. They let me sit on the patio with my dog and bring her water and dog treats. Free wifi, free garage parking...does it get better?"}
{"text":"Cute spot! Decent options for drinks! I didn't eat any food so I can't comment on that just got a latte-4$ for a small mug. Love the interior lots of cozy couches and tables.  Went at 1pm and it was pretty crowded was surprised by that. However people move often ( come in and out) so if you wait you'll snag a bigger spot(table)  if you need it!"}
{"text":"Great local owned, responsibly sourced coffee and ingredients. Tried a stuffed croissant with turkey and cheddar. Got to say it was a nice surprise. Another bonus is supporting a local business."}
{"text":"Great locality! Nice ambience! Great variety in menu. I tried their chai latte and cookie, enjoyed it. Worth trying!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I just moved downtown and THANK GOODNESS we found this spot. The vibe is great for 20somethings like us but there were plenty of 30somethings in there who seemed to be enjoying themselves too! The coffee is a great price and has been delicious every time I've ordered it. They have these stuffed croissants that are heavenly. Great ice cream too. 
I love that it's never too crowded.

The ONE thing I would say (which honestly isn't a problem for us because we're never in a hurry, but could be a problem if we were going to work or trying to catch the lightrail) is that it does move a little slow. There's usually only 1 or two people making drinks/serving/getting ice cream/whatever so it can sometimes take between 7-10 minutes to get your coffee. But if you're in no rush like me, it shouldn't bother you :)

I highly recommend this place if you're meeting someone for coffee, studying alone, studying in a group... anything really! Thanks Fair Trade :)"}
{"text":"Wow! I am a faithful, 2 shots over ice, gal. It's pretty consistent everywhere. Some roasts are better than others of course. Fair Trade started my day in a great note with a smooth roast and a generous dose over ice. I was appreciative of the cup and moved to buy breakfast for a stranger in the spirit of paying generosity forward. Thank you Fair Trade Café! The cafe is comfy, welcoming and so convenient for walkers, light rail riders and even drivers. My croissant was delectable and made to order. Go, get a satisfying cup and feel good at Fair Trade."}
{"text":"Wonderful place to study or work, great prices, great coffee and food, comfortable chairs, and very friendly staff!"}
{"text":"I REALLY want to like this place, which is why I came back on a Sunday. The barista was nice and friendly, that isn't so much the problem. Here are the problems.

1. They have been playing the same terrible song for two hours. No joke. I'm not sure if this is a psych experiment or a cruel joke, but either way- holy @!$%.

2. I must have missed the sign saying, \"Burn-outs\" welcome & preferred. This is the oddest group of people ever. During the course of my visit, some random guy tried to \"save\" a really nice man who happens to be blind. Along with that, the man kept yelling to the counter, \"Did ya'll forget me?\" Answer- yes. He ordered breakfast and bacon 40 minutes earlier. Yikes.

So, I cannot recommend this spot unless you like torture, or you are a psych major and need to study some weirdos. Bring your DSM -IV and have a great time."}
{"text":"Best place to do work that will change the world while drinking fair trade coffee, from their hands to your heart!"}
{"text":"Great place, great service, great coffee, great view and something a lot of coffee shops have forgotten... The lost are of comfortable seating! My only qualm is that... $4 for an iced coffee? Not some frappe-mocha-latte-domo-arigatou, but just a basic iced coffee... It's good, but I think just the basic iced coffee could be slightly cheaper."}
{"text":"Coffee shop-perfection.  Friendly staff, great coffee, free wifi, great location (ten steps from a light rail stop), wonderful ambience, and delicious food.  They got everything right with this place; I laid out my criteria for what makes a great coffee shop in my review of Mills End Cafe, and Fair Trade achieves all of those standards, and more."}
{"text":"This place is pretty trendy and hip. Lots of people lounging and reading or working on homework. I can't speak for the food, as I haven't eaten here, but their drinks are pretty tasty. I sat down with a vanilla and almond Italian soda. It wasn't as flavorful as I would have liked, but it was yummy.

I'd defiantly come back here. I am in love with trendy places like this. Next time I will get some food!"}
{"text":"This is a solid coffee place, quiet enough for reading friendly enough for having  a meeting or just being by your self. Prices are good, parking can be a bit tricky during busier times. Not the best coffee I've had, but its still very good and worth a visit."}
{"text":"The coffee is generally too hit-or-miss to draw me in, especially with Lola so close by. Both iced and hot beverages usually end up tasting watered down. Where Fair Trade excels is with their teas, snacks, and smoothies. It's also a dream for those who enjoy working from coffee shops. They kick Lola's ass in terms of table space, noise level, available outlets, and small affordable things to nibble on.

They also offer some pretty good Belly deals!"}
{"text":"I love the ambiance of this cafe! Fair-trade and earth-conscious in the middle of downtown Phoenix. I met with my friend here for a Iced Soy Mocha and a house salad - both were great. The house salad has a lot of dark, leafy greens - which is way better than the iceberg and croutons that you get at other places. And the soy mocha was very yummy and not too sweet. I added some clear syrup that they have on the table to get it to my liking. Overall, a great, solid cafe to try if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Super cute coffee shop. I like it because it's calm, not so crowded and very conveniently located by the light rail."}
{"text":"So,  fair trade is on the corner of Central and Roosevelt.   I friend of mine interested this place to me and now I'm hooked on their coffee.  It is hard going to other coffee shops and having the coffee when fair trade is the best.    

They can get busy on the weekends,  but it is well worth the wait.   the coffee is fresh every time I have it. I could either be there in the morning or late at night and it is always fresh and good.  

Another note is that I have never drank coffee black until I came to Fair Trade.  Now that just tells you that the coffee is good.  If I can drink it black.  :)  


Well,  if you are in downtown on a first Friday or just in the area you should come by fair trade and check it out."}
{"text":"After visiting the Phx Art Museum, my friend and I were thrilled to find this little cafe with outdoor seating as we were strolling down Central enjoying the nice weather. The prices are reasonable, and they offer many discounts including 10% off for teachers. The cheesy potato soup was wonderful! I also really enjoyed the chicken curry sandwich, while my friend raved about his huge slice of quiche. And as others have mentioned, the staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"I enjoy coming to this place EXCEPT for the drinks. The drinks are disappointing every time I come in. Sad. 

The first time I came here was for the poetry which btw was AWESOME! They have some really great poets coming through here. 

Alright back to my review. On a hot July day the AC is really nice in here. But the place is filled with a bunch of weirdos on their laptops, not including me. It begins to remind me of Starbucks with all of the client business type meetings happening at every other table. Annoying! I like the setting but that is about it. One star for that!

And one star for amazing WiFi which I can steal from my car in the garage. Sweet! Thanks Fair Trade for being useful at least once.

Happy Coffee drinking y'all. This poor college kid should have gone to Dutch Bros. As always."}
{"text":"This is my first review and this place is pretty cool. They have nice music selection with a mix of known and upcoming artists. The coffee was great, shame me if you want for never having a cafe au lait but this one did not disappoint. The art on the walls add a nice touch, they also have adequate space to study or work on those novels every always seems to be writing at coffee shops. Overall great place and it has cash back on the Yelp offer or DOSH."}
{"text":"Part of me doesn't even want to tell people about this place because of what a hidden treasure it is! 

The place is stunningly beautiful. It's like the set of a TV show where hip teenagers hang out. And honestly, I could just sit in here doing nothing but listening to the amazing music. The vibe here is perfect. 

The service: fantastic. 

Outlets are everywhere so it's a great place to work. There is the perfect blend of work areas but also places to hang out with your friends and just chat if you wanted. 

And of course the coffee is without fault. This place is my new favorite"}
{"text":"Can't believe its taken me this long to write a review for Fair Trade! The team here is the BEST; super friendly and make some great recommendations! They take pride in knowing their regulars (and their orders)! 

The food is also very reasonably priced (and delicious). 

Protip: Try their 'Purple Haze\" Smoothie w/ peanut butter!"}
{"text":"I'm not a big coffee drinker myself - lately I have just been getting iced tea. But a little secret about this place - their gluten free chocolate chip & peanut butter cookies are TO DIE FOR. I seriously crave these little babies all the time. They are so moist, dense and sweet. They taste like cookie dough but they are entirely gluten free! I love that this place is hip and in the middle of the first friday happenings. I can walk here from my apartment, which is an added plus.
Only knocking off a star because the seating options are sometimes underwhelming. Definitely more seating than Lola down the street, but sometimes the space is inefficiently used with one person per table. There is always outside seating (but it's so darn hot!)"}
{"text":"I have never been a coffee drinker until I stepped into Fair Trade Cafe. Owner, Stephanie Vasquez, made me feel special by making me a cup of coffee and since then Fair Trade is the ONLY place I will drink coffee. Not only is it absolutely delicious, but you cannot duplicate the warmth and ambience provided by the staff members and Stephanie Vasquez. It is truly a community center that serves amazing coffee. Best coffee place in Phoenix!!"}
{"text":"Very convenient. Easy to find. Lots of fun hangin out here. Friendly people. And helpful."}
{"text":"Of all the little coffee places in this area, this one is my favorite.  The atmosphere, lighting, and music are very cool.  The coffee is not bad, but it's not something to drive miles out of your way for, or anything - just a decent cup of joe.  The prices are a tad on the high side, but this is a convenient stop for me, and a very chill place to sit and sip with a friend."}
{"text":"Excellent coffee, food is the right price for what you get, and the staff are always friendly and know what they're doing. Service is quick and you can stay a while in their chill environment and work or chat, or you can take your stuff to go, no judgement or questions asked. LOVE IT!"}
{"text":"I went here one too many times. In my opinion, the prices were much higher than the quality!"}
{"text":"Truth be told, I have a history here.  Well, sort of.  I've known Michelle the original founder of Fair Trade for a long time.  Michelle planted this coffee shop in this hidden corner of Downtown Phoenix long before Roosevelt Row had fully re-emerged from its dark troubled times.  It was no guarantee that Fair Trade was going to make it back then, but the formula and the sustainable cause she championed won over the neighborhood.  Back then Fair Trade was something of a survivor.  Today, Fair Trade is a neighborhood staple with the original location here and another location next to ASU's Downtown campus.  

As per my previous reviews I am most definitely not a coffee drinker, but I'll happily frequent a coffee shop if they offer decent food and a good place to hangout.  On these fronts, Fair Trade will certainly satisfy.  I've had several of their breakfast and lunch sandwiches (the Turkey being my personal favorite) and I've also stopped in often for something simple like a bagel or a yogurt parfait.  But perhaps the most underrated thing here is the ice cream.  Fair Trade doesn't really advertise it and you could easily pass by the ice cream case without noticing. But from my experience, its worth your taste buds.  Their flavors rotate regularly so what you see this visit could be different the next.  

Tonight I was on something of a dessert prowl for First Friday in Downtown and Fair Trade just happens to be near my apartment.  Sooo, yeah.  A little ice cream starter here seemed like a good idea.  And it was.  Tonight I went with a couple of scoops of their cookies and cream.  Super cheap at just $3.  Really delish.  Pretty sure the butterfat ratio on this version is high enough that I shouldn't take a liking to it too often, but a really great rendition nevertheless.  A perfect way to start the evening (after an earlier dinner of course, but I digress).

The vibe at Fair Trade is as laid back as its always been.  With art dotting the walls and comfortable spots to sit both inside, out front, and even in the courtyard out back.  Fair Trade has always been popular with the local artists and in recent years has become a popular study hangout for the downtown college crowd.  Some because they love the coffee, some because of its arc towards sustainability, and for some its just comfortable.  And perhaps that's the best tribute to Michelle's efforts here.  Its just comfortable here.  Relaxed, unpretentious, and welcoming.  Good work Michelle, good work."}
{"text":"My review is not so much about Fair Trade, but more about the community dinner held at the downtown location on Sunday nights. 

I'd had delicious coffee and wonderful service at the Roosevelt location, but  didn't even know about the other one, despite living down the street. One Sunday night I just wanted to get out of my apartment and I started walking. My wanderings eventually led me to Civic Space Park, where I'd watched Christmas movies and people before. I smelled something wonderful, saw the sign for Fair Trade and took the steps down to the entrance.  When I walked through the door, I was greeted by a woman (Ingrid) that informed me that the cafe was closed but that they were just about ready to have community dinner. Seriously, I just started crying. I was feeling very alone downtown since all of my friends and family live in the suburbs, and finding this wonderful thing was incredible. 

Ingrid and her husband Daniel put out a great spread every Sunday around 6-6:30. The food is all vegan/vegetarian and delicious. You pay if you can but if you can't, you're still welcome to enjoy dinner. Daniel and Ingrid seem to attract forward-thinking artistic types so the conversation is always stimulating and wonderful. I generally try to stay and clean up afterward, especially if it happens to be a night when I've thrown less than a good amount of money into the pot. Even this is enjoyable because the sense of community is there. 

I cannot recommend this highly enough, especially if you happen to be a displaced former suburbanite that is looking for a great downtown community!"}
{"text":"Good coffee and they always take care of what i need in a timely manner. Never mind the fact it is literally 20 yards from my front door, but that may play into my liking of the establishment.  Either way you should check it out and enjoy some free Wifi."}
{"text":"This place has the best iced coffee in town, hands down.  My co-workers and I go multiple times during the week just to buy a cup.  It is not convenient for us but is worth the trek.  The staff is friendly and the iced coffee is consistent. It keeps us going.  The chai is made from a sugary mix - avoid it."}
{"text":"Loved this little place! I had a croissant sandwich, it may have been the best one I've ever had! I work around the corner and will be back to try their lunch and their smoothies! There were a lot of people there working and studying, seemed like a great place to get some work done!! Right across from the light rail! I loved the back patio as well, you wouldn't even know you were downtown back there! Super cute!"}
{"text":"Finally, a real, honest to goodness Seattle style coffee house in Phoenix without the rain -- and, you drink \"fair trade\" coffee!"}
{"text":"This place is so cute, easy to get to the environment is great for all ages! Breakfast burritos are amazing and the organic potatoes oh my goodness there broccoli cream to super super good as well my mother and I came in and shared all of those! Music is great calm I will definite come back and bring other people!!"}
{"text":"Great coffee, great service. friendly staff, very cozy, free internet! Good place to hold meetings."}
{"text":"We stopped in yesterday after not being in for 10+ years to check-out the ice cream offerings.  I ordered a scoop of pina colada ice cream and loved it...so delicious!  I can't wait to come back and try one of their Italian sodas and other tasty treats they offer."}
{"text":"How can you not love a place that offers $.75 refills on tea bought at the Fair Trade in the civic space downtown? These two places are great places for treats, tea and friendly service. I rode my bike from the AZFCU to the civic space, grabbed and Ice tea and some gum samples, then biked through ASU to Think. By the time I arrived at the Roosevelt/Central train station i was so parched i went to this Fair Trade, asked them if i could get a refill instead of wasting a cup, thinking i would pay for an entirely new Iced Tea, when she only charged me $.75. that was awesome!!! finally a place that is, well, Fair! they didn't have my favorite Banana Nut cookies, but that's okay i'll forgive them lol. 

however if you ever see the banana nut cookies available, get them fast! they are the most tasty & moist little bites of heaven you will ever eat! this place also offers tons of vegan items. 

they offer free wi-fi, have inside and outside seating both in front of the shop and in the courtyard right behind it too. ride a bike? you'll find 2 bike racks in front and back as well. you will also find handcrafted items to purchase from around the world, including music-which can be sampled on the sampler close to the courtyard. i can't get enough of their green tea, but the others are deolilcious too and at only $2.25, with a $.75 refill you can't go wrong. so next time you take the train into downtown, stop at the roosevelt/central station and get yourself some Fair Trade on!"}
{"text":"Cute little place downtown, very good for a break, brunch, sunday breakfast. Food is decent and the atmosphere is not too crazy. Bring a laptop for the free WiFi and you're ready to go.

Have fun, be safe and good luck."}
{"text":"I spend close to $150 here a month with all the coffees, pastries, and breakfasts I get for my boyfriend and me every morning. The ONLY thing that kept me coming back was the taste of their drinks.

It always takes at least 15 minutes to get a drink if I order anything for more than myself. Today was especially worse because I had noticed that they had served someone their coffee before mine, who's order was taken after my drinks we being started. This wouldn't have bothered me if they hadn't messed up my drinks. I order smalls every time because I like the flavor. And one particular employee there always gives me a larger size. I don't always notice because I have nothing to compare until I have my coffee in hand.

Aside from that this place is also inconsistent. Sometimes I can get my drink made a certain way and other times I can't. This place is also extremely slow, which may be because they are understaffed- I don't know. They could use some help being more efficient with the people who do work there though. 

Sadly this place has lost me as a regular."}
{"text":"The food and beverages here are as good as the cause that this place stands for. I was really surprised to see how this place actually was because I was expecting some sort of folk jam band/Vagina Monologues reading spot where hackey sack tournaments were held. Even though I consider myself liberally-minded, I take joy in ravaging a rare steak in front of a dirty hippie. I hate hippies. However, the people that run this place are hippies and I use that term in the best possible way. They're not all talk, they're actually practicing what they preach by running a cafe like this and I respect them for it and fully support it. It's like they're the American Apparel of Phoenix coffee shops that was American Apparel before they started using sweat shops.

This place gets A's all across the board for service, food, drinks, and for the relaxing environment that you get to experience it all in."}
{"text":"Fabulous! We are staying at FoundRE hotel and this is super close and convenient. Was quiet on a Saturday morning. Light breakfast food was very affordable! And the stuffed croissants... wow! I had the turkey cheddar and it was AMAZING!"}
{"text":"good coffee, friendly staff, good food.  they forgot to bring out the bagel I had ordered, but were very apologetic about it.  I will go here again."}
{"text":"What's one more 5-star review? Well, I want to add Fair Trade to the My Neighborhood list. It's only FAIR! 
HA!
I'm not addicted to coffee like sooome people, but I probably come here 4/7 days a week. Especially when it is so darn nice out and I can just stroll out my door and down Portland, cross the train tracks, ignoring the never-changing Don't Walk signs, and over to the angular little coffee shop downtowners know and love.

Not unlike so many of my reviews, I love this place for its proximity and my personal convenience! But that's not all! I love their brews, their coffee-sprucing counter of assorted sweeteners like agave nectar, the spinach and feta pastry thingies, the art, and the coffee shop version of Cheers-esque vibe. Like a morning migration of everyone from Bikini Lounge I saw the night before. 

The workers are usually nice and there's usually somewhere for me to plug in and pretend to do homework. Don't forget the student discount! Hey and they give a shit about other people in the world! Fantastic."}
{"text":"Great spot! Really good coffee and a cool eclectic vibe. I went to get work done and found a comfortable spot with an outlet. The volume level can get a little loud, but not to the point that it interfered with my work (except when I was on a call, in which case I went outside to their great patio area). I plan to go back!"}
{"text":"Cute, hipster place. In a nice area downtown, right across the street from my job. Pricey for the coffee sizes."}
{"text":"I've got to say, some of the best iced coffee around! I've never been a fan of hot coffee, but I loved iced coffee! The coffee here doesn't have that acidic after taste, and its so smooth! I asked the owner when she was at an event a while back and apparently they cold brew their coffee. Wow does it make a difference! 

And of course, its fair trade coffee, so it tastes better and there's no guilt drinking it. A win-win for everyone! 

Prices are fair, ambiance is laid back, and wifi worked great. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"We were hungry, it was late and no other reasonably priced place was open. We walked in here and were glad we did. The cafe itself is a pleasant spot with lots of seating. The girl at the counter was a sweetheart - she was extremely accommodating and helpful.

The food - I had a tomato basil soup and my sister had a salad and the black bean soup. All were very tasty and I highly recommend everything.

The prices were reasonable. I highly recommend this spot!"}
{"text":"I go here when I'm downtown to cool off with a cold-brewed iced coffee. The decor is comfortable and the seating options have something for everyone--plush couches and armchairs, smaller booths, a window bar, and desks for working and studying. The prices are on-par with your typical coffee chain...maybe just a touch more expensive. 

My only qualm is that the straws are next to the register, but they deliver your drink to the end of the counter, which is where the lids are located. I always forget to grab a straw when I pay for my coffee and have to squeeze around customers in line to snag one. It just doesn't seem logical. Yeah, it's a very small thing, but drives me nuts!"}
{"text":"3.25 stars.

Adequate coffee and drinks near my house and right across from the Central/Roosevelt light rail stop.  I'm working my way through the menu, and even though the psychoslow service is somewhat unreal, I'm never here when I'm in a hurry.

Are the frittatas gone?  The downtown location has supplied some lovely frittata dates in the Civic Space by the Goofy LED Boners for me, but I can't ever seem to get a luscious pair of frittatas shaken in my face at this location anymore.

The chai is very inconsistent from day to day, but I still walk here and have one a day some weeks.  The smoothies taste like they're made with sugary purees; I'd still rock one on the rare days when I don't give a rat's damn about high sugar consumption.  I like the frequent drinker card and the adorable filing system at the register.

Must try their biscuits and gravy.  Breakfast is nextest."}
{"text":"Sweet mother of coffe, I've found a home.

This place is great, as numerous others have said. The Wi-Fi is reliable but parking for both bike and car can be a hassle. 

It's often difficult to find somewhere to sit and relax or sit and study. Which is even more frustrating. Obviously, that's great for them as it means their business is good but darn it, I want to sit my exhausted ass down!

I settle in at a table outside, which wobbles. Sigh.

I have never eaten anything here so I cannot comment on the quality or anything, but I do want to give props to the banana smoothie - a must!

They offer punch cards as well as discounts too. Once a $5 smoothie is now $4.50. Sweet. 

Oh, and go on Mondays... it's \"double punch\" days! Those things add up fast and I generally save my smoothie for those days!"}
{"text":"Today I was feeling very sleepy so I sent a note to a colleague and asked if she wanted to go for coffee and she suggested FTC.  We got there and ordered our coffee and I decided to order a sandwich for my lunch later that day also.  While waiting for the coffee, the owner I can only assume stopped to talk to us. Under the cart she was pushing was a small child who reached up and essentially goosed my butt.  Not quite that far up but it was enough that I was so startled that it caused me to knock over my friend's coffee because I was just trying to stay away from this kid who more than likely would have done it again. I don't know if he thought I was his mom standing next to the cart or what, but it seriously spooked me. You just don't expect to be grabbed standing waiting for a sandwich.  

Now I could forget all that if the sandwich were worth a damn, but it wasn't.  The bread was horribly dry, and dense. Someone mentioned earlier that there are no condiments, and they weren't kidding.  This sandwich was as dry as the Mohave desert.  I'd go back for coffee if it was the last place to go, but honestly for a better cup of coffee and a bite to take back to the office, Carly's or Hob Nobs is always a better option."}
{"text":"In a zoo of coffee shops, comfy oasis for drinks and treats convenient to my office.  Currently enjoying my caramel iced latte and look forward to trying more things on their menu."}
{"text":"Sunday breakfasts are nostalgia and happiness all wrapped into one. This place has it.

I went here this morning to treat myself to a breakfast and a coffee. I had the French press, and even though it was just a regular old coffee, it was incredible. By regular I mean non-latte or anything like that. It was honestly what heaven tastes like, one of the absolute BEST coffees I've had in phoenix since moving here, possibly the best.

For breakfast I ordered the biscuits and gravy and being greedy and hungry went for the full instead of the half. I think I would have been satiated with the half though, it is rather filling.

It did take a whole to come out but I was able to sit by the adorable fountain in the lovely courtyard and I barely even noticed the time lapse. 

The biscuits and gravy were awesome! Just enough sauce so it wasn't making the biscuits too soggy but they were still smothered. They sprinkle cinnamon on top and that enhances the flavor.

The staff was friendly and the wifi was free, the ambiance was slightly hipster but very relaxing and just like a coffee shop for everyone. I will be coming back here again for sure and I think before I leave I will get another coffee to go!"}
{"text":"I love any local business that supports local farmers by offering homemade food. I had a sandwich and a treat and both were very good. There is free WiFi and a relaxed atmosphere."}
{"text":"Had coffee yesterday and all in all, not bad at all. I wasn't too into the environment of the coffee house, felt kind of like an episode of Friends. Not a bad thing, but I never liked Friends.
The roast was pretty darn good. Its not perfect, but it was definitely NOT bad and quite frankly, Rome wasn't built in a day. Will be floating by more often :)"}
{"text":"I know I just wrote a review for this place, but I just discovered even more to love about it.  I had known about their  quiches and pastries and went to go get some with an iced coffee on Sunday morning.  What do you know, they offer a real breakfast as well on Sundays from 8-12!  

I forget the name of the dish I had, but it was sort of like a frittata with sour cream and fresh salsa.  It was awesome.  And it was only like $5 and came with rosemary potatoes.  Mmmm.

I brought my dog with me and they were super cool about it.  They brought the food out to me in the courtyard and even brought a milk bone and bowl of water for the dog."}
{"text":"Love this place.  There is a group of us that go and play games every Friday evening.  The staff is AWESOME and friendly willing to go up and beyond.  I am NOT a coffee drinker and they have drinks that I love to drink.  Have not had much of their food items but they also look delicious."}
{"text":"Nice spot.... out of the ordinary.

Fair Trade Cafe has a laid back vibe and the food and coffee are pretty good. Fair Trade Cafe  is small but they have a shaded patio in the back, with a fountain, it is a really nice area to sit down and just relax.

The Fair Trade Café has a rather strange menu that would certainly lean towards the healthy, vegan crowd.  However, I was able to find a ham and cheese sandwich and latte, that were tasty and the bajed goods are definitely worth trying.

The servers are nice, however, service can be  slow at times. If you're ever in the area you should give it a try you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"A quaint cafe along the way of the lightrail & Hance Park, amidst all other shops & eateries in the Central & Roosevelt area of Downtown Phoenix. Beautiful, quiet ambience both inside & outside the cafe. A great place to unwind after shopping & events at the park. 

Great menu selection & the service here ands amazing! I highly recommend stopping in here if you need a drink or want a good meal."}
{"text":"this place has great coffee. the food looked delicious, sadly i didn't get to have any. very relaxed and open pretty late for the most part, its just calming and happy in there. definitely great for a first date or just to unwind. love their iced coffee with soy. had a nutty flavor to it, so delicious"}
{"text":"I love this place! I recently went back to this coffee shop, and it's definitely changed since the last time I've been (which was about a year ago). I love that they put a Latin feel to the place. Being Hispanic, finding places where I feel safe and comfortable is important, and this cafe does it for me. From the music, to the artwork, to the food... The atmosphere is awesome!"}
{"text":"I was really excited about this place, having just moved into the neighborhood. Because I work from home, I am always looking for alternative locations to set up and work for a bit. I went in tonight to get caught up on other tasks before the work week. At first I sat near the window but the kitchen was blasting one song with loud bass while the main room was playing another. I moved to the back of the cafe but it was almost worse. I asked the woman at the counter if there was anything she could do because it was making it really difficult to concentrate. She listened to me and walked away. I thought she was going to help solve the issue but... nope. Nothing changed. I guess I won't be returning. I thought the tea and food was good but not good enough to make up for this."}
{"text":"This cafe is really nice and artsy. The decor is welcoming along with the chalkboard menu which is a nice touch. I'm a fan of the smoothies and hot cocoa here. The service is good but can tend to get crowded on some days."}
{"text":"Tasty espresso, very friendly & welcoming staff, good atmosphere. Prices are competitive. Will definitely go back!!"}
{"text":"Fair Trade is a cafe right off of Central and Roosevelt in downtown Phoenix. It purports to be a supporter of \"sustainable living through economic growth.\" By being \"Fair Trade Certified\", this venue agrees to the following principles taken from the Transfair USA website:

* Fair price: Democratically organized farmer groups receive a guaranteed minimum floor price and an additional premium for certified organic products. 

* Fair labor conditions: Workers on Fair Trade farms enjoy freedom of association, safe working conditions, and living wages. Forced child labor is strictly prohibited. 

* Direct trade: With Fair Trade, importers purchase from Fair Trade producer groups as directly as possible, eliminating unnecessary middlemen... 

I guess that's cool. 

I'm writing this seated at one of its tables, supposedly to get some work done (free wifi). It's got a nice, direct view of our downtown skyline. Light guitar music in the background. Light lunch fare is available, and I just finished a very sloppy, but good, egg salad sandwhich. The crowd here actually seems somewhat ASU-ish. In fact some guy came up to me when I first sat down and asked me to take a sociological survey as part of some ASU study (he was here with the cafe's permission). 

It is a bit hard to find with the light rail construction chaos. But there is a very nice private and free parking garage directly adjacent to it. Find that, and you're golden.

The hours are decent. Open on this Sunday from 7 am to 7 pm. I still wish more of these Phoenix area cafes would get with the program and give late night owls like me somewhere to go after 10. If Tucson can do it, folks, so can you."}
{"text":"I had a brief stint in between meetings today and my caffeine withdrawals were kicking in. I wanted a coffee shop where I could get some work done, get a swift kick of energy and do so in a comfortable and local environment. I found that at Fair Trade. 

Ever since attending DPJ's Radiate Phoenix Event where local coffee shop owners spoke about their brands, I've been eager to check out Fair Trade and today was the perfect excuse to do so. I walked inside and was immediately welcomed by the smell of freshly roasted coffee and the therapeutic sound of coffee shop chit chat and the grinder humming to the beat of a fresh cup 'o Joe. The girl at the counter was friendly, attentive and definitely knew her coffees. I was tempted to try the mocha chocolate latte on special, but the barista convinced me that the iced coffee with sugar free chocolate and nonfat milk was the way to go. I know not to question the expert so I went for it. Note to self... my intuition was correct. I will always take the baristas advice from now on. The iced coffee was refreshing, full of a much-needed caffeine kick and just what the energy bunny ordered. 

I really like the character and environment at Fair Trade. The shop was packed with coffee drinkers, business folks and even friendly neighborhood policemen. I am pretty sure I saw a Pastor making his way through as well. With the dynamic group of visitors, the music was comforting but not distracting. I saw plenty of outdoor seating options but sadly, the 110 degree weather kept me from enjoying a fresh breeze today.

So in summary, I give Fair Trade two thumbs up (aka four stars) for the quality and comfort they provide to the coffee addict. I noticed some tasty food options as well and I plan on making my way back again very soon to check them all out! So thanks Fair Trade, for getting me rejuvenated while allowing me to do some work done during the busy workday!"}
{"text":"So I was just at Fair Trade downtown. And I have been in there more times than I can even count on all of my body parts and a girl walks up to me and says \"Can I help you?\" I say \"No I'm ok.\" She Says \"Have you bought anything in here today?\" I say \"No.\" She then tells me \" Well you can't just sit in for hours (I had been in there about 2) and not buy anything.\" \"Don't you know this is not a community center.\" 

So Fair Trade is the new Community Center for all of phoenix. They will be holding Comunnity meetings every night.

{"text":"This is a cute coffee shop to have nearby. In the 3 times I've been here, seating has never been a problem, which is nice. The barristas have been fairly nice as well. On Sundays they have a brunch like menu, with eggs, bacon, biscuits and gravy, potatoes, etc. Nom nom.  

I take issue with the fact that they don't brew their own iced tea. That may seem trivial, but they are a cafe, and so I think it's a cop out. The music is generally good, it's usually too loud to get work done. I would explore more of the options in the area, since there seems to be a lot."}
{"text":"This is the first coffee spot I visited when I moved here from Portland, OR. It really reminded me of home. Nice and homey. The product is fresh and tasty. The drinks are not to sweet and the smoothies are delicious. 
For sure a place to relax and sip some tea."}
{"text":"You can't get any better than Fair Trade in my book. And here's why:

I work for a grassroots non profit organization. This will be important later in the story. 

I first discovered Fair Trade through one of the owners, who also happens to volunteer for the organization I work for. (Remember I said my job would be important to the story?) I came in a few times and was continually impressed with the friendly staff, great coffee, and overall great atmosphere. 

Because of my job (and lack of office space) I have a LOT of coffee meetings. Sometimes it's all I ever do. And FTC is a great location, and it's way cooler than Starbucks. So my coworkers and I definitely give them a ton of business with our meetings! 

The Sunday brunch is awesome, everyone must try the egg puff and the potatoes, they are to die for. It's a great way to spend a Sunday morning!

The free WiFi is also awesome when I need a Central location to work. Sometimes I refer to it as my office. 

Lastly, Fair Trade donated coffee to the annual fundraising event that our organization holds annually. It's just a wonderful testament to how community oriented the staff and owners are, and how great Fair Trade is for downtown Phoenix!"}
{"text":"I'd been hearing about Fair Trade for a while but for some reason, I didn't try it until just the other day... 

Love it!

I found the staff friendly - especially Shane, who flirted with me and talked my ear off about all of the upcoming events; parking was a breeze in the adjacent lot; and although the place was packed, my friend and I scored a table outside... (good thing it wasn't crazy hot out just yet).

I'll be back soon to try more than the iced tea that I had the other day... the pastries looked awesome and I need to go explore everything else that Fair Trade has to offer.  I see a future Yelp Office Hours happening at Fair Trade for sure!  Let me know if you'd be up for that?!"}
{"text":"Love what this place stands for. There's plenty of comfortable seating. I'm here on a Saturday late afternoon so it isn't that crowded. Lots of wooden tables that can fit 6 people a table and there are 3 seaters and 2 seater tables as well or tables you can share with other people at the coffee shop. Just want comfortable seats to chill and sit with chairs side by side if you just want to come and chit chat with a friend or take a date here. 

I ordered a decaf vanilla latte with coconut milk. It's my off coffee day, but I wanted to check out this place and get out a bit. They have other milk alternatives like almond milk, soy milk. 

It's located in downtown and there are free 2 hour street parking spots. Nature calls? No problem, they have huge metal spoons to the far left of the register counter for the unisex restrooms #1 & 2. A little embarrassing to carry and not sure if I like the idea of touching it after getting out of  (Like how many people don't wash their hands after leaving holding those keys). They currently have condiment squeeze bottle that contains soap next to the sink. Not sure if it's good soap like natural, cruelty free, or organic essential oils, it would be nice if they switched it out with a nice soap dispenser or one with a label telling you what's in it to go with their brand experience.

There is music playing above and it's at a good volume so you don't have to yell. While I was here, they played some old classics. Very Coast. 

If you are sitting near the window you'll see benches for public transportation and there's an outlet extension with six slots for your laptop or other devices. There's also an outlet extension towards the back wall to the left of the window seating area. You just have to bring your own charger."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE. 
I first came here to study with my friends and didn't really know much about coffee, but the barista was so nice and answered the questions I had patiently, even reccomending? the mocha. It was so delicious! 
Second to I came was first Friday and the two boys there were so funny and friendly I left smiling with an amazing tasting soy vanilla latte.
The vibe is hipster but a little classic too cause I could totally imagine myself as a middle aged getting coffee there reading a newspaper. If I live near this place, I'd go there all the time."}
{"text":"I never really rate coffee houses based on their bean juice, rather convenience, proximity, and ambiance.  For me, Fair Trade rates highly in all three of those categories.  

Convenience:  Its centralized but more accessible by foot, which is the penultimate mark of a legitimate urban coffee joint, second only to the taste of their drip coffee.  Walking to your favorite coffee house is one of the great simple pleasures of life.  While this isn't my favorite coffee shop, its a suitable filler when drives to Copper Star or Paisley aren't in the cards.

Proximity:  The downtown Roosevelt Row area, which is crawling with people who enjoy $5 cups of coffee and like to support a cause 'they hear' is pretty good.  

Ambiance:  Much like other businesses along the Deck Central Area, Fair Trade struggles with Airport Lobby Pandemic.  They have, however, 'warmed' it up with corral walls, typical coffeehouse art, propaganda fliers, the token 'Monkey Che' t-shirt urbanite, and the sans-shower barista.  It feels like a nice place to stay a little longer.  The rear patio is nice and shaded, but if the bright ass reflection of concrete doesn't bother you, then I recommend the bustle of the front patio, as it provides the illusion of a brisk metropolis at the gateway to downtown PHX."}
{"text":"Love this coffee shop-- love everything about them! Anything on the menu is a hit. 

My go to is a latte or Italian soda. I also like to order breakfast items here. They are great!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for the second time yesterday on my way back home from evening errands - got a sandwich to share with my wife. Place was packed with people from 3 - 70 years old, originally- and trans-gendered, all shades of pink and brown, spread over every table inside and in both front and back patios, the three staff and proprietrix all running flat out, having a chance to catch up with a few visual and literary art friends while waiting.. There were two moms sitting across from me trying to shepherd 3 teensy ninas bursting with curiosity and energy who had me exploding in belly laughs by the time my takeout was ready - climbing up and over the couch, scrambling over the cookies on the plate, playing hide and seek with each other behind the legs of customers waiting to order, running in too many directions for the moms to follow, so one burst behind the counter as a staff member was finishing prepping her baby bottle. I suddenly realized I've been coming to this neighborhood social center across 3 decades now and never reviewed it before ... I love living where I do"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times, since I live in the apartments within a block's walking distance.  The food and beverages offered are some great choices, including delicious vegan brownies and a tasty veggie sandwich.  The tea was good as well. I have not tried the coffee.  The prices were about average for a place such as this. 

The free Wi Fi is nice, and I love how close it is to where I live. Supposedly there are small discounts if you live at the Roosevelt Square Apartments and/or ASU student, but I've mentioned that each time and have not received discounts. 

The seating can be variable, depending on the day/time that you go. I have found seating sometimes, but other times was at a wobbly table and ended up leaving (it was the only one available).  In the later afternoon/evenings, it can get a bit more crowded and harder to find seats."}
{"text":"This place has delicious food and great coffee! The atmosphere is serene and friendly. A perfect place to kill a few minutes before work!  I look forward to stopping in!"}
{"text":"I'm not really fan of the Fair Trade system. I want to like it since it's a market approach, but from an economics perspective, it actually harms growers.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_trade#Criticism

That said, I think coffee picked by child slave labor tastes best. The salt from their tears imparts that certain... je ne sais quios.

Not a bad coffee place. The baristas are cool. especially Geraldine who is also dangerous with a hula hoop, so better hope she is baristaing and not hula hooping, or you gonna git straight hooped, sucka. The coffee is tasty, they usually have a decent selection of tea, and their baked goods are fresh.  There is plenty of parking in the attached covered lot, and there's outdoor seating in both the front and back. The indoor seating is ample and comfortable. The tables and bathrooms are clean. It's downtown, and it's not Starbucks - IE the coffee is good and not burnt.

I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"Fair Trade is a solid coffee joint.  The WIFI is consistently good, they have a plethora of drink options to choose from and the staff is friendly.  

I'm not a coffee drinker, but the mango smoothie is amazing and they are happy to make me a raspberry french soda when I ask.

I've had the chicken curry sandwich, as well as the hummus vegetable sandwich.  They are both solid choices, and are $6.50 a pop.  You can choose between a half or a whole, but the half is only $4.50 so it is wise to just get the whole and save it for later if your tummy is full after a half of a sandwich.

The people that work here are genuinely nice.  They smile, and try to get you what you need in an efficient manner.  They make you feel good about coming here.  

Extra good touches:  
There is a computer that they allow patrons to use.
They have covered free parking available for their patrons.
It is in front of the Central/Roosevelt light rail station.

The only reason that it is a four star joint for me is because the set up is a bit odd.  I have to plug in my laptop as the battery is shot and sometimes it is a tad difficult to get to a plug.  That is truly my only complaint, but Fair Trade is pretty solid in my book."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying their coffee is STRONG which is totally great if your looking for something to wake you up instantly. It's a great spot to take groups in. When I went in it seemed that there were many groups there working on different projects and it was so cool! The Ice cream is also very good. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars was because of the service. The staff was unfriendly and didn't seem to care about their service."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE Fair Trade. It is very laid back and relaxed, but if you need a quick drink or snack they're great for that too. I love their coffee drinks, especially their French Press. I am a huge coffee drinker, and I'm being honest when I say their coffee is some of the best I've had. It's very fresh, but not at all too bold. For some reason, their hot drinks are better than their cold drinks. But all in all, they're delicious.

They also make really tasty pastries. I'm not sure if all of them are gluten-free, but there are some that I've seen. They also just got ice cream, which is perfect on a hot day.

The baristas are always really happy and helpful. Even though there are usually people in the cafe, it's a nice atmosphere. They also offer free Wifi and power outlets, so if you have a big cup of coffee and a laptop with a power cord you can spend hours there.

The only bad thing about Fair Trade is that sometimes it can get loud, especially there are a lot of people and if a barista wants to play loud music. It varies, based on what day and time you go in. 

Overall, I love Fair Trade and I never say No when someone wants to go."}
{"text":"Very- very nice place. The service is excellent and the coffee is great quality. 
I parked in the parking garage- west of fair trade. No issues finding a spot. 
I loves the outside sitting area because it has a water fountain that gives the area a peaceful atmosphere. 
The inside sitting area is nice too! Love the art on the walls. It is a nice size area. Like your regular Starbucks. 
I was told by the barista that every Wednesday they have loteria night. I am coming back for that!!! Like a bingo night or game night. 
Great place! I will return- will love to have a place like this is mesa!!!"}
{"text":"I loved coming to the Fair Trade Cafe when I lived and worked downtown. 

Their coffee is delicious, the pastries are divine and their sandwiches were my go to for a quick lunch or light dinner. My favorite was their grilled cheese panini with carrots. First off, they give you carrot sticks, not horrible baby carrots. Second the bread was a yummy focaccia style bread that held up well under the panini press. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. And if you didn't want coffee to drink there were always two kinds of ice tea to choose from. Why did I move to Tempe again? Oh right, boyfriend. :) 

If they have peanut butter chocolate chip cookies when you visit you must try them! They're so good! They hit the sweet spot between crispy and moist with just the perfect amount of peanut butter and enough chocolate not to be overwhelmed by each. And they're small enough that you can eat one for a little something sweet or have two and not feel like you completely gave up on your diet. 

I loved the mix of clientele that would frequent the Fair Trade Cafe. Downtown Phoenix is such a melting pot of different lifestyles. Having a conversation with the table next to you was always an adventure because you could meet anyone from CEOs to college students. 

When the weather is nice, you should try to sit out back in the little courtyard if you can find a seat."}
{"text":"Yay: good location -- close to me and easy to get to.
Yay: free reliable WiFi.

Meh: the coffee. Not falling over good, but not burnt up, heartburn-inducing Starbucks style either. 
Meh: the food. Now, granted, I haven't been for lunch, but the a.m. selection does not knock me out. I would think a place as hippie-dippie and crunchy granola as this would be somewhat into remotely healthy food. Instead there were lots of bagels, greasy croissants, etc. The only thing on my vegetarian, health-conscious radar was whole wheat banana bread, which was totally blah and not even really banana-y.

Boo: having to get a key to get into the bathroom. I understand the point, but as someone who will pee every hour for the entire duration of my stay, not cool.
Boo: crappy LOUD Lilith Fair-esque music. Sorry, I left my strap-on at home. Maybe at night when people are just hanging the tunes would be ok, but in the morning I saw lots of poor downtrodden souls like me hunched over laptops, books, or in serious conversation with someone else in a business suit... people who were actually trying to, you know, WORK.

As much as I want to support independent businesses, I highly doubt I'll be back... there's just too many other great places to go."}
{"text":"The coffee is quite good.

The Chai Explosion was yummy and cold. 

The coffee drinks were great.

The decor makes this place look like a corporate coffee entity, but it isn't.

They sometimes host events like the Downtown Phoenix Poetry Slam (which we saw on a night when it was a poetry open mike, and it wasn't all that good, but we have heard good things about it when it is an actual slam).

The coffee is actually fair trade. So, when you drink it, you can rest assured that the people who grew it were compensated fairly for their work. This is a good thing."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a whim because a friend mentioned this place. Liked it the minute I walked in.  Nice atmosphere, and friendly staff.  I had an espresso, a large coffee, and the chicken curry sandwich.  My 6 year old son had the grilled cheese.  The espresso was flavorful without being bitter, and the coffee full bodied.  The chicken curry was excellent, and the bread it was on was almost as much of a treat.  My son devoured the grilled cheese, which was also on the same multi grain bread as mine, though toasted,  We enjoyed hanging out in the courtyard behind the cafe, which has a fountain, and very relaxing atmosphere.  All in all, a very pleasant experience with very good, reasonably priced food.  I'll definitely be making this place a regular stop."}
{"text":"The original Fair Trade Cafe location holds a special place in my heart. I've been a loyal customer for 5 years, now, and practically nothing could change that.

They always have the perfect iced tea or toddy brew coffee (for $2 or $2.50 a cup, which is definitely not bad at all), and the nearby Portland Parkway offers a beautiful outdoor seating area if theirs is already filled.

Other good things include: Gluten free chocolate chip peanut butter cookies, tuna melt, electricity plugs, wonderful music variety, ice cream. Sunday brunch is also worth checking out, but I do not recommend the biscuits and gravy if you happen to be a biscuit and gravy aficionado.

The only bad things: They're often busy, which is good for them, but bad for you if you need an electricity plug to charge your laptop."}
{"text":"Very nice ambience and atmosphere. The coffee here is premium and straight forward menu that doesn't require a genius to pronounce the selection. Nice amount of table and single and couple seats. I seen chess boards and music selection was smooth with a nice volume. Prices were reasonable and I recommend this place for those that would like nice coffee and iced coffee. Brunch here is a very nice idea as well."}
{"text":"This is a great little stop for coffee and some pastry. They have brunch as well, I have never been for brunch but will definitely try it some time. 

Right across from the Light Rail, its hard to be more convenient! Its also a quick walk across Deck Park to the Phoenix Public Library - Burton Barr Branch...nice to get a book and then have a coffee while reading it!

They have live jazz at times and support many excellent local causes as well as being guaranteed fair trade certified!"}
{"text":"Had coffee from this cafe and was very good. A nice bold and well rounded coffee and latte. Also the place is very cute and well decorated. Only thing I would suggest is putting 1 more person on as a barista. Sometimes there are 2 girls there sometimes 1. But other then that great place"}
{"text":"When you compare Fair Trade to Conspire and Lux ... ummm ... well ... there is no comparison ... Fair Trade's decor is BLAND and last time I went there the Barista was less than personable.

Also they lack the electrical outlets at every table which at this late state in the game is a fail for any coffeehouse."}
{"text":"I was a regular here until I moved out east. Not sure where my old review from a couple years ago went. Great atmosphere, community and coffee. Plus Fair Trade which is huge!  I miss the people, atmosphere and location!"}
{"text":"This is literally one of my all time favorite places...I would live here if they'd let me!  

I come here every Saturday morning around 7am for a dirty chai latte (made with almond milk) and a gluten-free chocolate chip peanut butter or vegan breakfast cookie. They make the best coffee AND serve it with a smile!

The lounge-y, earthy, urban feel and decor make for such an inspiring and calming atmosphere, that it has become my new sanctuary. I love to just chill and sip my latte while reading, writing, people-watching or having a conversation with the many intriguing folk that stop in. A lot of writers  meet up here and you'll frequently come across artists, photographers and musicians, as well. 

They have tons of flyers and publications promoting local events and businesses: art shows, theater, LGBT community events, homeopathic/alternative medicine, live music, writing workshops, etc... an artsy hipster haven! 

I cannot say enough great things about this place...absolutely LOVE it!"}
{"text":"Okay, okay this review was coming. This is my coffee shop.

Yeah, I'm that girl, you know, \"medium iced coffee with soy?\"

They've got some new people on staff, but so far they all seem awesome. This is my favorite neighborhood coffee shop. It has everything you could want from a local cafe without the self-righteous hipster attitude. (cough, Cartel, cough). Besides the quality of the drinks and food, the atmosphere is nice. They have free WiFi.

What I love most about Fair Trade is supporting the business. I have (newly-formed) friends who work there and love it. The management truly treats its staff great and really wants to cater to the downtown Phoenix community. The prices are good and comparable to any Starbucks, but the coffee is traded ethically and bought for a fair price, which makes me happy.

Psst... they also have poetry readings and open-mic nights.

The only thing I dislike is that Fair Trade started closing earlier :( I can't go there anymore when I need to pull an all-nighter.

Try it and love it."}
{"text":"What happened to Fair Trade? So sad to see such poor management lately! I was just recently at this local coffee shop 4/8/18 around 5 PM and young blonde barista was just so unkind and just on her cell phone. The atmosphere has changed dramatically over the year and every time I visit this local coffee shop it is always unpleasant."}
{"text":"I love this place, I just wish it was closer to me!

Not only do they have almond milk, but they have gluten-free goodies. How awesome! They also offer Sunday brunch menu, so count me in for eggs and potatoes with my latte! They have so many baked goods, enough to satisfy any appetite.

I would come in and work here, the furniture isn't the MOST comfortable I've been in, and plugs are hard to come by with some tables, but it's such a great atmosphere that I don't even care. 

The staff is always so nice, what a great place to have a cup of coffee, a date, or a working session.

Park in the parking garage, except it gets a little busy on Sundays when the church parking is there too."}
{"text":"I'm a regular customer of Fair Trade and I usually have nothing but good to say about it. Just ten minutes ago, though, I stood at te counter for about five minutes watching one employee talk on her phone. When the second employee came out from the kitchen she returned to a plate of food. I have no idea what impression they think that produces in customers, but I left without being served and I wonder if I should ever return. I have no interest in patronizing a coffee shop that doesn't have a sense of customer service. I will think very hard about going back, which is too bad considering the many days I've spent there."}
{"text":"This was one of my fave places to study when I was in school. I agree with other reviewers, it's a hippy granola atmosphere. The ice tea is good. The seating is plentiful. The food is good. They once made me toast/jam (not on the menu... I had a craving for it that day.) I thought that was cool for a coffee place. The cookies are very good. And the wifi is free. And parking was no problem."}
{"text":"Very friendly Service and great food options. However it was a little hidden but we found it anyways. Definitely a great environment"}
{"text":"I have been here 2x since moving down here from cali bay area. I am a coffee snob and I really fit in here. The staff is very cute and helpful.
The people in the shop remind me of the bay area.
I drink americanos and the beans being used are very robust and smooth.
The menu selection is nice for the food fair and I really enjoy the general atmosphere.

I strongly recommend this cafe!!!

{"text":"Fair Trade Cafe is a nifty coffee house on the corner of Central and Roosevelt. 

Conveniently located near the light rail, so it's easy to access. 

Unless you're like me and drove in from the Southeast Valley and in true herp-a-durp fashion managed to miss the parking garage . . . Almost twice. Don't judge! 

Cozy up in one of their chairs, community tables or sit outside on the back patio near the fountain. You won't feel rushed at all. 

If my workplace was in the vicinity, I could totally see myself hiding out here to shake things up occasionally.

Met Amy K. here for friend catch up time / coffee / breakfast this morning. 

I got a cup of the dark roast. Hot, strong and brunette is the way I go! No almond milk today. This was one amazingly fresh cup o' joe. Nice and smooth, not a whole lot of bitter. 

We also got breakfast; hearty slices of bacon and perfectly fluffy scrambled eggs. 

Not sure what the damage was on all of this as I was being treated (THANK YOU SO MUCH AMY!), but $2.25 - $2.50 is your typical drip coffee price. 

Didn't get a chance to see if they sold beans here, but I know I'll be back whenever I'm in the area. 

Thanks Amy for introducing me to a new place!"}
{"text":"Good coffee & tea. A little loud on the radio and blenders constantly whirring... But good wifi and now that I know how to get there will use often..."}
{"text":"Wonderful coffee selection, and smoothies too. The ambiance is definitely laid back but their coffee and servers are first class! They have good pastries and breakfast choices. I will definitely revisit again and again!"}
{"text":"Good chocolate croissants, even though they're shipped frozen and then baked at the premises.  
Do they serve teas there?  I'll have to check that out next time I'm there for a croissant!"}
{"text":"Great urban view and feel. I enjoy places that have a rich feeling of culture. This is a must try to relax and enjoy the city ambiance without feeling rushed. 
Espresso was smooth, not bitter.  I loved my Latte and my daughter wanted a second Hot Chocolate! :)"}
{"text":"First time here, my wife recommended this cafe and I was not disappointed. I ordered a turkey wrap with chips and it was very tasty. The wrap was fresh and soft with a soft aftertaste of spinach which was good on my palate. The turkey was also tasty and fresh. The vegetables did not overpower the overall combination of tastes. I enjoyed the wrap very much. The service was great as well, very talkative and responsive to what I was saying. I felt comfortable with the cliental as well. I will recommend this cafe to my friends and co-workers and post it's where-a-bouts on Facebook, Twitter and instagram!"}
{"text":"Great location near the light rail, devoted baristas, good soy chai teas, clean interior, plenty of parking and free Wi-Fi.
I can easily pick up the internet unlike Lola Coffee where you need a password. I can't be bothered with that.  

Seriously. What's not to love?"}
{"text":"The only drinkable cup I have found downtown and maybe even the greater Phoenix area.  Also they have all sorts of crafts from other countries as well as art.  Awesome place.  Now you can catch the light rail to Fair Trade from Tempe where I know for sure there is no drinkable coffee."}
{"text":"I understand that it takes time to make drinks, but I would have appreciated at least a warning that they were slow tonight. I waited almost 20 mins for coffee that I gave up on, because I had something else to get to... And the barista stayed busy the whole time (they weren't being jerks), but a warning would have been nice considering that they didn't look busy."}
{"text":"By far one of my favorite coffee shops in the area. The light rail is across the street so it's super easy to get to. Plenty of parking too if you're driving. 
The atmosphere is artistic and relaxed, the coffee is good and the food is wonderful. 
Downtown Phoenix is not lacking in great little hangouts like this, but Fair Trade might just be my favorite."}
{"text":"Really neat place, it has a nice outdoor area and great indoor seating. Great coffee and good food."}
{"text":"I really liked this place. The iced tea is great and you get free refills!

The decor is cute and inviting and the staff is very friendly. Free WiFi too!"}
{"text":"Spinach and feta croissant, orange juice, free wifi with decent pluggage, nice environment, good yet non-intrusive music. Easy parking too! (Hey, this matters to someone from the Bay Area.)"}
{"text":"Lately, I have noticed that there are tons of coffee shops opening in central phoenix, and a few selections in the downtown area. I would have to say that Fair Trade Café is definitely has become my go to coffee shop because compared to others, it brings quality drinks and foods, we well as the atmosphere being serene to having different artwork being displayed. When I first discovered this café, I was intrigued by the motto and the fact that they are locally owned to always feeling welcomed, no matter what time of day I go. It's also a great cause for the owner to being direct fair trade, mainly because it shows in the taste of all their drinks and compensation towards the farmer, to opting into the organic movement and having different vegan options. Any time of day I enter this place, it is never full (unless it's the afternoon on a weekend or First Friday) that provides different types of sitting areas, with them providing trendy music and the artwork is always a great view. I have noticed that maybe every month of twice a month, the art is switched out which is so refreshing but I do wish there was more information on each artwork on their website(s) and whom they are presenting. I have never stopped by this place during First Friday because it ALWAYS seems to be full of capacity and loud, because of the DJ, but one day I do plan to just so I can walk around with a drink. I, personally, find this great of where it's located and the products they provide, especially, the top quality. I have moved out of the vicinity, for now, but do plan to move back to downtown and cannot wait to be a regular again!"}
{"text":"I hear the Sunday brunch menu is revamped so I plan to drop in soon to try it.  The baristas are friendly, over educated (+++), and attractive.  There's ever changing art on the walls.  Free wifi and free parking in the private garage is another plus....and it's right at the Roosevelt light rail station.  The coffee is fine and I like the house salad.  Otherwise the food is a little too greasy-spoon for my taste, which lean savory.  There are plenty of pastries there  for the rest of you!"}
{"text":"As mentioned in the other negative reviews here, this issue isn't the food or the coffee. It is the service. The hard part about the service at Fair Trade is that they are generally helpful and nice. Until they're not. An example: my fiancée and I were waiting for the light rail and decided to run across the street for a coffee and tea. The barista informed my fiancée that it would be 5 minutes for the tea to brew and as our train wasn't coming for 11 minutes later we said that wouldn't be a problem. 6 minutes in, the tea was just being started. We asked if that was our tea that she was starting just then and it was. We told her we couldn't wait another 5 minutes and she said she could just steep it for 2, it just wouldn't be as good. No offer of our money back or asking if we want something else, or even an apology. Just \"Enjoy this slightly worse tea.\" I know this doesn't sound like that bad of a situation, but it is 100% indicative of their service. When everything is fine it's fine. But when things aren't they're disrespectful and unhelpful. 

(There is a much better example of this but it is already mentioned in another review)"}
{"text":"I met my brother down town to have coffee and then I needed to work on grading papers. We originally planned on a different coffee shop around the corner but when we got there I was disappointed as the indoor seating was really cramped and even though they had outdoor seating there wasn't a place to plug in my laptop. I pulled up yelp and found fair trade cafe! We walked over and it was perfect! Lots of indoor seating, lots of places to plug in with free WiFi, the coffee was delicious and affordable, and the Manager Stephanie walked around checking in on customers and offering samples. The decor is adorable as well. I will definitely be back as I really enjoyed this positive space."}
{"text":"The coffee here is excellent! I was hoping for a rich dark roast, and theirs was definitely satisfying. Very hot and deep, rich flavor. I had the Guatemala. Amazing low key vibe and comfy, inspiring decor. Staff is amazing. Yessi served me today, and she was above and beyond, so welcoming and attentive all with a huge dose of friendliness. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I was on the light rail today and spotted this coffee shop from the train, so I figured on my way back I would check it out. The place was really cute, with a great selection off coffee and drinks to choose from.

The place has tons of seating, including a bunch of comfy looking couches and chairs, along with tables and chairs if you wish to use them.  Several people were there surfing the internet, and I wandered in looking for some coffee.

Initially, I wanted a Mocha.  When I was asking the girl behind the counter about it, she said her expresso machine was broken, but she could substitute coffee for it instead.  I decided that I would rather just get the coffee instead so that's what I got.  She was really nice about it, and apologized for it being out of order.

While waiting for my coffee, the girl offered me a pastry in compensation for her machine being down. Whatever she gave me, it was awesome! It was chocolate chip something, and tasted divine! 

I was going to sit in the patio area and relax by the fountain, but I passed because the seats outside were already taken. I ended up hanging out on the couch inside, which was really comfy.  

The coffee itself was strong but tasty, and everything went well. I would gladly stop by again when I'm in the area or have time when doing stuff.  Go check it out, the place is pretty cool!"}
{"text":"A stone's throw from a light rail stop, Fair Trade is about as urban and convenient as it gets. Come because you're looking for culture, stay because...well, the product is actually really good. 

I didn't even order the coffee my first time. Just a smoothie. No regrets, it's really good stuff. But as countless other reviewers will point out, the brew itself isn't bad. At all. I had a simple cafe au lait, and it didn't disappoint at all. I don't recall their roasts, I just know they're top notch, so feel confident stopping by.

There's some comfy seating to be had, but expect serious looking people on their Macs to hog entire couches or tables. On every visit I've found this to be a quiet, even solemn place for many of the valley's professionals to stress over their reports in public. That's good for many, but I can only hope Fair Trade spices things up with some more local flavor than the tasteful art adorning its walls. 

In closing, I'll simply say you can't go wrong here. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I really want to love this place! 

The location and concept are awesome- local, artsy, not-just-coffee shop. Great for a late night (or breakfast!) ice cream/gelato craving, which I have a little too often, & the peanut butter chocolate cookies are worth the trip alone. I have eaten here a couple of times, mostly because I was already there. Pretty good, local and made to order (so don't be in a hurry).

However... I have yet to have a good flavored latte, and the past couple of times I have waited at least 10-15 minutes for a couple of espressos and lattes. Milkshakes can be very watery and no bueno, depending on the barista. It is also pretty noisy, and sometimes has random theatrical/musical performances. I'm all for supporting the local arts, but it doesn't make for a quiet, productive atmosphere to get hyped up on caffeine and knock out some homework. 

Bonus- Wifi, and the single shots of espresso are basically doubles."}
{"text":"The latte here tastes better than any coffee shop I've been to in Arizona. The café is adorned with little pick me ups and is fantastic for studying. Free wifi, parking in a parking garage and offers a great selection of foods/drinks for just about any meal of the day."}
{"text":"Terrific spot with great vibe. The iced coffee is one of my favorites being cold brewed, smooth and delicious. The Americano is also fantastic if you desire a bit less caffeine.  Sandwiches are very good but the stars of the program are the pumpkin bread, banana bread, blueberry breakfast cake, and assorted pastry items!  Outstanding spot to regroup late in the day too."}
{"text":"There are many coffee places to try around the Downtown Phoenix area, and Fair Trade is simply fair. The coffee is good, but not my favorite. I have had brunch hear also, and it wasn't anything amazing. I do like that they have vegan offerings, and the staff have always been friendly. Sadly, its just a-ok in comparison to some of the other coffee shops around."}
{"text":"I'm bumping FTC up to 5 stars.  I stopped in here today with my girls and they proved themselves to be not just a really good coffee house - they're a great coffee house.

Would you like some ethical business practices with that latte?  Actually it comes with everything you purchase here.  Connectedness to the local community?  Standard.  Quality products?  Ditto.

I spent a good part of the half hour or so I was here talking with one of the employees, Shane.  Great guy and he served up 2 chocolate croissants for my kids with great panache.  I even snapped before and after pics.

And I discovered they make toddy.  Next time you're here ask for your drink made with toddy instead of espresso.  Smoother, more robust and more caffeineyer."}
{"text":"There is something special about this little house. One of my yelper buds invited me over here but I was busy. The very next day my client that lives in the apts over the coffee shop invited me here. So two invites, two different people in two days means something right? 

I order up a capp and the flowerless peanut butter chocolate chip cookie. Ok gal, I thank thee!"}
{"text":"I have been going to this place practically since it opened.  Was very intentional about continuing to go during light rail construction because it was important to me that they survive the construction and thrive as a business.

However, its' been a few months since I've gone downtown and so I haven't been in.  They've remodeled, I'm not crazy about the new seating they've chosen, but that's not really that big of a deal.

There were two people behind the counter, they were both standing there when I ordered a salad in a particular way because I have food related health issues. First, they took half an hour to make the salad (it was NOT busy in there!!), both of them delivered it, and the salad was made in the exactly the way that I had said not to do. 

I pointed that fact out, one of them said, ok, we can just take that off of there, and I said no, you can't, you have to start over. One of them brought it back to me and there was clear evidence that I'd been ignored. The second time. No apology, no following directions, completely ignored me when I suggested that when people ask for things in a specific way, it's usually for a pretty important reason. 

Sheesh, it's not McDonalds, they make stuff to order, they should be that much about customer service that she started over and didn't try to sneak something past me that is really important that I not eat.  I won't be going back.  This makes me sad."}
{"text":"This coffee shop was pretty cool. I ordered a iced chai latte with a shot of espresso and it was really good and spicy (that's the way I like my chais). The coffee in the chai was also very good, not bitter at all- just smooth. It tasted better than Starbuck's chai latte for sure! The service was pretty quick too. My order was done in  2 mins. However I can see how people think it's pretty expensive. It is pretty pricey, but it makes sense since it's 'fair trade coffee'. But I enjoyed the vibe there and its location is very convenient. I'll definitely be back since I liked the taste of the coffee so much! Oh, and they had a clean bathroom! That's a huge plus in my book!"}
{"text":"I am pleased with the service and quality of this place.

First of all, it is easy to locate-- especially if you are visiting downtown Phoenix and using the light rail for the first time (it's right across the Central & Roosevelt station).

The atmosphere is perfect for:
- studying/ reading/ internet browsing
- meeting with a friend for some coffee/tea/snack

They have an outside patio as well. Their drink selection is great. They have coffees, smoothies, teas, sandwiches, and other pastries. Prices were reasonable. The staff is definitely friendly and they are very efficient in how they operate. 

Definitely would go there again if I am in the Phoenix area. Loved it."}
{"text":"You into organic stuff?  You support your local farms and stuff?  Than come here!! 

Coworker and I decided to give this place a try.  We didn't know what we were getting ourselves into but we wanted to take the risk.  The parking is good since it was a parking garage, so it was nice and cool.  The location was clean and well decorated, they have tables and chairs and sofas and more  comfy chairs.  It was very homey feel. 

The service was fast, the staff were friendly.  The food was pretty good, no complaints.. it's organic alright I could somewhat taste it in their breads.  The coworker enjoyed his coffee and I enjoyed their tap water.  Good olé fresh water from the tap.  Their veggie soup was good, the sandwich was good as well.  

Overall a good little place, the price is a little high.  But we will probably come back again."}
{"text":"When I was staying at the Lexington Hotel, I found this coffee-shop, which is located half a block away. I can even crawl with my pajamas to get my cup of joe in the morning...in which I did. 

The coffee shop uses coffee beans that are Fair-trade certified. \"For a good cup of coffee, you gotta love that!\"

I was here every morning for my two-day stay for just a 16oz cup of coffee for $2.00. I love the coffee here and by a landslide, it sure beats drinking the beverage from the hotel.

This coffee-shop is also Eco-friendly; a definite plus. 

Despite the quiet area especially at night, the hours are great (closes nightly at 10pm).

Free Wi-fi are available.

Inside is a great place to study for ASU students

A nice shaded and cool patio to lounge or handle your business. 
 
I feel like home here with the friendly staffs and they treated me very well too, despite coming here three times for just a cup of coffee (twice in the morning and once in the afternoon). \"Hey you buy anything, you're automatically their friend(s). That is how I look at it!\"

If I come back to Phoenix, this will be my coffee-shop. And obviously, I need to show them some more \"love\" and get other items with my cup of coffee."}
{"text":"One of my favorite coffee shops. A cozy yet fun environment to get work done but also have a conversation. Awesome options for food allergies and great food in general."}
{"text":"This place definitely takes advantage of its surroundings, promoting its urban feel. It's easily accessible from the light rail, sits right on the northern edge of downtown, is close to the public market and contributes to growing number of businesses in the area. Its point-of-sale is a bit on the pricey side, but it's a nice place regardless. If I were downtown and wanted coffee, this would be my preferred choice. If I wanted to go out for coffee in any neighborhood, I would likely bypass this shop for Copper Star, Hob Nob's or the Lux. Patrons will notice Fair Trade's odd use of angles, industrial interior and UV-heavy lighting with windows that seem to magnify the sun's brightness. I do like it and would go back again, but in general it isn't my preference."}
{"text":"Awesome place and awesome environment! I came here after First Friday downtown and was blown away by the fantastic vibe this place had. Very cozy and intimate with great decor and drinks! Their smoothie with the carrots (can't remember what it's called) is the BOMB and very filling. The crowd here is very unique and it is a great space to get some work done or meet with others for a cup of coffee! I will definitely be coming back for their spoken word events to check out some great Phoenix talent!"}
{"text":"One of my most favorite coffee places in Phoenix - the cafe and clientele remind me of a more international place than we typically see in Phoenix/Scottsdale. Highly recommended for globalists seeking coffee."}
{"text":"Chill laid back environment. Honestly, for me it didn't set its self apart form a regular cafe as much. I went to meet a friend and to do some writing I guess would be fine but I was thoroughly unimpressed. 

I had an iced tea and it was okay... all ice on an already super light tea.... probably will never come back on my own accord but only if a friend invites me there to hang."}
{"text":"I have to say...2nd visit, more to come.  I have now been there in the evening to work on laptop.  Great, lots of outlets and good coffee and calm atmosphere.    Today stopped in with the kiddo...good Italian sodas too!  I will say, this isn't Starbucks and it isn't the speedier place.  But that can be a nice change of pace and they have almond milk!"}
{"text":"A lot of things have changed about Fair Trade Cafe. I haven't lived on this side of town for a while, but I remember their baked goods being AWESOME. I went back recently and wasn't very impressed, particularly with their vegan brownies which used to be amazing. However, the coffee is very good, the atmosphere is really nice. The food is SO GOOD. Curry chicken sandwich is my main go-to.

Another change that I noticed is their seating. Instead of individual tables and chairs, they now have a lot of bench-style seating along one of the walls. It looks really cool, but I feel like it's more crammed in there than it used to be. Furniture that they kept includes their chairs, which are super wobbly and kinda scary to sit in.

Overall great coffee shop, but not as comfortable as others in the area."}
{"text":"This is my third visit to Phoenix. I have come to this establishment for ice cream in the early evening, tonight being Wednesday, and the same woman has been here each time. She is super unfriendly, if not downright rude. I figure that three times is enough and there should be a review to acknowledge this. Ice cream good, wait staff sucks. Get over it, woman. Management: alert!"}
{"text":"So after multiple opportunities to go to Fair Trade Cafe, I FINALLY went and loved it.  Why was I taking so long in going? Not sure. But regret it.

It was First Friday, so very busy and very chilly, so I went actually a few times in one night.  First run was with the veggie soup, that was fabulous-- I can't wait to try other flavors.  Second run was a plain coffee and it was  tasty, not bitter- I drink coffee daily and often find it bitter at a lot of places. Third run was a mint tea- can't ever go wrong with mint tea.  

Now coffee houses, in my opinion are based a lot on the employees/owners, the vibe and the other customers.  The employees were above and beyond kind and the vibe was cool and as the night went on, it got even more cool.  It was open mic night and people were reading poetry-- some better than others but my favorite was a humorous poet who had the whole room in stitches.   I've never been to an open mic poet night, it was interesting.  I was talking to my friend and I got shooshed and someone yelled \"MAN ON MIC!\" and I felt like a frickin' moron but whatever, I understand.  I was new-- I didn't know the rules.  Doesn't help that when I talk in general, I pretty much scream-- loud talker but that's because I come from a family of 4 kids and if you were quiet, you were never heard.  


So, Fair Trade is 5 stars in my book."}
{"text":"The BF and I went here last week after riding our bikes around in the rain. We each had a latte and I thought they were alright, very drinkable lattes, but they didn't have the most flavor of any latte I have had. The place is super cute, has a bike rack, and has tons of seating BUT I wish the coffee was a bit stronger. Despite this, I will probably come back here because it is very close to the house and it will do."}
{"text":"Fair Trade Cafe has good coffee and nice places to sit and soak up the sun in the morning. It's also super close to the train stop, which is convenient. The barista here was very friendly and I love when I learn something new to start the day. On this particular visit, I learned that their cold brew, called \"iced toddy\" on the menu, is named for the toddy which is used to make cold brew. The coffee was good too!"}
{"text":"A locally owned business in a trendy part of town. This is well suited for people who enjoy a hip, cool coffee shop. Starbucks zealots may seem a little out of place at first but they will quickly learn the joy of a one of a kind coffee shop.  Very pleasant service and the other patrons seem to be enjoying their visit as well. I had a Chinese Breakfast tea even this late in the evening. I recommend a visit."}
{"text":"One of the best local coffee shops in town.... friendly service, home feel look and Amazing coffee and food... I highly recommended."}
{"text":"I'm a grad student who loves studying in coffee shops, but prefers tea. My favorite brew is the Mighty Leaf Green Tea Tropical. I have searched for months to find a cafe that serves anything even similar...and discovered today that Fair Trade stocks the real stuff. My life in Arizona is now nearly complete. (Now if only the girlfriend would visit from Cali more often)"}
{"text":"I consider myself a regular at Fair Trade because I live in the attached apartment complex and I wish I could justify rating them more than 3 stars. Although I much prefer Fair Trade over Lola (just down the street), they need to just get it together here!!

They are understaffed every single time I go in. Sometimes I feel horrible for the employees because they are taking orders, making drinks, cooking, cleaning and who knows what else. 

If i order anything besides regular coffee, it takes about 10 min to get my drink. If I order food (even just a plain toasted bagel with cream cheese) it takes no less than 15 min. I wish this was not the case because I would love to stop in here for a latte before work! This is a place I only go when i have a little extra time on the weekends. 

They recently gave themselves an internal face lift which looks amazing! New couches, chairs, art. I also love how they always have fresh flowers around the shop. An employee told me that the owner gets the flowers and arranges them herself- awesome personal touch! The crowd in here is the best. Down to earth!! which is a breathe of fresh air when compared to other shops around (Lola, Songbird, Lux). 

I will continue to frequent Fair Trade but please hire more employees so your current wonderful employees are not in over their heads and you can provide better customer service."}
{"text":"just hit this place the other night before our First Fridays committee meeting and in a word: supercalifragilisticespalidocious.

my carmel latte was so, so great, and having been a barista in a former life, i'm a tough customer. 

the atmosphere is perfect for work or play. wide open, big tables inside and a big patio in the back, with a fountain. (yes, you can cut through the parking garage and come in the back, instead of walking the whole way around like an idiot...like i might have done.)

the pricing is right for their beverages and aside from being involved in fair trade, they also like the environment. they've got a spot for you to put your sleeves to be used again. brilliant.

the only reason i'm giving it four instead of five stars is because i had to go to the bathroom really badly and i couldn't use it because someone was in it for a good 20 minutes while i was waiting and i had to wait even longer and use it at the next place because i was scared to go in, at that point. not their fault."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for the first time Wednesday morning and asked if they would make a Cafe Miel for me, a drink that wasn't on the menu.  The barista happily looked up how to make it and made it perfectly!"}
{"text":"In my quest for the best dirty Chai in Phoenix this place is up there. The girl that made it did some madness with spices over the top and it was delicious. I have also had more than a few baked goods and hot damn the M&M cookies are good! Also Ingrid Hirtz is slingin food like a pro so you can rest assured there is love cooked into every bite!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and the service is always terrible. Usually I stand at the counter waiting to be acknowledged by staff that is either in the back or busy behind the bar. They never bother to acknowledge customers. Today the lady behind the counter had a nasty, negative attitude when she finally decided to take my order. She made it clear that I was inconveniencing her. Pardon me, Ms. Sassypants, for interrupting you at w-o-r-k!

I generally try to visit local coffee shops, but there's a reason Starbucks is so successful - they're customer focused! Granted, the coffee and the food is good (hummus plate is filling and delicious and the coffee is non-acidic), but the consistent poor service is a huge deterrent. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times and feel confident in my review. The layout of this place is very nice with plenty of open space and large glass wall facing the street. The decor inside is decent and comfortable.  The music is also  set an an acceptable volume. 

I've had the ice latte twice and hot drip coffee once. They're both okay - nothing I'll crave later on. 

The breakfast sandwich is ok, but not great - a bit expensive at $6.75. It should be $5 tops. The ham and cheese breakfast sandwich is very bland. Instead of a think slice, there was a huge slab of ham on top of a small amount of scrambled egg and I could barely see any cheese. There was no sauce, so it was very dry. I completely took out the ham and only ate the rest because I hadn't eaten in almost 18 hours (doing intermittent fasting). 

Lastly, the last 2 times I've been here, the WIFI has been terrible. In fact, I'm using my hotspot data from my phone to write this review on-site on my iPad. I can't get YouTube videos to play, access many APPS, email, or APP store."}
{"text":"There are only two coffee shops in the valley that I love, and Fair Trade is one of them. I love FT if just for their great selection of snacks that make the perfect companion to a mug of coffee, latte or even iced tea.

They always have a few different roasts brewed and waiting for a mug to call home. I enjoy lighter roasts - sorry I don't enjoy burnty coffee. And FT is quick to meet my desires! Mmm the Peruvian roast, how I love thee. And yes, students get a 10% discount. Plus all the coffee is certified Fair Trade (some are organic). Woo! However, I wish that they would also use Fair Trade chocolate for their Mochas etc, and since they don't it makes me a little sad.

They have started to have more and more fresh vegan pastries from their kitchen. I heard they just got a vegan pastries cookbook so I can't wait to see what kind of other treats they will have for me in the future.

The atmosphere here is usually mellow enough for me to be productive.. and I have been happy to be able to take advantage of their wifi this week, since I recently moved and have been without internet for a week.

The cafe is right next to the light rail stop at Roosevelt & Central (Arts District) so check it out if you're a rail rider on a leisure trip (weekend riders I'm talking to you).

Oh and everyone who works at FT is wonderfully pleasant. These girls (and one guy) have won my heart, that's for sure... or maybe it was the coffee that did it..."}
{"text":"The name enticed me, the barista was adorjable, warm and knowledgeable, my iced chai was \"very spicy\" but I was warned and it was the best iced chai I've ever purchased. I really like the eclectic feel and random nooks available to curl up into. There's some cool aet for sale as well, or you can sit outside and just soak up some vitamin D while you sip on your drink or munch on some grindage and watch the light rail go by. 5th star grantes when the gal came outside to ask me if I was enjoying my chai ;)"}
{"text":"I've been coming to Fair Trade Cafe ever since my move back to Phoenix in 2010 when I was living on Portland.  I met a friend here for coffee, at his suggestion, and have been coming here ever since.

For awhile, I spent three nights a week here either meeting about my book or writing it.  It was such a relaxed atmosphere and the employees were the nicest coffee shop employees in town.  

Since moving to Ahwatukee, I have not had much occasion to visit the cafe.  Recently, I have been downtown more frequently.  I've popped in three times in the last week just to read.  

They now have the rewards terminal for Belly next to their register, which I've seen popping up at small businesses in town.  They have bigger tables.  They have gotten rid of their retail offerings (apparently they were collecting too much dust).  Their pastry case has been removed.  

But other than those basic changes, Fair Trade Cafe is essentially the same.  It is a great local cafe where you can get basic eats (today I had an egg and cheese croissant) and good drinks at a fair price.  And you can feel good doing it, too.  They support fair trade practices.  

I've tried a few other local coffee shops in town and they're just not for me.  The vibe here at Fair Trade is relaxed.  I feel comfortable sipping on my soy hot cocoa or Italian soda at my own pace as I read a book.  I don't feel rushed.  I feel only the utmost relaxation.  

If you're working on a project, having a quick meeting, writing a paper (or a book) or just want a place to pop in to get away from the hustle and bustle for awhile, Fair Trade Cafe should be your place.

This place reminds me so much of SF Bay Area cafes.  It's just like home!

A side note: One of the owners, Stephanie, is one of the nicest people in Phoenix.  She is such a genuine person and I really wish her every success in growing her business."}
{"text":"Morning Ritual...get fair trade, smoke cig, wait for car pool. 

i have been holding off reviewing fair trade for a very long time...where once i felt it was pretentious and kinda uppity with it's social politics...i have since embraced this jewel and really love the people who work here. every morning i get greeted and for the most part they know what i want and it simplifies everything.

first i don't get all picky with what i get, it's a large drip every morning. i usually steer for Medium Roast..but for the most part i like what i get..dark or medium..so i stopped specifying. it is just good so why complicate things with being picky.

Fair Trade also gives out discounts for RS residents, Gov. employees, students, and seniors. as a resident of the apartment \"complex\" fair trade is in. i get my resident discount..i think it's 10%. which is nice because it brings the cost down below 2 bucks for a large coffee..i then feel more justified with the 1 dollar tip i usually leave. 

1 star for good coffee 
1 star for great employees 
1 star for location 
1 star for prices 
1 star for convenience

ahhh i feel better now."}
