{"text":"The food is delicious food if/when it gets to your table, but painfully slow (and apologetic) service.  We ordered spaghetti and shrimp, Taiwanese fried chicken and golden squid balls. Food came sporadically, the last dish came 50 minutes after we ordered. To be fair, I approached the manager and was offered a refund for the late dish.  The most enjoyable part was the environment. There is plenty of space across two floors and a great place to hang out. Don't think I'd return but worth checking out."}
{"text":"Had TWO BUGS in my beef noodle soup, they were stuck between the vegetables. I told the manager, and his reply? \"IT IS NATURAL.\" If that is the attitude for Charidise run a restaurant, I am speechless. Yes, he did switch for a new one, but the new came with bug again in the vegetable... Super disappointed as I had high hopes for Charidise."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good and nice restaurant, but my entire family got food poisoning after eating here. We had the Taiwanese pork on rice, chicken spaghetti and popcorn chicken snack. Tasted really good, but after getting food poisoning from eating here, not sure will we come here again. Unfortunate."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. Nice ambiance makes me wanna study even though I don't like studying. But feels like a casual first date kinda place, you know what I mean. Food is good, drinks is good.  *Tip - service can be a little slow. Keep that in mind so you don't get all frustrated like some of these other yelpers.   They have plugs in all seating areas and have free wi-fi. Password is their phone number (no dashes).  Would definitely come back and tell my friends about it."}
{"text":"I've come here twice before and it was ok and nice to eat and study at. However yesterday I ordered a beef noodle soup and got food poisoning symptoms shortly after. The apple they gave also looked pretty dirty so I didn't eat it. Not sure if it's related but I don't think I'll be going back for a while."}
{"text":"This is a really good Taiwanese food inspired restaurant in DT Toronto. It is huge! 2 floors with hundreds of seats. So never have to worry about waiting in line or having nowhere to sit.   The menu is simple, rice dish or noodles dish. Desert snack drinks. I ordered the minced pork on rice. It is fantastic! The flavour of the pork really pops in ur mouth. And u mix it with the rice, oh yeah! My frd ordered the teriyaki chicken which is also really tasty.   Overall it is a really good restaurant but hope the price can be lower a little bit. The single rice dish costs 11.99 which doesn't come with any drink. I will compare it to papa Chang's which is also Taiwanese food restaurant in Markham next time."}
{"text":"Just to clarify, food=4, ambient=5, drink=1. The drinks are made way way WAY too sweet. I had very sugary drinks from other BBT places, and it is for sure among the top few. Tried original, less sugar, half sugar in 3 occasions, not much a difference. It really only takes the owner to take one sip to figure out what is being served. Anyway, really want this place to be good. Tell us when it is fixed and will try again.   At the meantime, definitely NOT going back because of the sugar issue."}
{"text":"Had a craving for Taiwanese beef noodles and realized that Charidise advertises itself as a Taiwanese restaurant.   I've been by many times but never been inside. The restaurant is nicely renovated and ordering is simple at the panels up front by the door.  They should have added the ability to pay right at the ordering stations as you have to then pay at the front counter.  I ordered the beef noodle and drink and it came quickly enough.  It's a bit fast food style so you basically just sit at any free table.  The beef noodle was average I would say.  Nothing that really makes it stand out from the others.    The atmosphere is great and spacious and for something quick it's a good place.  Other than that it's average fare."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a weekend, the quality has gotten worse over the past few months.  I ordered the chicken leg with rice.  There used to be a skewer of zucchini or brussel sprout, now it doesn't come with them.  The chicken leg was super tough to chew, which is surprising since its chicken.  I suspect it's was made a long time ago."}
{"text":"I stopped here by chance for a tea and dessert so I cannot comment on main courses. Any menu that at least listed the teas or coffee was missing. The individuals wait on you across the counter and the cook works in the kitchen at the back -but far at the back, so it seemed the service person was always on the run and exhausted!  With photos in the front part of the store for main courses only, and only one dessert in the window (Saturday at 3:00 pm would be prime dessert time so there should be a display....at least show mugs and at least make the hot water easy for the service person to access. Not offered any concrete tea options I requested water which I had to request twice. Seems there's also a cold water shortage-the cold water was served in paper cups to each person just rationing a bit over 8 ounces...maybe use larger cups or a jug for a table of people?  With pictures of the food at the front, I felt a bit like I was at Swiss Chalet and didn't feel that more personal impression or touch that the food is fresh, available and accurate to the pictures.  Service person didn't seem to know how to find a tea bag-so I didn't get the impression from that of a place I wanted to stay for a meal if tea and dessert was hard to handle.  I ordered the only thing I saw which was blueberry cheesecake. Looked and tasted ok, but sweet, and just ok, not cold either, but felt somewhat room temperature.  When the cheesecake served was marked with a price code that stated chocolate cheesecake then I just felt like I was at the Ikea cafeteria.   Atmosphere: Save for windows and a few comfortable couches at front,  place is completely dark even in sunny daytime. Female washroom looked like a college washroom for students way way at the back....clean but not bright and cheery.  ..it felt quite studenty-they need to brighten the place up to attract a daytime crowd and make it look more social. Or at least create a bigger section at the front for dessert and tea to attract more customers."}
{"text":"I came here with my friend around 4:30 on a Friday. It was fairly busy but there was more than enough seating to accommodate us and not too loud as a lot of other patrons were there to study. I ordered the curry beef spaghetti and Charidise milk tea while my friend got the fried chicken and chicken breast spaghetti. They told us that the chicken breast spaghetti would take 20 minutes, which was fine by us since we would have other things to eat. Our food came fairly quickly and I was surprised at the large portions of spaghetti. Every dish was very filling. The bubble tea was decent, but I've had better. My only complaint would be that the ordering system can be confusing for some, and if you want water, you have to go down to the cashier as opposed to asking a waiter passing by. The food was good for a reasonable price and I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"So my friends and I certainly aren't treehuggers, but this restaurant made us feel incredibly guilty about all of the waste we were creating. From the bamboo plates, paper soup bowls, plastic utensils, bamboo skewers, and paper on the trays, all of it went straight to the garbage can when we were done.  The worst part was that Charidise gives you tap water in the plastic cups, complete with plastic covers and plastic straws. The same ones you'd expect for bubble tea. And if you ask for refills, instead of a server getting a jug of water and leaving it at the table, they give you even more plastic cups and straws.   There is no reason why a group of four should have eight cups by the end of a meal.  By the time we were done, we were swimming in plastic and paper, and although the food was fine, this definitely marred our experience.   So much waste.   If the owners are listening, please change this ridiculous contribution to landfills that you're making every day. You have a beautiful space and a huge kitchen-- surely you can afford some real plates, cups, and cutlery?    P.S. On a funny note, the entrees come with a bag of Doritos, which is just hilarious. (And, come to think of it, even more wasteful. Oh my.)"}
{"text":"Not a big fan of the service. the decor and atmpsphere of the shop is nice. I tried the curry chicken, it is alright but nothing really stands out though. The washroom needs to be up a notch too. Hope next time their patio section is available."}
{"text":"I try to order something different each time I go there and everything is so good. The best Taiwanese comfort food in town and I am currently obsessed with their Korean Grapefruit Green Tea drink. The price of food and drinks is very reasonable. Excellent hangout spot with a group of friends and they close late."}
{"text":"I like the restaurant, but didn't have the best experience asking for a coffee. They forgot to mention that I should pick it up in the next counter and I spent some time waiting for it at the table.   When I asked if they had any sweetener or sugar, the clerk gave me a giant bottle of a transparent liquid (???)  I know this is not a coffee shop, but why include a latte in the menu if they don't even have sugar to offer?"}
{"text":"Baldwin Village now has a bubble tea place. A HUGE bubble tea place with an upstairs and downstairs.  We wandered in here on a snowy day wanting soup noodles. The set-up is cafeteria styled and they they have a menu with noodles, rice, dessert, and bubble tea.  I ordered the Taiwanese beef soup noodles. They were actually pretty good!  Fresh noodles with tender beef. I had an apple as a side... it wasn't a fresh apple, covered in wax and it had a weird hole in the bottom.  I chose to throw the apple out.   The milk tea was disappointing.   It was just watery, too sweet, and just not good and expensive. I threw it out unfinished.  I can see how this place is popular for studying and a meeting place for students. However, with Chinatown so nearby and ramen places on the street, I'm not sure if I would visit again."}
{"text":"Food is generally very good when I order from here. But my latest order - Taiwanese beef noodle soup was delivered by foodora as a separate container of soup and noodle ....BUT the noodles were hot and stored in a cardboard container which when gets colder, noodles stick to cardboard and pull up pieces of cardboard.   PLEASE FIX THIS CHARIDISE!"}
{"text":"I'm so in love with the space of this place. You pay at the front and find your own table. There is a \"sun room\" on the ground floor and a long couch with opened garage doors ok too. The popcorn chicken is very good and drinks are on point. Price is high though, $40 for lunch which was 2 meal and 2 drinks. Free apple with our meal is a great touch to keep health conscious especially to students in the UofT area. 5 stars! Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Charidise is a plesant place to read and get your work done while enjoying its slightly overpriced bubble tea. I actually dislike bubble tea so I can't comment on whether its bubble tea is better than that of other places, but my girlfriend seems to enjoy it. The servers are quite friendly.   The music here is a bit too random and loud for my taste (Spotify Top 40 playlist with ads) and the temperature can be a hit or miss during the summer.   I like that it's open til late hours. Open space and lots of seats to choose from. I really like their garage doors."}
{"text":"Good food and vibes. It's a great place to grab some food and get some work done. It is a bit pricey so I wouldn't suggest coming often. I ordered the Taiwanese Minced Pork Rice and a Fresh Taro Latte. I really enjoyed the latte! Best I've had."}
{"text":"I've always been a fan of Taiwanese food. Ever since I've known of this place, I always wanted to try it. To be honest, I was very disappointed because it wasn't what I anticipated.  It was pretty much a self-serve concept where you order your own food on a ipad, then there will be a receipt printed out where you have to bring it to the cashier to cash out. You then take a number and seat yourself to wait for your food. They will tell you to pick up your drink at the station next to the cashier when it's ready but food will be served to you at your table. After you finish your meal, you have to dump your own garbage and bring the tray back to the station.  Staffs didn't seem friendly and were rude when taking payment. It almost seem as if they were miserable working there. The only friendly one I've encountered was the one who brought out the food to my table. She was nice and sweet.   Both my friend and I ordered the popcorn chicken with rice ($12.99) and a drink ($5.99). Meals were prepared quickly, it came out within minutes of ordering. It was a nice surprise that our meal came with an apple on the side. Honestly, taste of food was just average for the price that they charged for. I don't think it was worth it on top of the fact that there was really not much customer service involved."}
{"text":"Location: located on Baldwin street pretty close to St. Patrick subway station.  Price: Everything is quite pricey. The coffees are ~$4-5, the smoothies and bubble tea is $5-8, and the meals are $10+. If you get a membership card, you can get 10% off if you pay cash!   Food: Since everything is marginally out of my budget, I've only tried a couple things here. The best is the plum powder sweet potato fries! It's around $6, but quite worth it if you share. The drinks are pretty average and the coffee is quite acidic.   Seating: This is probably the best thing about this place. I always come here to study because they have wall plugs, sketchy wifi (keeps you off Facebook), and a very nice Ed Sheeran + other soothing songs playlist that loops and loops.   Overall: Nice place to study or chat with big and small groups. Food is soso, but can be worth it if you have good company."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best places to study and get work done. The environment is pretty calm and relaxing, though the music is a bit loud but just put on some headphones and you're set!  Food is pretty good, I generally opt for the popcorn chicken rice but their grilled salmon rice is nice as well. Drinks are pretty nice, I've only ever gotten the milk tea, matcha latte and pineapple sparkling but they all tasted pretty good.   Service is good as well. I usually spend about 3 to 4 hours here and I've never had any issues.   Only downsides are that the food and drinks are pricey, otherwise this place is solid! They're open late too which is great!"}
{"text":"Upon entering, you place and pay for your order at the front, then you seat yourself and the servers bring your order to you however the service isn't particularly quick, especially on busier days/times which is something to keep in mind. I've tried quite a few menu options but the popcorn chicken is definitely my favourite, always very flavourful, savoury and crispy! They have a fair selection of entrees and snack items ranging from $9 - $13, their drinks are also good however they are pricey (~$7 for a large).The meat portions are considerable and with a meal you get an apple, rice, an egg, some brussel sprouts and zucchini - all of which make for a pretty filling meal.   Overall, a nice study spot with an abundance of outlets, I found myself here several times throughout the exam season, although be warned that the wifi is super slow despite showing a strong connection. However, I probably wouldn't come here if I didn't intend to stay a while as the menu is on the pricier side for a casual meal."}
{"text":"Taiwanese fast food at non-fast food prices.    My first encounter with Charadise was with their beef curry and popcorn chicken.  The beef curry was delicately presented with nicely charred zucchini and brussel sprouts on a stick and diligently sliced hard boiled egg. It was very favourful and hit the spot.  It also has a nice finishing touch with an apple that comes with the meal. The popcorn chicken, was as expected, hard to miss.  Very satisfying meal.  My second encounter was with their Taiwanese specialty: minced pork on rice (aka. lu rou fan in Chinese).  This dish, although favourful in its own right, was not as great of a deal.  The minced pork did not feel authentic - as it is suppose to be made from braised pork belly that's subsequently mashed to fine tender pieces but felt like this version was just made from ground pork.  A bit disappointed here.   There's a quiet study area in the back area where students go to get work done.  Overall, a great space and convenient location for a quick bite of comfort food, but can probably get better value elsewhere."}
{"text":"This restaurant has a very trendy yet casual feel and is very spacious. Could see this being a nice hangout spot during the summer.   The food itself was good. I got the minced pork on rice and also tried some popcorn chicken. The meal also came with some egg, brussel sprouts and zucchini and, a side of apple? Gotta get a balanced meal I guess. Also tried their milk tea which was really good and tea flavoured yet creamy (kinda like HK tea)"}
{"text":"Nice lunch spot during the work week.  I always get the popcorn chicken meal and a drink.  The bubble teas are good and the popcorn chicken meal is flavorful but sometimes I'm still hungry later.  They give you an apple with your meal.  Prices are a bit on the high side but it's a nice atmosphere and the rooftop patio is nice.  Staff are friendly and it's clean!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for dessert, the only bearable one here is the cheesecake ice cream. Even then its not worth the price. Save your money and go to Kekkou next door for better and cheaper dessert options. Food wise its alright, we had the \"popcorn\"  (its more like bite size than the classic popcorn chicken size) chicken numerous time and its always consistently good. The Taiwanese ground beef is also alright. Marked up prices made it not worth though.  I would advise against getting any drinks other than tap water from this place. The bubble tea was not worth it (they didn't get what half sugar meant).   Onto the good things about Charidise. Good roomy space to study (chat with friends), no one to sit you in so you're free to choose a good spot to sit, free apples for dishes $10+. Me and my friends used to go here to study but recently their wifi has been the shittiest and weak.   tldr: decent comfort food for semi-jacked price, get dessert elsewhere"}
{"text":"Food: I ordered \"Teriyaki Chicken Spaghetti\" and it was delicious. I also got some kind of apple for free which was also delicious.  Environment: The restaurant itself is like a restaurant/cafe and the environment is really relaxed, clean, and warm. I liked it a lot.  The style of the cafe/restaurant is Taiwanese so there's lots of Taiwanese food and drinks available.  I really enjoyed my visit."}
{"text":"The food: Had the Taiwanese beef noodle and it was pretty good after adding salt and hot sauce. It is pricier than other places for the same thing but the soup had depth, beef was tender and there was plenty of beef.   The drink: Had the charidise milk tea. Like others have said, the taste was bland and not comparable to chatime, etc.  Ambiance: Casual but nice. Very comfortable setting. Good for students studying or just hanging out with friends. Many seats."}
{"text":"Would highly recommend if you want great taiwanese food. Service and food were quick and great!"}
{"text":"It was just okay to me. When entering, the vicinity looks like it has an interesting get-up -- meaning, the set up and system is different. Your menu's on the left and then when you order at the counter, you wait upstairs at a table of your choice and a different server somehow knows your dish and brings it to you via tray, accompanied by an apple.   I will say the cons were, having to order water at the counter and wait to have it served to you other than having the server who came originally to bring your food to give it to you. If that made any sense. Anyway, the server said we could get the waters ourselves so my guest had to get up from the table to do so which took quite some time and I found it inconvenient for our meeting as it took some valuable time away.  The upstairs seating overlooks a patio with a petite, cramped booth on the side. I don't know how to describe the decor but it's modern with a hint of retro? There's seating on the main floor as well.   For food, I ordered the cheese chicken spaghetti which was pretty filling and had a heaping portion of spaghetti - needless to say I got full pretty quickly. The taste of my dish was standard and something I could easily make at home. My meal was about $15  Overall I don't think I would come back for the food but wouldn't mind trying their drinks next time."}
{"text":"It is nice place, I enjoyed my popcorn chicken and curry beef spaghetti. I will come back soon with my friends ."}
{"text":"Learned about you guys on Uber Eats. Ordered 4 times already.  Hands down best Asian food. Love the packaging, love the food. Please keep up the amazing quality and never change!"}
{"text":"Environment: 5/5 Drinks: 4/5 Price: 3/5 Service: 3/5  Came here shortly after opening, and was shocked to see how big and nicely decorated this place really is. I can see it being a nice space to study in or just chat with a few friends. They offer a large variety of drinks and Taiwanese dishes which I will be back to try,  but for now, I can only comment on the drinks.   We ordered the Charidise Milk Tea (I'm a sucker for trying signature drinks/food) and the Passion Fruit Aloe Black Tea. Both drinks were excellent,  but I found them to be a bit expensive (around $6+, and if adding tapioca to the milk tea, it was about $6.80 for the smallest size).   I ordered the drinks separately, and it wasn't until my second order as I was about to pay, that I asked if there was a points card. That's when the cashier explained that there was a free membership card that gave 15% off every drink if I paid cash. I was a little disappointed they didn't offer it to me at any point until I asked and forgot to put in the tapioca I ordered, but since they were new, I won't hold it against them.  I will be back to try more and I'm glad that there will now be a place downtown for when I crave Taiwanese food!"}
{"text":"This place has been hyped on my facebook timeline for some time now, so I figured I'd check it out. It's a little overrated in my opinion, but I must say the food is pretty good. I got the crispy chicken poutine (probably not the best choice for a taiwanese restaurant), and my girlfriend got the popcorn chicken rice box. Both were very good, but a tad over priced in my opinion. Both dishes set us back about $27, but both portions were sufficient. I also got the milk tea, which is priced around the same as Chatime and CoCo, but I think the tea is a little better at the other two spots.   I would definitely come back to try more dishes, but it is overrated. Service was also very friendly, operating on a Panera Bread style of service. It would be a great place to study, or finish assignments, but the wifi is a little slow here. Recommend to those who want a chill place to not just eat, but to hang out"}
{"text":"BlogTO did a pretty good video on this restaurant, but this place is not that good and I'm not sure what the hype is all about?? Charidise is pretty scattered, unorganized, and overall, really packed and the service is super slow. I got into this restaurant around 8 on a Saturday night and I was pretty damned confused. I had no idea this was a Panera-style cafe so I waited for a table for a good minute, sat myself down for a good minute before I realized I was not thinking straight.   The line to order was absolutely crazy. It was around 8:30 at this point and there was only ONE cashier doing all the front-end duties. Answering questions, helping out the back, getting people's orders. There were about 20 chefs in the back. I waited in line to order for FIFTEEN minutes, which was absolutely CRAZY because the place was SO FULL. The line went OUTSIDE the door. WHY WASN'T THERE ANOTHER CASHIER?   When I finally got my order in, I had to wait another 20 minutes before all the food came.   Damn. Also, the wifi was slow too. Not sure if this is something to complain about, but if Charidise is a cafe to do work, then you walked into the wrong place.    The food is alright.   My BF and I ordered:  1. Sweet potato plum fries (with plum powder):  Average 2. Curry chicken on rice: Average  3. Minced pork on rice: Pretty good. I liked the boiled eggs.  4. Milk black tea - no ice, half sugar: YAAAS   All the entrees come with an apple so that was pretty nice. (It's not one of those cheap-ass apples. It was large, crunchy and pretty juicy!!!)  I can see why this place is so popular. Nice interior decorations, everyone loves chill/cafe-like zones, especially if you have the money and time for afford such luxuries.    Although I really liked the bubble tea, the food is quite pricy. The whole restaurant is very expensive, but out of all the \"Taiwanese cafes\" Toronto has to offer, I do think this is the best one. Their menu is also strange though. What are pasta and burger dishes doing in a Taiwanese cafe?   I wouldn't come again unless someone asked me to.   TLDR; Come for bubble tea if you can afford $4.99 bubble tea. Else, there's no point unless you're just bored and having nothing but time and money to spend."}
{"text":"This place is HUGE! A really comfy place to chill, study, eat, drink, with lots of lounge space and beautiful decor..one of the nicest tearooms I've been to! Though I can only speak to their popcorn chicken rice for food, I think it was quite good. Presentation was nice, portion was larger than expected, and the chicken (which came with egg, broccoli and roasted brussel sprouts) was tasty. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This Taiwanese cafe offers typical options you'd normally find at places like these: bubble tea, rice dishes, snacks, etc. Part of the charm of this place is the modern yet cozy atmosphere. The place is large, boasting a ton of tables and seating (with lots of outlets as well). The large windows allows natural light to flow in, creating an open and comfortable environment.  Since this place opened, I've been here many times and have always found the food to be consistent and tasty. My go-to dish is the popcorn chicken rice, which comes with a zucchini skewer, a brussel sprout skewer, a cold sliced egg, and an apple. I've always found the proportions to be very good compared to the price. I never manage to finish the bowl because it's layered with a lot of rice and absolutely LOADED with meat. The curry chicken rice is also tasty, though the curry itself is just standard (nothing as memorable as Kaiju or even Gyugyuya).   However, while the food items are solid, the drinks are really meh. The bubble tea is super sweet and after trying several options, I haven't found one that has made me go \"wow.\" The taro milk tea is nothing to write home about and the honeydew if passable. The honey milk black tea is one of the better options, as the rich taste of the honey goes well with the black tea. It's still nothing to go out of your way to get though.  Overall, Charidise isn't where I go to get bubble tea - it's where I go for simple comfort food. I'd rate the food a solid 4/5 but the bubble tea gets a 2.5/5 from me. Side note: They offer a loyalty card which gives you a discount off of your order. Our order of 2 regular bubble tea drinks and 2 rice dishes saved over $5."}
{"text":"First time there, and it was surprisingly good! We did takeout and the food wasn't soggy when we got home. The pork rice and beef noodle were my favourite."}
{"text":"Was so glad to find this place open at 11:30 at night for my group of friends. We desperately needed a place to chill and hang out in the early spring winds and Charidise didn't fail with these late night hours!  Upon walking in you have the cashier and kitchen to your left, if you keep walking straight you can walk upstairs to the upper floor, and to your right are an abundancy of seats on high chairs and wall booths.  I personally found the menu is quite pricey for its selection of fine tea and beverages selection and food but moreso the drinks than the food.   The drinks were at least 6 dollars each whether it was tea, bubble tea, and flavouredin house made sparkling beverages (itallian soda you could say) and then additional for toppings which when i asked if I could have one of the bubbles, they were out!!! I was kind of bummed but oh well maybe next time (?)  I ordered a pineapple soda which was made itallian style with the jam at the bottom and soda poured on top so to future drinkers. PLEASE SHAKE THE CUP BEFORE YOU OPEN otherwise you get a whole lot of pineapple/jammy goodness at the bottom and then all that carbonated water at the top. My friends ordered a hot matcha latte and both said were good, I'll take their word for it.  The food always comes with a side of an apple, banana, bag of chips as I've read on Yelp but I wasn't offered that option when I ordered and was pretty surprised at first as to why I even had an apple on my tray in the first place??? Welp good to know after the visit.  The popcorn chicken I ordered which I specified that I only wanted the popcorn chicken and not the rice that comes with it (cashier didnt hear me I guess?) but I got it anyways. It came with a nicely sliced egg and some sauce for both the egg and one on the side. Me and my friend found the popcorn chicken quite salty so we were glad the miscommunication during ordering gave us rice. Without the rice I would've chugged the whole soda I had in an instant.   On that note the rice is PERFECT HERE omg I would live in their kitchen and just eat only their rice if I could.  Overall, the location is pretty lit when it comes to layout and flooring of the entirety of the store but the food after a while would just be subpar for me. Thanks for having me though!"}
{"text":"Very delicious Taiwanese mince pork rice. And the spaghetti was made on point and super cheesy, but the chicken was dry. Thought, the popcorn chicken was delicious. And the foods were all in big portions. Their bubble tea was okay, but not as good as Coco and Sharetea. Price is moderate-high. The restaurant has a second floor, and has more spots then ordinary bubble tea places. Strongly recommended for people who are looking for a place to study or chill."}
{"text":"I love to study at this place. It's a great place to study if you don't want to go to the library or stay home I usually stay here the whole day to study and there's meals and snacks I can order thoughout the day It may be a little pricey but it's worth the price if you plan to work or study here for half or full day  The popcorn chicken is really good and rice dishes are all decent The drinks are standard and the staff are generally nice and don't bother you  5 stars because the food doesn't disappoint and it's a good place to get some studying done"}
{"text":"This is my happy place! The service here isn't the fastest, but you can tell they put a lot of effort into their food and drinks. If you dine in, they'll give you a tracker and personally deliver your drinks and food to you.  Prices here are steep for drinks but the food is quite reasonably priced. I ordered the minced pork rice and Charidise milk tea. Was pretty impressed by the authentic taste! I liked that the rice was really chewy and the apple that came with the meal was a nice touch. They should provide the apple as an add on, as I noticed a lot of uneaten apples go to waste.   Come here to catch up with friends, get a good study session in, or to try out some Taiwanese food!"}
{"text":"Disgusting dessert! Why don't they use their heart too cook? I think dessert are made by staff not the chief. It is really bad and awfully sweet. Do not order the sago and sundae!   Kind of disgusted right now and feel dehydrated!"}
{"text":"Overall great feel. Food was good. Had the minced pork on rice, squid balls, popcorn chicken and calamari. Pretty disappointed that they don't have the Taiwanese friend chicken anymore."}
{"text":"I really like the ambiance here. It's nice and spacious, even better if you can grab a table by the windows looking out onto Baldwin St. The food is alright with decent portion size. The drinks, however, are quite disappointing. There's very little tea flavour and they try to compensate with sugar even when you ask for less sugar. Prices are definitely a bit steep compared to other Taiwanese restaurants, but it's not too bad if you're looking for a place to enjoy a relaxing meal."}
{"text":"Came to Charidise around 8:30, and noticed a big sign outside offering 50% off on drinks with purchase of honey toast, waffle, or snack from 8:30 to closing. Went in.  Haven't been here since their grand opening back in January, so it was nice to see that their self-serve machine have been implemented and are working. If you're the shy type or like to take your time deciding what to order, head to one of the four self-serve machines set up near the menu. Not sure if they accept cards or not because I still had my VIP card from back then for a 15% discount on cash purchase.  The menu has also changed a bit, with more items to choose from. I think the bubbleteas used to be around $7 for a large (I should've written how much I paid for it back then, instead of just \"1 or 2 dollars more\"), but now they start at $5 for a basic milk tea, which I think is much better (competitive prices vs the other options nearby like CoCo or 168)  I ordered the charidise milk tea, half sugar and no ice, with tapioca on top. It was still somewhat sweet, so maybe quarter sugar would be better. The tapioca was very chewy, very firm. Definitely superior in quality to that of chatime and CoCo that I had in the past week. Haven't tried any of the other toppings but the tapioca is a must-add.  The area enclosed in glass at the back had extremely powerful air-conditioning going. It was like walking into a fridge, which was very welcome given that it felt like 30 C outside. Their marble table definitely felt ice cold and awesome. Definitely the best place to be if you're looking to escape the heat. Hopefully they will keep this area the freezer throughout the summer, and make it a sauna during the colder season."}
{"text":"Food: Would recommend fried chicken pasta for its portion and taste (altho not as crispy). I do not recommend the shrimp pasta: shrimp is great but pasta was lacking taste and comes in extremely small portion.  Still hungry with that and two apples.  Service: Servers yelling orders out loud, so loud that you can hear no matter where you sit. Waited for one order for 15 mins, the other for 20 mins (both pasta). Servers run up and down the stairs making you wanna tip them so bad.   Space: Has plenty of tables for 4 people (WITH WALL PLUG). Went at 9pm so not sure about rush hours."}
{"text":"Horrible food. You order at the counter and you can take your food anywhere to eat. The place is beautifully designed but the food is horrible. Taste like frozen stuff you buy and they just deep fry it. I don't think the people cooking actually has cooking experience , nor I think there is an actual chef. The service is made up of a lot of very very timid girls that is hard to hear. They give you an apple with your meal, but the quality of the apple is is not edible. Would not recommend. Would not go back."}
{"text":"I didn't know this place existed till I saw a blog TO video that was highlighting this restaurant. Having had a craving for Taiwanese style snacks and food for a while I knew I had to try this place out on my most recent visit back to Toronto.   Servers and staff were friendly and very helpful. The store looks very well designed and had a clean look to it as well. It was also well lit which made the atmosphere very warm and welcoming. There is ample seating for groups of various sizes.  After we had ordered it felt a bit like a cafeteria with seat yourself service. Location trackers were given to help servers to bring food to your table which was a nice touch. I had ordered the Taiwanese minced meat with rice dish and a side red bean shake. It was served with an apple on the side which was an interesting addition. The minced meat was good but it didn't have the same sort of taste as more authentic Taiwanese minced meat as theirs was a bit too saucy for my liking. Mostly because the sauce for it was sort of thick and heavy. I found the red bean shake was standard, it didn't taste powdery as I have found it to be that way at some other establishments. We also ordered some popcorn chicken for the group to share and this was as good as it gets, it had a good crunch and the chicken didn't taste too dry nor was it over seasoned.  Overall I gave it 4 stars because it was a solid restaurant but it didn't wow me. I would go here again without question because it really is comfort food for me."}
{"text":"Amazing new spot at Baldwin street along with a big spacious eating area. I ordered the popcorn chicken and minced pork as well as a snack Taiwanese sausage. Apparently if u go late night (after 10 pm) and order a dish you get half price if you order a snack along with it. Hence the sausage we chose to order as well.   The place is well lit, great for instagrammer goers if you like the aesthetics food and loungey feel to a place. It's got two floors and plugs everywhere prime place to study and it closes late 12 at night.  Of course there is wifi! :)   The food came at a reasonable time and it comes with a table tracker so you seat wherever and the server will come to you. But the drinks you go and get yourself upfront.   P.s. Get the hazelnut ferrero rocher drink even the lady who put in my order was like it's amazing! Which it is! It's not too sweet which was great cause I hate overly sweetened stuff."}
{"text":"Huzzah, I was back yet again for their grand opening BOGO drinks and this time, I tried their food!  Super condensed summary ahead: 1) Consensus from 4 drinks tells me that their bbt is just really sweet (even when 30% sugar!) Would recommend passionfruit aloe lime; would not recommend hazelnut milk tea (wasn't mixed well which led to coagulated chunky bits floating around in my drink) 2) Takoyaki is a must get, piping hot deliciousness with large chunks of octopus 3) Popcorn chicken is also pretty great, the meat is firm and the seasoned batter is addicting (tastes almost like Hot Star chicken except in smaller pieces and boneless)  4) NewZland lamb chop spaghetti, the most costly item on their menu, just barely made it over the thumbs up threshold. The lamb was seasoned well, juicy, and there were two pieces (3 bones). However, be aware that the spaghetti is more catered to Asian cuisine in which it is softer than al dente and is not embedded with the rich, strong flavours of Western spaghetti. It tasted a bit bland at first, but left a distinct aftertaste.   Overall, the concept is great, the interior is snazzy and cozy (especially upstairs!), and the food is palatable - the only caveat is that the price point is a bit high. Not sure I would come back solely for their $7 bubble tea, compared to other large franchises, but I would definitely bring friends here if we needed a place to hang out and talk over some snacks/food/bbt!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is very spacious with a modern design.  Great selection of food, drinks and desserts. I had their Charidise milk tea, Taiwanese popcorn chicken and takoyaki."}
{"text":"A menu with a very diverse selection of interesting items. (too many to mention in a review)  A clean modern interior with lots of space.  Great food at great prices.  I got to try the beef noodle and the minced pork(classics) and they both were the best I have ever had in the city.   Baldwin Street is becoming such an interesting place to visit, and this is one of the must visit joints."}
{"text":"Located on baldwin street close to artic bites and the original kekou location. Space itself is massive with alot of seating area and an outdoor (covered) patio area and upstairs. The ordering system is quite straightforward.. you take a menu, place your order at cashier and you get a buzzer number. Similar to what other reviews are saying, if you ordered a drink, definitely stand close to the front as it is difficult to hear your number being called for your drink if you're sitting upstairs or at the back... but besides that, your food comes served directly to you. (They have a system where the buzzer will indicate which table you are sitting at in their system.. very similar to pannera)  we opted for the minced pork rice combo and the popcorn chicken combo. Both our dishes came with rice at the bottom, a skewer of zucchini, a coupe Brussels sprouts and a hard boiled egg with some teriyaki sauce over it. The minced pork and popcorn chicken was both very generous in portion size and one little \"bento box\" can definitely fill you up! Price wise, if you're looking at getting a drink as well you are looking at paying $20 a person. It's not SUPER cheap but its quick and great if you have a taiwanese food craving! Service was also super friendly and servers are definitely there to help as needed.  Just a little FYI - full of uoft students so it does feel as if you're eating at a cafeteria of a school... lol"}
{"text":"3.5 stars  The place has such a nice ambiance to it, perfect for studying, dates and just hanging out with friends. There's more seating upstairs and I believe they're renovating the patio so I'm sure it'll be even better once it's done.  The food on the other hand is honestly just alright. Nothing blows me away. I had their minced pork rice and it was okay, a bit on the salty side."}
{"text":"Great student hangout, if you happen to have money to spend. Charidise is located at the prime up and coming area on Baldwin. Easily distinguishable by its bright and modern store front. The restaurant is huge by any standard and beautifully decorated. They run a tight operation, customers order at the front, drinks are picked up on the side of the front counter, food orders are deliver to table side using locator coasters to pin point your location... (another word, once you've ordered, go and place the coaster onto a table you plan to sit at then go back to wait for a drinks...otherwise you might cause mass hysteria and kink in the service - Happened to a friend of mine. Definitely NOT me...so sorry again).     Walking in, the restaurant is modern, clean, and bright. It is a massive space for if you want to hangout, chill, or even the dreaded studying. Service is fast and very friendly. Wait staff zooms by with food service at a constant pace. There are space upstairs as well as deep within the restaurant bough. We visited at around dinner time on a Wednesday evening, it was not too crowded. Although there were several items on the menu that was exed and unavailable, which was a bit disappointing.   Prices there are quite a bit higher than what you would expect to pay at a snack place. Although if you see the space and the amazing packaging, the price is kind of understood. Portions are good and will fill you up. My boyfriend ordered the veg curried spaghetti and a regular Logan Dragon eye tea; the bill came out to about $21. The noodle was softer than how I would usually preferred, and the curry sauce is a bit runny and bland. The veggies had an array of level of doneness that was all together, not that appealing. Served with a deliciously sweet whole apple for an after meal pallet cleanser. However, the tea was the bomb. It was prefect in every way (except price) but I would definitely go back for that taste of heaven.  I ordered the an order an order of popcorn chicken served with plum sauce, a Taiwanese mince pork with rice, and an iced Charidise black milk tea; came out to about $31. Although expensive, the chicken portion was decent. Probably one of the best popcorn chicken I've had in recent memory-A DEFINITE MUST HAVE. Bite-sized pieces, perfectly seasoned, and fried to a crisp. They paired it with a plum sauce that had citrusy notes that was quite a nice contrast. The fried basil leaves garnish gave a nice pop of colour and interesting flavour. I'd go back just for that. The minced pork dish was good too (too expensive for what it is), however, flavours were there. The bed of rice was nice cooked, fluffy yet not mushy. The milk tea was average and pretty standard.   Overall, a lovely place to spend a date, an evening, or a study session. I'm hoping to come back every now and then. I would recommend this to everyone that wants to experience a Taiwanese snack bar."}
{"text":"I knew about this place from blogTO and came in with really high expectations. The ambience is busy but nice for sitting and chatting with friends. Wait time for my food was 40 minutes and i only ordered popcorn chicken. A little pricey for taiwanese food as i spent $20 for popcorn chicken and a mixed fruit tea.  Food was good but not worth 40 minutes. Fruit tea didn't have ice and when i requested for some the waitress said they didn't have any."}
{"text":"Very good! Nice atmosphere and I love the self sevice. Only thing is that it's pretty pricey...$20 per person. I loved the vibe and food was pretty good. I got the beef teriyaki and portions were big. Bubble tea was good and tasted similar to chatime. I would def come back!"}
{"text":"Connected with wifi but the wifi basically not functioning. Nice environment with slightly over priced drinks. Came here twice and they missed my order every time...but they have very clean and comfortable washrooms."}
{"text":"A disappointment. I could try and overlook the 35 minutes wait for the food to arrive and the abysmal service given that this is a new restaurant, but it is harder for me to forgive the extra soggy rice. Both minced pork and beef noodle soup sampled were sweeter than they should be, the latter lacking spice and flavour. Egg should have been marinated - though that might have been asking it to be too authentic. Decent popcorn chicken, and veggie garnishes were tasty. Overall would not come back for the flavours nor the service."}
{"text":"I loved this restaurant. I bought the ginger milk.. it was made really well, lots of ginger with raisins. Loved the sitting area too. Nice place to just chill! Maybe I will be back to try one of their meals."}
{"text":"The food and service at Charidise is fairly average. I ordered the chicken teriyaki bowl and my friend got the salmon bowl. Nothing too fancy, but good enough. Our meals came with Doritos chips, which felt sort of out of place.   Charidise is... odd. Weird. Quirky, I guess? It has a lot of room and feels more like a weird mix between a diner and a coffee shop than a restaurant. (Maybe that's the vibe they're going for???) You walk in, order your food at the counter, and go find a seat. The cashier gives you this pager/tracker device (woohoo modern~~~) and the food gets delivered to you. The water is all served in plastic cups (the same one they use for the bubble teas) and contains fruit. They use bamboo (I think) bowls that seem to get thrown out after each use.   Despite its weirdness, I think that Charidise belongs on Baldwin Street. Surrounded by all these fancy schmancy busy restaurants, it's nice to know that there's a not-too-shabby restaurant nearby that you can go (and have the room!!!) to hang out with your friends. Charidise is spacious (so much room!!!!) , its menu has enough variety to please everyone, oh and did I already mention how much room there is?"}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good. I ordered the beef noodle soup and salmon rice here before.  While the space is new and contemporary, it is inaccessible. There are steps to enter the restaurant and doors have no push buttons. Inside there are stairs to get to the second floor for more seating and washrooms. There are washrooms on the first floor in the back of the restaurant, but the first floor also has steps throughout.   Also, the restaurant needs to improve on their environmentality, since all food is served in one-time use disposable paper bowls with plastic utensils, even when dining in. At the end of meal you are supposed to dispose of your own tray (there are actually no instructions on this anywhere in the restaurant). And while each trash station has multiple bins, they do not have different ones for recycle, compost and trash.   Service here is poor. When you order food, they pass you a buzzer/tracker, but don't give you further instructions. And when I was at my table, I asked for water when the server came over with my food, but she told me I had to go up to the cashier to ask for water. I guess they are only runners, not waitresses? So pretty much everything here is self-serve like a cafeteria, except they bring you the food.   Overall, food here is good, but I wish the service was better. Also, I hoped a new and spacious \"restaurant\" like this would be more accessible and adhere to AODA standards."}
{"text":"Came by to find food after hanging out around downtown. As I am not one that ventures to this part of downtown a lot, so I decided to try this place out. The interior is very modern and clean. When I got into the entrance, there are 4 tablets for ordering. I have to say, the user interface wasn't too intuitive. Took some time and I finally figured out. After I place my order, I went to the cashier to pay for my order and I was given a pager. Not long after my drink and food came.   The drink tasted not bad and not overly sweet. The food I ordered was the teriyaki chicken on spaghetti. The spaghetti wasn't bad? I wish it was bit more on the al dente side. The chicken was made nicely, however I was expecting a teriyaki sauce. (given the name teriyaki chicken, or maybe I have been to too many Asian places that dumps a lot of \"sauce\" onto the chicken. haha!)   Anyhow, this place is a good hangout as they got a sun room that's quite cool. Also the front opens up to Baldwin St, so nice and breezy day like this is spot on."}
{"text":"I can't count how many times I've been here now, but it always just takes one or two experiences to bring it down, doesn't it?   When it comes to Taiwanese food, it's good enough... and that's okay. However, what's not are specific employees that should improve their service. What do I mean? That's a great question reader.   I was standing in front of a cashier to order a meal. There's no one else, but she didn't bother looking up or acknowledging me in any way. So I spent the money for dinner elsewhere. The only thing I got today was a drink for 5 bucks - not bad for spending 7 or 8 hours at a place.   Take my money! No? Alright. Take a review instead.   The only reason it gets 2 is because it's a great place to work and however mediocre, any Taiwanese cuisine is welcome in the city. Also, other employees are just great. I recommend this place and wish I could give it a higher rating, but I can't."}
{"text":"I decided to go here based on an Instagram post by tastetoronto. What drew me to this place is the presentation of the entrees. It comes in a container that reminds me of those bamboo dim sum containers.   The cafe has two floors with ample seating. When I arrived (at 3pm on Sunday), there were about three-four people in line waiting to order and the place seemed 75% full so we decided to grab seats first. This place seems to be popular with students, I noticed all around me there were people with laptops and textbooks out.   If you order food for dine in, you are given a tracker for the servers to bring the food to you. We ordered popcorn chicken with rice ($13), spaghetti with lamb ($16), and Taiwanese sausage ($7). As others have mentioned previously, included in the entree is a snack, you can chose an apple, banana, or chips. The spaghetti was decent, it reminds me of rose pasta. I would have preferred a little bit more sauce. The lamb rack on the other hand, was delicious. The herbs used to season the lamb perfectly complimented the meat. The popcorn chicken had the right amount of seasoning, wasn't salty and was perfectly crispy. The Taiwanese sausage was fried or something because it was crispy as well. I also liked that it wasn't greasy like how some other places make it.   This place is a nice spot to hang out with friends, study, and enjoy a meal. I'd definitely recommend this place and will be coming back the next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"A little on the pricey side for bubble tea and other Taiwanese food. But still tasty and a great place to catch up with friends or study. It's a nice change from studying at coffee shops all the time, but definitely a better study environment than typical bubbletea chains. The food is also tasty and filling, although more expensive than I would value it at.   The wide seating option, free wifi, and number of outlets make it a great option for students or anyone hoping to get some work done over some Taiwanese food."}
{"text":"A few issues: 1) Wifi is unstable/slow. It was so bad that I had to tether data from my phone.  2) Half of the outlets don't work, namely the ones at the far back on the 1st floor and the ones near the sunny place on the 2nd floor.  Pro-tip: don't get the spaghetti. Stick with the rice - it goes better w/ the meats."}
{"text":"Came on grand opening near closing time. They were doing 2-for-1 special, but they ran out of some products like Yogurt and Slush. Shared the special with a friend and we got a Honeydew Milk Tea with Tapioca for myself and a hot Charidise Milk Tea for my friend. We also got a loyalty card, which gives us 15% off on our purchase when paying cash only. The drink tasted the same as everywhere else since it's just powder drink. However, what stands out was the tapioca. It was really chewy, which makes it fun to drink it. The environment was good for people to hang out or study. Lot of tables and spaces are spread out so it doesn't feel noisy."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch, and was a bit confused by the layout of this place. We ordered on the tablet screens it spits out a receipt and then we go to the cashier to pay. But first automatically we both go to the cashier and she tells us that we need to order over there with the tablets.  This is definitely a pricier place - I ordered a bubble tea and a rice dish and it came to around 20 ish dollars?   Overall, the food was good but not enough to charge that kind of pricing for it. I don't really care much for the order yourself and pay with someone method. I might as well just pay with the machine instead of walking back n forth for order and pay. Most likely won't be back, there are way more affordable Taiwanese places out there."}
{"text":"I wanted cheese cake... They said they didn't have cheese cake because the kitchen's closed, even though the cheese cake was sitting in front of me.  Good thing they can still fry my chicken and serve my friend CHEESE CAKE sundae."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant, tasty food.  Had the mince beef rice which was really flavourful.  The popcorn chicken had a good flavour and the beef noodle soup was aromatic.  I would come back."}
{"text":"Hubby and I were looking for a place to eat near hospital row and found this place. I was immediately impressed with the clean spacious interior and the tablet ordering stations when we walked in.   We ordered ground pork over rice and beef teriyaki over rice. Our orders were filled quickly and served hot in nice round cardboard containers. Each of our meals were served with fresh fruit (apples), as well as a sliced hardboiled egg, roasted Brussels sprouts and a mini skewer of grilled zucchini.   It surprised both hubby and I that our meals and 2 regular sized drinks (hot ginger tea and iced Charidise milk black tea) came to $40! The premium food and premium packaging probably account for the higher than normal prices for similar Taiwanese or Japanese cuisine elsewhere. Ok...so they do have nice sturdy wide-bottomed cardboard bags for takeaway of leftovers or for Ritual pickup orders. And they have lots of seating and a cool electric fireplace feature towards the back of the restaurant. It's a cool space to hang out with friends or possibly to study. I just wish the food was less pricey. Nonetheless I would probably return to eat here again because I appreciate the look and feel of the restaurant, the serving size of food was pretty generous relative to the price (I only managed to eat half of my meal), and the food was good."}
{"text":"A fairly new café located on the popular Baldwin street. From the outside, it doesn't look that big but you go inside, it's quite huge being 2 floors and lots of table seating. The menu has an extensive selection of food and drink items. Basically you order at the front and pay at the same time and you get a buzzer for your order and the food is brought to your table. I ordered the Mango Yogurt drink with Tapioca and the Popcorn Chicken with Rice. The food came out pretty quickly. I'm a little bias about popcorn chicken so I always love it if it's made right, it's good. This one was delicious, nice and hot and the batter was made right. It's a decent dish to order at about $10.95. You also get a brussel sprouts and cucumber skewer along with sliced eggs with your dish. Overall, it was a decent dish and I enjoyed it. The mango yogurt was decent and it wasn't too sweet. A very nice place to simply hangout, have a light meal or even study if you are a student. There is usually an abundance of tables and seating but it does get busy later in the day. I would definitely come back and try their other menu items."}
{"text":"Living 2 minutes away from Charidise, I watched as the store prepped for its opening and simply couldn't way for the day it opened! Naturally, I can here for their grand opening (during which they had a BOGO deal on drinks) and ordered a charidise milk tea in hot with 30% sugar and a Likeaget6ix (which is essentially green tea with apple syrup and apple jelly) with 30% sugar and less ice.   I hated the apple drink, it look and tasted very artificial as if half the drink was composed of apple syrup. There was also way too much apple jelly (think of coconut jelly but soaked in apple syrup) and even 30% was still too sweet to my liking (maybe because of the ton of apple syrup).   The charidise milk tea was too milky in a bad way to my taste, it tasted as if a ton of milk powder/creamer was added to the tea. It would be nice if they had an option to have fresh milk instead of powder.   The environment is really nice, large and tastefully decorated with lots of tables and space as well as a patio overseeing downtown toronto. Unfortunately, a good number of tables were full of empty drinks and despite the large amount of servers employed, no one bothered to clean up the tables...   Giving the food/drinks 2 stars but +1 for the nice space perfect for studying/doing work/hanging out with friends!"}
{"text":"LOVE the layout and the interior. It has an industrial upscale chic vibe with high ceilings + home-y elements. The venue is on trend and is very insta-worthy. This place would be great for a date or even for studying because there are lots of comfy sofas and tables. Visually, it's definitely a 4 star café but the food and drinks were below average (2 star)."}
{"text":"I see a lot of reviews saying that this place is relatively expensive, but I think the prices are reasonable. I ordered a chicken curry rice and it was 12.99. It came with rice, chicken, brussel sprouts, cucumber skewer, an egg, curry, and an apple on the side. The portions are far from stingy too.  The chicken katsu was not dry, and all the other sides were cooked perfectly. The curry was seasoned to the way i like it, not too salty and not too bland. It mixed perfectly with the rice.  Please note that if you order a drink with ur meal, you have to pick up ur drink first and bring the tracker to your table after. The waiter will bring your food to your table afterwards."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was very nice. They have an innovative ordering system that has you order at the front of the store. However, their food isn't especially superb, and those without strong digestive systems may want to steer clear of their food (as confirmed twice by myself and once by a friend). I've also tried their bubble tea on a separate occasion. Not bad but again not too special.  Come for the atmosphere and study space - not the food."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere but food and drink are not good at all,  great for friend hangouts tho"}
{"text":"I love popcorn chicken. This place, does it well. It hits the spot for me for popcorn chicken.  The vibe is a casual order first, sit down with your laptop, we'll bring you the food type of place.  I love how they seem to only use paper containers for all their food. Seems environmentally friendly.  The beef noodle soup, tastes pretty good. The fried octopus had veggies, don't be fooled. You'll find stuff looked okra in there! The only thing is, it's really a big expensive for what you get.. It's not expensive, just the same stuff is cheaper elsewhere.  It's still pretty decent, tastes good, fast enough, and nobody bothers you."}
{"text":"Limited Fruit Slush and Milk Tea selection. The lid of the cup was a normal lid and not plastic wrap that you poke the straw through. Speaking of which, all of the straws were the same colour! Can one call this place a real bubble tea establishment?   The taro milk tea was superb.  3 stars"}
{"text":"This place offers reasonably priced Taiwanese staples. I had the popcorn chicken on rice, beef noodle soup, minced pork rice, and boba.  The chicken is done right, with all the spices, tenderness and flavour; a good snack (forego the rice) between two people. The beef noodle soup was nothing special, but a cold day, this might be an excellent option. The minced pork on rice tasted great but the rice to meat sauce ratio could be better balanced. The boba had good tea flavour but nothing to go out of the way for.  For a relatively cheap meal (under $15 with a drink), I can see this as a good spot to work & eat, or casually catch up over snacks and a drink."}
{"text":"The food is really good and well-presented. I've eaten here three times and it's been delicious and ample. However the wait times are totally unacceptable. On the second occasion, my friend and I waited over 30 minutes for our takeout order, which was simply two of the curry chicken rice dishes. There was a lot of confusion amongst the staff, some harshly-worded exchanges between them, and the guy who took our order kept coming over to apologize...but not to offer any kind of restitution. A new place like this, at a minimum I'd expect a coupon for 10% off next time. No matter, I'm generous of spirit, I went back the very next day, figuring lightning couldn't strike twice. I was wrong. Two burgers to go, again handed to me at almost exactly the 30 minute mark after ordering. Place was not busy, if there was a lunch rush it had already passed. Lots of people busy in the kitchen. I would go back if I could trust that I wouldn't spend my entire lunch break waiting for my food, but at this point I'll have to wait to see better reviews before I give them a fourth try."}
{"text":"Sampled some of the Taiwanese food (snacks) and beverages at this spacious eatery on Baldwin. They were all delicious! It's also a great place for small or large groups to hang out. Will definitely come back soon."}
{"text":"Decent spot to chill but the food here is mediocre at best. The desserts are alright and are the only thing worth ordering. Good selection of both desserts and entrees. Nice decor inside."}
{"text":"I've been on a journey of finding restaurants in and around the GTA where I can bring friends, and loved ones to really enjoy the moment.  So a place with great atmosphere is a must!  Charidise manages great food, very personable service, AND AMAZING VIEWS!  I really enjoyed the presentation of this store, from how you order, to the vibe inside, and the patio above that let's you have an unobstructed view to the CN Tower is absolutely stunning!  The popcorn chicken was caringly made, they didn't overcook the batter, and the meat inside remains juice.  The bubble tea we got actually has flavour of tea inside, so kudos on that too!   The patio, food, service makes for an amazing combination and left an impression on me and my friend that afternoon.  We will be back, and with more friends, we're ready to vouch for this place when we are looking for a great place to hang out."}
{"text":"I got the Taiwanese beef noodle and it was very okay... Was definitely expecting better quality food after all the hype but it is just meh"}
{"text":"This will probably be my go to place for popcorn chicken. The chicken itself was not dry and not caked with batter. Of course, you cannot compare the popcorn chicken here to the authentic Taiwanese popcorn chicken you find in Taiwan.  Upon entering you are presented with order screens where you simply place your order, a slip prints out and you take it to the cashier for payment. After you are handed your receipt along with a pager tracker that you place at your table. Note: be sure to wait for your drink as they do not bring it to you. When the food is ready, your pager tracker will vibrate and before you know it, a staff member is on their way with your food! Remember to clear your table/trays when you are leaving.   Plenty of tables and room for students to study. There is a second floor (was not open when I went), assuming that when exam season rolls around they may open it to accommodate more students.   I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"I'm a fan - because this restaurant really spoke to me. It has everything I need in a Taiwanese cafe/restaurant:  - ample seating space: for a private date, eating with a large group, or studying quietly by myself  - the aesthetics are welcoming, instead of being overly pretentious and fancy just for the sake of instagram - the interior designer has good taste and those windows...man if I had the money, I'd hire these people to design my house. Of course it helps that it's in a beautiful neighborhood with just the right vibes and tree-lined streets  - the food is consistently good. I wouldn't say it's anything special but everything is yummy and good for the price. Nothing is ever under/over-cooked. Drinks are refreshing, fried chicken tastes authentically Taiwanese (which is to say crispy and savory), and even the rice texture and salty marinated eggs have the same taste every time  - service is just right, of course for the price I don't expect 5-star service. A lot of it was DIY - like when I asked the cashier for salad dressing and she pointed me to the kitchen, where a smiling chef literally poured me a small container of sauce. It was efficient and even better than if I had to wait at my table, call for service, and wait for this dressing to be delivered.  The only place where it lost a star was because the restaurant was missing some \"wow\" factor on the menu. Maybe some seasonal menu like they usually have in Asia? Or some rotating \"chef's special\" combos? I feel like this place would be great to host events too - it has the perfect amount of tables and an outdoor patio on the second floor with a great view. So maybe some collab with another dessert shop - or even its neighbors, would really make this place stand out. If they can hire a good chef to bring some elements of surprise, I'd definitely come back more often."}
{"text":"The staff and service was exceptional. They checked in often to make sure the food was okay. =) The decor/ambiance was great too. There's lots of space in the back and upstairs so I think it'd be a great place to catch up with friends or to get together with a large group of coworkers.   Ordered the jumbo shrimp spaghetti and got the buy 1 get 1 free bubble tea deal. Looking forward to going back in the future!"}
{"text":"Two words: popcorn chicken. To be frank, I haven't been to a place with BAD popcorn chicken, but if you're craving the best - I dare say, this is it. The food is good in terms of portions and taste but I can't say it really has a *sparkle*.  I came here twice, once at lunch and once for dinner. At lunch it's really beautiful, the sun just shines through the windows while eating and chewing your tapioca. Dinner is a bit more busy where people are catching up or attempting to study.   Charidise seems like a place that would be just right to get some work done or to just simply catch up with old friends. An improvement would be to really get better WiFi - it SEEMS like a great place to study but the connection is basically nonexistent.   Popcorn Chicken Rice ($16) - just the right portion and nothing to complain about.   Fried Calamari ($10) - great snacking food, almost would of been better with beer than with bubble tea. Almost.   Bubble tea ($5) - actually not too bad if I was craving it right then and there. Not the best, but not rhw worst.   Overall, I might come back again if around the area. It would be great for a larger group if we wanted to catch up or celebrate casually. Otherwise, there's so many other places I could go on Baldwin, Kensington or around the area for a more unique, satisfying dining experience."}
{"text":"Came in here at 10pm, there were people in the place and kitchen had several staff.  There was no one waiting when we ordered.  This is what we got  Strawberry yogurt drink Lamb chops spaghetti Chicken cheese spaghetti (asked for light sauce and saw it punched in as light sauce) (Shrimp spaghetti sold out)  The girl at the cash kept saying \"huh\" everytime we asked a question.  I'll chalk it up to fluency in language.    We were given a buzzer and nothing was said to us.  We assumed we grab a seat and food is brought to us.  We went upstairs to sit down and wait...and wait...  Waiting.....20 minutes later i went downstairs to ask what happened to our order.  Were we supposed to wait downstairs?  No, i was told to just wait...  25 minutes later...we wonder where our drink is.  I go downstairs to inquire and was told i was supposed to pick up the drink downstairs.  Well, no one told me even though they saw us go up (it wasnt busy)...  She asked about our drink and we were told it'd be ready with the food.  30 minutes later...i go down and ask, whats happening with our food?  Place is not busy and there are a few people in the back...  I'm told it'll be 5 minutes...10 mins later, i go down and ask again.  The girl checks and she says its coming...  The food was good.  Both meals came with an apple, mine had a small hole but it wasnt worth changing.  We'd like to go back but i hate to think what the wait is during lunch time. 30+ min wait when theres no one, cant imagine how long if its busy.  Note: several items on the menu are not available anymore. Wtf"}
{"text":"Went to this place today. Nice decor. Very spacious. 2 floors. Ordered a LikeaGe6ix (green apple green tea with green apple jelly). Was ok ... tasted like jasmine tea with green apple flavoring (I would say it's typical of most places I've been to where I ordered a flavored green tea drink)."}
{"text":"Food was bland. Had the Salmon spaghetti? Literally was spaghetti in a bland watery cream sauce with salmon teriyaki on top. At least the salmon was good. Also got the rose milk tea which tasted awful it was sour? I don't think rose milk tea should be sour as I get it often at Cup O House. The sweet potato fries were alright but is nothing special. Would rather the ones at Hot Star. Took a sip of the regular milk tea and \"honey\" oolong which tasted like dim sum tea with sugar. I know there is the honey oolong option on the menu but their order sticker doesn't say so. Maybe they messed up? I don't recommend the watery cream sauce spaghetti. Perhaps other food is better."}
{"text":"This is great study spot, there are outlets near every table it seems. And there is always somewhere to sit. The space itself is insanely cute, and it's great to get work done when you need to be in the company of strangers. The wifi was just fine for me, and I'd imagine it'd be a great place for group work. Best of all, the servers are nice and helpful when needed, but otherwise they didn't bother me.   I had the Taiwanese beef noodle soup, it was delicious with a complexity and balance of savoury, meaty and slightly sweet. Would highly recommend this item, I know I'll be tempted to get it again.   I also tried the mango waltz sundae, the soft serve was piled high and tasted pretty good, it was however slightly icy."}
{"text":"Thanks Tracy for letting us know about the grand opening special.  I got the LikeaGe6ix large drink (Green Apple Green Tea with Green Apple Jelly) $6.49 less sugar less ice.  Was still too sweet and tasted like bitter apple juice with sugar.  Will try something else next time.  Cup was sticky even before I touched it.  Place has lots of seats and has a 2nd floor.  They also sell lots of different types of food.  Didn't try any of it since I had dinner just before coming here."}
{"text":"Authentic Taiwanese flavour. Well-balanced meal. Adorable interior. The top floor is a great place for studying!   #feedingdodo"}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend tried their popcorn chicken combo. The chicken tastes just like all the other Taiwanese places, nothing special. The combo comes with an apple with no alternative choice offered, which is odd.   We asked for getting an VIP card so we could potentially get a discount and the male cashier told that it used to be free and now to be a VIP costs $30... of course we didn't bother.  The food is honestly okay, also expect this place with no music, but people chatting super loud around you."}
{"text":"[Location] 4/5 It is located at Baldwin Street, close to AGO, OCAD and U of T.  [Service] 3/5 We ordered my drinks with an iPad. Paid at front desk. Picked up our drink and went back to our table.  [Environment] 4/5 The restaurant plays soft music. It is an Asian-type Starbucks for study.  [Drinks & Dessert] 4/5 We ordered logan dragon eye tea, red Bean Milk Black tea and molten chocolate cake. The drinks are good but the lava cake is too sweet and could have be better.  [Overall] 4/5 With its handy location, you can spend $6,7 and study the whole evening/night."}
{"text":"Friendly, fast, unique, and great! This place is just amazing. Charidise is different from most restaurants; first you make an order at the cashier along with paying and then you are given a tracker. You take a seat anywhere within the restaurant and when your meal is ready, a worker will come and bring the food to where you are sitting. You could also order take-out if that is what you prefer. I ordered the Chicken Teriyaki with Rice and wow! It was amazing! However, while I was paying with my debit card, there were some technical difficulties while tapping, but the worker was incredible understanding and very patient. The chicken had the perfect texture, the sauce was extremely flavourful, and the rice wasn't too dry or too soggy. There was also a small section of vegetables given. If you walk a bit down the aisle, you will see a very bright section with glass doors surrounding it. The lighting in here was phenomenal! The place was also very peaceful, which is perfect for those who want to relax and read a book. Charidise also sells lighter snacks and drinks at a reasonable price. I recommend this place to anyone who is looking for good, cheap food along with amazing lighting and aesthetics. I will definitely come back here in the future!"}
{"text":"If you like Taiwanese food, this place is for you! Great space and warm service. You order at the counter and take a buzzer. When your food is a ready, a attendant drops it off. I have ordered their pop corn chicken meal (which comes with an apple for dessert - how healthy!), sago dessert and bubble tea. All flavorful and the portions were generous. My favorite spot within the restaurant is on the second floor, they have a garage door that opens up and you get to see a great view of the city. A affordable meal with a view, oh yes! It also looks like they are renovating the second floor once again and perhaps a patio may be opening soon. The patio part is a guess but I really hope it does come true!"}
{"text":"Searching for something light to eat and/or dessert, we ended up on Baldwin Street, a short street just off Chinatown's main strip on Spadina. There are lots of restaurants offering many different cuisines. Some of them have been there for decades. There are a few newer trendy establishments scattered among them.  We settled on Charidise because it appeared to be new, clean, spacious and their menu satisfied our desires. And we didn't feel like lining up at one of the smaller busier places.  The Taiwanese Minced Pork Rice was served in a bowl, with a sliced hard boiled egg and cucumbers on top. Not bad. The Crispy Chicken Poutine had a nice flavour, with crispy fries. The chicken looked like deep fried chicken fingers that were chopped up. The Golden Squid Balls were deep fried and topped with bonito flakes and green onions. Very good. The Mango Waltz is a tasty concoction of mango, NY cheesecake, and soft-serve ice cream. Nice.  While our cravings were satisfied, we'll probably try one of the other places next time we're in the area, not because the food wasn't good, it's just what food explorers do!"}
{"text":"Looking for a late-night dinner, I ordered the fried chicken with rice and was pleasantly surprised. It came in a shallow bamboo pan, with a layer of rice on the bottom and plenty of fried chicken on top. Besides that, there was a soft-boiled egg, a skewer of grilled brussel sprouts, a skewer of zucchini and an apple on the side. So much food!!  The fried chicken wasn't too greasy and  was seasoned well. In fact there was several small pieces of fried skin mixed in and they gave a great crunch. The soft-boiled egg was perfectly cooked and a welcomed addition to the platter. The only negative was that the brussel sprouts were on the harder side. They were still edible, but slightly raw.   I don't remember what use to be here, but Charadise has done a great job in transforming the space into an inviting, open and comfortable area for studying, eating, or chatting. The ordering system is streamline and easy to use. You scan the large menu screens at the entrance and order at the counter. They hand you a plastic coaster with a number on it, and you seat yourself. There is plenty of seating on the main floor, and even more on the second level. I would recommend one of the window seats on the second floor during the summer months. When your order is ready, they will deliver your food to where you've settled down. A nice process."}
{"text":"A cute and spacious cafe with good food and drinks. I love sitting at the window seats on the second floor and watching people go by.  Tip: Don't get pasta, the rice bowls are much better."}
{"text":"Came here just for drinks and dessert. Its a beautiful interior. I can tell the food is just what you expect for a taiwanese snack joint. Its not a high end resto or pretending to be anything other than a nice BBT hangout joint. There is a back room where you can study in peace. Ordered the molten chocolate cake and the black diamond milk tea. I loved both. The jellies in the drink were so yummy. And they were generous in the toppings. Will come again! 4 stars ****"}
{"text":"Pick up a menu, decide on what you want, get a number, and go sit somewhere in the spacious two level establishment.  They deliver the food to you.  The place is open and airy, with great natural light.  The top floor is much hotter than ground level.  I had the popcorn chicken and it was delicious.  I had the salmon grilled spaghetti for main, didn't realize the spaghetti was going to be coated in cheese.  Not a big fan of cheese, so that was a bit disappointing.  The best part was the apple they included with our meals, very cute!  It's a good spot to hang out with friends, love their window seats, and how open it is.  Would return for snacks and desserts!"}
{"text":"Taiwanese comfort food in one of the most adorable neighbourhoods in Toronto? Sign me up!  The food is served up quickly and service is efficient. But honestly, half the reason for coming here is the environment. The large, well designed space has plenty of nooks, benches and seats for hanging out.  Also, the containers that the food comes in are really neat."}
{"text":"Good food and great bubble tea. Their bubble tea is sweeter than most (even with 0 sugar), however tastes delicious. Price is slightly higher than other bbt places - for a drink and a meal you're looking at around $20.  My friends and I go here quite often to chill and work/study. Almost every seat has an outlet to keep your devices charged and their wifi is good. They've gotten busier recently, especially since their upstairs seating is under renovation (although should be done in a couple weeks from the time of this posting based on what the servers told me).  Ultimately the only blemish would be the higher than normal prices, though if you're looking for a place to work or study and like bubble tea, this is the place.  UPDATE: Recently the food quality has gone down and the prices have gone up so I have reflected my rating appropriately."}
{"text":"Charidise opened yesterday and definitely was an example of what I would call, a rather successful opening. They were prepared in their staff numbers and however at times there can be some confusion, it is expected for the first opening day.  I have read the other people's reviews and I think that those reviews do not accurately portray the quality of their service or food. I've ordered the popcorn chicken and found that their seasoning with it was really good - better than Sugar Marmalade's popcorn chicken per se. I also had their iced mixed fruit tea and they throw in quite a bit of fruits in there - something to chew on after you've finished the drink.  Lastly, their takoyaki was really fresh - I never tasted a takoyaki that was relatively crispy/crunch on the outside, and not too soft in the inside. I can definitely taste the freshness of the takoyaki than in some other places (ie. Night Markets) where it was probably frozen before serving.  Apart from that, their modern touch to the cafe really hit it home - an ideal place for student studying as there are practically outlets near every table and there are some quieter places too. The restaurant design and look-and-feel had got me impressed.  Overall, I'd go again in the near future to see how well they can perform as they prosper in their business and growth."}
{"text":"Came here for afternoon snack. Ordered the popcorn chicken combo which comes with a drink. This place, you order first and pay first, then they give you a pager, and you go pickup the food when it's ready. Good place to hang out or grab a snack! You can see the View of the CN Tower if you sit upstairs, but they don't always open the 2nd level."}
{"text":"It's the Asian Panera. The food is okay but honestly, pretty overpriced. Cute interior though!"}
{"text":"Came here after a theatre show. It's very well decorated with 2 floors. I absolutely love their flooring.   Tried the minced pork rice, popcorn chicken and baked chicken spaghetti. The minced pork rice and popcorn chicken was good. The chicken dish was mediocre. Also had their mango cheesecake ice cream sundae. It was really good but too filling for one person."}
{"text":"Charadise is one of the few newly opened tea shop/restaurants on Baldwin. After sampling their food and drinks for a couple of times, it's clear to me that the strong point of what makes this successful is not their food, but their drinks and their decor.  Charadise is one of the biggest tea rooms in downtown, featuring 2 different floors with plenty of sitting area. Separate rooms and high chairs are offered in abundance, so you'll most likely always find a seat to sit and enjoy your meal. Speaking of the food, it definitely looks better than it tastes. Presentation is beautiful, yet somehow the food feels a bit under seasoned and generic. But perhaps the free apple or bag of chips you get on the side can compensate for the mishap.  The drinks are good with great selections. However, as mentioned in other reviews, the time it takes for the food and drinks to arrive could be long. Multiple times, we've faced long wait times for our table to be served. However, it is nice that the restaurant tries to compensate by giving you a tracker, which tells the staff which table you're sitting at, and will bring the food to you when it's ready.  Perhaps with faster service, and more seasoning on their food (instead of expanding their menu), Charadise will be the ultimate spot to have a casual meal and play some cards/study/converse, because their space is totally worth the visit."}
{"text":"Got my food over 45 minutes after. It was cold, and even reheated the chicken teriyaki tasted horrible - no flavor and the chicken was covered in fat. The egg on the side was the only thing that was edible. Their drinks are ok. Way too expensive for what it is and the quality of the food."}
{"text":"My friend and I decided to visit this place after seeing multiple photos of it appear on IG and I can say that I am glad I visited the place.   The minute you walk in you can see how spacious the place is and their door is like a garage door and they have it open on a sunny day. The ordering system is like Panera you order and get a buzzer then go to your seat. The only thing you have to wait for at the cash is your drink. I personally don't mind that type of system.   I ordered the New Zealand Lamb with spaghetti and my friend ordered the salmon with spaghetti and both were pretty filling and good. They were both simplistic dishes and at the price range and type of place it was I wasn't expecting too much. But simplistic dishes are nice to have nevertheless. Each meal came with an apple which was nice.  The menu had a lot of cool things to order from and I will be visiting again to try out their desserts.   Overall the atmosphere was nice, the second floor was open and it seems like a good place to study. This kind of place I wouldn't mind dining alone."}
{"text":"Food's semi pricey but the space of this place is perfect for mostly college/university students. You lag at the front and the. They'll bring your food to wherever you seat (note drinks must be picked up on your own, kind of weird)  I ordered the beef rice dish and the presentation in a wooden circular box was cool and different. My meal also came with a complimentary apple - kinda cute, but not sure if it's significance.   I'd definitely comeback with a friend (or a group). They have this one table that can seat 4-6 ppl together and you sit starring straight into the view of the CN tower. Gorgeous!"}
{"text":"Be careful of the step. And that one too. There are lots of steps here, where you wouldn't think there should be. The physical design of the place could be better.  I've come here a bunch of times now. I like the food. It's relatively quick, tastes good, but I think it's a little pricy.   When you arrive, there are some machines to the left before the counter. Proceed there to order. Once you're done, the order will be printed, take that slip to the counter to pay and get a buzzer. If you ordered a drink, wait for it there. Then you can sit and the food will come to you.  I came in with a friend a few weeks back. We both got the beef noodle. And the red bean latte. And then we walked to a table. Unfortunately for me, I didn't see that to get to the table, there was a drop and I would need to step down right at the table. Not seeing that I needed to step down meant that I landed funny and spilled pretty much all of my drink. No red bean latte for me. I wonder how many people have this same problem, because within seconds, a staff person came and gave me a bunch of towels and began to mop right away. I hope it doesn't happen a lot, because I can imagine people turning their ankles pretty easily because of that.   I didn't get a replacement for that drink, I guess because it was my fault for spilling it. But I did try it a few weeks later. I'll get to that in a bit. I did however get to try the beef noodle, and that was delicious. And for every meal you get here, an apple comes with it.  A few weeks later, I came back and got the same thing. This time, I avoided the previous set of tables and say near the front.  There was a crowd of people waiting for their drinks, so I sat down thinking they have to get their drinks before I would get mine. But then I hear them call out a red bean latte, and so I walk up to the counter, but no drink. I asked they just called for my drink and gave them my number... And they said they just handed it to someone. The guy that too the drink eventually came back and said he ordered another drink and must've taken it by mistake. Lesson here is: stand there to get your drink. Apparently they have order numbers and tickets, but don't use/collect them to check that the right people get their drinks.  After the most recent meal, I walked out and thought \"ok, at least I didn't fall.\" Yeah except as soon as I thought that, I came to realize there's a step there that I keep forgetting as well..."}
{"text":"amazing establishment! I just wished I was still a student at uoft when this place was opened so I could come during lunch and study.   There is plenty of space for a downtown location and the price is reasonable. I just cant seem to get enough taiwanese popcorn chicken. Theyre the best!"}
{"text":"Was looking forwards to trying this restaurant since it opened, especially with the the selection  of  Easter-Western blended menu as well as its eye-opening seating size.   Ordered: 1. Popcorn chicken 2. Fries 3. Lamb Spaghetti 4. Charidise Iced Black Tea  The bill came up to about $35 - on the higher end. The food taste was above average, but nothing spectacular when parred to that of typical Taiwanese street cuisine. The popcorn chicken and fries I found to be a bit less crispy than ideal while the lamb chops with the spaghetti were better than expected. The tea, especially, was nothing extraordinary and did not leave behind a memorable aftertaste.    The restaurant itself is very open-concept and can be a great spot for chatting and studying. Overall, the dining experience was mediocre but pleasant nonetheless. Not sure if I would revisit as a go-to tea spot when compared to the other teashops in Toronto."}
{"text":"Great study spot for U of T/ Ryerson students if you can handle a little background noise. The staff was really attentive and kind and the bubble tea is legit. Also, (and totally unnecessary) the bathroom had three-ply toilet paper!!! How nice haha!"}
{"text":"The food is good. The drink is good. But the bubble tea is overpriced compare to other bubble tea joints. $8 for a bubble tea?? That's way too much for a drink."}
{"text":"Amazing new Taiwanese place conveniently located in Baldwin Village. When first walking in Charidise I was amazed of how big the place is. It was two floors with plenty of seating. Rather than being served at your table and paying after you eat, you order and pay at the front and then they bring your food to your table. I ordered the popcorn chicken it was delicious. I also ordered the grapefruit lemonade and I wasn't disappointed. The only con is that its more pricey compared to other Taiwanese restaurants.   Overall I was very impressed with Charidise and will for sure will be coming back in the near future!"}
{"text":"I've been waiting for this place to open ever since they started the renovations. The opening was delayed for around half a year and when I finally got a glimpse of the store front, I couldn't believe how different it was from John's Italian Caffe that used to take up that spot on Baldwin.  This space is completely transformed and modernized for the student population. There are lots of seating areas with large tables which are great to study on. You order everything at the front when you first walk in. The drinks you have to pick up there but the food seems to be delivered to each table. I got a large Iced passion Aloe Lime Black tea with added tapioca, which cost me $6.40 after the 15% discount from the VIP card by paying cash.   As many other people mentioned, 30% sugar is still a little too sweet; my fault for not heeding the warnings and getting it still. I just didn't want to take the risk of going for no sugar...  The large Aloe pieces that came with the drink was pretty good. I contemplated getting some food as well during the 3 hours I was sitting there working, but decided against it for some reason... what came over me? Next time I'll definitely try the hot and sour sweet potato noodle, it sounds pretty interesting.  Overall, a great space to just chill and work with friends. The music is not too loud and there is enough lighting for comfortable reading, at least where I sat on the second floor. The free wifi was pretty good after they fixed it."}
{"text":"Super cute place to grab some snacks and chill. I like the decor here and self-serve concept. There is an area at the back for more quiet study which is nice. The staff here was nice and menu offers a good variety of bubble tea, dessert and Taiwanese snack options! The popcorn chicken here is soooooo good! It came out piping hot, crispy and juicy. I highly recommend everyone to get this when they visit. I also tried the original milk tea and it was delicious. I cannot wait to come again to try the other food options! P.S wifi password is their phone #."}
{"text":"My boyfriend was raving about this place since it is nearby his home. We finally went and the moment I walked in I was shocked with how much space there was! There is a lot of room to sit outside and the seating stretches so far back on the main floor. My favourite place is the room with the window ceilings that provides a beautiful atmosphere with a lot of natural lighting.   There is also another floor up and there are a lot more tables there and comfortable seats and even sofas! The last time I came by they were fixing the back of the second floor, maybe it will become an outdoor patio?  The food was fine. I liked it but my palate, I guess, isn't as refined as others to make a judgement haha. I loved this place and came back many times but the last time I came by the AC wasn't working and the wifi wasn't working too (I studied there a lot)...   On the plus side if wifi isn't something you really need and can do without, this place has tons of outlets for ya. :)"}
{"text":"3.5 stars It is a nice place to hang out with friends. Food is average consider the price they charged.  However, their service is fast and friendly. You can get your order within minutes.  If you looking for a quick serving and nice place for meal, this is definitely one of the place to go.  p.s. I like the idea of adding an apple for each rice or noodles order. It gives you reminisced about your lunch in middle school."}
{"text":"Had the popcorn chicken rice, ~$12, not sure how I feel about that...portion was pretty decent but would pass on the rice next time and just get snack size.  The restaurant in its entirety is very nice though, there is a lot of seating space and very long. On the main floor theres a front seating area, a kind of middle seating area with a closed room, and a back seating area with a little fireplace. I would imagine this would be a nice place to sit down and read or study."}
{"text":"This place is really great if you're looking to catch up with friends, study, or grab lunch by yourself. The atmosphere is really laid back and it seems like a place you could stay for 2, even 3 hours. It's also really spacious and open, with two floors and a ton of seating. We came at ~4:30 on a Wednesday afternoon and it was actually pretty empty so seats were easy to find.  The food isn't super cheap but the quality makes up for it. I got the popcorn chicken rice and passion fruit lime aloe black tea. My friend got the curry chicken rice and the strawberry yogurt drink. Our food arrived pretty quickly; I think we waited 10 minutes max.  The popcorn chicken is superb and perfectly cooked. My only complaint is that the sauce they gave me wasn't enough for the entire portion of rice so some parts were bland. I also liked how they included an apple with both of our meals. One thing I really liked was the aloe vera pieces in my drink were really big - not the typical tiny pieces you find in those aloe drinks. My friend said his drink tasted good but it also tasted exactly like those yogurt drinks you buy in the grocery.  It started to get super busy at around 6:30-7 so make sure you come in early to beat the dinner rush."}
{"text":"So this place recently opened so of course my friends and I went to check it out, and we weren't sure of what to expect. When you walk in it's a very nicely decorated place that reminds you of a small cafe. However it's more of a self-order kind of small restaurant where you pay for your food and then find a table yourself and they deliver your order to you. They also feature a full drink/bubble tea menu which is nice. I ordered the taiwanese meat (I think?) And it was good and there's an unusual choice of sides(banana, doritos, or apple). They literally give you a bag of chips, not fries or anything like you would expect if you asked for chips with your meal. Overall the place has a nice atmosphere and there is lots of seating. The food is good and a good price, but i'm not sure about the bubble tea. Seems like a good place for students to get food/drinks and just talk or study. 4/5 stars for now."}
{"text":"Came on opening day and twice after that. Food is good and I love the layout of the seating area and how they come to your table to deliver your food using those tracking devices. The drinks are average, but decent."}
{"text":"i used to really like charidise. it had some of the best popcorn chicken in the city, imo. it's other taiwanese offerings, like the beef noodle soup, were also done well. it's also a nice space to hang out.  however, the service and the food quality have dropped in the last few months. they aren't as they use to be. maybe they're getting busier? there's a constant stream of food delivery people coming in and out.   in any case, it's harder for me to justify the extra premium now. meals for 2 with drinks will easily cost $50. i hope they find their old spark."}
{"text":"Good: - Very good variety of food, they have everything from noodles and rice, Taiwanese snacks, desserts, to all kind of bubble tea and other drinks. - Good place to study / do group projects, if you don't mind the music. - Popcorn chicken is really good here!  Bad: Sorry but I'll be a bit nitpicky here... - On the pricey side... Especially in this area where you have plenty of choices for noodles / rice / bubble tea. - Food quality varies from time to time and from dish to dish. I got a molten cake with non-molten chocolate. They only give out apples with their dishes now (instead of a choice between banana and apple before) and I hate apples ;_;. Braised beef noodles is usually good but I got some really dry beef once. Yea..."}
{"text":"This is the ultimate study/work place off meal hours. Plenty of seating, power outlets everywhere, spacious with high ceilings and calm Starbucksesque music. Once UofT and OCAD students find out about this place, it will become a study hall off campus. I had a latte and dessert pastry which were fine. Service was good. This is now my new local study/work cafe."}
{"text":"Ever since I saw this place on social media, I wanted to try it out! Finally got the chance to and it was just alright. In terms of menu options, everything is pretty mediocre especially for the price you're paying. I got the Cobb salad with Caesar dressing instead of the vinaigrette it usually comes with. It looked very good in the photo they had on display and I had high hopes. I guess there's a reason why I've never ordered salad before today. Charidise definitely has slightly healthier options than other places and it was pretty average taste. I liked the salad but it wasn't good enough for me to get again. The portion was alright but I didn't like multiple things: - egg was not cut up properly so I couldn't mix it in well - there was a whole bunch of craisins at the bottom of the salad bowl??? Why was it all condensed there? Only found out when I had nearly finished the entire bowl - considering the price of my meal, it did not come with an apple like others did which was pretty disappointing personally speaking -mediocre grilled chicken. I wish there was a crispy option  I did like how they had environmentally bowls? I believe it was made from recycled materials so that's nice to see but it just got tossed in the garbage anyway...  I'll get something different next time probably"}
{"text":"The cafe here is really spacious and picturesque. The cafe boasts multiple seating areas and has several screen monitors where you can place your order.  Once we got our receipt we took it to the cashier and was given an electronic number pad. They then brought our meals to us at our table.   We ordered the teriyaki chicken rice and the popcorn chicken rice meals with their specialty bubble tea. Each bowl came with rice, broccoli, and a boiled egg. I personally loved the popcorn chicken meal because the chicken is really fragrant and super crispy. The teriyaki chicken bowl was average.   I didn't appreciate how small the bubble tea was for the price I paid which was $7. Plus, the drink was a bit too bitter for my liking..."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed with my visit here on the weekend. The food is really expensive, not to mention the quality of the food wasn't there.   We ordered the Minced pork rice ($11.99), and the Beef noodle soup ($11.99). We also had a side order of Popcorn chicken ($8.99), and we each ordered a drink: Hot Charadise Milk black tea ($4.99) and Iced Royal Matcha Latte ($4.99). Our lunch for 2 costed us $50 total! One thing that really threw me off was the minced pork was sweet! I've never had Taiwanese minced pork that was sweet, it's supposed to be salty. It made me wonder if the chef had accidentally put sugar instead of salt when cooking. The beef noodle soup was ok - decent amount of beef pieces, and the meat was tender but overall it lacked flavor. A lot of noodles, but the soup was bland. One thing I also couldn't get over was why the preserved vegetables were yellow (normally they should be light green, but it was distinctly yellow). The best dish was probably the popcorn chicken but even then it tasted like nothing special. I've definitely had better Taiwanese food uptown. Only thing I would say was good were their drinks. Both drinks were good, but not quite worth $5.  Service was not so great. If they give you a tracker and deliver you food to where you are sitting, why can't they do the same for drinks? After ordering the staff told me to stay here to wait for the drinks. While I was still standing by the counter 2 food trays already came to me while I was still waiting for my drink...  I do have to say though the place is really big. It actually does seem like a cafeteria, and the décor is really nice. The place actually comes off as a good place to study."}
{"text":"almost 3.5  relatively basic food, including spaghettis (you can do same at home, really) but everything ends up ok, clean and fresh, and served in good portions. sago tapioca deserts are good (again, basic but satisfying).  a satisfying place, nothing stellar to expect, but that is already very good in a way."}
{"text":"Horrible place with horrible customer service. Poutine was disgusting, when I took it back they refused to give me my money back but offered another dish. I had no time, didn't want another dish and simply wanted my money back (I litterly had 5 fries) manager refused and just wanted to give me something else.  Sorry, I didn't want anything else.  What I wanted 2as my money back.  Worst customer service ever. If this is a chain they are in trouble"}
{"text":"Great place to study if you're into working in cafe environments. The menu is extremely extensive, you'll see it right when you step into the store. The people there are really nice and since it is a new place, I did see some of them helping other customers with their order as you are able to sit anywhere after ordering (given the tracker). I ordered their Charidise milk tea which alone costs $6.49 with no toppings. That was the most expensive bubble tea I have ever gotten. The drink itself was not that bad but I would not pay for that, only if I wanted to go to the restaurant and study there and not want to buy any food. Overall, great atmosphere and the food there looks good!"}
{"text":"Lmao what the eff who pays 6.20 for a regular sized milk tea (h). Also I wasn't told til after I paid that they ran out of matcha latte... Again, after I paid.   The place looks nice and big but based on my very first interaction I'm probably never coming back. Because even Starbucks doesn't charge this much for a regular hot drink."}
{"text":"I really liked the food here. We ordered a chicken curry on rice and a New Zealand lambchop on spaghetti. Both were quite tasty and filling. The menu has a good selection of food, drinks, and desserts (which I didn't get to try this time). I also tried the red bean milkshake which was nice and sweet. The apple they include with every meal is a cute touch. The building is two stories with ample seating for you to choose from. I saw people just hanging out, doing work, or playing games which made for a relaxed casual atmosphere. There's lots of windows and the second floor has a pleasant view of Baldwin street.   There are a few negatives. The food is priced a little higher than I felt it should be. $17 for a two small lambchops on a bed of spaghetti is kind of pricey. Especially since all their cutlery and dishes are disposable. I suspect the price is high to make up for the fact that they don't seem to allow tipping. However, there's barely any waiter service. When they do deliver your food, they're relying on a tracking system that isn't most accurate. Be watchful so you can grab the attention of the waiter with your food if you notice them circling around several times. Make sure they can see your number!  All in all, I'll be back even though I grumbled about the price a bit"}
{"text":"Checked out this spot at lunch! Very spacious and clean restaurant. Lots of seating which is nice for a change. It wasn't too busy over lunch so we ordered at the front and found a table as we waited for our meals.   I had the beef noodle soup which was quite a large portion. It was flavourful and tasty though with lots of tender beef chunks. My friends had the popcorn chicken bowl and minced pork bowl which were both very good as well. I really liked that each meal came with an apple! Was a nice healthy snack to have back at the office.   Overall it's worth checking this place out. I guess it's not rave-worthy for me just because I'm not the biggest Taiwanese food fan, but there's some great dishes here for everyone!"}
{"text":"I'm really disappointed because I heard really good stuff from other people about this place. The furnishing of the restaurant is quite modern and spacious, and I have yet to try the food. However, the service was terrible, they messed up my order for bubble tea three times. The first time I asked for specifically no ice for both drinks which they decided to put in one of my drinks for some reason. Then they decided to not put in the tapioca which I asked for and yes also paid for (the guy making the bubble tea asked in Chinese the cashier if she charged me extra for tapioca right in front of me) and then they decided to give me the skinny straws for bubble tea. The bubble tea was also subpar for the price they charge... more than a lot of other places."}
{"text":"The Taiwanese beef noodle soup was flavourful and quite tasty. The stewed beef was soft and tender and the noodles were perfectly cooked and chewy. The popcorn chicken is crunchy and decadent. I didn't try the milk tea because they were out of tapioca but I'll be back to give it a try!"}
{"text":"I keep hearing that the popcorn chicken is really good here. If you've ever tried popcorn chicken at Bubble Republic and you like it, then you'll probably like it at Charidise. I've been to this place before but I never got anything to eat until I checked in for the first time on yelp. I think the layout is a little interesting. You order what you want on the screen and then you bring it up to cash and pay. Then they give you a buzzer and that's how the server knows where you are. It's very hipster looking and I do really like the way the restaurant is set up. It looks like it's more for students as both times I've came here, a lot of them had their laptops out and did studying/group work.   Food is quite pricey here so be prepared if you're coming for a meal. Apparently the rice and noodle dishes don't come as a combo and that's why your bill will be kinda expensive. I think when I ordered my fried chicken, there was a promo deal so I was able to get a drink for cheaper. The food looked pretty generic to any other Taiwanese place but it was set up a lot nicer; aesthetically pleasing to my eyes.   BBT tastes pretty good here but again nothing too special.  Popcorn chicken tastes like your typical fried chicken pieces from Bubble Republic.  3.5* Food is alright imo because it tastes very generic.  4* I think I just really like the store looks and the way the food is placed. 4* for service"}
{"text":"I give this place 3.5/5. The popcorn chicken rice is pretty good imo, quite a large quantity too. The price a little higher than other locations as I can find the same thing for cheaper at other places like sugar marmalade. The drinks themselves are a little overpriced at around 6-7$ for a reg size"}
{"text":"The first visit was wonderful. Great service, free WiFi, fast service, good food. And based on that visit, it was worthy of 4 stars.  However, the next visit downgraded the rating to 3 stars.  Yes, it's a great space (2 floors and patios), and the food and drinks, when available, has been good. So far I've enjoyed the Taiwanese beef soup noodle, popcorn chicken, Taiwanese mince pork rice. (But skip the fried calamari and takoyaki)  However, when my friend and I arrived at 11:45 am, and tried to order lunch - we were told:   1. Only snack menu was ready for order. Rice combos would be a 30-45 min wait. So we had to re-visit the menu to make a split second decision (as the line started to grow behind us). We order and go upstairs to find a table. What do we find? Several patrons already seated, eating rice dishes. Hmmm...  2. Tapioca would be an hour wait. How can a bubble tea place have NO tapioca ready?! Kinda silly.   I hope this occurrence was a one-time thing... but based on recent reviews - it seems many people had similar experiences."}
{"text":"Such as bad experience eating here!!!! Very slow !!! We were sitting here for almost a hour, they even didn't give us our drinks! You have to get your dink downstairs! Very unorganized! I won't come back here for sure !!! Nothing special !!!!"}
{"text":"This is a nice spot in Baldwin Village for Taiwanese eats. There's a good selection of rice and noodle dishes, as well as drinks and desserts as either a nice complement to your meal or a sweet snack.   Their bubbletea is pretty good - better than the average bubbletea you can find in downtown Toronto and comparable to the ones you can find in the suburbs. Despite no extra modifications, the drink had just the right amount of sweetness with nicely cooked tapioca.   The mango cheesecake sundae was my favourite part of the meal. The vanilla soft serve doesn't overpower the cheesecake crust. The mango is a little more on the sweet side - would've been nice if it was a bit more sour.   The lamb chop spaghetti had nicely cooked pasta with a good amount of sauce. It was delicious but doesn't really stand out that much.   Unfortunately, the baked cheese chicken rice took nearly 30 minutes to arrive. I only learned of this when I asked the cashier after waiting 20 minutes for my food. The chicken breast was juicy with a good amount of cheese. The zucchini skewer and brussel sprouts were a nice addition to the dish. While it was delicious, I wish the servers would have informed me of the wait time as soon as I ordered.   Overall, I would rate this place with a 3.5/5, but I rounded up to give them the benefit of the doubt. It's definitely a must-visit place if you're craving Taiwanese food downtown and there's ample seating. If you feel like studying here, Charidise also has a lot of plugs for your convenience."}
