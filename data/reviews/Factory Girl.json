{"text":"Outstanding!! Winterlicious menu. Appetizer: Fried Calamari  Entree: Chicken Marsala w fingerling potatoe and veg. Desert: Chocolate Mousse Wine: Malbec  This outing was a welcome surprise and our best Winterlicious experience. We were thrilled they had Malbec on the list.  More than enough Calamari for one, could even be shared.  The chicken was fantastic. It was butterflied, but seemed like two breasts. Juicy and very tender. Veg included peppers, green beans, zucchini and turnip. They use seasonal items when available. Everything was cooked perfectly. Nice and tender with just the right amount of crunch on the veg. I can be a fairly big eater, but I was getting full.  Desert was spot on. I wanted to hoover it up but held back. Not too sweet, light and airy.  This eatery is a gem on the Danforth. We will be back."}
{"text":"Nicely renovated and a great add to the neighbourhood. Good menu selections although I think the kitchen is working out the kinks.. Looking forward to enjoying the patio this summer! Welcome to the hood!"}
{"text":"Unexpectedly fantastic! My husband and I dropped by for lunch and a drink on their back patio and we couldn't have been more impressed. The pizza was fabulous and the service impeccable. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I've been to Factory Girl a few times since it opened. The décor and staff are fantastic. I have never felt rushed or ignored. I've always enjoyed their wine suggestions. The first time I went I had one of their pizza's (dough made fresh every day). It was fantastic and quite large. I ate leftovers for lunch and dinner the next day.  The second time I went I had one of their specials. Lasagne with garlic bread and salad. The Lasagne was made fresh that day and others at the table ordered it as well. They were all very impressed. However, mine was cold. It had the potential to be very good but due to the temperature it was a bit of a disappointment. My BF had the \"Charlie's Spaghetti\", it was also not very good. Almost tasteless pasta with no sauce, or oil.  That being said, both times I have been with large groups. Everyone (other than the two cases above) enjoyed their food and both times a nice sampling of the menu was chosen.  We will definitely go back and might even make it a regular place to visit for some good no-fuss, fresh, home-made meals.  Don't be deceived by the seemingly small dining room/bar in the front. There are two very large dining rooms and a patio at the back as well. I can't wait to try this place in the summer."}
{"text":"Yum Yum.....one of my favs on the danforth.  I have been here a few times now and love the pizza. They had a very special pizza once-- curry delight. It was a true delight!  Another favourite pizza of mine is the smoked salmon pizza( the dough is made fresh everyday)  -- very delicious and the portions are HUGE. I always end up taking some home with me.   The service is good and the staff is friendly. I love the grey seatee at the front of the restaurant, very cozy for 2...... Great Patio. Good place for a date nite, or drinks with friends."}
{"text":"Great food. Great service. The pizza was fantastic and they have a great selection of wine and beer. I would definitely go back the next time I am in Toronto."}
{"text":"I went to Factory Girl today with a party of about 20.  I ordered the fish and chips ($18.99) and asked that the chips be exchanged for a Mediterranean salad.  When my bill came there was an additional $7 charge for the salad.  I was not aware there would be a $7 charge for the swap so I asked the waiter who talked to the manager about it.  When the waiter came back she told me it could not be taken off the bill but that she'd be happy to cover it.  I didn't think it was fair that the waiter pay the charge (she did an excellent job overall!) so I asked to speak to the manager.  After about 15min he hadn't come out so I went inside to talk to him.  He told me sternly that it was the waiter's responsibility to tell me about the charge and lectured me about how the salad was worth $7 as it had feta cheese on it.  I felt quite awkward and I agreed to pay the $7.   I think it's pretty un-classy of the manager to dicker with me over this small charge.  I also think it's pretty bad of the restaurant to make their hard working wait staff absorb the costs of small mistakes like this when they did a great job.  Is this a normal policy in most restaurants?    Overall the patio was nice and the food was decent, but the manager turned me off.  Given the plethora of other awesome restaurants on the Danforth, I will not be back."}
{"text":"Nice,  open and friendly. The meal was quite good, but the prices should have translated into spectacular."}
{"text":"Nice back patio. Friendly staff. Menu is a bit one-note. I started with calamari, which were piping hot, crisp and tender, served on a bed of lightly dressed greens. Easily could have washed down a second order with my beer and skipped the pizza. Not sure why they want to bill themselves as a pizza place. Their topping combos are interesting enough, but the pizza itself is nothing to write home about; greasy-ish crust and a bit doughy (think Pizza Hut)."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite places on the Danforth.  One of the hidden gems with a nice, private and comfortable patio.  A natural canopy of trees in the west eases the blaring sun in the late afternoon.  The food is good, the service is friendly and they serve Beau's Beer. Love this place."}
{"text":"LOVE this place. Great patio. Decent beer. Great atmosphere.  Would get 5 stars if it had BETTER beer."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere of this place.  Upscale pub fare with a wide selection of beer and wine.  The pizza is outstanding (thin crust with all fresh ingredients).  I would recommend the factory girl pizza (so delicious)! They have some fun cocktails to choose from as well that are quite potent and delicious!  Will be back regularly!"}
{"text":"Great pub place on the Danforth area with a relatively large backyard patio! I have been in a number of patios, but never one in the backyard. I would say this one definitely set the bar high for the backyard patios I come across in the future.  There is a number of options of the menu- I ordered the mac & cheese appetizer as I was not too hungry (~$11) and a pint of Keith (~$7). The mac & cheese was flavourful with lots of cheese at the top, but just too oily in the bottom (think almost quarter of the food submerged in oil). Beer was pretty standard. My friends order a wrap and burger. Both came in large proportions, yet the fries weren't the crispy type (which I personally prefer more).   Services was great, server often came around to see how we were doing and was friendly, didn't rush us to leave either.   I would come back here for the backyard patio again, but perhaps for just drinks and some munchies."}
{"text":"The place is okay. Nice setup, great tunes. The food is just OK. The place is defintiely a little pricey considering all they serve are sandwiches, pastas and pizza. No item is less than $17 (and that's just the burgers and sandwiches). I've been here twice and both times I was hoping to be amazed, but its just mediocre."}
{"text":"The food is really good and the back patio is excellent. I just wish the rotating draft list shifted more towards local craft beer and less of the big name brands."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times now and the food is always excellent. The pasta is fresh every day and all the sauces are homemade.  I think my favorite dish is the Agnolotti, although I've not had a single pasta that I didn't like.  I also would recommend the nachos with the Cajun chicken added, they were significantly more flavourful than the regular nachos without just being extra spicy."}
{"text":"Don't be confused by the name or the cool atmosphere, this is a great gastropub. The name it turns out, is a Rolling Stones....kinda cool.  Me and my coworkers made the trek across the bridge from downtown to The Danforth after work last Tuesday.  My coworker had been there several times before and said it would be worth the walk.  We were seated immediately by the very friendly and warm hostess who stopped to chat with us.   We started off with an order of ahi tuna tacos and an order of pulled pork tacos. Both were flawless and went well with the Headstock IPA we ordered. We had Fish and Chips, Factory Chicken, a Burger and a Maria Pizza, all were delicious. The Factory chicken is prepared differently than any other chicken I have ever had. It was so moist and delicious and the veggies that came with it were perfectly al dente, it is the type of dish that you will crave.   The waitress suggested a lovely and reasonably priced wine to go with our meal. All in all a great experience. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"I walk home by this place everyday after work and was curious. This use to be the home for years to the Mexican restaurant called Willow which I never actually tried. I initially had thought the place was called Factory Grill until I took a closer look. The name is supposedly taken from a Rolling Stone tune from the Beggars Banquet album. We started off by sitting in some nice chairs/couch lounge area and having drinks and some calamari. We then shifted over to a table for our meal.   Their menu has too many great sounding options and it was really hard to pick what to go with. Its largely an Italian based menu but there is some standard pub fare too like chicken wings/nachos.  I had a very tasty pasta with sausage and red peppers. I also got to taste a friend's \"Maria\" pizza. Both were fantastic. The desert menu (2 items) sounded amazing but I was stuffed by this point. Service was excellent.  The place has been renovated to the hilt and has great atmosphere. The restaurant/bar has a number of big screen tvs for sports and a huge area in the back. They also will have a patio in the summer which I'm sure will compete with Allens for top patio spot when warmer weather hits.  Cost wise it ran me about 50 dollars for Appetizer/3 Pints/Pasta/Tax/Tip so definately reasonably priced for what you get.  I would and will definately go back again."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible food.  Not sure why people are saying it's ok.  My dinner partner ordered the steak sandwich, it came wrapped in a tortilla shell (?), it was soggy and sitting in some sort of liquid that was tasteless, the steak was over cooked and chewy.  I ordered the brisket - which tasted like it came out of a pre-packaged box.  When we could finally get a waitresses attention and asked for the bill with our food uneaten, she wanted to know if we would like to take it home.  We were stunned, any good restaurant will ask you if there's something wrong with the food.  We didn't think it was even worth complaining.  We'll just never go back."}
{"text":"Stopped by Factory Girl for a quick bite and a couple drinks and was impressed with the food and drink selection they had. The service was okay, they were friendly and helpful but it took a while to get our bill from them. I would recommend this place if you are meeting up with a small group of friends to watch the game."}
{"text":"I think I was the first customer in the resturant yesterday for lunch, so the service was really good. The calamari however was a bit on the over cooked side but I was too hungry to really care and the portion was huge so i was pleased. I tried the salmon wrap with sweet potato fries which was above average. The actual smoked salmon portion was a good value but the dip provide was less amazing. I also dried med wings. Average but the fries were really good. Overall pleased with this place and wouldn't hesitate eating here again."}
{"text":"Two of us for lunch on a Wednesday.  Margherita pizza which was so mushy as to be inedible A greasy linguine dish paired with a mushy breaded chicken  Way overpriced Caesar with what was clearly brought in dressing (i.e. not made on premises) Minestrone soup that my friend did like  Service was strange. Mains arrived while we were eating our appetizers...reaction to being told the meal was crap was a shrug...  Certainly will not return."}
{"text":"Nice service from server but weird, old smell inside the restaurant (unsure if caused from the old building onsite) which stinked on my cloths for quite a bit of time.  Recommend drink : Try 'Factory Girl' A bit pricey but good to enjoy.  Food : Nachos is alright (recommend the ones at Firkins on Woodbine & north of Steeles Ave. E., uptown). Burgers is not bad, comes with French Fries, but the Medit. Salad I ordered which dish is a bit smaller portion than I expected based on the price I paid.  Washroom : Very clean and no dirt smell, or wet on the floor (located downstairs of the resturant).  Nice Atmosphere.   Good thing also they had both backyard and front yard patio.  Will I go back again : Maybe not (but good to have a try)."}
{"text":"Très bon petit restaurant de la Danforth, qualité, bon choix et prix raisonnables."}
{"text":"Food was excellent. Great little back patio away from Danforth. Service was so so. Going back so a longer review coming."}
{"text":"Terrible. Went with a group of friends. Waitress didn't tell us her name and maybe spoke to us two times, to ask us our order and when she gave us our meals. Also didn't ask us if we wanted drinks. Food wasn't all that great either. After we paid we were told, \"you know a 15% tip is REQUIRED\" we obviously know that but the service was not good. Then one of us payed with cash. Her meal was $19 and she payed with a $50. The lady came back with $5 in coins. She immediately went to the back so we had to ask someone else to bring the correct change. This lady came back with a $10, still not enough. We complained again. The first lady came back with a bunch of cash in her hand placed down another $10 and said \"is this enough?\". Terrible terrible would not go again."}
{"text":"Review is based solely on my Winterlicious experience a few days ago. We were really excited to try this place out. The place was buzzing and had a really vibrant crowd on a Friday night. We had reservations and were immediately seated.   We ordered a bottle of red. It sucks seeing the LCBO right across the street and knowing the same $35 bottle we had cost about $11. We both had the meatballs to start. They arrived cold in the middle. Another small thing that I noticed, the plating was different for the same dish. I'm just a fan of consistency. I have to say, the meatball sauce was great. A shame that they didn't serve any bread or something to soak that deliciousness up with.  The mains were grouper. Nothing fresh about it and again, the sauce was better than the actual hero of the meal - the grouper. To finish we had the donut (meh) and the bread pudding - amazing!   Our waitress was absolutely awesome, which directly attributes to my only positive experience with this place. Like I said, this was the Winterlicious menu and maybe their regular menu serves up a better experience. I'd go back to try their regular menu though."}
{"text":"Popped in for an impromptu order of nachos with my lovely wife last night. The nachos were tasty, the servers friendly and efficient, the music was good and at a reasonable volume which allowed for conversation. The place was clean, if not a tad clinical and lacking in atmosphere. A safe bet if you are unfamiliar with the bars on the Danforth."}
{"text":"I got the Rigatoni a la Vodka (which is what I usually get lol)   This hands-down has to be one of my favourite restaurants in the city. I love the atmosphere and the music here, but it also doesn't hurt that the food is always ridiculously delicious and filling every single time.  I also really like their vodka-lemonade drink with the strawberries in it- the strawberries that aren't moldy or rotting, as I have gotten from other places.  Service has been excellent the 5/6 times I've gone, though the time it wasn't so good I suspect she must have genuinely forgot, which is alright since it was a busy friday night, so I understand.  I'd definitely recommend this place to others. (btw the back patio area is really nice!)"}
{"text":"I'd give here a 3.5 actually.  Tried it at night with a large group years ago and remember liking it, but with no detail standing out other than it was quite dark in the back room.  Most recent visit on a warm Monday evening in early October (around 6pm?) was pretty good.  The place was mostly empty in the front, but I didn't look in the back.  Quite a large restaurant/bar, very casual, lots of tables & booths...I didn't take a count but guess capacity for well over 100.  Bathrooms in the basement so probably not accessible.  Friendly service.  I tried the Giovanni pizza (15.99 olive oil, fior di latte, cremini mushrooms, parmigiano shaving). It was thin crust, four large slices and delicious.  I looked at it and thought there is no way I could eat all that, but yet I did.  My friend, a fussy carb addict, had the Mac & Cheese (15.99 fresh rigatoni with alfredo sauce & cheddar, she excluded the mushroom and tomato, but what was left was really hot and satisfying, as I sampled some).  She also ordered the Poutine (fresh cut yukon gold fries with, melted cheese curds, red wine gravy. 10.99) but she ordered this without the gravy, which makes it not really poutine. Also, they were apparently out of cheese curds that night, so used shredded mixed cheese.  But for just fries with melted cheese, was still tasty.  LOL  We split a bottle of pinot grigio and then a chocolate lava cake which I don't see on the menu.  She doesn't like ice cream, so we ordered it with whipped cream instead, and a side of vanilla ice cream for me.  It was warm and good.  I'd come back here anytime although nothing blew me away about the place - definitely good enough where I have no complaints."}
{"text":"I came here with the wife for a quick dinner before a concert at the Music Hall and was quite impressed. The atmosphere is trendy, but not TOO trendy, with lots of exposed brick and music posters on the walls.   There's a very good beer list on a giant blackboard, and our server was pretty knowledgeable in that area.  I had the factory pizza (tomato sauce, mozzarella, pepperoni, house made spicy Italian sausage, red onion and hot peppers), and would recommend it as a solid option if you're a pizza fan -- and who isn't, really? Very big portions and the sausage and sauce really worked well together. The crust was also just the right mix of doughyness and firmness.  It wasn't very busy, even though it was Friday, so our server was very prompt and friendly.  So in summary, this is a great option if you find yourself on the Danforth."}
{"text":"I've come here twice. Because its so close to my Irish bars (Doras and the Black Swan) , I'm usually quite inebriated when I cross the threshold here. The place has a very eclectic atmosphere. Not quite the too cool for school of Queen West, but not exactly laid back either. Service can also really vary."}
{"text":"Dayum girl! Drop by for a super quick meal before a concert, and definitely happy my friend suggested this location!   Since we were on a time crunch before the concert, we ordered appetizers. I got the Mac n Cheese with sausage, and my friend got the Ahi Tuna Tacos. The mac n cheese was phenomenal! Amazing flavor, nice and cheesy, and pulled together wonderfully by the sausage! Highly recommend this one. The tacos were more like a salad in a wrap than tacos though. Good flavor, with amazing cole slaw and tuna, but it was just missing 'something' to tie it all together. Maybe something with a kick to round it out.  Service was pretty good, though she seemed quite busy and ran around a bit inside and out on the patio. It was a bit tough to get her attention, but she was still quick when we requested something. I will definitely be back if I'm ever in the area."}
{"text":"The vibe is fun and all but the food is WAY too overpriced for what it is. Their prices for substitutions are absurd.  Saying that it looks like they have good drink specials on Saturday-Monday. **Substitution I was referring to was gluten free pasta. An additional $4 for GF noodles is the most my friend has ever seen and she has been gluten free for years. In our opinion, the pasta price was already high at $18. The GF additional cost just made it too high and not the right value for what was served to us.  Hopefully that isn't absurd to other patrons."}
{"text":"Factory Girl is a gem of a restaurant, great food and drinks. Backyard patio is awesome. I have never had a bad meal there. Recent consumption was the rigatoni alla vodka. Wine selection is perfect for the menu.   This place is both just a great place to eat or have drinks at the bar. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Monday night during a concert and it wasn't too busy. I loved their patio as it was tucked behind their restaurant. Came with a party of 4 and we all ordered our individual pizzas. I found the crust too thin, but at least it was packed with toppings. Each pizza ranged from $15-$18 I believe. The servers were nice and attentive. Nice place if you want to get a drink before a concert as it's right beside the Danforth Music Hall."}
{"text":"This is a pretty standard Canadian-style/Italian restaurant.   Atmosphere is casual and service is friendly. We ordered the calamari appetizer, which was very good and I had the spicy sausage pasta and the Hubster had the smoked salmon wrap. I thought the pasta was just okay. Since the menu had such a focus on pastas and pizzas, I had higher hopes for it. The sauce didn't have the homemade flavour that I really enjoy. The Hubster didn't really like his wrap, but he finished it. It's likely his fault, since he doesn't like cream cheese that much and apparently doesn't really like smoked salmon. Fries were good.  They had a good selection of beers and lots of TVs which was a pleasant surprise, as the Hubster got to watch the hockey game during dinner.   We are not really likely to visit again."}
{"text":"We stopped in for some dinner and drinks on a Tuesday night.  We waited 10 minutes before our waitress finally greeted us and took our drink order. There was only one other table throughout our visit which was a party of two.   We then waited another 20 minutes and still no service for our dinner order. All three ladies were standing over near the bar completely ignoring us. My friend ended up walking out and leaving because this was just poor customer service. One very nice lady finally came over (not even our waitress) asked if everything was ok? I explained to her what happened and requested the manager. There was no manager on staff that night, and then I requested the supervisor who was in fact my waitress. I looked back over and she was still laughing and socializing with the other server. By this time I just wanted simply paid for my drink and leave. The one waitress did send her apologies and we discussed customer service and what should be a standard policy.  I get that it seemed to be a slow night but I strongly feel that the customer service needs to be looked into. What sucks is I had such high hopes as I have heard good things about this place.  We ended up down the street at Allen's for more pints and food, with excellent customer service."}
{"text":"Came up to the Danforth post pool, trying to find somewhere to eat with a patio on this gorgeous day.  I read online that Factory Girl has one, so we decided to check it out.  They do indeed have a patio - a big one, out back.  It had some sun and shaded areas, so it's good for everyone.  It was pretty quiet, as it was still late afternoon so the service was great.  We shared a few things.  The mac and cheese was excellent, though very rich.  Pulled pork tacos were also pretty good, as was the side of fries.  The only thing that fell flat was the caesar salad - not good at all.  Beer was reasonably priced, food was good and the patio was great.  I think this is a good little spot."}
{"text":"Great place - but WHY ARE THE NACHOS GONE???   We walked here from the annex and built up quite the appetite and were looking forward to devouring these... We made alternatives choices which were great, poutine, calimari and split a couple of pizzas.  All in all great patio and great service.  would definitely go back... and definitely definitely if they bring back the nachos...  please ?"}
{"text":"A last minute meal with a friend. We started with the bruschetta which was very oily. I ate one piece and didn't bother with the second. I had Sunday night's special, Ravioli. The pasta itself tasted as though it was low quality store bought and also was sitting in a shallow pool of oil. My Pepsi was good though."}
{"text":"So yummy. I had the Creamy Tomato Sauce Rigitoni with Pancetta, a la Vodka, Green Onion and Chilli. I loved it because it wasn't super creamy, but had that texture. It was so yummy that the waitress made fun of me because I had to finish the sauce and lick it clean.   It's a great bar/ restaurant atmosphere. We made a reservation for Friday night and it was super busy. The staff is friendly, and although the place was busy, we were never rushed (3 hrs!)  They have a great diverse menu, with an Italian focus (pasta and pizzas). Each one was so different, I can't wait to go back and try another (but tempted to have the one I had this time)  I've been told they also have a great brunch.   If you're in the area, definitely something check out. I would go out of my way to come here too!"}
{"text":"Literally the worst burger I've ever had.  I don't ask for much in a burger, and can usually pour enough condiments over a burger to cover the taste of a bad one....but really couldn't even finish the burger I had here. To be honest, I felt a bit cheated, too. The waitress casually asked \"fries or a side salad? As if I had to choose one.  I asked for the salad and when the bill came, it was $3.50 extra. Don't even get me started on how much the burger itself cost."}
{"text":"Nice little spot with a cool little patio out back. A nice choose of craft beers and to my delightful surprise they had goose island honkers which is originally from Chicago.  The waitresses were very nice and came back to check up on me quite often to see if I was good. ( by myself on a Saturday night) I ordered the pulled pork sandwich which was a good portion and definitely my fill of tasty fries.   If you ever have a concert to go to at the Danforth music Hall and in need of a meet up place or a pitstop before show time, this is where to go."}
{"text":"I made a last minute reservation but didn't really end up needing it... (A word of advice -- reserve over the phone rather than online if possible. The online form is not very intuitive.) That being said, it was a great experience! The décor of the store is fantastic, with a real theme, and the food is great value for the price.  The Summerlicious menu was delicious. It was simple but well done, and very reasonably priced. The perogies were a little on the under salted side but nothing a little salt can't fix. The salads were hearty and appropriately filling. The bread pudding was an incredible way to end the meal -- although a smaller portion (three small cubes of bread pudding served alongside strawberries and ice cream) -- as it was rich and soft on the inside with a crispy exterior.   The food was served slowly with some gaps between courses -- unexpected as per my Summerlicious experiences so far -- but gave us ample time for conversation over the meal.   Would definitely like to go back for the regular menu!"}
{"text":"My friends and I went for lunch and even though we didn't have a reservation we were seated as soon as we walked in. The decor was trendy without trying too hard. Our starter was the best calamari I've had - it was fried perfectly but didn't leave us feeling too heavy. I ordered the rigatoni a la vodka and I can honestly say it's one of the best pastas I've had since I was in Europe; so glad my server recommended it. My friend tried the macaroni and they did everything right. I'm already planning our next visit to try the wings! All in all, it was a fantastic meal at a great location - thanks Factory Girl!"}
{"text":"Another good place to stop on a Danforth pub-crawl. Foxy, awesome bartender chicks! Good layout. Teeny-tiny patio, perfect for people watching with your drink."}
{"text":"This is my 2nd visit to Factory Girl but 1st time I eat here.  I ordered the (Almost Famous) Mac 'n' cheese. I was shocked, stunned & confused when this small ceramic dish arrived with it. It wasn't even a deep dish! I had to ask the server if that was the entree one! It is. I felt duped! But I ate that pasta as slowly as I could, breaking down the food pieces into molecules....all in hope I would be filled.  I had 2 glasses of the Italian Pinot Grigio to help me forget this disappointment. Why must life be filled with disappointments? Food is a great pleasure! This is torture.  The server was efficient & professional.  But Almost Famous, you are most certainly not girl!"}
{"text":"Came here again on September 22nd for a show.  Decided on getting their Rigatoni ala Vodka since I noticed the menu indicated that \"people travel a long way for this\".  It was delicious!  Definitely going to come here again to try other things on their menu!"}
{"text":"came here for a date last Friday, great experience.  place was busy enough so it didn't feel awkward but roomy enough that we got a nice booth. There are some cool chairs and couches by the front, a good bar and table. Its got a really impressive setup, whatever your seating preference you should be able to find something.  drinks are a little cheaper here than other places, rum and coke was 5.25, most other places seem to be 5.50 doesn't make much difference but i'm noting it anyways.  the staff were nice all of them greeting us as we entered and when we left, the layout makes it easy to find your waiter should you require them.  to eat we got the nachos with Cajun chicken and a pizza with chicken and peppers on it, I can't remember what else was on the pizza.  the nachos were delicious, the best bar nachos I have had. Unfortunately though the Cajun flavor of the chicken although good is overpowered by the other flavors of the nachos. You get an absolutely massive plate.  the pizza was a good size, at least twice the size of the pizzas at brass taps for a point of comparison. the pizza was cheesy and the toppings equally delicious and in good order. It was a nice pizza.  the only bad part was that we underestimated the size of our pizza and spent the next 4 hours or so cradling our bursting stomachs, I don't think I have been so uncomfortably full in my life. This was completely my fault though and factory girl has absolutely no responsibility for this.  I'm gathering that the other food they make here is good too, they seem to know what they are doing and my experience was a good one."}
{"text":"My food was ordinary. My friend and I got the Maria pizza. It was not good, and we left about 1/3rd of it. My other friends got the Factory pizza, they said they really liked it. The beer selection is OK for a bar. The staff were friendly and polite, but didn't know much about the beer.   EDIT: George, my review was honest and reflects my opinion. However, I have updated it to better reflect my opinions, and that my other friends enjoyed their food more. The Maria pizza was unenjoyable, we left about 1/3rd of it. The beer selection is limited (imo), and the waitress was unable to answer my questions about the 2-3 of the beers I asked about. Attacking a customer's review in this manner will do more damage to FG than my average review will."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great for casual food & drinks with friends."}
{"text":"This is a rock-themed restaurant, nice vibe, but more for drinking with friends than for a meal.  Expect lots of noise and yelling, large groups abound - while we were here there was a guy with the most piercing, annoying laugh you've ever heard, going right through your innards.  Good thing about this place is that kitchen is open until late (we were there around 11pm).  We had the pulled pork poutine as appetizer, which were very good, though the gravy could have been more tangy - it tasted like from a jar.   I had their Mac'N'Cheese entree, but it was actually baked Zitti with alfredo/beschamel-like sauce, not your classic M'N'C.  Not bad, but not what I expected.  My girlfriend had the Chicken Marsala (sp?) which was a chicken breast in mushroom sauce with a side of wild rice - good, but nothing to write home about.    Overall good place for hanging out and drinks, and relatively decent food to go along with."}
{"text":"After going to Pilot Tavern, my friends and I headed to Factory Girl (well, we were supposed to go somewhere else, but that place was packed, so we ended up here).  I was glad we came here, because 1) service was great; 2) we got the back area to ourselves; 3) food was absolutely delicious!  We ordered the nachos and it was really filling.  I would REALLY recommend the yam fries -- they were soft, on the inside, and crispy on the outside with a delicious flavour.  Would definitely come back here if I lived in the Danforth area."}
{"text":"Wasn't expecting much. Went in a group of 6. Everyone was very happy.  Everything we tried was very tasty and fresh. Decent service. Would definitely return."}
{"text":"When we venture into the city to go to Greektown, we usually opt for Greek food. As we were meeting a relative who lived in the area, she recommended we try Factory Girl instead. Strictly based on her previous experience we decided to give this place a go and we're so glad that we did.  We sat in the front of the restaurant, at a table near the front window. The décor is exposed brick, warm woods, large open bar with a huge blackboard (listing the beers they stock)...just a very homey feeling. The menu is expansive, with something for everyone's taste buds. I already have my next meal planned. Our waitress was fantastic. She was over promptly and drinks arrived shortly thereafter. She told us the specials and recommended some dishes. Throughout the evening, she continually dropped by to check on us. Unfortunately her name was not on the receipt but she had short brown hair and worked the evening of Wednesday, March 26, 2014. Excellent service. One of us ordered a pasta dish (Agnolotti) in a red tomato cream sauce and she said it was delicious. 2 of us each ordered the Factory Girl pizza. It was cheese, homemade sausage, pepperoni, red onions and hot peppers. It was cooked to perfection and is in the top 5 of pizzas I've had at a restaurant. Portion size was massive and we ended up taking pizza home. We opted to not have dessert, as we were stuffed, although next time I'll indulge and have the bread pudding with vanilla ice cream. Great food, great staff, great menu, great atmosphere, decent prices, ideal location.....we'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"**2.5 stars**  Very homely meals.  Came here on a Friday for a late lunch/early dinner around 5pm, so of course it wasn't busy yet. There were a few men (probably regulars) at the bar, and maybe 2 more occupied tables. The creaky wooden floors invited us in, and a friendly server lead us in to a simple, rustic atmosphere with large chalkboard on the wall listing the wines and beers. Accompanying that were big black and white images/posters of Jimi Hendrix and other musicians.  Their menu consists of a variety of pastas in different sauces, sandwiches, and many pizzas, a selection of appetizers from nachos and wings to pulled pork poutine. Nothing really jumped out at my adventurous appetite, but finally settled on:  Soup of the Day- Mushroom Soup: $6.50 (3/5 stars) Don't get too excited, all you cream of mushroom fans! This one was in a clear broth with lots of mixed mushrooms, a generous serving of noodles, and some baby spinach leaves to wilt. Good, but being Chinese, we can make better!  Calamari w tzatziki: $10.95 (4/5 stars) Love the breading, fried to perfection, and served small bed of light greens dressed with balsamic (although it's too greasy to eat as a salad) . Other than that, nothing too special. It was a fairly large portion that can be shared as an app between 3-4 people.   Spaghetti Franco: 15.95 (3/5 stars) Spinach noodles with spicy sausage, diced tomatoes, broccoli, in a garlic olive oil sauce. At first, it seem to be a relatively small portion served in a shallow bowl, but they manage to pack a LOT in it! Again, very simple dish you can make at home.  Pulled Pork Poutine: 12.95 (3/5 stars) A little is a lot... and i don't mean in portion. In fact, it was quite a serving!  Just very simple yukon gold topped w/ cheese curds and gravy. But what separated this from others was the lack of bbq/pulled pork sauce!! The pork was roughly shredded (still in chunks with fats hanging off). REAL PORK FLAVOUR!  Service: (4/5 stars) Friendly, casual service. Helpful. Came by to check on us a few times and topped my water without asking. also got Magner's Irish Cider- hint of bitter herbal taste, which I personally like to cut the tart acidity I normally taste in say.. Strongbow.  While I was eating, there were a couple people who came in to order pizza to-go, so maybe they have really good pizza. Guess I'll have to come back!!   More people started coming in as we were leaving, so I assume it can get busy. But don't come if you want something fancy or adventurous, come if you want to sit back and enjoy a simple homely Italian meal!"}
{"text":"Went by this place for my first time on Sunday and was extremely pleased. Server was super friendly and helpful, I think her name was Ally or Ashley. Food and drinks were top notch and prices were very reasonable. Nice ambience and a great place to go for a date...or with two dudes on your softball team"}
{"text":"Really delicious and solid egg Benedict. Even more pleasing is they serve it with figs, strawberries and banana slices. Yum!   The salmon one is decent too but overly salty which kind of killed it.   Coffee was okay... Free refills but wasn't digging it.   Would definitely come back for their Benny. #worhthedrive"}
{"text":"Factory girl impressed me. I visited here for a friends birthday last year and split a pizza with my bf. I wasn't sure what to expect but must say we both thoroughly enjoyed it. There was about 10 of us and everybody enjoyed their meal. The food was great atmosphere was nice and relaxed.   I live in the beaches so it's not as close as I would like. Planning a return visit in the next couple of weeks for some beers and nachos. Definitely worth checking out if you're up in the Danforth area."}
{"text":"Nestled into the plethora of competition on Danforth, this small little bistro didn't do much to impress me.   First of all this place is for local traffic only as there is no free parking available, like many others on this particular strip. If I'm going to have to pay for parking I'd like to expect a decent experience However this venue seemed to really miss the mark for me. Marketed as a \"rock n roll\" bistro with the only real reflection of this being the pictures adorning the walls and the obvious name otherwise it was a rather stuffy little Italian bistro in my eyes and I did some researching prior as well.  The service is fast and fairly pleasant however there is a real rushed feeling here, maybe it's the limited seating I'm not sure but this isn't really a place id like to sit and enjoy company. I found it cramped, very dark... so dark that reading the menu was an actual issue for many guests in fact a few used their own phones to illuminate the menu. The setup of the seating was even more awkward with the only real highlight seeming to be the small back patio that looked quaint however it is awkwardly tucked in the back of this very small venue. The front patio is literally a sliver, I think it's supposed to be for \"people watching\" it's just very cramped with these cold metal tables and seating.   They have what seems like a wonderful bartender though it's hard to tell who is who as there are so many people behind the bar. They have a selection of kraft cocktails however none are sweet and again can vary in time and taste depending on who makes it.   The specials are pushed a fair bit but they are a tad expensive for what they offer, however they do have a fair bit of varying selection on they're menu. They do not do many if any substitutions which i understand is for convenience and prob time however there isn't a lot of personalization here. They offer fresh pepper and Parmesan only for certain dishes and actually suggest against using it in particular ones. I don't think that would have bothered me had I expected it but I didn't know it was such a fussy culinary destination when I chose to visit.  Lastly The owner appears to hang out at the location often, sitting at the bar and eating which I've never been a fan of. It's fine when other guests are getting served but when your servers attention is split between guests and the owner, that's just a little odd to me and something I rarely see.  Ultimately there are way too many amazing eateries in the area for me to bother going back here"}
{"text":"I came here for the Winterlicious menu - I was expecting something less casual, but the space inside is warm and inviting. I ordered the salad as a starter and it was very straightforward, but fresh. The Red Wine Soaked Beef Tenderloin cooked in extra virgin olive oil and served with fingerling potatoes and vegetables made the trek across downtown worth every frozen step. Absolutely delicious, hearty, and so succulent that I barely minded the lackluster dessert.   On to the chocolate mousse, which seemed a bit uninspired but certainly not offensive. My dining companion sampled this and advised me that it was better than the Tira Misu, which certainly doesn't commend that choice based on my mousse experience. Perhaps they can branch out here and take a few daring risks.  Very clean bathrooms bode well for sanitary standards in the kitchen."}
{"text":"This place is super fun!  I was fully impressed when a friend mentioned heading there for a girly work reunion.  If I hadn't mapquested the location, I would have walked right by it.  I'm so glad we didn't.  The back patio is not what you would expect from the front of house, or even the darker interior of the main restaurant/bar.  It's bright, airy and full of benches and flowers.  It's a great place to spend a Saturday afternoon with friends and a few pints.  The interior is dark, with deep wood benches and barstools and standard tables.  Thee theme is rock and roll, but when I hear Factory Girl, I think Warhol, so I was a bit disappointed not to see more Andy in there.  I was pleasantly surprised by the food on both visits.  The pizza is as true to Italian as you can get for a pub.  Thin crush, fresh ingredients and great sauce.  Their fresh soups and salads are crisp and much like the pizza, great for a pub.  As for the beer, they have a great selection on tap and in bottle.  It's a fun place to check out if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Gord and I had supper this evening at the Factory Girl.  We sat on the patio which was so nice.  Gord and I both ordered wings.  I got mine medium with fries and Gord got his cajun with onion rings.  We both enjoyed our meals and would get them again.  Emilie was our server.  She was friendly and took good care of us."}
{"text":"Big fan of Factory Girl. We have been a few times, great patio outback.  Fried calamari was pretty tastyyyyy!  I had one of the pizzas, which is in the Italian/thin crust style. I believe it was the sausage and onion (forgive me, i am catching up on my reviews)... very generous portions on both. quite the beer/wine list...it is displayed on chalkboards, i love that effect in restaurants :)  Definitely worth a stop if in Greektown. Now that I've written this review, may have to take a stop by there this weekend!"}
{"text":"If I was a girl/guy that worked in a factory, I would expect my meal to be hearty or at least special in some way. And if I was dining at place called Factory Girl, I would expect the same of the food there. My wife and I ordered 2 Pasta Entres @$18 each (Mac & Cheese + Rigatoni a la Vodka). Both were on the small side and I left still hungry. Pasta is on par with what you would get at a good wedding or banquet. Not to say they were bad, but certainly not special. Crossing the $15 mark for a pasta, it should be special ie prepped with good ingredients, have a good portion of protein or just be really unique. The Pasta there is not that. Seating is plentiful, drink list has lots of options and the servers are nice. If you are on the Danforth, you have a lot of options at that price, and that's my point. Allens is two steps over, 7Numbers is close and all of greek town is down the street. I didn't try the sandwiches or pizzas but perhaps I should if there is a next time."}
{"text":"I've dined here three times. The first two times were decent dining experiences. This review though is reflective of all my visits, including my wife's most recent visit.   The atmosphere at Factory Girl is really nice. It suits my tastes. The restaurant is pretty comfortable, it's decorated well and quite clean. It has a decent patio in the back. A perfect setting if the weather is just right.   The food was fair. I don't recall it being amazing but I do remember it being good. Burgers, sandwiches, fries and the like. Unfortunately with the food comes service that could be better. Everytime I go the service is painfully slow. Poor customer service, decent food and a nice setting only gets this place 2/5 stars. Go to Allens or Globe Bistro instead where they do atmosphere, customer service and food the right way."}
{"text":"Factory girl is a great spot for a casual dinner!   Lots of choices, fast service .... but the real winner here is the almost-famous Mac and cheese! (Which I didn't even order but I tried my friend's, but wow I'm sure it will be famous very soon!)   My eggplant sandwich and sweet potato fries were also delicious, but nothing compared to the mac and cheese :)"}
{"text":"The 3 of us arrived at noon during the taste of the danforth. We sat on the back patio to have appetizers and drinks.  Caesars and Stella were great. We had the Cajun chicken nachos and anti pasto plate. Fantastic. Everything was fresh and tasty. More than enough food for 3 people.   Our server was Jessie and she was awesome. We will be back for sure"}
{"text":"I popped into Factory Girl with two friends for a quick snack after a show at the Danforth Music Hall down the street. We'd had a couple beers at the show so were just looking for some water and something quick and greasy to fill our stomachs before heading back to the west end.   Between the three of us we split a small mac and cheese and a side of fries. We thought, if we need more, we'll order more. But, both items arrived at our table as pretty sizeable portions and we were sated enough to survive the journey home. The fries were crispy and the mac and cheese was so buttery I would have died a happy death if it gave me a heart attack right there on the spot.   Other thoughts:   + Front and back patio, yay! + Surprisingly large space with multiple rooms. Would be great for a large group gathering. + Alanis Morissette portrait indicates which is the woman's bathroom. Alanis forever."}
{"text":"Super cute spot in greektown with a great selection of beers and yummy high quality pub grub. Great place to grab a meal and a drink before a concert at the danforth music hall!"}
{"text":"The service was a little shoddy; not the most friendliest servers, especially that one blonde b***** who looked at you as if she was better than you even though you just wanted her to bring you a water.   THEN the extra $3.00 charge for getting two sauces on a 2lbs wings order. Seriously??! That's $26.99 for 2lbs of mediocre wings!!!! (Mind you, this charge is not noted on their menu and our server didn't not mention this to us either). Total rip-off. Those two things alone will never get me back to eat at this establishment.   Note: Maria pizza was alright, the Daniel was meh."}
{"text":"Oozing with ambiance and I can't hear enough of the Beatles!!!!......everything my girlfriend and I ordered was incredible! The best mac n cheese with sausage in Toronto! Pizza extraordinaire also! Little get together this weekend with my girlfriends' girlfriends..... and we will definitely be going here!"}
