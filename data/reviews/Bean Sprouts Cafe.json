{"text":"I was making a route to do some shopping in Madison and Middleton, and planned a stop at the highly-rated Prairie Cafe and Bakery (http://www.yelp.com/biz/prairie-cafe-and-bakery-middleton), since it was on my shopping route.  However, when I looked, the cafe was empty (apologies to Jay & The Americans).  Then again, it was Memorial Day, so that made sense.  I looked for another place to eat, and I found this place.  There was a sign outside advertising soups, sandwiches, and wraps.  I was planning on having a sandwich anyways, so I decided to stop in.  I went on in, and was surprised by what I saw!  I didn't know ahead of time that this was a kid-friendly place, but I really enjoyed it (even though I'm 23).  There were a lot of cute decorations, and the menu was kid-friendly (and adult-friendly), as well.  There are a lot of options for vegans and vegetarians (including soy milk), and any sandwich can be made with gluten-free bread for an extra dollar.  There are also casein-free options, as well.  The food is a little expensive for a fast-casual establishment - Panera has sandwiches available for $5.50 to $7.00, and also has vegetarian options.  There is no separate menu for kids and adults, but there are three separate portion sizes - kids ($5.25), adult ($7.95), and \"big daddy size\" ($9.50).  There is also organic baby food available, at $2.50 per portion.  Wanting something vegetarian (I'm not strict, but I don't like eating meat at every meal), I ended up ordering the Spinach with Gruyere Cheese and hummus wrap.  You get your choice of a side (banana octopus (which is a banana shaped like an octopus, with no octopus meat), edamame, grape kebob, or roasted sweet potatoes).  I ended up getting the roasted sweet potatoes.  The food came about 15 minutes after I ordered it.  The restaurant wasn't busy, so I was surprised it took so long.  I did have the newspaper with me, so I wasn't bored.  The food was very good.  The spinach wrap was very warm and tasty, and so were the sweet potatoes (which were mashed sweet potatoes).  The portion size for the sweet potatoes was a bit small, though.  I also noticed that there were plenty of toys for the children to play with, along with two family-size bathrooms (complete with changing tables, butt wipes, and small toilets for toddlers and young children to set on).  The child-sized door at the front of the restaurant was very cute, as well.  The restaurant also has cooking classes for the young ones, and they're opening a new location at the Madison Children's Museum once the remodeling is done over there.  I would rate this place 3.5 stars.  The food was good, but it was slightly overpriced, and the wait was too long for this type of establishment.  However, for anyone with young children, or any people on a vegan/vegetarian/gluten-free diet, I would give this 4.5 stars.  This is an excellent place to take small children, and is a great alternative to McDonald's and Chuck E Cheeses.  In addition, very few places have vegan and gluten-free options, so it's great for those people as well.  Therefore, it averages out to a 4-star restaurant."}
{"text":"Loved this super kid friendly cafe! The cashier was extra nice and accommodating which made our experience that much better. They have awesome healthy options for kids like hummus guacamole dip. If that's not your thing, they also have some pizza! There is also some adult options.   This is right at the entrance of the Arizona Science Center. So it's a good place to have a lunch or snack while spending your day there."}
{"text":"We decided to hang out in here and wait for our 12pm planetarium show after walking around the science center.   We ordered the special they were having which was either a cheese ($6) or pepperoni pizza ($7) with a small lemonade. The employee who took our order was very friendly and the cafe was very clean throughout.   We were given a buzzer and told to find a table. We waited about 10 minutes for our pizza to be ready and then the buzzer went off. We asked for ranch but the lady said they didn't have any, boo.   We sat down and dug in! The pizza was so good! It definitely tasted fresh and not frozen. It was very cheesy and the crust was to die for. After our pizza was done, we decided to order the mango smoothie and that was delicious!  Prices are a little on the pricier side but hey, the items we had were definitely worth it! We had several employees come on over and ask us how we were doing and that made our experience that much better!   Thank youuuu"}
{"text":"As expected for a children's museum cafe. Our tuna sandwich didn't come with avocado and tomatoes, like we ordered, so we brought it to the attention of one of the employees preparing the food. She said \"we don't have any sliced tomatoes at the moment. We have whole, but not sliced. I can slice some for you BUT it will take a while.\" Umm  all we could do was LOL. Thanks, anyway. Sorry to trouble you."}
{"text":"Bean Sprouts cafe is a-ok. Located inside the Arizona Science Center it makes for a convenient choice to grab a bite. I love that they have healthy items in the menu as well. I ordered a salad with quinoa and veggies. I forgot to order chicken with it but it ended being just fine for a quick and light bite. The have sandwiches,smoothies and other items just for kids. I'd say it's a 3 for the food... But I am additional star for letting us post up and work out of the cafe for severalHours. And a shoutout to Anthony who was running g the register and kitchen area. He's a five-star employee and was super helpful to us while we were there after hours setting up for a large event at Science Center."}
{"text":"Awesome!  Good for you, yummy food for kids and parents.   Extended winter hours and a drive-through would be great! It's now located in the childrens museum.  Probably doing much better there... ... And now has moved to Chicago."}
{"text":"I was a nanny for a while and spent a lot of Friday afternoons at Bean Sprouts! It's such a great concept and so kid friendly. Their menu is slightly pricey and I sometimes couldn't put the baby down to toddle around because the floors were a little too dirty, but overall they do a great job.  They often only had one person working and I think were fairly new, so I can totally understand why things maybe weren't as organized as I might have hoped.    My little ladies LOVED their Mac and Cheese and Banana Octopus.  The food tasted great and they had a nice adult menu as well.  The healthy options were fabulous and really appreciated that they offered chocolate soy milk.    The kids loved being able to play while we waited for the food, and there were often other mothers and children there for them to play with too.  The counter girl soon knew me and the girls by name and I really appreciated feeling recognized.    The desserts were great too and we often spent over an hour there just enjoying our time and lingering over the food.  I miss my time there!"}
{"text":"Very Cute Place! I stopped by at 11am on a weekday for a smoothie, and the place was empty. The staff, though, was very friendly and took pride in their work. My smoothie was great -- made with realy fruit and yogurt and served in a 100% recycled cup. Loved the decorating inside. A great , environmentally-friendly, tasty lunch place for kids and adults alike."}
