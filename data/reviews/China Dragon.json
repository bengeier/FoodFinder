{"text":"China dragon oops
Let me try egg foo young
And boy it is goood for me this place is 5 star on my level of egg foo young in vegas, i tried the combination egg foo young .clean place n not pricey"}
{"text":"Fast delivery and delicious! Totally hit the spot...I will definitely order here in the future."}
{"text":"This is the best Chinese Take Out around Bedford! The food is always good and they deliver so quick!  You can even place your order online with your credit card and have it delivered.  The owners are very friendly and  the restaurant itself is spotless.  Vegetables with Garlic Sauce really good and love their pork fried rice and potstickers."}
{"text":"Truth be told I ordered from China Dragon because I could do it online, it was long out of the way but I liked the fact if I placed the order online there wouldn't be any mistakes. They had my order ready with no errors. Very nice when I walked in and confirmed the order. 

The food was, unfortunately, not very good. Nothing was undercooked, nothing was wrong, but the flavor was just sub par. I asked for the Kung Pao chicken to be spicy (compared to the default of Medium) and it was nearly flavorless with no spice. 

I imagine they are catering to the normal clientele but it's a shame. 

Lot of potential, just need to go back to true seasoning."}
{"text":"I would like to start off by saying that the food is good, however the last couple of times that I have ordered the driver was late (40 minutes late), food was cold. On top of being late the gentleman has been rude. The guy says he gets lost not sure how as he has been delivering to our residence one or twice a month for the last year. Sadly I will be finding a new restaurant to order from which is unfortunate because I do enjoy the food when it's delivered in a timely manner."}
{"text":"Best deal ever... They deliver for $2 if ur 4 miles away, no minimum amount :) we always eat hear and they have big portions for small price"}
{"text":"I ordered the pu pu platter and bit into the chicken wing and a string of hair was in the wing. I called China Dragon, and she stated that wasn't possible to have hair in the wing, My problem with that is I'd been giving them plenty of business, since I moved here and they didn't want to take responsibility for this problem. I will not order from them ever again."}
{"text":"I ordered my normal sesame chicken and egg roll. First i ordered and they said 10 min. I got there in 10-15 min they asked what i ordered and then they started cooking it right in front of me. The big issue was that type of chicken is not supposed to be extremely hot it had tons of red peppers in it. So way too hot. The parts that did not have the hot sauce on it the chicken was not good. also it was supposed to have fried rice which it did but they must not of cleaned out the pan cause it also had a few lomein noodles with it. So not going there again."}
{"text":"I've gone here a lot. But   Last tues I ate chow Mein beef  after 2 hrs at work I start getting nauseous   Start throwing up     Till now it's already Thursday I feel that way .. can't eat and sit up too long .. this happened to my Other co workers too..  its horrible feeling for sure I won't  ever come again.. u guys need to be careful when u prepare food.. I have to call out for work. .. this should be check by  health department .. it's horrible   Scares me to eat  out for now .."}
{"text":"Love this place! Fresh and well prepared Chinese food. Family owned business. It's a great place to eat with great prices. We usually do takeout. The inside is pretty old but the food is great"}
{"text":"The food is always delicious! They went a little too heavy on the curry beef on my last order, but I would still go back."}
{"text":"I like the food a lot here. It is priced well and the food is good. Delivery is fast and they offer nice specials on family meals."}
{"text":"The food tasted good and staff were nice but we found like 3 long hairs in our food which got gross so we all just threw the rest of the food out. Maybe hairs were just a'sheddin."}
{"text":"This is a consistently excellent take out Chinese place. I heartily recommend the hot sour soup (it is veggie based) and the chicken with garlic sauce."}
{"text":"i've been going here for 6yrs now.:) this is my Go to place for good chinese food take out!:) the people are nice and friendly!:) the food is good and the price is reasonable.:) i dont mind driving 15mins to go here!:)"}
{"text":"Rude service!! Food is extremely bland.  And it's over priced.  Delivery takes an hour. Won't be going again."}
{"text":"First time eating here. Food was meh, nothing too special. Portions were good. The service had room to be improved. I had Sweet and Sour pork and all they did was cook some pork and pour sweet and sour all over it. Was originally expecting the pork to have been cooked with the sauce like it shows in the picture on their menu. I don't think that's worth the $9 price tag. Not a big fan."}
{"text":"We ordered very basic fried rice dishes. They're reasonably priced but very very bland. I'll give them another shot with other menu items but with the fail of this simple dish I won't know what to expect."}
{"text":"Visiting son & d-i-l in Bedford.  D-i-l insisted i try this place.  Son had Double Cooked Roasted Pork, i had Special Pad Thai noodles (shrimp, beef, chicken, veggies, extra spicy) & we split the seafood hot&sour soup.  For some reason, the Pad Thai noodles do not appear on the online menu, but can be ordered on the phone.  Everything was great, portions large enough for 2 meals.  Never had Pad Thai from a Chinese restaurant before;  was outstanding!!  Next time, want to try the Singapore Chow Mei Fun [spicy]  (my usual dish in StLouis is Singapore Spicy Noodles, heavy on the curry).
Agree w/ FaTyma P; getting in, out of the parking area was a challenge; will just call for delivery next time."}
{"text":"We live very close to this establishment. Online ordering makes things easy and efficient. I've gotten the food  unbelievably fast most times. Hunan chicken is amazing.  I'm personally not a huge fan of the chicken teriyaki, but that doesn't necessarily mean avoid it."}
{"text":"Good place for fast Chinese food if you're in the general area. Lots of different dishes to choose from. Lunch and dinner combos. Food doesn't taste overly greasy or salty. Just about right."}
{"text":"I order delivery and its very fast and friendly always tip... Great service.. They give u a large amount of food & is clearly cooked when ordered..I like to order fried chicken wings and rice the wings are so big and seasoned well love it...and love that's its online ordering also"}
{"text":"If I were you I would go the dumpster behind panda express and eat their trash, it would without a doubt taste better. The pad thai is bland, while the sesame chicken taste like it was baked in a pigs anus. I will admit the only thing I finished was the crab rangoon, it was a mediocre at best. I highly recommend passing on this place."}
{"text":"This place is horrible. The owner is rude and unprofessional. My brother was looking at the menu and he just kept asking if we were ready over and over again. Food is waaaaaay overpriced. My brother finally got his food but regretted his decision after the first bite. He asked for an exchange or refund and was told to call the police if he didn't like his food! Really? We kindly informed him that since he didn't have any signage he needed to exchange the food. This place is horrible please do yourself a favor and go elsewhere. Worst part is it was our first experience there!"}
{"text":"Driver yelled at me because he can't read the gate code that was clearly typed on the instructions and even on the receipt that was on the bag. Horrible experience won't be ordering again"}
{"text":"I order here all the time, but this will probably be my last. The fried chicken was soggy and cold, the kung pao shrimp was under cooked. There usually on point but I'm not sure what happened. On top of it the delivery driver argued with me over a tip I had paid online in advance but kept asking me to tip more as this went on letting my animals run out the door. Very disappointed maybe next time it'll be better.."}
{"text":"Best \"go to\" place for Chinese. Best lunch specials around. Always ready in 10-15 minutes. Owners are always friendly and will make any food as hot as you like it. 
Sure the place could use a face lift but that is up to the building owner and not the cooks! New owner of the buildings in town is forcing all the good stores owners out with high rent. It will be a shame if we lose the best Chinese around. 
Love the kung pao chicken and general."}
{"text":"The General's chicken wasn't bad.  Had some good flavor.  Could have been just a touch spicier.  The dumplings were good.  The fried rice (we ordered pork) was just meh.  The delivery was faster then they said on eat24.  I would order again as most places here on the south side are pretty meh and this one was better."}
{"text":"Good food and decent quantity. One of my go to places when I'm tired after working my 12 hr shifts and don't feel like going home to cook to feed the family"}
{"text":"not the best i ever had but it's really good food  friendly owners fast. most people take out not much of an eat in place."}
{"text":"Came in for my second time, and they did it again! The lunch special is phenomenally priced. Under $7 + tip for a huge portion of the dish, fried rice, and chow mein. Plus an app of egg drop soup. Great food and awesome prices."}
{"text":"Probably the best Chinese food in the area. Honestly it's the best fried rice I've ever had and such flavorful food! They always are quick if you have a pick up order and deliver which is amazing because the food is still nice and hot when it arrives. One of my favorite places to eat when I'm feeling Chinese food and the only fried rice I eat anymore!"}
{"text":"I usually don't write reviews, but I think these people desever a 5 star rating!!!  
This is my all time favorite chinese place to go to!!!!
I've tried many other places in the area, I still think they serve the best Chinese food!!! 
Extremly large portions, very flavorful which is what I care about the most. The ingredients are very fresh as well. 
Fast delivery. Owner is extremly friendly, sometimes I go in for take out. 

Favorite app:
Fried chicken wings
Chincken and beef on the sticks
Pot stickers
Woton soup is very yummy!!!

Favorite entrees:
General Tso's chicken
Saseme chicken
(sometime I will order tofu instead of chicken, they are delicious too)
Shrimp egg foo young 
Sweet & sour chicken
Hunan Shirmp/chicken
Pepper steak
Happy family

Favorite Noodles:
I am a big fun of any type of noodle pretty much. Lomein are always nice.
They also serve great Pad Thai as well, I believe this is not on their menu, you have to ask them about it.

I know I listed a lot, cause I've been going this place for more than a year now, I 've pretty much tried everything on the menu. So there are definitly a lot more things that I like. 

Over all, If you live around Bedford area, this is something that you don't want to miss out."}
{"text":"This is my go to Chinese place when I'm hungry at work, they have the best lunch specials ever. Good price, good food, nice people. Everything you need to have a good lunch break"}
{"text":"Lunch special for $6 comes with egg drop soup and a huge portion of food. Kung pao chicken was delicious."}
{"text":"The restaurant was clean and tidy. We ordered the lunch specials of General Chicken and Kung Pao chicken. They were made fresh on the spot. The rice was also fresh and delicious. I would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"This is my favorite carry out Chinese place in town.
They do a couple things better than the other places around. I LOVE their eggrolls. They're not out-of-your-mind amazing but they're consistently great and delicious. I love their chicken entrees as well (sesame, general tao's). The black bean chicken is always great. Their dinner combo makes for an easy meal with leftovers that's worth the price."}
{"text":"Decent food. Smaller proportions than what I am used to. The General Tso chicken is about the best thing that they serve. Fast delivery but I am in walking distance."}
{"text":"China Dragon rules! This place was prompt and amazingly quick with my take out order. Not only were the portions huge, the food was also delicious!

Will be returning soon and highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Good neighborhood Chinese food. They offer very quick service and great portions for the price. I rated 3 stars because it's not the best local owned Chinese I've ever had, but it's good and consistent. I've been here several times- in person and delivery and I will be going back. The only item I can't stand behind is their egg roll."}
{"text":"The people who gave this place such high ratings do not know what good Chinese food is. You should go to Bobo China on Sahara and Durango and see what good Chinese food tastes like. I'm bummed I wasted my money. Still looking for good Chinese food on the South side of town. :("}
{"text":"Really good place this place beats any Chinese food place in Vegas it's big portion and very affordable my kids and me love coming here"}
{"text":"We drove around for ages and finally stumbled upon this place. It turned out to be delicious! The Kung Pao Chicken my husband ordered was just the right amount of spice and flavor. I ordered the orange chicken and was equally impressed. I expected it to taste much like the famous 'chain' Chinese places but was much better with a deeper flavor. We definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Definitely above average. The Ta Chien Chicken is perfect. I have been there about a dozen times and it has been great every time"}
{"text":"DO NOT ORDER! I have had multiple times where they have completely messed up my order. The customer service here is crappy. The food is ok but it is not worth the headache."}
{"text":"Staff was friendly but food was not good. Chow mein didn't have taste as well as their fried rice. Chow fun also had no taste maybe due to the fact there was more vegetables than noodleswhich were also mushy. Don't think the family and I will be going there anymore."}
{"text":"This is the second time ordering from here.  Always quick and always fresh.  Delicious food and the Singapore noodles are awesome!"}
{"text":"I ordered lobster fried rice and shrimp egg rolls that was good.  I will eat from there again."}
{"text":"I order from China Dragon when I'm at work in Solon and they deliver all the way from Bedford, so there's brownie points right off the bat (I give them a $5 tip or better). The food is consistently good, reasonably priced, and large enough portions that I can warm up the leftovers for lunch the next day. I am a big fan of this place, as there are no Chinese delivery places in Solon."}
{"text":"Combo appetizer plate was well worth it very delicious,  shrimp fried rice was tasty,  ordered on  Yelp  wss ready when we arrived and as stated,  we were able to pick pick up time,  menu variety is great."}
{"text":"These people could care less about customer service, I received the wrong order and called them to figure out a resolution; this bitch on the phone said hurry I have other customers!?!?!? They don't care about customer service at all!!!!"}
{"text":"I had the RUDEST delivery driver ever !!!!! I ordered food at work and they told me he would be here by 1pm. I was gonna go outside around 12:45 but he came early. So he ended up walking trough my job to look for me! Then had a attitude and was very rude because I wasn't outside ! Proceeded to slap my food down and yell the price. I will NEVER EVER EVER eat here again !!! Plus the food isn't that great !"}
{"text":"I've ordered from here twice using eat24. Both times I ordered the chicken teriyaki with fried rice. Decent price and large portion. It had zucchini broccoli and carrots for the veggies. Not drowning in teriyaki sauce, but enough for good flavor. 

My coworker ordered the Hong Kong chow mein. The portion was huge. Never had it before & didn't try it. As for presentation, the noodles were a single piece (the size of the styrofoam container) and not broken into smaller pieces. The broth came in a separate large container. I liked this, as one could portion some and save the rest for later. As for taste, she said it was okay. 

The first time the delivery was super fast- less than 10 minutes. But the restaurant is located across the street, so not too surprising. The second time delivery was a bit longer (maybe the driver was on a route), but still in the said time frame eat24 posted. Both times the food was hot and well packaged for delivery."}
{"text":"Love that they deliver. Never messed up an order :) always friendly. Wong ton soup always yummy"}
{"text":"First time for ordering from this restaurant and it was amazing.  The menu and food is exact what they are advertising.  Our delivery was on time and our dinner was still hot."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and like others have said, I love that their lunch specials are good on Sunday unlike some other restaurants. They give you the choice of fried rice or chow main or half and half with your meal. And above everything else, the food was really good. Some restaurants that have the lunch specials make pretty basic and plain fried rice but this place has good rice with more than just rice. And like others have said I took half home with me. I don't know how anyone could eat everything they give you. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Don't know why the reviews are so poor. I have always had great service and great food at a reasonable price. Always enough left over for the next day."}
{"text":"My second visit. Wonton Soup is amazing! Very hot, great flavor, is like is supposed to be. 
The Crab Rangoons, wow! Not greasy at all. Really good.
Fruit smoothie and Thai Tea with boba really good."}
{"text":"Wow, got the family combo and the wonton soup was delicious . My kids are very picky eaters, surprised they tried the soup. Great customer service.."}
{"text":"Was not good... the best thing about my meal was the fortune cookies. I didn't know you could mess up fried rice."}
{"text":"the worst . I ordered  early . im sure they gave me yesterdays leftovers. overcooked, bland  , uneatable,  no second chance. it was that bad"}
{"text":"The first thing I noticed upon walking in was the large menu behind the register; a lot of options if that's what you like. You order at the register then the kitchen makes the order. It's not like the \"express\" places where food is sitting under the heat lamp.

I ordered the Sesame Chicken to-go, which was brought out within 5-10 minutes. My order included 2 large \"Chinese take out\" boxes. One with the chicken and the other with steamed white rice. The chicken was good, nothing that stands out in particular though. The steamed rice was a little overcooked for my tastes, but it was easy to look past. I'll definitely come back if I'm in the area and looking for some quick Chinese food."}
{"text":"This place is meant for take out I wouldn't really reccomend coming here to sit down for dinner unless styrofoam cups and plastic soup cups are your thing. The food on the other hand is fantastic, super falvorful and huge portions. I always get the mongolian beef however the last few times I've ordered I've been telling them to tune down on the spicyness. One time it was just way to much."}
{"text":"I can't say anything negative about the 4+ occasions I ordered from here. Excellent food. Great flavor. Great price for lunch special. You get tons of meat. I get 2 meals out of it. Friendly staff. Quick too. Just awesome all around. Egg foo young is yummy and love general tso's!!"}
{"text":"I love the general chicken here so much.  It's delicious.  Portions are great, they are fast and friendly.  Good price, too"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch, they have very cheap and delicious lunch specials. We also tried the pop stickers which were really good. The quality of the meat isn't the best but it's a good cheap lunch place to stop at every so often. We got the Mongolian beef and broccoli and beef, both cake with soup as well."}
{"text":"We where looking for a place to eat after a long flight. Something affordable and tasty. We came to the right place. It was close to the airport also"}
{"text":"Horrible!!  Horrible service. Didn't think to recommend Family Dinner options which would have been a better deal. Either way sub par chinese food. I would rather go to Panda Express. Yeah, it's that bad!"}
{"text":"I eat here often, the food is very consistent and priced fairly, less than $5 for many lunch specials."}
{"text":"Normally, in order to get any kind of quality Chinese food, I need to travel to Parma Heights or to downtown or to Independence. This place is right around the corner, and the food is quality and delicious. I find myself going here at least once a week. I go here so often that the lady behind the counter knows my order by heart (General Tso Chicken, white rice, 2 egg rolls) I have yet to try something that I truly dislike.
A few times I've gone here, however, I was given fried rice when I asked for white rice, but I'm chalking that up to relative miscommunication. The people behind the counter are very very friendly, and will accommodate you."}
{"text":"Clean place, really good food, really friendly cashier, reasonably priced.  Will recommens to my friends."}
{"text":"Meh at best. Rude and over priced. We need a decent place in this area for Chinese. I will go back for the only reason that they are the only one close."}
{"text":"This is a good Chinese food place. I go in frequently for Thai teas. Tonight was the first time ordering take out. It was really reasonable. 22.00$ two entrees and a side of rice including tip and delivery."}
{"text":"So it has been 1 hour and 10 minutes and I'm still sitting in the lobby waiting for the delivery.   They told me 45 minutes.  I wanted to make sure the driver wasn't waiting for me so I came down exactly 40 minutes after the phone call.  After 15 minutes I called and they said the driver had already left.  I doubled checked they got the right address and hotel and she said yes.  The restaurant is only 3.5 miles away.  Still waiting.  2:42 pm they're here.  Ordered placed at 1:20pm. I didn't have any cash on hand and they're credit card device only allowed a no tip, 15%, or 20%.  I didn't really want to leave a no tip but 15% really?!!  That's a 6.50 delivery tip for being 45 minutes late! And my soda was completely watered down by then. Well on to the food.  I ordered 1 teriyaki bowl, 1 chicken chow mein, 1 broccolli beef lunch special, 1 general chicken lunch special and 1 walnut shrimp.  The teriyaki bowl was a really good size for only $4.50.  A good amount of rice, meat and veggies and sauce.  Both lunch specials came with Fred rice and chow mein noodles.   A good amount.  The broccolli beef was good, but the general chicken was not good. Tiny pieces of meat covered with soggy batter and not much flavor and not a single kick of spice.  And the walnut shrimp?? TeRRIBLE! Just like the general chicken the shrimp was covered in battered and soggy.   It probably got all soggy being in the container for over an hour delivery wait.  And there was no flavor.  The sauce that was as supposedly on the shrimp was all watered down.  The shrimp was in a pool of watered down mayo sauce.  The chow mein was ok. I wouldn't have ordered it if I knew the lunch specials came with it.  Could use more flavor.  I won't be ordering from here again.  It wasn't my first choice,  but the other restaurant didn't deliver.  $50 spent on sub par chinese food.  I should of just went to panda express across the street and spend half the amount. But i do agree with other reviews that their portion size is good. I would give 1 star for the general chicken and  0 for the walnut shrimp.   But the teriyaki bowl and portion size were good.  So an overall 3."}
{"text":"Basically I have to give 5 stars when comparing to other chinese take aways.Food is good quality and they have super fast delivery(25-35min Max)"}
{"text":"Reluctant to even give 1 star. Ordered food for delivery, took 90 minutes and I wouldn't feed my war sue gai to a dog. Crab Rangoon was very undercooked, dognuts tasted like they fried in same fryer with chicken. Worst food experience I've had to date."}
{"text":"Wanted something new so we tried this spot!  Was a little spot next to h&r block.  We had dinner and there was no combos, just like a plate of orange chicken to share.  I wanted to order a plate of half noodles half fried rice but the cashier said they don't do that, lame!  So we just got rice and shared.  Chicken was tasty!  Beef and broccoli was fresh!  Very good food just wished I could order like a combo plate for myself."}
{"text":"If you like getting only half of your order, and what you did get was burned! Than this is the the place for you! If not, run away! Run fast, run far!!!! I knew I was in trouble when I picked up the order and all three cooks were to busy talking on the phone to pay attention to what they were doing!! HANG UP AND COOK!!!! Never again!"}
{"text":"The driver yelled at me because he couldn't type in the gate code very aggressive during delivery, he yelled and said \"next time you tell me correct code\" proceeded to put his hand on my shoulder in an intimidating fashion. 
No need to touch me. 
Now the food.  The food was of the worst quality it was honestly terrible.  I've had Chinese food all over the country this has been the worst utterly disappointing and terrible. After complaining to GrubHub they sent back the  driver he walked into my house uninvited and I apologize but that is terrible imagine my wife was alone? She would shoot him.  This is not how you run a restaurant"}
{"text":"So disappointed. I ordered veggie fried rice and mixed veggies in garlic sauce. 

The rice didn't seem fried at all. It had very little seasoning and lacked flavor. The garlic sauce was also bland, and not spicy at all like the menu indicated. The veggies were soft and a bit cold, even though we got there right when the food was ready. I also tried a spring roll. Again, lacked flavor. 

Everything just seemed bland, generic, and like maybe it was all premade. I won't be returning."}
{"text":"I have been searching for a good Chinese place around my work and i finally found one. I ordered the sweet and sour chicken for lunch. The delivery was super fast and my food was hot. It was SO GOOD!! There was so much food that I had lunch for two days!"}
{"text":"Really good food for the price and it came faster than I expected as a truck driver I have been to quite a few places it's not the best I've ever had but it was great flavor and very decently priced I would definitely recommend them and would definitely order from them the next time I'm in town"}
{"text":"Not bad for your quick Chinese food fix. You can feed 2-3 people for $25. Minus one star because they forgot one of our entrees, but they were able to quickly give it to us to go."}
{"text":"Even though this is just normal Chinese take out, it always seems to taste a little bit better than the other run of the mill take out joints. Their egg rolls definitely don't have that normal take out frozen cardboard taste, they taste delicious and fresh. The service here is super quick. I live close to here and I can pretty much call and by the time I get there it will be ready to go. This has quickly become my favorite quick Chinese place"}
{"text":"I have not seen such immature, selfish, service. I had never been in before, we asked what we should order that will provide the most food for our dollar, the manager didn't recommend anything specific. We ordered almost $40 worth of entrees. After ordering we noticed they had a family dinner special that would've provided more extensive amount of food and would have included the chow mein instead of rice which we were going to get charged and extra $3. We confronted the manager why he didn't offer that deal and he laughed in our face! I have never seen such service at a food establishment. When given the food there was no apology or confronting of the issue. The food was subpar at best, especially for the pricing. I highly recommend you do not support such an establishment."}
{"text":"I might have been doing some smokin , but this was one of the best meals I've had from this style of Chinese Restaurant. 
I ordered the Singapore Mei Fun , Hot and Spicy soup and Egg Roll. (Told ya I was smokin)
Every bit of food was prepared very well, tasted very fresh and left me wanting more. The portions were perfect size and I'll have left overs thanks to my stuffed belly. 
If they Keep this up and they'll be around a long time. 
Also the service was efficient and the food was made quickly. 
The price felt like you were getting a steal! Bravo! 
I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Delivery was fast. But that's it. I ordered chicken mei fun. The whole order smelled like old fish. I travel the whole fucking world for work, so I've had amazing as well as awful Chinese food. This one falls under the awful category. The smell and tastes were just horrific. I can't believe the delivery guy let that shit in his car."}
{"text":"Got some sweet and sour chicken, wonton soup, and pork fried rice with a couple instructions. It was delivered to my apartment with a big smile very quickly. The food isn't reinventing the wheel, but the service is great and they deliver and you can even order straight from Yelp and that's great. You can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Tried many different Chinese food places and China Dragon happens to be one of my top three. I live all the way in Anthem Highlands and will drive down Eastern just to go here for lunch or for pick up. They have never disappointed me with their customer service or food. Their lunch special is the cheapest I've seen and they give you a generous amount!"}
{"text":"One word: Lunch specials! Okay, that was two words but either way, I like this place for the extremely affordable (read: cheap) place to grab a good lunch. I gravitate to their spicy kung pao mix and steamed rice. They have a decent egg drop soup too."}
{"text":"The egg drop soup was good but it's not hard to mess that up.  I had high hopes for the food.  The chow mein was only noodles, no veggies, nothing.  Very greasy with no flavor.  I opted for the Mongolian beef and the paper wrapped chicken as well.  The actual beef was tasty but the veggies it was sauteed with were overly oily and flavorless.  The paper wrapped chicken had absolutely 0 flavor.  Ended up being pretty disappointed but it's cheap, you get what you pay for.  At least it was cooked fresh to order."}
{"text":"Exactly what I was expecting.  Solid portions and filling food.  It's not the absolute best I've ever had but meets expectations and for the price of delivery to our hotel room it was amazing."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed.  3 months ago I had ordered and had the food delivered. Now the restaurant says that they don't deliver to my home. We are less then 4 miles away! Their online menu doesn't match their online menu at all, items are missing. Food is good."}
{"text":"Stopped at China Dragon for lunch today.  It is new, so it's clean and fairly modern inside.  They seat you, take your order at the table, and serve you instead of having you counter order like a lot of the strip mall quick order Chinese joints.  Because of this I was surprised that our food came out in Styrofoam boxes and bowls with plastic utensils.  

The soup that comes with the lunch specials is egg drop.  It is basically favorless, but adding some of their wide crunchy wontons and hot mustard helped a little.  The crunchy wontons themselves were very good.  Light, crispy, and not greasy.  The hot mustard was was in the little to go packets.

I ordered the Sweet & Sour chicken lunch special with all white meat chicken (for an extra $1).  It came with fried rice and chow mein.  The chicken was fantastic.  They only put a little s&s sauce on top so the breading retained that crunch that gets lost when it gets doused in sauce.  The peppers and pineapple were also crisp and flavorful.  The chow main & rice were bland and nothing special.

My friend ordered the orange chicken, also all white meat.  Hers was smothered in orange sauce, so it was a little soggy.  The steam in those closed Styrofoam boxes really don't help matters.  Her orange sauce lacked much flavor.  She would not order it again.

They do have Thai tea and Boba smoothies, which are worth investigating if I ever return.

All in all, it's okay if you're looking for something cheap and quick and the service was good, but most items we tried lacked flavor.  The crispy wonton strips and sweet and sour chicken (white) would be the only things I tried that I would want to eat here again."}
{"text":"I have been eating here 2-3 times a week trying new things each time. Their cooking style suits my tastebuds 80% of the time. Near work and large portions makes this place an ideal place to eat on weekdays!"}
{"text":"Omgosh! Everything was awesome and delivered 15 minutes ahead of schedule. Special requests were met and expectations hella exceeded. I'll order here again evertime."}
{"text":"Was out and about yesterday and wanted something to eat. I remember seeing this spot when I was in the area so I decided to check it out. After looking over the menu (they have takeout menus on the outside of their restaurant so you can see if you want to go there or not before you enter) and seeing the great prices on the food I decided to try it out. 

Inside was fairly large with plenty of tables for small groups of people. Other than the employees, I and my guest were the only one there so we were able to order right away. We decided on the lunch menu items which they serve every day from 11 am to 4 pm. 

I decided on getting the L14 Fried Tofu with Vegetables and my guest got the L6 Orange Chicken. Lunch specials come with fried or steamed rice, Chow Mein, Egg drop soup and fried wonton strips. Both of the specials were $5.95, an amazing price for the large portions they give you. It was enough for me to have it for 2 meals. 

The fried tofu and vegetables were perfect. Tofu not too dry, veggies were still crispy and the sauce on them was very tasty. The fried rice was AMAZING!! Some of the best I've had at a fast food Asian restaurant. Chow Mein also was well seasoned and very yummy! I was very impressed with the quality of food that they offer for the price. 

Employees, especially the lady that took our order and brought our food out, was very friendly. Even though she had a strong accent, I was able to understand her when she talked to me. 

The restaurant was clean and organized. All tables were wiped down, floors swept and the trash was emptied. The drink station was clean and filled as well. 

Can't wait to come back again to try more items on their menu."}
{"text":"10 to 15 minutes....10 to 15 minutes....10 to 15 minutes...

We ordered our food at 5:15 pm. Delivery time was 6:17 pm. We live right by UNLV so China Dragon is basically 10 minutes away. And that's if you hit traffic.

After they had missed the delivery time, around 6:20 we got an update status which told us that the food was on the way. We waited 10-15 minutes. With no delivery yet, I called the restaurant. The lady tells me, OH THE DRIVER JUST LEFT, IT'LL BE 10 TO 15 MINUTES!

10 - 15 minutes later.

I called again. OH HE JUST LEFT, 10 TO 15 MINUTES! I asked the woman to call the driver and get an update. I also asked if we would even get hot food at this point since apparently this dude is delivering Chinese food to someone in Victorville, the only rational explanation for why this is taking so long. She spouts the same info.

AHHHH...OHHH....UHHHH....10 - 15 MINUTES.

10 minutes later.

I had seen someone in a car stop by my house for a while. I was outside looking as hungry as I could. The guy drove away. Then drove back down the street, passing the house. I don't live on a major street, usually people driving down my street know where they are going. I'm assuming this might have been the delivery guy. We gave specific instructions where we list the exact location of the house, the color of the house, cross streets, etc. Mr. Magoo could have figured this out.

So at this point it is past 7 o clock and nearing 2 hours after we ordered. I called the restaurant and HANGRY me is not nice.

I gave the lady an earful. She told me again it would be a few minutes. I told her to cancel the order. Eat24 gave us a refund. 

We ended up getting a boatload of tacos and burritos from Del Taco that took exactly...

10-15 minutes."}
{"text":"I can't wait to come back and try the vegetable dishes, I love what they did with cooking the meat."}
{"text":"This place is surprisingly a lot better than I thought it would be for such a small town. The only disappointing thing is that they don't have a website or menu posted anywhere online. I'd like to change that by adding pictures of their full menu here so people can reference this! For the prices, you get A LOT of food and it's worth the price. I always get take-out since the inside looks pretty run down but the employees are very nice and polite. If you're in the area, give it a try!"}
{"text":"It's okay... not the best Chinese food in the area but definitely the saltiest.  My fried rice was more oily than it was fried and my lo mein was pretty soggy and the things I ordered generally tasted like they could have used both more and less time cooking!  I've been here a couple times and didn't really care for it either time but I went based on the reviews, plus it'd been at least 5-6 years since my last visit to China Dragon."}
{"text":"Great Wor Won Ton soup, I love the broth, has a hint of ginger and oh so good! Great service. Very clean and the decor is simple but I like it."}
{"text":"Fuck this place...I only order from here cause is close...buy the service is awful...They take more than am hour to get here...then unfortunately I got tide up and he had to wait 5 or 7 minutes for me and then he wants to give me shit, and be rude...So ti the driver I will say again, Go Fuck Yourself....customer service is fucking awful..."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery on 7/31/2016, accidentally had the wrong addressed saved on Yelp. That part was my mistake, but the person we spoke to on the phone said that they couldn't issue a refund, but they would give me credit next time I ordered.

Just got off the phone with them. They say they have no record of that and refuse to honor the credit promised. 1 star for dishonesty."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food ever and extremely decent price! I'm picky and this place is A+. I ordered the orange chicken, beef chow mein and broccoli shrimp. It was all made to order and I was able to have it custom prepared. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Food is tasty however only the female cashier will get your order correct.  Double check order when younger man is on duty.  When we 1st came in another customer was complaining order not right and this was slowing down the line.  Never an apology from staff.  I repeated no pork in house rice plus extra spicy.  Never got it right. Disappointed because everything is perfect when female is here.  Get it right guys!"}
{"text":"Good price but had a pretty bland average taste the chow mein noodles are ehh. But cheap so id probably go back"}
{"text":"China Dragon is a recently opened Chinese restaurant , on the east side of town, that we often frequent. The food is fast, hot, fresh, and very reasonably priced. Good for vegetarians because they do have veggie options (veggie chow mein, eggplant tofu). The hot and sour soup is excellent! Defiantly try this place out if you are in the area and looking for some decent Chinese food."}
{"text":"It was pretty good I wouldn't say it's close to the best I've tasted but it is surprisingly good for the area it is in. If you are that far out and craving Chinese food it's the place to go... not that there are a lot of choices"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places for delivery food. They give you good amount of food that is so tasty. They are quick and professional. The family dinner is such a great deal. Recommend this place to everyone I know."}
{"text":"We ordered a teriyaki chicken, pork, Mongolian beef, steamed rice, chow mein, wonton soup, potstickers.

We did not receive the chow mein or rice. We got fried rice instead. When we called I was told the steam rice was under the meat, but there was none. And after arguing with me for about 5 mins I was told I would give back the fried rice for the chow mein, and get the steamed but no one came back. 

The chicken teriyaki was ok but that was all ok. The rest of the food was good, soup came nice and hot."}
{"text":"I gave them 3 tries. 3 times they refused to give me a extra duck sauce for my food. 1 side of sauce for my Rangoon's, fried wontons and fried shrimp! Asked for soy sauce packets an chopsticks an nope they didn't put in bag. I asked over an over An they refused to. The Mongolian beef was all veggies. The chicken was so tough I could only eat half of it. Never again. Screw this place!"}
{"text":"Food ready in 15 minutes. The lo mein is good even for leftovers reheated, it doesn't get overly oily/buttery like others. The egg rolls and crab Rangoon's are delicious as well!"}
{"text":"Delivery is always on time and the food is always as ordered even with the special instructions me and my coworkers enjoy every dish we have ordered!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped by here for a quick lunch on a Sunday and am happy that I remembered seeing this spot as their food was delicious and the service was good not to mention that their prices were amazing. 

I was happy to see that they offered lunch specials every day of the week and not just Monday through Friday like a lot of places. And their lunch specials are super reasonable with prices from $5.95 to $6.25 for the items that have seafood in them. All lunch specials come with egg drop soup (if you dine in), fried rice and chow mein. I got the orange chicken and it was really tasty. The portions are huge, so I was able to take home half of mine and ate it for another meal. 

The lady that took my order was very friendly and smiled a lot. 

The inside of the restaurant was clean and in order. Everything was filled and organized. 

Will come again and do recommend this place if you want something delicous and quick."}
{"text":"I've only been here once before & the one time I came in prior was to simply pick up a soup I'd ordered. However today I walked in & stood in line when all of a sudden this man yells at me to shut the door! I wasn't entirely certain what he said so I said excuse me? Sure enough he stood up this time yelled at me again, SHUT THE DOOR! I manage a couple businesses including one in this shopping center so I know the doors here don't work the greatest. They're simply slower to close, but I would never allow my staff to yell at our guests. If the door doesn't shut properly we can certainly walk over & close it ourselves. Guests in any establishment should be made to feel welcome, not yelled at & treated as a nuisance. Clearly the owner of all people doesn't share this philosophy."}
{"text":"The food was good. The Fried Wontons were little balls, no extra wonton, like I've seen before. There was a bit of grease in the bottom of the container. I asked for Spicy mustard - and got regular mustard, like for a sandwich, not quite the same.

The Sesame Beef was again a little greasy but the taste overall was good. I'm used to it having a bigger kick as far as spice but it was good.

Delivery was fast!"}
{"text":"The absolute best for the price! We only order from China Dragon even though we live near a few Chinese restaurants. Always good food and service. Never have to wait too long for fresh, hot food to be delivered."}
{"text":"I'll be honest from the start here because I'm not a fan of Chinese food take out.  The Chinese food take out restaurants I've been to end up being cooked too much or they are so salty and greasy I feel like I was shot in gut and need to take a nap.  

China Dragon has been an exception so far.  My roommate and I have driven past this dozens of times and never thought twice about it until one day on the way home we drove past this place and decided to just try it.  Something told us to and we did not regret it!  One item on their menu that I just had to try because I thought to myself that this was \"unique\" to a Chinese restaurant was (brace yourself) Pad Thai.  YES!  A Chinese themed restaurant that serves Pad Thai!  I don't know if any other Chinese take out restaurants mixed different Asian/Oriental foods but I had to try it.  Well, they had all the meats; beef, pork, chicken, shrimp and also veggie for the non-meat eaters. They also had another option that intrigued me.  They had a \"House Special\" version of Pad Thai.  The house special Pad Thai here consists of ALL the meats you see listed for only $7.95 at the time of writing this!!!  This definitely caught my attention and I really wanted to try it.  My roommate picked up a Fried Rice w/ Fried Chicken Wings for $5.50.  Now I have to explain something.  When you see a price of only $5.50 for a item like this, around dinner time no less, you think this is going to be like a decent sized appetizer or side dish, especially from the way it's listed in the menu handout at the top and not with the main courses.  Nope, this was not the case in any way.  This portion was HUGE for the price!  My roommate received what had to be a half pound of rice with 4 LARGE fried chicken wings! WOW!  I was impressed.  
     Now, as for my Pad Thai, I wasn't expecting the usual and that's why I ordered it.  Honestly, how many people can say, \"Yes, I ordered Pad Thai from a Chinese restaurant and it was different but I really liked it!\".  China Dragon's is different but it is still very good if you can ignore the fact that it's most definitely not your typical or traditional Pad Thai.  It's a noodle dish just like Pad Thai but it doesn't use the crushed peanuts or the typical Pad Thai sauce and the way they cook the noodles at China Dragon gave them an almost grilled like taste that I quite enjoyed.  Plus the portion was also HUGE!  I'm serious, it was about a pound of noodles with a nice mixture of vegetables, chicken, beef, pork and shrimp.  The house specialty was a real treat as well because every bite gave a different piece of meat or vegetable, noodle and meat combination that made this one of the most enjoyable Chinese takeout restaurants that I've ever been to.  
     I'm not done though.  I'm not saying in anyway this food will end up in the healthy \"low sodium\" section of the menu but the salt was not overwhelming.  In fact, ALL the food we ate had taste that was not diminished by salt but rather had the right mix of ingredients to give a really good taste.  
     To top off all of this food off I wanted to try their Wonton Soup.  A pint of their Wonton Soup at this moment was a surprisingly low price in my opinion of $3.95!  I seriously had 3 decent sized bowls of Wonton soup from the pint!  
     The only reason I'm not giving China Dragon a 5 star rating is because of parking.  Their parking lot is a small angled parking lot that if you're not careful you COULD end up on the sidewalk or even worse, drive off the curb into Northfield Road.  But if you can angle yourself in their parking lot just right, China Dragon is DEFINITELY a Chinese take out restaurant that I actually do recommend.  Their staff is friendly (the one gentleman remembers me as the 'Pad Thai Girl') and no one is sitting around as there are about a half dozen people ALL working/cooking behind the counter.  They even have a few simple tables and chairs to eat there if you would like to do that as well.  I can't wait to order from them again and talking about it makes me want to order tonight because $10 dollars at this place will give a decent meal that may include leftovers."}
{"text":"DeFRIGGINlicious, each and every time! HUGE portions, fantastic service! BEST Chinese food in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I have NO complaints!! Food arrived in 20 minutes, we were quoted an hour. It was hot and very fresh. I was expecting to be somewhat disappointed because the prices, but they far far exceeded my expectations! To those who say this isn't  real Chinese food, I dont know as I'm not a huge Chinese food fan, so dont have a lot to compare it to, but what I do know is that what hit my mouth and belly was delish!! And isn't that what's important? Authentic or not, it was inexpensive, great portions, fresh and hot! Will definitely order here again! 
We had the teriyaki bowls ,mine with fried rice (highly recommend, costs a bit more but worth it), hubby had steamed rice. We shared the combo appetizer. We both agreed we weren't crazy for the BBQ pork, but wasn't horrible.  
Take the negative reviews with a grain of salt, and give them a try!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Chinese takeout plan in the Cleveland heights area. I am from the east coast, and it has been a challenge finding good, consistent, Chinese! Best egg drop soup, eggrolls, and seafood delight!

Cons: I wish they had a bit more selection on the menu (i.e. chow fun or chicken with eggplant), they are always out of string beans even though they have a few items on their menu with string beans, and often can forget the crispy noodles with the soup. They also don't carry brown rice. 

Pros:BUT they have no MSG and the food is consistently good"}
{"text":"Warning:
1st time: My credit card got charged incorrectly.
2nd time: Did not get food as ordered. I ordered shrimp omelette but got chicken instead."}
{"text":"The food is great but the delivery is awful. I have both dined in and taken out, so the only reason I am giving it 4 stars is because of the incredibly slow delivery."}
{"text":"I love this place! They cook really good Chinese food! I love their Crab Rangoon and their Orange Chicken! Plus, their service is really fast and their food is really filling! Plus!!! They do deliver! This is one of my top go to place when I need my Chinese food fix ;)"}
{"text":"Nice little place that slightly reminds me of China One?

Nice service, they made the food fast and it was your good standard fast food chinese. Will probably be visiting here frequently when I'm in a hurry."}
{"text":"Hubby's response: that was surprisingly great!! We ordered Family Dinner B. Sweet and Sour and Lemon Chicken. It was all so do delicious. This was the third place we have ordered from since moving here and fell in love with it. It tastes fresh and not like bulk pre-made sauces. Definitely our only place!! We had this delivered and they were fast and the food was hot!"}
{"text":"i always love how fast they are also the fact its probably the best Chinese place that's fast on delivery around my work only that the taste is a little off and all there dishes sometimes it wasn't fresh produce but others it is overall its good for the price but that's all 

i ordered the eggplant with tofu it was not bad just the eggplant wasn't fresh also order the sesame chicken and it was ok a bit heavy on the batter 

but the delivery was really quick usually (if its the usual guy but the girl will get lost in the parking lot and drive by like 7 times before realizing where she was... kind of funny but sad...)"}
{"text":"China gormet on center rd. is better. The quality of food here is mediocre."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery.  Cream cheese wontons, eggplant and tofu, and beef/broccoli.  Everything was hot on arrival in about 40 mins. They were spot on. Entrees were a little bland, and I wish the eggplant was more spicy. Super overpriced for fried rice instead, $2.50 upcharge. The wontons were delicious! More cream cheese would be nice. All together with tip about $33.00. Would try again someday."}
{"text":"A coworker had a very nice looking lunch special of Mongolian beef one day and I quickly decided I would try this place. The portions are huge! In this area of town, this is the best place for a cheap Chinese lunch special. I've tried the cashew chicken and the generals chicken and both items were fresh, hot and flavorful. The order time is short and it's a quick run inside for pickup, which is a plus when having to dash back to work quickly. The portion is honestly enough to last 2 meals. It's easy to order, and so far nothing has been bungled on my multiple lunch special orders for the office."}
{"text":"Four stars for convenience and speed. And boy are they fast. Restaurant must be close to my house because every time I order it it is here within 15 minutes. Including cooking time. I always love the fried dumplings and crab Rangoon's. Beef and broccoli is also really good. The fact that you can order direct from Yelp and also the BeyondMenu app is super convenient. Definitely my go to when I am starving to death, don't feel like cooking, and don't want to wait an hour for pizza."}
{"text":"Awful place.They messed up my delivery 2 times.The food is not for the price.Is discusting and they are always missing things you paid for.i would never recommend it to others."}
{"text":"The food is always hot and fresh prices are reasonable my favorite place to go for Chinese food"}
{"text":"I order from here rather frequently and the order is always accurate and the food is fresh!! I am always satisfied. 

Also, I am convinced that they either have underground tunnel access to my house or are psychic and anticipating my order.  There is no other way to explain their delivery promptness.  All I'm saying is be dressed when you place your delivery order because they will be there sooner than you expect. 

My usual order:  Sweet & Sour Chicken, Vegetable Lo Mein, Spring Rolls."}
{"text":"Food was good. Ordered the orange chicken extra spicey. Very good. Could taste the orange!! Lady workin the counter struggled with English to place an order. Will be back!!"}
{"text":"Yummy!! Best Chinese food I have ever eaten! Great prices and large portions. Delivery person actually brought our food up to our hotel room! If I am ever out this way again, I will most certainly order from here again!"}
{"text":"The general chicken was good hot and crispy the rice was loaded with peas and carrots I hate having to dig through my fried rice picking all of those half cooked veggies out , the chow mein has the weirdest texture I've ever encountered like steer clear it was soft smushy slimy and greasy all at the same time not food at all"}
{"text":"The food was quick good and hot. It is clean and the music is great. I am coming back again."}
{"text":"Good food, never messed up my order, speedy and convenient delivery! Very nice people"}
{"text":"Ordered lunch special and portions were just right. Not too much and not too few. I ordered the orange chicken with chow mein, it was okay. Nothing special I have to mention. The ambience is nice and the person who the order was friendly and welcoming. The good thing is you get free drink if you dine in rather than do a take out. Nice place."}
{"text":"I ordered along with some co-workers one day for lunch at work for delivery. I decided on the shrimp teriyaki bowl (4.95) I also ordered a side of (2) vegetable egg rolls (2.25) which were tasty as well.

It was delicious and chock full of yummy rice, veggies and the most important part SHRIMP.  

The teriyaki glaze is very tasty.

We will for sure be placing a lunch order again in the future. This place is a keeper for fast food sit down, to go or delivery Chinese cuisine. 


A round of mmmm yum yes!"}
{"text":"I know exactly what I'm getting when I order food from China Dragon. I always get take out, and it's always ready in 10-15 minutes. 

The restaurant needs some heavy renovation/face-lifting. 

The food is eh, but here's why I return...it's cheap! I know I'm not getting high quality Chinese here, but at least the price justly reflects the quality of the food.

I can't say that I would tell someone to try this place out unless they really wanted blah Chinese. In my neighborhood, though, the only other local place for great Chinese is Ya Fei, and their prices are ridiculous! I end up
spending $25 per person there. 

So, take this review for what it is. I don't have to be a foodie everyday. Sometimes, I throw back to college days when you just wanted to eat and didn't care that it was stellar or not."}
{"text":"Rude service, overpriced extra sauces, and food is extremely bland.  Additionally, they don't have tofu options, which sucks.  So if chicken or shrimp is my alternative, then those better at least be good.  I've had both, and neither was worth it.  In fact the chicken was downright fatty, which is a big turnoff considering I was ordering chicken breast to have a lower fat option, not to be constantly finding it in every bite or spending half the meal cutting it away from each bite.

Spices are almost non-existent .. even when I've always requested spicy hot.  Yeh, they give you good portions, but then charge a fortune for the sauces you would typically eat it with.  Besides, if the food isn't flavorful and/or exciting, then what's the point?  So you can have a bunch of blah food you feel obligated to eat?  No, not worth it.  We've gone a handful of times, and each time just reaffirmed the fact their food just isn't all that good.  

As for atmosphere, I wouldn't be inclined to eat there.  The inside looks no different than its neighboring Subway actually, only not as vibrant.

Also there was an instance on the most recent visit when I tried to complain about getting a meat egg roll instead of a vegetarian one, the lady argued and then hung up on me. I will never be back. Even if the food was good, it still isn't worth that kind of service!   

Two stars for the food, minus 1 for the 'tude.


EDIT:  The menu we have says they deliver, but for lunch only."}
{"text":"I got a to-go today, ordered lunch special General's Chicken.  Didn't notice a difference between here and China One's on eastern and tropicana.  Its not a bad thing, it was very tasty and they give you a large amount of food for the price.  Food comes out pretty fast and the place is very clean on the inside.  

Next time Im going to try their teriyaki chicken. Hopefully it is as good as their General's chicken."}
{"text":"5 Star for this Dragon. The ultimate in yummilishis. 

Today I had shrimp chow Mein.  It was beyond a generous portion and in the mood for Sesame Street I counted over 15 shrimp on my plate. Marjie like.

I am never disappointed in China Dragon.
The wontons are house made and yummi.
The Beef chow Mein is tender and excellent.
The egg rolls are really good .
Kung pao was yummi in my tummy.

We always order for delivery.  Prompt and no mess ups, the orders always correct.

Thank you Dragon."}
{"text":"Ordered take out from here a couple of days ago. I am fine with average to above average fast, cheap chinese food. This place was pretty bad. We ordered the family dinner combo B (shrimp chow mein, beef chop suey). We also ordered the appetizer combo. I have never had worse BBQ pork or paper wrapped chicken. We also got a free order of kung pao chicken via coupon

BBQ Pork - It was kinda dry and the glaze was vey forgettable. 

Paper Wrapped Chicken - It was some deformed ground chicken version that I have never had before, the main problem was not that it was ground meat, but that it had no flavor. one bite and it was tossed out

Fried Appetizers (crab rangoons, shrimp, egg rolls) - Standard fried appetizers, nothing special.

Wonton Soup - This may be the worse wonton soup I have ever had. Broth had no flavor and the wontons were so soggy the texture was like the soup was made the day before. This was a total waste of food, I had to throw out an entire container of soup

House Fried Rice - Average fried rice for a place like this

Shrimp Chow Mein - Another horrible experience. How can you mess up chow mein? The noodles were incredibly soggy and simply not edible. I tried to add soy sauce and some premium fish sauce, but the sogginess was to much to overcome

Beef Chop Suey - nothing special, average, but since nothing else was edible I ate all of it.

Kung Pao Chicken - This was actually slightly above average simply because it actually had some spice to it. 

I would not eat here again, but if I had to I would stick to the entrees only"}
