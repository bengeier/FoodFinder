{"text":"Awesome place for all the Non-Veg dishes they have on the Menu. Some of the dishes I could not find in any of the other Indian restaurants I have been to. Enjoyed the Biryani and the Kothu paratha. Definitely recommend all people who enjoy their food to come over here."}
{"text":"I wish I lived closer to Chennai Spices. I would eat here every week.  I'm really excited to have found a new South Indian restaurant as Canada Dosa sadly closed a while back. I would advise not to be in a rush if staying in to have your meal. While the service was slow, they staff were very friendly and patient with our questions we had about menu items we weren't familiar with. Our table of four ordered a mutton curry, fish curry, chicken dosa, paneer, pakora, paratha and a couple mango lassis. Every single item was beyond delicious. They catered to our request to make some dishes less spicy, and it actually came that way. Our main meals came with a choice of either naan or rice. I've never been one for mango lassi, but stealing a few sips of my boyfriend's made me a convert. You can tell it was made with fresh mango, no powdered junk. We were stuffed after our meal and even had leftovers. All that for $85 (including tax and tip)"}
{"text":"I can't get past how dirty this place is. I had a hard time eating here. The food was OK I won't go back!"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed the south indian food.. Good South Indian Food is hard to find in calgary ..This one is a hidden gem If you love authentic south indian food ..This is the place to go !!!"}
{"text":"Excellent place for authentic south Indian food.  Good options available for vegetarian. I have been 3 times in one week to try of different kinds of dosa."}
{"text":"The best South Indian food in Calgary! Fantastic Dosas"}
{"text":"Best Dosa Restaurant in Calgary and easy to get there on the LRT, I can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Came here a few months ago while visiting Calgary.  Don't be turned off by the look of this place. It might be small and dingy but the food is amazing! Awesome sambar and great masala dosa. Idli was very moist and soft. Vada was soooooo good!"}
{"text":"Amazing food hidden in the corner of 52 St SE and Memorial Drive...  Probably the best South Indian food in Western Canada... A must try for all dosa, idly and uttappam lovers..."}
{"text":"I had the dosas here with my family, while visiting from Toronto. Though the food and hosting was great, the atmosphere left a lot to be desired. It's a no frills atmosphere. I would recommend this place for a night of delicious food with friends, family, or other people you don't need to impress. The portions are huge! I ordered the CD chicken special dosa and it was cheesy, flavorful, and aromatic. I asked for it spicy but it was fairly mild."}
{"text":"Went on a recommendation. Thoroughly enjoyed everything we ordered. Loved the buttermilk as well as the Mini Tiffin. Found the restaurant quite busy with Indian people, which is always a good sign! Pricing was incredibly reasonable and felt I received great value. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"In terms of food it was Decent to Good, nothing special. Service was slow, the space was tight and all the food ordered came one by one with long gaps so we had to wait for each other's food to arrive before we could begin. we had a person with an allergy to spicy foods, asked them to eliminate the spice from her order, she still got green chillies in her dosa.  Washrooms were dirty, which is an indication that kitchen isn't clean."}
{"text":"(This review is currently old as they have changed locations. Will update when I get a chance to visit. My assumption is the food is still good. And they should have upgraded to a better restaurant itself)   The best masala dosas in Calgary hands down! The quality and price is amazing which is why I have given it 5 stars.   The restaurant itself in regards to the ambience and seating is very poor - which should be 2 stars.  So go for the amazing food just prepare yourself to step into inidia when dining in."}
{"text":"Amazing South Indian food in an atmosphere that totally took me back. From the fantastic dosas to watching Tamil films in the dining room this place really hit the spot for me."}
{"text":"Nice place to spend for lunch ordering the dosa and chicken curry, also every time been here pleasant environment watching some of the Indian  movies on the TV. Highly Recommandable!"}
{"text":"Saturday/Sunday dosa buffet. SO YUMMY. They have a nice buffet where you can do either vegetarian or non-veg and then unlimited dosas. Yes, unlimited. Of course, it's hard to have more than two but they're delicious, made to order and come in a bunch of different varieties. Onion masala dosa and chili cheese masala dosa are the best, in my opinion. Can't wait to go back. :)"}
{"text":"Wow, just wow. If you want great South Indian food in Calgary *this* is the place. Most (if not all) of the Indian food in the city is from the north, but that means certain dishes (such as dosas or uttappam) you will not see. If you miss those flavors and menu items then this is the place for you. Or, if you're curious as to what \"south Indian\" food means then this is the place to get a great sample.   Anyway, as the other reviews noted, this is a small dingy kind of place that isn't necessarily appeasing to the eyes but the focus is on the food not the decor. There is a television, though, and I'm sure it always plays cricket matches.   The menu isn't large, but it has a mix of appetizers, dosas, curries, biryani, and other specialties. There are veg and non-veg options with a good deal of variety for both (including some mutton.) There are varieties of naan and roti, and there are a few desert options (gulab jaman for instance) and of course, mango lassi. Most of the appetizers at in the $6-$9 range and the entrees are about $8-$15.   I had a dosa as well as vada appetizer. Some colleagues ordered the masala dosa for entree whole we got the uttapam. Everything was delicious and I could barely stop eating. I was definitely way too full at the end of the meal.   I highly recommend this place - I'm not sure how the North Indian type fare would taste (ie the alooh gobi) but everything was so good that I think you probably can't go wrong.  In general, definitely check this place out - it's well worth a visit."}
{"text":"Restaurant name changed to Madras Cafe. Same great food if not better! We ordered plain dosas, poori, chicken 65, mutton briyani, vadai, and masala tea. Everything was excellent, authentic, and delicious."}
