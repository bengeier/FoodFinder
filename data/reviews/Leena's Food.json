{"text":"Best gyro I've ever had. He always puts tons of meat on my gyro. The real key of the dish is the pepper relish. If you don't get it, its really not the same thing. I've had this gyro probably 50 times, and it's still great.  As others have said, Muhammad is another reason to go here. Last time I was there (before spring break), he was telling me about going to Cancun for the 'girls gone wild.' Dude is awesome. Gives me free stuff sometimes too."}
{"text":"Came out from LA to visit family and was driving through Murrysville looking for a place to eat.  This place is hard to find as it's location inside Marathon gas station.   My husband and I both ordered the gyro platter. Man, we can honestly say that this was the best food we've had out here! It's tough to find high quality food as everything is usually bar food! The meat is lean, clean, and perfectly cooked! The owner takes such pride in quality ingredients and quality food! His gyro even surpassed what we've had in LA and NYC (yes, it's better than the Halal Guys)!  We left, stuffed and happy!  THANK YOU for such delicious food!"}
{"text":"Best Bakhlava I have ever had!! HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!  The gyro was good too! The meat was flavorful, I just wish they gave a little more than they did in each one.  The owner and the wife are super nice!"}
{"text":"The gyro is awesome and the service is very, very friendly. Definitely the best gyro I've had in Pittsburgh - you absolutely need to get the gyro with the hot peppers though."}
{"text":"Surprisingly delicious authentic gyros and baklava from a gas station location but seriously good food. Limited seating so I recommend taking it to go. Owner is knowledgable, approachable, and interesting to talk to!"}
{"text":"This guy makes a great falafel.  I used to eat from his his blue van in the  the 90s outside of hillman library.  I've been here once and it was just as good."}
{"text":"I agree with the other reviewers 100%.  Everyone, go here at least once. Something great when you want a break from Dick's."}
{"text":"I honestly thought this place was just ok. Eaten a lot of falafels but not in Pittsburgh, so I really cant compare with whats around.   - The owner seemed nice and friendly.  - There were like 3-4 falafels cut into 1/2 and lots of rice and salad and hummus. the falafels werent hot, they werent crunchy on the outside, the flavor was ok. - I had to hunt the meat in the gyro but once I got to it, it wasnt as salty as probably mike and tonys has it.  All in all it was okay. I guess its the price that makes it a good deal for college students."}
{"text":"On the way back from a visit to our son at Penn State, we looked for a place to eat and my wife found Leena's on Yelp. We were intrigued by the unusual combination of gas station and good food.   We each had a gyro - cooked perfectly, excellent taziki sauce. We also ordered grape leaves and babaganooj with Pita. Everything was excellent and delicious. We were thinking to bring it home to eat (about 35 min away) but it smelled so good we just ate it there!  The service was quick and very good too. We'll be coming back!"}
{"text":"I wanted so badly to like this place, I really did. But the food is just a sloppy mess.  The owner was really nice and I enjoyed that it was a simplistic no-frills kind of place. Those places are where some of the best Greek food I've had come from. However...I came in with high hopes that I could fulfill my Greek/Mediterranean food craving, but they don't even sell chicken gyros...I mean if you're close to a university, you have to understand that not all people eat lamb. Maybe it was the upbeat middle-eastern music that made me expect greatness like what I've had in Greektown in Detroit, but no.  I got the chicken shishkabob and I don't mind a little black, but it was like eating pure charcoal that was overdone. I got four tiny pieces of chicken, I mean TINY, the rest was filled with mounds and mounds of lettuce and a couple random pieces of pepper. It was sloppy trying to eat as the sauce was really runny. It was just nasty. My fiancee got the lamb gyro and it was messy and mediocre.   If you like it, keep buying it because the owner seems really nice. But if you just want some really good food, no bs, I wouldn't try this place out if you're really hungry."}
{"text":"This place is amazing, even more so because of its location. Seriously a hidden gem since looks can be deceiving. I dare you to find better gas station food, though I hesitate to even call this gas station food, because well, it isn't. The BEST no frills hummus around, and I consider myself an expert given my childhood as an Aramco brat in Saudi Arabia. Falafel is delicious and baclava is on point. Even had the grape leaves and tabouli and I can't say enough how awesome it all is. If they ever leave I will boycott."}
{"text":"Yes, this is the Leena's that used to be in Oakland. Great Fallafel, super nice owners. easy to miss when driving. it is in the marathon gas station building."}
{"text":"Outstanding.   Probably the best Falafel I have eaten.  Grape leaves and gyros were excellent as well."}
{"text":"The falafel was dry and not very crisp. I got a falafel wrap and it was more salad (iceberg lettuce and few tomatoes/cucumbers) than falafel. I only counted 2 falafel balls. Overall wasn't impressed and wouldn't go back unless desperate."}
{"text":"I was visiting Pittsburgh after a long absence, and eager to stop by Leena's to order what I remembered as the best falafel in town.  But it was gone!  It seems the place has been closed for a while now...does anyone know what happened?"}
{"text":"Great establishment in Oakland. The owner is super friendly, and only puts the freshest in the dishes. They truly are the best and authentic Middle Eastern establishment in Pittsburgh. Not only are the dishes top quality, but the prices are cheap and student-budget friendly!"}
{"text":"Great food, prices and service!! Falafel, gyros and hummus are all fantastic!  Highly recommend getting a side of hummus...you'll thank me!"}
{"text":"I hate to be \"that guy\" (or \"that girl\" in this case) who is the only one not loving a place. Tried Leena's for the first time recently. I didn't hate it, but I'm not raving. As others pointed out, it's in a gas station, nothing fancy, and atmosphere was not what I was going for so not an issue...just looking for some takeout. Ordered a bunch of stuff since I wanted to try it all. Got a gyro.  It was good but not the best I've had.  They wrap them in foil which would normally keep them pretty warm for a short drive home, but the meat was almost cold...I don't think it was very hot when put on the sandwich. And you can't very well reheat a gyro with all the cold stuff (lettuce, sauce, etc). Hot off the press might have made it better.  Got a side of falafel.  They were the puniest, hard as rock falafel I've had.  One actually had no filling...just the overly crunchy breading. The ones that did have some (very little) filling were coated in such a thick crust that it's all you tasted. Got an order of baba ganoush.  Ok, but a little bland, and when I got home realized they didn't give me the order of pita that was supposed to come with it.  Luckily I had some dippers. Finally a spinach pie which I had the next day for lunch. Don't expect filo dough....it's in a pastry shell. This was the best item out of the bunch. Delicious. Very peppery though, so if you don't like pepper it might not be for you.  Might give a gyro another try one day, but I'm not dying to go back. Now if they served moussaka and pastitsio....I'd be back every week!  What I wouldn't give for a place in this area that served those!"}
{"text":"On the recommendation of others, I stopped at Leena's to try out their falafel sandwich and hummus. Mohammed was also super sweet and let me try their baklava - which is sinfully and dangerously good. The flavors of everything are fresh, and taste absolutely delicious. They are a diamond in the rough, and I will certainly be back. For less than what I'd pay at Sheetz for a sandwich and fries, I got all of this food plus 3 additional pitas for my hummus. And the food was a million times better. Don't be put off that it's in a gas station - You've eaten from Sheetz or GetGo! If you haven't yet tried them, get on it!"}
{"text":"This is the definition of hidden gem.  I stopped here for dinner while in town for business and is was so delicious and different that I came right back for lunch the same day.  The owner/operator is a very nice man and even grows many of his ingredients himself.  If you are anywhere near Leena's food, do not deprive yourself from the best lunch or dinner you'll have anywhere!"}
{"text":"Solid Greek-style sandwiches and food at this little hole in the wall.  All of the pita sandwiches are pretty messy, so grab some extra napkins unless you like tahini sauce on your pants. That sounded a bit dirty, but I digress.  Gyro meat is well-seasoned and tender. Although they use a mass of ground meat instead of the more authentic layered slices of meat, Leena's offers an admirable take on the American-style ground meat gyro. The homemade yogurt sauce is much better than your run of the mill thick, mayonnaise-like condiment you usually find labelled as \"gyro sauce\" . There's a good ratio of vegetables to meat.  Falafel tends to be served lukewarm, but are nonetheless crisp and texturally complex. The spices they use in the fritters shine here, and the tahini isn't overwhelming.  Chicken shish kabob is juicy, tender, and perfectly seasoned with the right amount of char. Too bad they only give you a few little pieces per sandwich.  Sides are great too. The spiced fries are crisp and bold. Yogurt rice benefits greatly from the addition of hot pepper relish and is a nice, light side dish.  Definitely the best spot in Oakland to grab a pita sandwich, forget the competition."}
{"text":"Delicious food, the honest to god best gyro around. The hummus is great, and the owners are wonderful people"}
{"text":"Terrific food, friendly owners.  I think lunch here sealed the deal for my son to attend Pitt."}
{"text":"Good hole-in-the-wall restaurant with great food for an affordable price.  GET THE HUMMUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Best I've ever had."}
{"text":"This place is a perfect 'dont judge the book by the cover' example! Leena's is inside a marathon gas station and its kind of a hole in the wall but this place is solid. I have stopped at greek food spots up in cranberry/wexford area and this place is way better. The spices used for seasoning the chicken were stronger than other places and tasted great - perfectly balanced with the sauce that comes with the gyros. The pita bread is grilled - makes for a crunchy outer rim perfect for dipping in the hummus. The pita also had a sweet note to it which I really liked. The hummus was fresh with dices of veggies in it and more creamy but slightly less dense than your typical store bought hummus. Will become a regular here."}
{"text":"It's just ok.  Gyro a little above average and hummus was meh.  \"Meh\" may be too nice a word.  The hummus was very thin and not very flavorful.  You can find better hummus at the Market District.  The lettuce and tomato on the gyro looked a bit aged.  This could easily b a two star but it is hard to get a descent gyro.  Also it would not hurt to wipe down the eating tables.  They were filled with crumbs.  There is no need me to hurry back."}
{"text":"Leena's has ruined falafel sandwiches for me.  I cannot eat them anywhere else because they will be sad, sorry shadows of what can be found in this humble shop.  Maybe it's the pickles or the heaping helping of tahini - there is something about these sandwiches that I've never found anywhere else.  You can also get stuffed grape leaves for about two bucks.  If you're looking for great Middle Eastern eats, stop by Leena's!"}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to giving this place a try and made a special trip to get lunch one day. The hours are listed as 11-8 and they were closed when I got there at 12. I tried calling ahead of time, but the number listed seems to be a cell phone that went to voice mail after a few rings."}
{"text":"If you're in the area, you must stop at Leena's. I was confused at first because it's actually located inside the Marathon gas station. Being a little hesitant I went in and I couldn't have been more happy with the food and service! Mohammed was so gracious. You can tell he has a real passion for the food he serves his patrons. It's the best giros in the world for a reason. Get one!"}
{"text":"I have driven past the sign on Old William Penn trying to lure customers in to Leena's countless times over the past year. I have had this place bookmarked for nearly as long, but still it took a solid year before I gave it a try. I wish I would have tried it sooner! Yes, it is in a gas station, which doesn't sound so appealing when you're reading other reviews, but please do not let that deter you from giving the place a try.   They are closed on Sundays, but have perfect hours for lunch or dinner the other six days a week. Prices are quite reasonable as well considering how much food you get.  I opted for the \"Leena's Special Platter\" which came with hummus, two pita breads, small salad (maybe 1/2 cup or so), rice, and plenty of thinly-sliced lamb with that delicious greek sauce we all know and love! How do you spell it? Tzatziki, maybe? I believe it is a husband and wife who run the business, and both were friendly and inviting. When the man was putting my platter together, he told me I was going to have enough food for lunch and an afternoon snack - love that!  I can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"Really good gyro at good price; didn't like their hummus tho. Will visit again next time in Pitt."}
{"text":"Falafels are very good, there's a lot of veggie in a thin style pita but that's how it should be. The only thing that surprised me were the spiced fries, which have standard curly fry seasoning on them, not za'atar or something like that. Still pretty good."}
{"text":"Muhammad is one hell of guy!  Best Baba Ghanooj I've had!  Told him how awesome his food is, and he made me some sort of veggie pita for free which was amazing!  Can't wait to make it back to Oakland to visit this place!"}
{"text":"Leena's has my favorite Gyros in town and the owner Mohammad is there every day ensuring you are served the highest quality middle eastern foods!"}
{"text":"The gyros are genuine and the best around. Great service and the owner is an awesome guy who you can sit and talk to while you wait for your food or eat it. Doesn't get better than Leena's."}
{"text":"The service was fast and friendly and the falafel was moist and tasty.  But the falafel sandwich was overloaded with bland lettuce, no hummus, and the wrap was a bit dried out.  Maybe going again I'd know to order differently, but given the other reviews, I was a bit disappointed.  Overall, good prices and the food might get better if you order exactly what you want."}
{"text":"Delicious. Not as good as Lesvos in the South Side, but still great. Gyros are served to you in almost 5 minutes and they never leave me disappointed."}
{"text":"We made a quick stop while traveling for a late lunch. We were greeted by the owner, Mr. Issa, who was kind and prepared our food quickly which we then enjoyed in one of the 3 booths. The Palestinian fare had reasonable prices, modest presentation, and delicious flavors. We had a gyro sandwich, falafel sandwich, side of tabbouleh, and baklava. As a lover of Mediterranean food, I can endorse that the falafel was fantastic - flavorful, excellent texture, cooked to perfection. (There is press and a signed letter in the restaurant backing up its claim to best falafel in the world.) My partner said the tzatziki on the gyro was very good - flavorful and not too creamy. It was exactly what we had hoped for and exceeded my expectations for the falafel!"}
{"text":"Murrysville has tons of restaurants, but nothing really unique. Just the same old. One day, on my way to Wendy's for a ho hum burger, I looked at the side of the road and saw the  \"worlds greatest gyros\" sign I had passed so often. I decided to pull in on a whim, and boy was it a good idea!  I ordered the Gyro platter for $9. Well worth the money! You get a ton of meat, rice, hummus, two pitas, and a salad. The tzaziki sauce is the best I've ever had, the meat is the most flavorful I've ever had, and the hummus was delicious. This is a hidden gem of Murrysville!"}
{"text":"Tied for the best gyro I've ever had.  Get the platter if you're with someone else--there's enough to make two sandwiches.  My wife liked the falafel, but that's not really my thing."}
{"text":"I've driven past this place hundreds of times and always seemed to forget it was there.  I finally stopped in and tried and was glad I did. The menu is pretty small, but they offer all they need to.  There are two types of combos available.  The combo meal and the platter.  The combo meal is your sandwich, drink and a side.  The sandwich is wrapped in foil and is stuffed with a nice amount of meat that has tons of flavor.   The platter is in a styrofoam container and has rice, gyro meat, hummus, lettuce and pita.  There is a huge amount of food, so you either need to be really hungry, sharing food or plan on having leftovers for another meal.  I was really impressed with the platter (and will likely be what I order on all future visits).  In addition to the combo and platter, you can also get a la carte items such as falafel, French fries, grape leafs and baba ganoush.  I found the prices to be very reasonable for the portions you get and will be back for a visit again soon."}
{"text":"I stopped in on a rainy day for a little spinach pie pick me up.  The owner was unbelievably nice!  He called me thin then gave me a piece of baklava.  I thought what could be better?!?  Then I bit into the baklava....  Holy crap is it the most amazing ever!    I have tried several menu items and have never had a bad thing.  This is like going to have a homemade dinner at your favorite uncles house."}
{"text":"We had the gyro, falafel, and hummus.  All were delicious!! The owner made a pepper mix, which he put on top of the hummus, also amazing (and I'm not a huge fan of peppers in general) Only negative was it was inside of a gas station, which was kind of odd."}
{"text":"A group of my new classmates and I completely took up all the space in this little cafe, they seat maybe 15-20 people tops. I got a falafel, it was HUGE but the falafels were cold :( Other than that it  was great, and you can't beat the price. With a bottle of soda, my total came up to something like $7.  I also love their myspace website - they list the hours, menu with prices and etc. All extremely useful."}
{"text":"Drive by here everyday and decided id give it a try.  By far the best ive eaten around the burgh.  Flavors blended beautifully and plenty for the money.  Owner really made me feel at home, even in a gas station.  I'm now a regular....."}
{"text":"Leena's used to be located in Oakland, where my wife and I found it while frequently visiting Magee Hospital. They are now located at 4180 William Penn Highway, Murrysville. I just had lunch there and found that the food quality and quantity are the same as the Oakland store. I had the Gyro salad with double meat and it was delicious. My co-workers had a gyro and chicken kebab and they also enjoyed their meals. We will return. So happy that Leena is now in Murrysville. Leena has changed the menu slightly, from Oakland, but the staples are all still there"}
{"text":"The food was really good! My husband and I both ordered the gyro platter, which came with a small salad, hummus, rice, gyro meat, & pita. The portion was very generous, and I'll have a nice lunch from it tomorrow. The salad had what tasted like an intense tangy tahini dressing...that I was particularly fond of. The gyro meat was doused with a delicious homemade cucumber sauce, which was topped with a homemade hot pepper relish that took the whole thing to next level deliciousness. The hummus was super smooth and also had the magical relish on top. It was great authentic food made by the owner, who was very hospitable and funny. We'd ordered 2 pieces of baklava to share amongst the four of us but Mr. Issa gave each of our kids a complimentary baklava, which they devoured despite their heavy 5 & 7 year old's reservations. They each tried a bite of everything, and while they were not fans of the falafel, they both enjoyed their gyro cup and pitas. I, on the other hand, thought it was the best tasting falafel I've ever had. I don't like falafel and never have. I've tried it so many times and damn near passed on even tasting it at all, but it looked different than other falafel. It was very green inside and was in the shape of a mini muffin almost. This falafel was actually rather tasty. I liked it.  So there you have it! We will definitely go back. Yes it is in a gas station but I don't really see why that's a big deal."}
{"text":"My boyfriend is obsessed with Greek and Mediterranean food, so we checked this place out while on vacation in Pittsburgh due to the Yelp reviews. I just have to say that it was a truly incredible experience. We both had the falafels and they were simply the best in the world. The owner talked with us for a good portion of the time and he just added to the experience, because he was completely badass and hilarious. I'll have to second the other reviews by saying he is awesome and his food is too."}
{"text":"New location in a gas station in Murrysville. Falafel was great!"}
{"text":"Falafel is ok but nothing special. It's been served twice in what can only be described as a salad with a little bit of falafel sprinkled in. Also, it's mushy, not crispy on the outside which is not necessarily bad, but not my particular favorite. However, what's up with those fries? They are amazing."}
{"text":"I seriously cannot say enough about this place! The people are so nice and the food is incredible. There is not a single thing on the menu that I wouldn't recommend. I personally love the gyro platter, you get an incredibly generous helping of gyro meat over the best cooked rice, with hummus, pita bread and a little salad."}
{"text":"I used to go to leenas when it was in Oakland and loved it. I was so happy to see him open a place less than 5 minutes from my house. I absolutely love the gyros. Hands down the best gyro I've ever eaten, and let me tell you, I've eaten a lot. The hummus is a little thin but as a good flavor. The tabbouleh is very good and fresh. The falafel isnt bad but not my favorite. To the person who wanted to eat moussaka or pastitsio....why would they serve Greek food at middle eastern restaurant? Ugh come on."}
{"text":"I usually order a platter which comes with a portion of meat, a side of hummas, a small salad, and thin pita. The quality is good, and you can see everything being prepared in the kitchen. What gives Leena's an edge is that it is the only spot that I know of where you can get Middle Eastern food, gyros, and house-made hummas in Oakland.  My only complaint is that the owner (who is also the cook and is friendly) is skeptical of his customers. I have ordered take-out twice and both times he did not start cooking my order until I showed up; both times he offered an excuse for why he did not starting preparing the dish until I showed up."}
{"text":"\"Eat this,\" the owner/chef said, \"right away, while it's nice and hot.  It's very important.\"  \"Thank you.  I will,\" I answered, one hand on the bag with my falafel sandwich.  He then let go of the bag.  Why, oh why, have I often settled for mediocre food at Panera in Oakland when there's Leena's?  The falafel was moist and had a nice spicy kick.  I like my falafel a little crunchy on the outside, which this falafel wasn't, but the wrap also had a tasty lemon-flavored sauce going for it.  Because I kept my promise, I can't tell you if the falafel sandwich is good lukewarm or cold.  You won't want to wait, anyway.  Prepare to get messy.  My wrap dripped all over even though I kept it in its foil wrapper.  But if you eat in--there's a fair amount of seating--you can use the bathroom afterwards to clean up.  Well worth a trip to the sink afterwards."}
{"text":"Leena's is oldly enough located inside a gas station, although that doesn't take away from the food and service in any way.  The small shop is run by a family, mom dad and daughter. The father was very open in discussion and generous with us as first timers.  He gave both my sister and Inextra gyro meat because I didn't know you could buy more after purchasing my meal. We ordered a gyro salad, gyro cup, spinach pie, meat pie and a slice of baklava.   Everything tasted really good. The meat was served in a shredded/sliced style almost like a chipped ham. Salad had a great vinegarette base to it that was great with the extra hot peppers. I preferred the spinach pie over the meat pie, I felt it had more flavor and I wasn't too fond of the fluffy bread they use as a pocket to hold all the goodies in. The baklava was worth savoring. I took small bites at a time tasting the warm honey, walnuts and flaky crust. Delicious!!   The owners were definitely personable and happy to please. I look forward to going back!"}
{"text":"Good food, but great service and host!!! In the marathon gas station. The hummus was amazing and fresh as was the salad. You can tell he home makes it! The hot peppers he makes are amazing and so incredible he makes them from his own garden. Really sweet man and wish he had his one spot!  The falafel is fresh and has a good flavor just wish it was cooked a little longer bc i just love em crispy!  My only complaint was my gyro meat on my platter was cold.  But I doubt you will find better service or more heart put into food anymore! Loved this place!"}
{"text":"This is such a nice place, small but has so much charm. It is by far the \"BEST FALAFEL IN PITTSBURGH\" hands down, no lie. The rice and hummus are also tops. Great place."}
{"text":"I've been eating here since it was still a falafel truck on Bigelow Boulevard.  Top-notch Middle Eastern/Mediterranean entrees.  The \"Best Falafel in Pittsburgh\" sign is not hyperbole (the falafel is perfectly spiced and fried a lovely golden-brown, and comes stuffed in a pita with sumac, pickle, tahini sauce, and an astonishing chopped salad with lemon in it), but don't let the glory of the falafel dissuade you from trying the gyros, the shwarma, or anything else.  The hummus is also very good -- lots of tahini (which I love), and drizzled with olive oil and homemade chopped pickled hot peppers.  Definitely a tasty treat anytime.  Opening the restaurant and getting out of the back of the truck has let the menu expand, and now there are some entrees that it wouldn't be practical to cook and serve in a truck.  I particularly love the moussaka.  Assuming you haven't already gorged yourself on hummus, falafel, and other delicious foods, you should also get a piece of baklava for the road.  Leena's also has a sort of inspiring backstory.  The owner has had a lot of struggles in his life -- after coming to America, he was hit by a drunken driver and horribly injured years ago, his young daughter lost a hand in a terrible kitchen accident, and the city harassed the Oakland food trucks and basically drove them all out of business for a long time.  But the owner did not give up.  He opened his restaurant after his truck was driven out of business, and he is always so happy and optimistic despite all the obstacles fate has put in his path.  I would not have known about all the terrible things he's surmounted, but the Pitt newspaper ran a story about it when the restaurant opened up a couple years ago.  Leena's Food is a great restaurant, but it also is a physical embodiment of the American Dream, and the owner is one of the quiet heroes you find every day in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"We had a really good take out experience at Leena's.  The gas station gyro took me a moment to get over as well, but get over it.  They make a good gyro at a good price.  We had a side of fresh hummas which was also good.  A better storefront would equal a boom business.  Best authentic gyro in Murrysville!"}
{"text":"Anyone who has ever seen this place but never tried it are probably confused how I could give it 5 stars. That's right my friends the restauraunt that shares a building with a Marathon Gas Station makes the best falafel you could hope to find.   It took some encouragement from people I knew to get me to go in, but I am so glad I succumbed to peer pressure. I forgot my lunch for work so come quitting time I was pretty hungry. I stopped in for gas when my nose started making a very convincing argument drawing me in to Leena's foods. To be honest I don't know how it happened but next thing I knew I was staring down the fattest falafel known to man.   The ingredients tasted so fresh, the chickpeas were clearly not from a can, the spices and sauces tasted so rich and authentic. And the bread engulfing him the whole meal was light and flaky just the way I like it.   The thing that makes this good taste 10x better is the man making it. He is a one man shop making and doing everything from start to finish. I have been there many times since and the guy always has a story to tell.   I really wish he would move to a sit down kind of place, as it is there are just a couple tables but you are clearly in a gas station. But this place is best for takeout anyway. This is a modern day example of how you can't judge a book by it's cover."}
{"text":"This is THEEE BEST place around to get a good gyro. They also make the most delish baclava (sp?) for dessert. They have a cool food truck that comes to my daughter's school for events. I hear they also do catering, but I haven't had that service yet. All of their food is fresh and has so much taste, not bland. The staff and owners are always so friendly and greet with a smile."}
{"text":"Definitely the best Mediterranean food we've had in Pittsburgh so far. The restaurant is small and nestled into the busy area around Forbes Ave. near the Pitt campus. The owner was just on his way out the door (his employee was taking over), but he made a point to chat with us and to talk with us about his kids and our baby (who we brought with us). He was friendly and personable.  We ordered a gyro sandwich and a falafel platter. The gyro was perfect: plenty of succulent lamb, fresh cucumber, tzatziki, romaine lettuce, and tomato. The ingredients tasted fresh and the tzatziki had a nice sharpness to it. The falafel platter included a few patties split on top of rice, a small Middle Eastern salad, two pitas, and fresh hummus. Although I had heard the falafel here was awesome, I found it to be very good, but not great. It wasn't quite as spicy or crisp as some I've had in town, like Aladdin's. And I would have liked a bit more falafel on the plate (the rice dominated). Nevertheless, the falafel platter was quite satisfying and we ate the whole thing!  We saw a fresh pan of baklava on the counter and couldn't pass up the opportunity. For just $1.50, we got a good chunk of baklava, and it was the best I've ever had! The phyllo dough was light and fresh, the nutty filling was soft and delicious, and there was a perfect amount of honey (some I've had are much too sweet). Needless to say I suspect I'll get baklava every time I go back!  All told, a very enjoyable and cheap dinner."}
{"text":"This has been one of my favorite restaurants since 2010. While the gryo's and falafel sandwiches are incredible the main attraction for me is the humus which is homemade.   I recently purchased a gyro and noticed that it was very different than before - the pita didn't fall apart after my 15 minute walk home and it was not dripping everywhere. I went back the next day and the owner told me that he recently decided to dry the meat a little and reduce the cucumber sauce.  The new sandwich is great! Its enough sauce that each bite is mixed with a blend of the hot pepper sauce and the cool yogurt. It i also awesome to not need a fork or kill a tree in napkins per sandwich!"}
