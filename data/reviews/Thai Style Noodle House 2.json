{"text":"We been coming here for lunch mostly TO GO.food is good we like it however,we noticed that some of the Guys that work there has mental issues.today me and my 9 year old son was there,when I was parking my suv,there was a red pickup truck door wide open,I just noticed when I was about to park this guy inside was very angry that I have to park right beside his truck and he insisted on closing his door.when I finally park my suv,he was cursing at me really angry and opened his door again..I was worried that my son was seating right beside his truck,we got down and i could tell that he was yelling at me but this time his door was closed now.then he was opening his door like he's trying to scare me.anyway,having my son with me I just went straight to the restaurant.I complained to the people inside working.and they said yeah \"HE WORKS HERE and Hes a little crazy\" and he told me to go ahead and beat him up?? so I was like what?? the guy inside said \"we feel the same way\".I just said I am getting harrased w my son and if I call the cops were gonna have a big problem.no response exept that he want me to beat him up!?this is not the first time theres also a younger asian guy that has a very bad attitude working in there and he seems like hes always angry about somethings.This is a really bad experience that I have decided to not to come back there.weird people working in there pushing me to fight with my son with the crazy guy."}
{"text":"This place is the best. Their Tia tea is good and so is there food only problem is that they don't have \" fresh Spring rolls\"."}
{"text":"really good food and friendly staff. not to mention cheap prices. no complaints at all."}
{"text":"I'll be returning. Good noodle dishes, both of us had a great time here. Good service. Good taste. Along with modest prices."}
{"text":"Decided to try something different as I haven't been thrilled with their curry (red or panang) lately. Used to like the pumpkin curry, but last time I ordered it I was only given 1 piece of pumpkin.

Ordered the Mongolian Beef.....won't make that mistake again. They gave me more white rice than actual entree, the beef was overcooked and dry. They loaded up the entree with sliced carrots, which aren't even supposed to be in Mongolian Beef (description says peppers and mushrooms).

My son and husband still love the Pad Thai and their rangoons are pretty good. But, that is about all I can say is good here. They skimp on the veggies, the curry is kindof bland, their larb not good, hot and sour soup also bland. Sorry guys, time to find a new Thai restaurant."}
{"text":"I wish I could give it 3 and a half stars.  But I don't feel it's a 4, for sure.

Pros: Excellent, authentic Thai tea.   Service is very friendly.  Willing to accommodate special requests in your dish.

Cons:  Inconsistent quality.  And when you ask for level 1 spice out of 10, it will often be the same as when you ask for 5 or higher.  Very little chicken (which is usually tough) in the chicken curry, which includes more carrots than any other vegetable, but also includes green bell peppers, usually wilted/bitter/aging basil, and then the usual ingredients in that dish that you would expect.  Pad Thai flavor is good, but often the sprouts are old and getting slightly slimy/funky.  Chicken is a little dry and tough in this as well."}
{"text":"Spicy basil fried rice, oh how I love thee. Yellow curry, spicy papaya salad and yummy spring rolls, are all must have's. And they have a separate vegan menu. Score."}
{"text":"I usually don't eat at Thai Restaurants because everything is so sweeeeet and I can make it better at home.  But today, I tried TSNH and it was actually very good.  I did have to tell them to hold the sugar on everything.  I ordered Rad-na because I do not like to make this particular dish because it's too much work for me. My daughter had Spicy basil fried rice and (hold the sugar please!!)  it turned out delicious.  We will be going back as this place is pretty tasty!!!"}
{"text":"Used To go to there Wynn location when I lived on that side of town.. When I moved and found out their other location was near by ... I was so excited. They have amazing food and can not get enough! One of the best tai places in Las Vegas. Prices are very responsible. My mother loves it and she is very critical.. Recommend it to everyone."}
{"text":"Great eats - homestyle thai food. Curries, noodles, noodle soups, and the lot. All tasty. Havent had a boring dish yet. Best part us that they deliver, too!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to try their food, ordered for carryout, they verified my order when I picked it up but I got home and they made my tofu pad see ew with chicken.:( Dinner was ruined as I don't eat meat. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"Price is good, but service is not.  Needs more server during lunch/ dinner time.  And we don't need a male server with sagging pants."}
{"text":"Their appetizer fried wonton is the best! it has that zesty sweet taste to it which I love! I would say its the only thing i order from the appetizer menu. Haven't tried it yet?! i suggest you should!"}
{"text":"Best Thai in town and somehow it's one of the cheapest too. Fantastic pot stickers. Love the spicy basil fried rice. Great service. Full scores across the board."}
{"text":"This a great spot for very reasonable prices and good sized portions. I had the pumpkin chicken curry which was delicate and flavored well and really good. My hubby had the spicy basil beef with wide pan fried noodles, which was good, but not as flavorful as mine. We split an order of chicken satay, which we both thought was over-seasoned and the peanut sauce lacking in flavor. I think we'll try again as the curry was so delicious. We asked for it spicy... a 7 of  10 for me i thought it was more of a 5... so kind of americanized. We thought it really worked if you were in the mood for thai, in a hurry and cheap eats."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, thanks Victor! We Left over-satisfied. Try the potstickers!!!    We had the yellow curry with chx, duck chowmein. Both way above average. Environment also above par. Thanks again!"}
{"text":"First of all I was shocked that such amazing food existed in this area! So I was asked my buddy for a random place to eat to switch things up and keep in mind that most of the time I try new places, i never really find a satisfying place. Well this time I'm glad I founds this delicious restaurant! 
I tried their yellow pumpkin curry with the spice level at a 10 out of 10 & I have to say IT WAS THE BEST CURRY I've ever tried!!
I've had a lot before but this took the cake!
HIGHLY RECOMMEND TO EVERYONE!"}
{"text":"love this place, my go-to thai restaurant. It's affordable and they're always friendly!"}
{"text":"Five stars because I didn't even leave a noodle on my plate.  It was that good.  Gonna keep this review short and simple.  Excellent Thai food for cheaper than most other places in town.  For my first time, I tried the Pad Thai - my food mood was yelling at me to eat Pad Thai.  It was wonderful and the perfect combination of ingredients and spice.  I agree with some other reviewers that I wish there were a Thai Style Noodle House in Henderson!  Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"5 stars even though in a strip center- why?
It's all about the food and service. Fairly extensive menu caused worry about quality sacrifice. Ordered 4 different meals and everyone was really good without any repeating of style or flavor- served family style so all got  samples. Restaurant was not fancy but clean and tasteful. Service from Victor was excellent as he saw my parents unfamiliar with Thai dishes and took time to describe, ask about their taste preferences, but then tactfully left the table to our meals. All this including combo appetizer and one dessert (for Dad). Tab?......$50"}
{"text":"The food is very good. I had the fried chicken and rice and it was incredible and its right around the corner from my house!"}
{"text":"We ordered the Won Ton Soup and Prak Pi King which is the name they used for spicy green beans. The soup comes with fish cakes, pieces of pork loin, garlic chips, cilantro and bean sprouts.Both dishes were so good!! Highly recommend this place. The Pad See Ew is excellent, and  the combination beef soup is tasty and full of flavor because they use three different kinds of beef. The broth is probably made with beef bones but is really heavy broth. I have yet to try the Tom Yum Soup noodle. Thai ice tea one of the best I've tried. Excellent customer service and pleasant servers.  Place is about to celebrate its first anniversay next week. They do a lot of take out orders and free delivery if you live less than 3 miles. Will be here every week for sure since we live close by."}
{"text":"This restraint is one of the few that I like! My husband and I always come here for Thai food! The service is ok....bc I keep seeing new waitress every time I go there.  I liked the waitress that was there before but I never got to ask her name so....Another thing is that they've made the salad too spicy when I asked for mild and this happened few times now. I hope they will get that right next time.  We still like the food that we will keep coming here:)"}
{"text":"I had gone in today for lunch and looked at their menu for their lunch specials. Not sure why they didn't just give the lunch special menu like they do at their 3rd location in Summerlin.
When you go for lunch be sure to ask for the lunch special menu. So much food! They currently have a 5.99 1 item combo with soup, rice and fried item. Add an additional item if you're hungry for 7.99. Their lunch menu encompasses a lot of choices from spicy eggplant to various curries. Mind you they don't do pad thai for the lunch special. But you won't miss it with all the other items they offer. And the prices can't be beat."}
{"text":"Best thai on this side of town for sure. Everything I've ever ordered was delicious and reasonably priced!"}
{"text":"I was in the neighborhood & decided to try out the 2nd TSNH location, being that I am a fan of the original one ;) 

I ordered the Roasted duck noodle soup & some pineapple fried rice. 

The broth for the soup was a little sweet for me, but it was very good, especially after I added the spicy condiments ;) 

The Pineapple fried rice was just as awesome as at the other location. 

I had saved room for dessert & was looking forward to some fried banana with ice cream & honey, but alas, they were all out of bananas :( 

This location is probably as small as the other one, maybe slightly bigger. Very clean & friendly staff. 

I would definitely come back ;)"}
{"text":"Actually went to this restaurant by accident thinking it was another Thai restaurant that I had researched earlier in the day. So many Thai restaurants on Fort Apache! Think they need to rename the street to Fort Thai. Anyways, the menu had a lot of choices but the one that stuck out for me was the duck curry. Two of my favorites duck and curry it was a no brainer. It was a really good first choice. Duck was tender and curry excellent with plenty of rice. Portion size wise I felt was perfect. Looking forward to going back and trying something else from the menu."}
{"text":"I just ordered to go from this place last night!! Amazing!!!! I love Thai food!!! The beef combination noodle soup was so good!! Even the flavoring of the broth had me drinking any left over soup. I also ordered the Papaya salad . Of course also amazing !! Best Papaya salad I've had. If you choose to dine in it is a small cozy place . Has the ma and pa shop vibe. The ppl that work there are super friendly too!! Must try!!"}
{"text":"Horrible food. The server didnt even give us plates and forks. The duck fried rice is so disgusting.  It's so chewy and greasy. Worst food ive ever tasted."}
{"text":"Found on Yelp and the reviews are right. Very good Thai food with an extensive but not expensive menu. Fast service considering how busy they were. Lots of take out, lots of full tables and lots of Asians eating here."}
{"text":"Being a huge fan of Thai cuisine I was looking forward to trying Thai Style Noodle house. 

I unfortunately was not impressed at all. My order consisted of chicken satay, crab Rangoon and pad Thai chicken spicy. 

The chicken satay was made of chicken that had the texture of cardboard and was bland. The peanut sauce didn't do the satay any favors either. The crab Rangoon was ok, nothing special about it nor can I say it wasn't good. The sweat and sour sauce that came with it was watery. The main dish, the pad Thai chicken was mediocre. There is a distinct difference in pad Thai from a Chinese restaurant and pad Thai noodles from an authentic Thai restaurant, these favored Chinese, which was very disappointing. The spicy was rather weak and the chicken in the dish also had a cardboard taste.

Unfortunately, I would not return nor recommend this restaurant. On a positive, the host and server was very friendly!"}
{"text":"Great place for a quick Thai fixin!  Love the friendly staff!  Kudos to Victor, La!  Always smiling, attentive, and friendly.  My fav dish is the \"Chicken Noodle Soup with Flat noodles\""}
{"text":"Tasty fish cakes, yummy curry, very reasonable pricing. The rad nar is lacking in the flavor department -needs garlic- and they tend to skimp on the coconut milk in the curry. It's a mystery as to why the noodle soups get cold so quick when eating there. Possibly the wide shallow dishes that are used for soup dishes. Papaya salad compliments any dish, especially meat dishes. Generous portions leave diners satisfied and for an additional charge; brown rice instead of white rice makes a great healthy choice. This is a delicious destination for foodies on a budget."}
{"text":"We love Noodle House#3 on Rampart n Lake Mead.  But At #2 is kind of disappointed.  It was salty and greasy. The service was ok."}
{"text":"This is great Thai food at a great price! Wonderful yellow and green curry! We also really like the house specialty potsticker appetizers. They deliver, which is also awesome! Just discovered it last week and already been back midweek for take out. :)"}
{"text":"I have eaten here several times, and I tend to always get their Cashew Chicken.  My boyfriend tries different things and everything is always delicious.  The prices are extremely affordable, and the food is always so fresh.  The staff are very friendly, and we love coming to this restaurant or ordering pickup.  You can get 2 entrees plus an appetizer for about $20.  Can't beat that.  We've tried the other Thai places along Ft. Apache, and this one is our favorite!"}
{"text":"Great food! I'm allergic to shell fish and some Asian restaurants use a fish sauce that contain shell fish or shrimp so I have to be super careful where I eat. I went in and asked about their fish sauce and they brought out a bottle and let me read the ingredients. The only \"fish\" was anchovy. That was super great that they did that. 
I only gave 4 stars because my yellow curry chicken and chicken pad Thai was skimpy on the chicken. 
Over all, two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Visited last night , beef panang curry not as good as first time . Yellow curry with chix and pumpkin really good .  Eggplant with chix very good same as last visit. Still a very good restaurant. Service very good."}
{"text":"Fantastic. The food was great. We were looking for something that wasn't China a No-No. We found the right spot. Orange chicken was perfectly crisp. Kids ate it up and no complaints. Not that Panda is worth comparing to but it is the kids choice and they usually complain when other Orange chicken doesn't taste right. We had a combo appetizer plate which was a great assortment. Thai chicken skewers were fantastic. Edamame was lightly salted and wonderful

Me had chicken curry and chicken pad Thai. Loved them both. We could have shared either dish because the portion size was nice. Not crazy large but a healthy portion. 

Although we didn't partake in desert they had a nice menu. Price was perfect. They don't serve fountain drinks. This usually annoys me but at 1.25 per can I spent less on drinks than any chain restaurant. I even had TWO cans!!!  

I think you should try this place."}
{"text":"I was starving after working for a bunch of hours at work. I was really craving  Asian food and my friend mentioned that he was getting Thai food. I rushed to Archie's since I LOVE their basil fried rice. It's amazing, but sadly they were closed. There are a bunch of Thai restaurants in this area, but this was the only name I remembered, so I decided to try it. I ordered Pork Pad Thai and Chicken fried rice. I ordered take out and my food came out pretty quickly. The service wasn't that great. Typically whenever I order to go, other places always offer me water, this place did not. They also did not offer me a place to sit. I just sat down. Maybe I just have different expectations? 

Their Pad Thai was weird. It was very dark and kind of clumpy. It wasn't horrible, but not the best I've ever had. My friend had Thai food from Weera Thai, and their Pad Thai was a lot lighter. I normally don't order Pad Thai, but I was starving and for some strange reason I wanted Pad Thai. The fried rice was pretty good. It just wasn't the same as I was looking for. I ordered a spice level of 7/10, and none of the dishes were spicy at all. I was worried that 7 would be too spicy, but it wasn't spicy at all! It was kind of disappointing, actually."}
{"text":"Came to eat here with my kids the other day, I am very critical of my Thai food since I have been to Thailand and have alot of Thai friends who cook authentic meals for me. Heard really good things about this place from coworkers so I figured I would try it out. I drove pretty far to check out this restaurant since I live on the opposite side of town but it was well worth it. It was a Saturday and I was greeted right away which is always a plus, we sat by the fish tank, it kept the kids occupied for awhile. I ordered the papaya salad, tom yum soup, pad see ewe , and bbq pork. The papaya salad was good but a little too sweet for my taste. Tom yum soup was delicious as well as the bbq pork. My kids liked the pad see ewe but to me it was just ok. I would actually only rate the food 3 1/2 stars but the reason it got 5 was the service was great. Our waiter was very nice and attentive, and he was able to comply to all my special requests (since my kids are picky). it usually is hard to find really good service in Asian restaurants because they usually hire people with no personalities and don't speak that much, and I was happy to have a waiter that could not only conversate and make me laugh but more importantly make my kids happy. It always makes life easier when they know how to handle kids and keep them happy so it makes it easier to enjoy my meal. Definitely will come back and bring my friends, hopefully my expectations will proceed me."}
{"text":"Probably my favorite go-to place for Thai food. Prices are very reasonable, the food is delicious, and they are very nice. My favorite dish there is the panang curry. 
This place is missing a star only because of my first time going there. But after giving them another chance, I love the place from there on. I was never served at all on my first visit. Waited to order for 20 minutes, even got there attention, but they ignored us and pretended that they didn't hear me.
But like I said that's all forgiven, everytime I get Thai food, I go here!"}
{"text":"We eat here quite often. We love the food and the friendly service. We first went to  Noodle House 1 in China Town before 2 opened. This location is more modern and the room has a more fresh feel.

We love the lunch special menu, the pot stickers, the wonton fishball soup, the mixed veg entrée. It's all very good. We have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"I've been to this place for couple years already. It really disappointed me this time. Staff messed up my to go order, didn't call me back when she realized the mistake, didn't apologize when I called, only told me to go back again to exchange food. I was tired from working whole day and lived 10 mins driving distance away. It's extra 20 mins I had to drive to and from so I could have the right food. When I got there I  told the staff and owner (or owner's son) to either refund the money or do something. The owner refunded my money without apology or even eye contact.. The service is disappointed.."}
{"text":"Casual, totally unpretentious - the place I go when I'm really hungry and I want hearty great Thai food at a great price.  Staff is friendly, and whatever I order, I'm never disappointed. Chet also serve a pumpkin curry that is to die for, and I don't see this item on menus of other Thai restaurants.  Hubbie agrees, we've never had a bad dish here.  And we've been here many times."}
{"text":"I'm giving it 2 stars for the service and quickness. Now for the food, we ordered the pad Thai and the pad se ew. The pad thai was a big clump of sticky gummy ramen like noodles you could barely chew let alone swallow, but the flavor was good they need a flatter noodle and the chicken was over cooked. The pad se ew had good flavor but the noodles were not wide the pork was tough.

I prefer the food at the corner Thai kitchen around the corner on trop.  Give it a try and please let me know what you think.  I jugde a Thai place on the pad Thai if they can make that well, you can bet the rest will be good too."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious 2 item lunch special. I got kung pao beef and yellow chicken curry, spicy level #8! Comes w a huge dollop of white rice, smal cup of soup and choice of appetizer..I got a wonton..all for only #7.95! Plus, they are offering 7% cash back through Yelp..by signing up one of your credit cards..then, all you have to do, is use it there, and Yelp credits you back 7% of your bill. Highly recommended. Great flavors."}
{"text":"Really good, fresh, noodles and rice dishes. I have eaten there twice and had great food and service. They will prepare your order with the spiciness of your choosing. Have tried the egg rolls for appetizer, 2 styles of phad thai, and 2 style of thai fried rice. All were prepared just as we ordered. The egg rolls are so crisp! Cannot wait to try more items on the menu."}
{"text":"The curry with chicken and pumpkin was outstanding! Food was tasty and delicious. The service was five star!"}
{"text":"Good food, great price, but HORRIBLE customer service. This is the only place I know that doest answer it's phone and then hangs up on you if you let it ring, then when you call back it's busy because it's off the hook.  Guess they are not trying to actually make money? Tired of this game as this happens at least once a week to us. I'm going down the street from now on."}
{"text":"Has become our favorite place! They deliver!!! Papaya salad and pot stickers are so amazing! I love the shrimp curry and pineapple fried rice! Always perfect and staff super friendly!"}
{"text":"Seriously the rudest encounter of my life. They tried to give me half my food for full price and then when I asked if this was correct they fixed it with the most attitude possible. The foods good but the workers are not. Definetly never coming here again."}
{"text":"The cashier was rude dont have no since of humor, I don't think he knows whats customer Service is all about. I wouldnt recommend this place at all..."}
{"text":"Love this place. Affordable, delicious & healthy food!! Plus the staff are nice. I usually order the yellow curry with a side of either flat or vermicelli noodles. You've to try that, it's sooo good! I've yet to try the entire menu lol. They have a separate vegetarian/vegan menu too which I love. It's easy to be vegan when the food is this good! Healthy vegan fast food!"}
{"text":"We waited about 25 minutes to put in our drink order, then we both had straw paper in our water. The pad thai had very little flavor and the noodles were soggy. 
However the glass noodle soup was decent probably some of the top 10 noodle soups I've ever had. Probably wont be back."}
{"text":"Great service, great prices. I think the spicy scale is a bit of a scam as everything always seems hot, but no matter, we love this place!"}
{"text":"Food is Excellent but the service is NOT! The gentleman taking the food orders acted like we were disturbing him.. Tried to give him the benefit of the doubt but this is the 3rd time we go and he's always beind rude and in a rush."}
{"text":"Since my hubby and I live right around the corner we decided to try this place. We were so glad we did! Before this, we always went to Archi's but since they've open we haven't been anywhere else for Thai food in the Vegas area.

They give big portions for great prices. Our favorites here are: beef larb, rad na, pad see ew, spicy egg plant (we can't eat too spicy so we opt for #3 spice) and most def the Thai ice tea. Did I mention they have a huge xl cup available for anyone who loves it? Service is always fast and friendly, even during their busiest hours."}
{"text":"I have ordered delivery from this place on a number of occasions.  To be fair, I have never been inside the restaurant itself so I cannot meaningfully comment on restaurant atmosphere etc.  To that extent, I cannot give the review more than a four and speak accurately.  Delivery is very timely and the people are friendly over the telephone.  Our order was well packaged and came to the house hot and fresh.

I have tried number of the dishes here and never been disappointed.  The drunken noodles with seafood combination is a spicy and savory dish that hits the spot.  I am a big fan of the curries here.  The red curry with seafood combination and the duck curry are excellent as well.  The soups are very delicious and sooth the body well if one is feeling sick or under the weather.  The spice level is appropriate as to what we have requested.  This has consistently been a good delivery food experience.

I look forward to visiting the restaurant in person soon."}
{"text":"I love the place simply because the food is very good for the price, its just that simple, not to mention Victor is my BOIIII..."}
{"text":"Very good food for a great price. I had the fried chicken over fried rice. The chicken was not overly oily, crispy delicious coating. The Orange chicken was great too, no chunks of fat or chewy pieces. Great quality of food and friendly service!"}
{"text":"Uh oh. Looks like things went downhill.. came in again and the wait staff was very rude upon arrival. The table we wanted was not ready which we had no issue waiting for. We were given an attitude when asked if we could sit there. When we asked nicely for water while our waitresd was wiping down the table, she actually IGNORED us. She seemed angry that we asked for the table to be cleaned and water. It was 95 degrees out. The real kicker was seeing the filth next to our table. I'll be checking out the other place nearby. Wanted this to be my go to."}
{"text":"Food is great, but their service is horrible, they show a lot of attitude, been to two of their
Locations - the one on Fort Apache and one on Spring Mountain Rd, at both the locations the food is amazing (as if the chefs making food are cloned :-)) , but both the locations the service is horrible, I visit to one on Fort Apache, food can't go wrong anytime - it comes fast and taste exactly as expected always, so is their service pathetic and with don't care attitude. Ex: Gives water with out straw you have to always ask for it and when you ask they give a strange look!! And once I asked for extra fork silver instead of plastic one and she says \"we only have this\", damn thing I could see silverware all around, they are usually busy and want to serve asap and get rid of you!"}
{"text":"We come here all the time mostly because it's right by the house and it's reasonably priced! Staff is so nice and food is served so quickly! Our favorites are beef nam tok, pineapple shrimp curry, panang, papaya salad and tom yum."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place. It's our go to place if we are craving Thai food. We love the dry noodle, it reminds us of our trip in Thailand & had the street food. I can go on & on with their delicious food, just try it yourself and you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Not good.

We ordered the chicken wings, pad thai, and pineapple fried rice last night.  The woman on the phone was very nice, and informed us the delivery would take about 45 minutes, since they were busy.  We were fine with this, unfortunately I can't say the same about the food.

The Pad thai showed up in a large clump of mushy noodles.  The flavors were all there, but the texture ruined the dish.  

The Fried Chicken wings had feathers on them.  Yes, feathers.  This should never happen, but clearly someone in the kitchen was rushing.  Either way, disgusting.

The Pineapple fried rice lacked the flavor many others have had, but it wasn't gross, just not very good.  It was on the light side which was nice, but still is not worth ordering. 

I'm not remotely interested in trying this place again, there are way too many Thai restaurants to settle for poor quality food."}
{"text":"Stopped by after getting a foot massage, which made me starving. It wasn't bad. The service was good. I have mixed feelings about the food. I got the yellow curry with chicken. It was really good, especially the potatoes in it. It was almost if they baked these pieces and then put them in the curry. They were different and tasty. I also got Som Tum and pork. This was just OK, especially the meat, which was a bit on the dry side and tasting slightly like liver. It came with two sauces and I preferred the one with vinegar rather than the sweet one although I'm not a big fan of vinegary tastes. The sticky rice that came with it was bad. It came in a bamboo container, I guess, to keep it moist. However, it was so tough, especially around the edges, that I didn't like it. I don't think it was supposed to be like this and that it was overcooked. I also didn't care for the bean-sprout type of salad. I'm not a fan of bean sprouts or having peanuts used in foods."}
{"text":"Everything is so delicious! They have a pretty large menu so you will forsure find something for you. They even have a vegan menu! I recommend their pad Thai and crispy tofu appetizer!"}
{"text":"Super yummy! 
Best soups ever.. Fast take out, great to dine in as well. 
I found my new soup house."}
{"text":"Lent season = no meat. So what better place to grab shrimp dishes than a thai spot? 

And while I may opt for all the standard staple Thai dishes, I can also be very picky about them... and I was very impressed that they are all done very well at this 4 locationed restaurant throughout Las Vegas (Chinatown, Fort Apache, Rampart & S. Jones)!

RECOMMEND: 
- TOFU PAD THAI: Stir fried small rice noodles with egg, ground peanuts, bean sprouts in pad thai sauce. (I ordinarily would order this with chicken, if I could eat meat!)
- SHRIMP YELLOW CURRY: Coconut milk mixed with white onions, bell peppers, tomatoes & potatoes, with side of white rice. 
- SHRIMP PAD SEW: Stir fried flat rice noodles and egg with broccoli in sweet black soy sauce. (I usually prefer this dish with beef, but like I said, lent no meat fridays!)
- SEAFOOD WONTON SOUP: Wonton soup with seafood and yoo choy in clear broth. Add noodles to it for $0.75! 

Everything extremely satisfactory and hit the spot! Service was good, venue was nice, and the portions were filling! New to the southwest area and I think we officially found our go-to Thai place! :)"}
{"text":"Have been here many times. I will never be back after the amount of time taken and no care if you wait. There were four people eating and I was the only person waiting. Soup took 30 minutes. When I expressed my concern no one cared. I DO NOT recommend. Zero stars in my book but you have to pick something."}
{"text":"4pm Saturday - Sold out of Noodle Duck, Floors and Chairs very dirty... Water taste like Chlorine.. WOW!  No more noodle house for this Team... Approved by JKKUHL LLC."}
{"text":"My now favorite thai place.. I really enjoy there thai spicy basil & there egg drop soup"}
{"text":"If you're looking for something cheap and decent, this place isn't bad. We ordered fried tofu, calamari, duck curry, salmon avocado curry, chicken noodles. We all asked for medium spicy and most of our food wasn't spicy at all except for the noodles which was really spicy  ( my friend looked like he was in a hot yoga class while eating it, I personal tried it and it was on the very spicy side) we had to add rice to it and even with that, it was still very spicy."}
{"text":"Fried chicken over fried rice, duck fried rice, thai spicy noodles and yellow curry are all great!  The pad thai was OK.  Big servings for the price you pay."}
{"text":"Nice little hole in the wall with delicious and authentic Thai food. How do I know it's authentic? My bf and I usually get the runs - IN A GOOD WAY because of the spice, not because of food poisoning, lol. Everything is incredibly affordable and well portioned with noodle dishes around $7 and specials around $8-9. I particularly enjoyed their special beef noodle soup, kuay kai seafood rice noodles, BBQ pork w/ papaya salad and sticky rice, and their pork larb. I would definitely stop by again if I'm ever in the area."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Thai food in Vegas. The service was on point, the place is clean and again the service was excellent."}
{"text":"Great place, great food.  Can make anything Vegan but you have to tell them.  They use a special button on cpu that says vegan.  I like that.  Means no fish sauce and egg.  Very nice, comfortable dining area.  Fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Food is just ok but the services is very very bad. 2 waitress just keep talking to each other we ask for one more white rice it's never come. I will never come back to this place."}
{"text":"Been coming here a while and I'm always treated nicely by all the workers. They're always smiling no matter what. Never had a bad service."}
{"text":"Good Thai food on the cheap. The only thing I dont like is their chairs at the Fort Apache location. They are worn out and sunken in. Very uncomfortable."}
{"text":"This is our 2nd or 3rd time eating here. Always good service & food. We enjoyed the calamari, Larb, and pad Thai - deliciousness! I also like the menu is affordable. If you enjoy Thai food, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"GREAT CURRY! yummy pot stickers and pad thai. like the new location further from the strip."}
{"text":"You get what you pay for. If you're looking for a cheap Thai Spot here you go! Bright side is they offer XL Thai Tea for $3."}
{"text":"Great food and incredible value!

I discovered this place via Yelp and was so excited when they opened this location closer to my home!  

We frequent this place and I've tried most of the more appealing items on the menu.

Must haves:

Coconut Water!  Try it!  It's sweet with chunks of coconut right in the glass.  Surprisingly good!

Thai style pot stickers...quality deep fried dumplings, but with a kicker.  Three different sauces on top.  Believe it or not, makes all the difference.  Amazing!

Grilled beef or pork salad.  Thai style salads are great!  Crunchy and tasty, TSNH makes one of the best.  It's a great combination of meat and veggies and priced well for the size too.

Roasted Duck Noodle Soup.  Sweet and plentiful.  You can choose your noodles, so I usually pick the thicker rice noodles and add wontons for extra heartiness.  Sweet broth goes perfectly with the duck and it's filling and good!

Tom Yum  Noodle Soup.  My friend's favorite!  Coconut base with a spicy bite.  That sweet and sour flavor is unmistakable and again, big portions, hearty and filling!

Khua Kai.  I compare this to it's chinese counterpart of fried rice noodles, but they serve it with a side of duck sauce that makes the thai version just a hair better.  Pretty simple dish, fried with scallions and egg with soy sauce, but when you mix it with the duck sauce...it's a perfect match!

Duck fried rice.  The duck adds a moist, more tender meat than your typical chicken, beef and pork.  Add that to a definite thai style of fried rice here, and it's just great fried rice!

Mangos with sweet sticky rice.  I grew up on sticky rice and this dessert runs $6 at the thai place down the street!  It's the same thing and always tastes better when it's less expensive!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I was a fan.

I have been to both locations. I stopped going to the other because of sanitary reasons. I saw the dude cooking on the wok sneeze in to his hand, then continue cooking. I asked the waitress and she said, \"no he did not\" ... OK ... gross.

Then here ... previously, cheap and decent Thai food.

Until this week. Ordered food ... it came, the pot sticklers which are usually excellent were dripping grease and covered/swimming in sauce. Not a good start. The soup and salad came, and so did a little friend walking across the floor.  Actually not so little. A roach in the middle of the dining room. When I went to the manager/cashier about it, she said they have no problems - they spray all the time. I said then what about the roach in the middle of the restaurant, she said it must have come from outside. (After leaving the business, not one roach, anywhere.) I find this very hard to believe when on previous experience I had health concerns with their other location - in fact, I just learned the other location was temporarily closed by the Southern Nevada Health District last month. I think it is time for an inspection of this location as well.

For what it is worth, I offered to pay, I kept asking how much do I owe you - I kept asking, again, kept asking - yet she was on a very long conversation in Thai (I assume with an owner) about the roach issue. She did not make me pay, which in all honesty is what should have been offered in the beginning, since we did not eat and we were interrupted by pests."}
{"text":"I normally go to the original Noodle House, but Noodle House 2 is a lot closer to my house so I thought I'd try it out. 

The inside of this one is so much nicer. More spacious, more modern, and there's actually a waiting area when the restaurant is full. 

The menu is the same as the original, which I was happy to see! I ordered what I usually get (beef and broccoli) at the original house to compare it to this one. My BF ordered a combination bowl with small rice noodle. Both of the dishes weren't as good as the original house, but they weren't bad either. It was almost as if they both tasted more bland. 

The servers were very nice. One of them was so engaged with his customer they were talking about boxing almost the whole time we were eating... Lol. (Go Manny!!!)

Overall we enjoyed our experience and really liked the restaurant inside!"}
{"text":"Pad see eww and green curry fried rice are great! I can substitute my crave for Sanam Luang (in SoCal) with food from Thai Style Noodle House!"}
{"text":"I decided not to go here again because of the lady with her service.  Never really pleasant with her every time.  finally had enough when i asked for light ice with my Thai ice tea and she told me that's extra."}
{"text":"Very good food, fast service, great prices. The Thai specialty drinks are cheaper than at other places. Nice inside, friendly service, no debit card limit of $15 anymore (great bc I don't carry cash). 

My favorites are the papaya salad, basil fried rice, and pad Thai. I'll keep coming back happily! :)"}
{"text":"*** update I have now been harassed 2 times by profiles the owner instead of trying to make it right is now sending foul messages to me directly. *** I have been to this location many times and I have to say I usually enjoy anything that I order and usually the service is amazing but today I went in and ordered my usual broth and was met by complete rudeness. By only a person that I can assume is the owner. he is a man that I have never seen her before but it seems like he rather be anywhere else but running his business. The fact he was demeaning to his staff on top of it made me say scratch my order and I will never order or put money into the pockets of such an a**hole."}
{"text":"What can I say?  Great thai food and great prices.  I ordered the pad kee mao, papaya salad, and the spicy basil beef/ chicken.  Friendly people and I am so glad they are opening another one up on Jones and Warm springs!  Win!  I love this place and for the price, it's a must try."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. This place is right by my house so it's a very convenient location. First of all the food is really good, I always order the beef ball noodle soup (similar to pho) and the fried snapper with chili sauce, which is absolutely to die for. Their Thai iced tea and appetizers are delicious as well. 5 stars for good food and great service."}
{"text":"Love this place, been going there since they opened.. Cheap and the food tastes good. Love the spicy basil chicken, spicy string beans, and the yellow curry."}
{"text":"People are friendly soon as we walk in they greeted us, place is kinda clean I think they need to change the chairs it's kinda dirty already. Food was good we ordered beef combination and parang curry both were good definitely would be back to try the other menu they have to offer, price is pretty decent the also have lunch special ranging to 8.95  the place is easy to find near a barber ship. The compound itself has a lot of store."}
{"text":"this my favorite thai take-out place in vegas bc it's delicious, SO CHEAP !!!!!, and quick."}
{"text":"Great food and flavors with authenticity...To top it off great prices. My fav's are lard-na, pad thai, beef noodle soup. Great place to satisfy your cravings for Thai food."}
{"text":"I love this joint! Food feels like a warm hug on a cold winter's night. Always comforting to know they are just around the corner when I am craving the noodle house. I always order the chicken noodle soup with flat noodles."}
{"text":"Foods are good. But the male server( with glasses)  has terrible service. We've been there three times, the same server same terrible service. Won't really say a word to us. Only word he said was \" you done?\" Female server was totally different. Would come to us ask if everything ok. Has very friendly smile. Never go there eat again if the male server still works there."}
{"text":"THREE WORDS: QUANITY FINALLY MEETS QUALITY ( Ok, FOUR words!) lol But FINALLY, i don't have to take a journey down to the east side of Las Vegas to get some authentic and savory thai cuisine. I work nearby and i must say i eat here at least twice a week and even on my days off.
The Portions are far generous and the quality definitely exceeds my expectations. Bursting with flavor their dishes will take anyones taste buds for a ride. Anyone LOVE papaya salad LAOS style?? Get it here, is is BOMBDOTCOM. The Rad Nah, pad see ew, and pad thai are also amazing, but one of my favorites is the chef's special pineapple curry.! & the LARGE thai tea which is Gi-normous is only $3.00. Major two thumbs up from me.!"}
{"text":"I called for a pick up order only to drive there and find out that that their credit card machine is broken and that it's cash only. I didn't have any cash so I just left with no food, wasted gas and the worst part of it was that they didn't even apologize about the fact that they didn't tell me on the phone that it was broken before I drove there. Also I asked them why didn't tell me on the phone that the machine is broken and they basically just looked me at and said nothing with and \"oh well \" face. If I just wasn't so hungry I wouldn't have came back, so I brought cash with me and they tried to hand me the old curry I ordered had to ask them to make it fresh for me and looked mad about it. Ridiculous!!"}
{"text":"I come here for their chicken pad see ew and panang curry. The prices are lower than most Thai restaurants but the food is delicious and the portions are big."}
{"text":"Love love love this place! I always get their Shrimp Pad Thai at level 5! Such a good portion just wish they would add more peanut crumbs!"}
{"text":"Love their food! Their prices are also incredibly low for the quality of the food. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend placed 2 orders of fried calamari to go, and when we got home I was so upset. What we got today in two boxes equals the amount of food we were served with one order the previous week. So disappionting!  There're only probably 10 pieces in each box :("}
{"text":"Love love love love love!!! I'm a creature of habit so I always get the pan nang curry with chicken and sticky rice. And I like it hot! Owner is super nice too"}
{"text":"Ordered the pineapple fried rice with fried tofu, added-on brocolli, and no egg for yummy vegan meal. Highly recommend, but if you want it to be spicy, I suggest level 9-10. Asked for a level 7 and it was really mild!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service. The crab fried rice is the best. If you looking for a great Thai food, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"We have been looking for a good Thai place close to home.  The food and service was excellent!"}
{"text":"I always order this through uber eats and the portions are giant for the price. It's always super hot, fresh, and delicious. I've ordered Thai through other places that aren't nearly as good for what you pay. The pad Thai and Tom kha soup are two of my faves!"}
{"text":"After going to another Thai Restaurant and paying $12 for Pineapple Fried Rice, I was shocked with how cheap the prices were here. Around $7 for a big box of my favorite fried rice, and it tastes amazing? What more could you possibly ask for?

While I'm still a little weary to try other menu items, I did order the Mango Sticky Rice after reading a few good things about it here on yelp -- and it's actually really, really good. I was a little afraid how rice and fruit would mesh together, but it's tasty without being too sweet.

Clean looking restaurant, great tasting food, and I love how inexpensive it is."}
{"text":"First time out was a winner - ordered the appetizer combo, all were good if fairly standard, but the chicken satay was amazing, I could have made a meal of it. I wanted to try the soups but they stop serving them at 9:30. Also had the chicken/shrimp with silver noodles & the khua-kai rice noodle with egg and chicken, both were great, flavorful but not overloaded with sauces or spices so I could taste the food. Def a place I'll keep in mind when the next Thai food jones hits. Check it out."}
{"text":"By far my favorite Thai place! I would eat here once a week if I could! Service isn't the best but I don't mind I go there for the food!"}
{"text":"Great food....horrible customer service. It took 10 mins to get water. I had to ask them to take my order. And when waitress was ready she made a smart comment about not taking my order because my phone was out."}
{"text":"Love their Spicy Eggplant with ground beef spicy level 10, however they don't have chilly in fish oil oh well I got mine at home."}
{"text":"Most recent visit was disorganised and disappointing. The food here is tasty but the portion size for the price is daylight robbery. First time having my favorite Glass noodle salad here but it was overly salty and had barely any noodles, mostly cilantro, onions and romaine. This dish is bigger AND better at Panna down the street. Our waitress was rushing us to order even though there was only one other table. Then our main dishes came out separately so two of us were eating while the others were still sitting 20 mins without food. We asked to cancel the orders because it was taking too long and we had to get back. The waitress kept telling us the food was almost ready but we'd lost our appetite and our time at this point. She was quick to take our payment however. Smh."}
{"text":"Very average thai restaurant. Average quality food and poor service. Lotus of Siam is much, much better."}
{"text":"We had the sampler appetizer platter. The bbq chix skewers were.very good . I would def get that by itself next time. If there is. The rest were meh. We also had the pad see ew. That was also good although lacked any spice and some salt.. We asked for medium . We also got the beef larb. I ve eaten quite a bit of this dish at many Thai places and I also used to work at a Thai rest. Their larb is nothin. Like anything it's suppose to be. Maybe they forgot how to make it that night? It was just chopped up big chunks of beef . With some lemon juice. No mint no rice powder nothing . And mind u they threw so much red pepper flakes in it that I know for a fact they over spiced it . It had red all over . But they didn't correct it. Poor customer service on their end . I just didn't eat it.
 The good : prices. 
The bad: service and quality ."}
{"text":"This place is one of my favorite Thai restaurants. My favorite is shrimp pad Thai with a 5 for the spicy level. The price is pretty good for the quality of the pad Thai! I have tried the green curry and the red curry. I love them both! Definitely not a 5 star restaurant but I would give it 4 stars! !"}
{"text":"Now that I moved back to this side of town, I will be coming here a LOT more often. I love the choice of foods and how you can customize your noodle entrees!!

Absolutely gotta try the Roasted Duck Noodle soup!! I get this almost every other time I go~ I've never ordered anything here that I didn't like."}
{"text":"There are four Thai Style Noodle House restaurants in Las Vegas. This is the second one. I have to say the place is clean and the food is very good. However, the service has a lot to be desired! When we arrived, the restaurant only had a few patrons. When we sat down we had to wait a bit for our drink orders(no big deal). When our drink and food orders were taken the waiter was not at all friendly. My meal came after about 10 minutes, I was given no extra plate, condiments, or napkins.The waiter then took a seat and finished his meal. My son's meal did not arrive for ten more minutes. Not once were we offered more soda or water. After we finished we asked for the check. The older woman handed it to me with out a thank you or a smile. We have been here several times and these two servers are EXTREMELY RUDE! How pathetic to dislike your job so much. I will not be back, I will just take my business elsewhere!"}
{"text":"I came here on a sunday to have a date with me, myself and I, and I was dying of hunger. Okay, well not exactly dying, but I was super hungry, since I didn't eat anything that day.  Anyways, onto the review:  

I was immediately greeted and seated seconds after walking in, then asked what I would like to drink.  I received my water and ordered larb with regular rice, and calamari with sweet sour sauce. Now I loved how much 'meat' you get with the calamari, but I didn't like the sweet and sour sauce paired together. I liked the larb, but not 'in love' with the larb because it was drowned in sauce that it was getting harder to eat towards the bottom of the plate. 

Towards the end, I had to stop a server for a box, and normally when one does that you receive a check.  I received my box and put my leftovers away, while waiting for a check.  I waited another minute or two and realized the server was just talking with another server that I had to interrupt her.  Other than that, it wasn't so bad. I'm willing to go back."}
{"text":"I ordered for the first time and chose the pad thai thinking it would be the safe choice. I didn't think it was all that great. It was edible but I wouldn't want to order from here again"}
{"text":"I decided to take my sister here as she suggested Thai food and I did not want to go down to Chinatown or even near there.  We were pleasantly surprised.  I couldn't believe the pricing for the amount of food we got.  The staff was very attentive.  I would definitely recommend this restaurant and will be going back."}
{"text":"Each and every time we go the food is super good, nice and hot and generous helpings! Staff nice and friendly and restaurant clean!"}
{"text":"Food here is good.  Sometimes the food is a little off though when you tell them the spice level you want.  If you order a 4 spice level one day may be like a level 7 spice level another.   All in All, I just like their duck dishes and the beef noodle soups.  You can't really get it at some of the other Thai places.  If you're not a duck person or a Thai noodle soup person, then I would try places like Archi Thai's Pad Thai and Thai Fried Rice is way better."}
{"text":"It's been YEAAARS since I ate at this location and it's still good! I used to go to the Wynn location a lot back in the day, but this one seems newer. This location has been open for a long time now and it still looks like a good environment to dine in. As far as food quality goes the two locations I've been to seem to have the same taste. They have never disappointed me as far as their food, but the real take from this place are the prices. Everything is pretty cheap and they give great portions! My girlfriend and I were able to share an order of pad Thai noodles and beef jerkey. She also got an order of their thai tea. We spent less than $20. I remember I used to get their BBQ combo you find on the back of the menu. It comes with sticky rice and papaya salad. That was always my go to. The servers were welcoming and I can tell they've gotten to know a lot of the regulars there. I forgot how good this place was for a quick thai fix. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Two days in a row, we ate and ordered different food items and the taste is really great!  Authentic Thai food for a cheap price!  So worth it!"}
{"text":"Clean, delicious food, shared crab fried rice, I had chicken noodle soup, my wife had the beef soup, both were really good lots of meat and noodles, very reasonable price for the amount of food and the quality of it. Great service. We will be back!"}
{"text":"My first time having curry and it was amazing! The lady was very accommodating to my request and every time I go there (they definitely had my boyfriend and I hooked after first time) she is really nice and helpful! This is my forsure go to place from now on!"}
{"text":"How would I describe Thai Style noodle house? Well, take one hand open it up and place something of outstanding quality there, then take the other side of your hand and also place something of really good quality there but A LOT of it, then CLAP your hands together! Aside from Hercules Hercules! What do you have? The meeting of QUALITY and QUANITY! Innovative I know, but that is exactly how I would describe this place they serve up plates and plates of delicious food and you get A LOT of it!

 I have yet to be disappointed each time of come here and have explored a vast majority of the menu! Must tries are their pad Thai, duck fried rice, chicken panang, basil beef, basil fried rice and if your LAO or prefer the Lao style papaya salad rather than Thai, they have the best LAO Style papaya salad! Super great location and awesome prices. Service is also stellar. Recommended for all your savory Thai cravings!"}
{"text":"The very first place I came to eat at when I first moved to Las Vegas.  I was impressed by the quality of food, and service.  I have come here numerous time over the past few months.  My favorite dish is the Yellow Curry, and I think their coconut juice is some of the best I've ever tasted (ice cold, served with a spoon to eat the baby coconut)."}
{"text":"I love love love this place. If they were closer to my house I would probably frequent this place more then once a week.

It's hard to find a good Thai place that cooks their food like my moms style but here they do and I struck gold because my mom now lives in Tennessee so this was the best substitute. 

Every time I come here I want to order everything on the menu but always get the Crispy Pork belly fat with Chinese broccoli about $8.95 plus a single side of rice. Their 3 companion dish hits close to home with the BBQ pork, papaya salad and sticky rice is perfect and reminds me of what my mom would make all the time. A lot of their other dishes are absolutely delicious and the dessert sound and looks amazing I yet have to try that. 

Food is amazing, price is awesome and restaurant is clean and quaint. The staff is also very nice. I would return to the place everyday of I could. If you haven't been here you must do just that because you will be hook at first bite."}
{"text":"Not bad for the price. Ordered pad se ue, pad Thai and yellow chicken curry. The curry wasn't thick at all but the taste was good. And the other two were good but I've had better. If u want lower priced Thai food this is a good place."}
{"text":"I always order from here when I'm hungover lol I get usually a mix of things. But I always, always get the beef salad level 7! My favorite!!!"}
{"text":"This is the best Thai restaurant in Las Vegas.

Try these:
Lad Nah noodles
Papaya salad
Grilled pork
Pad Se-Eu
Hoi Toad"}
{"text":"I like reviewing places for the purpose that they serve, so they don't necessarily need orgasmic, revolutionary food just to garner a full 5 stars.  This place is good and cheap- great for what it is.

Interior is what it is too, nothing super splendid but not shabby either.  They have the Thai channel on as you wait for your food, which can be entertaining at times to see the monkey dancing and other oddities.  Service is fine- quick and attentive.

But their food..  very, very nice.  There was only one other place in Vegas that had bigger portions of pad thai, but that place closed down.  Whomp whomp.  I've tried plenty of their dishes and it's only when I tasted their praram dish that I had to write a review.  It's a stir fry of vegetables and any choice of meat, topped with peanut sauce.  To my, peanut sauce is like an aphrodisiac, and this dish had PLENTY.  So.  Good.

I went here with a friend and I've been returning with more friends ever since.  I'm always hungry late night so an hour or two before they close, if I'm feeling hungry, I'll stop by the place and get something quick.

All other Thai places nearby are way too expensive for what they're putting out- if you're craving it and are in the area, you gotta stop by."}
{"text":"Food was great! Prices were great! Customer service? HORRIBLE! Waitress had a horrible attitude when asking for an extra sticky rice for our daughters. She never even brought it out. Never came to refill our drinks. Just bad service."}
{"text":"Favorite Thai restaurant by far.  Same great prices as the Wynn location in Chinatown, but much nicer dining area inside.  Staff is always friendly.  Food is always amazing and prices are phenominal...reminiscent of great Thai places I used to eat at in Seattle."}
{"text":"My roomie and I walked in around 3pm on a Friday afternoon. We were told we could choose our own seating, cool.

I ordered the Hot and Sour special soup with flat noodles. My roomie ordered the spicy basil fried rice with beef. The Hot and Sour soup was not as flavorful as I had thought it would be. It was definitely sour, though. The soup comes with multiple meats but my favorites were the ground chicken and pork (everything else was eh). I'm giving this place 4 stars because I ended up enjoying my roomie's fried rice more than I liked my own meal. 

Maybe next time I'll try something different. Will come back with hopes to be proven wrong about future dishes."}
{"text":"Just as good as the first one.
I'm glad this place is the same because nothing needs to change.
I love coming here for a quick bite to eat because I'm never disappointed and the service is relatively quick.
And their Thai Tea is still on point.
As with the original Noodle House, I wish it were a little bigger.
I've never seen the place crowded or have a wait but I just feel a little cramped whenever I'm inside.
I guess they're just keeping it old school."}
{"text":"This place is great. We were in the area and my girll suggested we try this place for lunch. As an official fan of Thai food, I was on board. The curry and noodles were perfect. Delicious and spicy. My favorite combination. I will definitely be back and because of their great prices, I can often."}
{"text":"The basil chicken w rice, excellent! The pot stickers excellent! Thai tea good. . I love good thai. This was my first time here , I'll be back"}
{"text":"I may not be the best to read a review from because I order the same thing every single time.  Yellow curry with chicken, no potatoes, no potatoes and extra chicken.   I think it's some of the tastiest yellow curry around.   Plus the prices are very solid (I think my meal is like $8).   Most places are at least a few dollars more for the same thing.  They are weak with the spicy.  When they ask what level of spicy I want from 1 to 10, I always say 20 and tell them I want it really really really hot.   To the point that I'll cry from the heat.   And maybe one out of 8 times it's as insanely spicy as I want it.   It's always tasty though.   As always they give not nearly enough rice as you need (but no Thai place does) so I just make more at home and usually turn my dish into 2 meals.  

I usually choose take out but sometimes I eat in.  The service isn't too great.  They get the waters to you pretty quickly and take your order fast but you hardly see them after they bring you your food.   Slacking on the water fill up a little usually but it's all good with me.   I'll go up to the counter if I need something which is slightly inconvenient.  

The place is modern and clean on the inside from what I can see (their chinatown location is pretty gross, I wouldn't eat there) but I never got a gander into the kitchen.   I've had the beef pad-see-ew (probably bad spelling) and thought it was a nice portion and tasty.   

If they could step up the spicy and have better service Id give them 5 stars.   If you want quality, nice portions, tasty and a respectable price point, give this place a try."}
{"text":"Love this place, come here at least once a week for the Noodle House Tom Yum, and get it super spicy. Then chase the heat away with a thai tea."}
{"text":"LOVE this place. But then again I LOVE thai food, sooo flavorful!!! Tried a few other thai restaurants in town nd this one is mos def the place to come back again and again!! Tom Ka soup is one that everyone has to try! The ground pork fried rice hmnnm yumm. Just commenting on the restaurant makes me want it for dinner. The waittress was so attentive. Small but friendly and delicious place!! MUST TRY!!"}
{"text":"My go to place for authentic and delicious Thai food! This place is so good! I used to go to Archi's for thai food but after discovering Thai Style Noodle House, I have not stepped foot in the former. It's also a plus that this place is right next to my house. There is another Thai Style Noodle House location in chinatown but this one is about a 5-7 minute drive from my house. The portions are pretty generous for Thai food. If you eat a lot of Thai food, you'll know that the servings area always tiny. This place is the total opposite. The plates are always full and very affordable. ~$50 could feed my whole family (4) with left overs. Another reason I love this place is because it's very family oriented. Everyone here is really nice and they're always coming around to make sure everything is alright even though it's always packed when I go. It's nice to see how attentive they are, especially since their staff is very small.

My favorite dish here is the Pad See Eu with beef. MMM. I am salivating just thinking about it! A second favorite is the spicy eggplant with tofu. I usually get the spice level at a medium so it's not too overpowering. The duck fried rice is a good option too! Oh and don't forget the squid salad, potstickers, and last but not least... the mango sticky rice! It is absolutely AMAZING!! I could go on and on about the different food items that I love here. The only thing i wasn't a fan of here was their thai iced coffee and thai iced tea. They were good but a little too sweet for my taste. Not a big deal though. I can't wait to come back here for a feast!

Oh yeah, they also do delivery but I believe it's only within a 3 mile radius."}
{"text":"Definitely my go to Thai place in vegas. This place is definitely budget friendly and the food is on point. Their staples of pad see ew, Tom yum, Tom Kah, mint leaf beef, and currys are all good. From their chef specials the ginger snapper with crispy fish is a good choice when you don't want meat, and their mootod is this crispy pork that has this citrus salty jalapeño  dipping sauce is yummy. I have pretty much tried everything on the menu and it never disappoints.. when they do have mango sticky rice in season that's always a great way to end your meal here. Oh and if you live close by they deliver!"}
{"text":"Service was great, and our waitress was very friendly. But, the food was alright. We ordered the pineapple fried rice, chicken satay, duck curry, and yellow curry. The chicken satay portions were small and it wasn't that flavorful. The pineapple fried rice was very oily and greasy and didn't really have a pineapple flavor to it, but the chicken and cashews they added to it helped. The chicken curry was my favorite, it had a lot of flavor and the portions for the curry were quite big. A bowl of rice came with the chicken curry. We ordered mild spice for the curries, but it was a little spicy. Place was small but, a lot of families were coming in and out to eat dinner, so it's a good place to eat with family or a large group."}
{"text":"Went here because of the reviews.  Normally go to David Wongs whenever I crave fried rice.  But since he went on vacation, I needed to find an alternative.

Went here with friends, knowing up front that service was subpar, but also expected the food to make up for it.  The consensus between friends is that this place deserves 1 star because the food doesn't come anywhere close to our favorite spot.  And the service was lack luster.  

I encourage anyone who thinks this place is the bomb, give David Wong's 1 chance.  You will thank me later."}
{"text":"This place is really going bad. Its cheap but the food not that good especially the pad thai.. it tastes sour. We used to come here often but everytime we go, the food keep getting worst. I keep saying give it a try again and looks like its just doesnt taste as good as the first time we came here. Well I guess you get what you pay for. Even if its cheap its not worth the money. Still surprise alot of people still give it 5 satrs."}
{"text":"I was in the mood for something fast and more on the healthy side, so I ordered take out from here last night by phone. The lady who took my order was neutral but courteous, and she repeated my order correctly without me asking. I ordered the Khua-Kai rice noodles, Beef Basil fried rice, the Choo-chee Chicken Curry, an order of potstickers, and two Thai teas. Everything turned out to be good and tasty, especially the Curry! I didn't even notice that the Basil Beef I ordered came with the rice on the side instead of everything fried together...actually I just thought of it now, so it was obviously that good! The potstickers came with a few sauces drizzled on top, which was nice because it was already prepared. Also, I usually order the Thai tea without ice, so it doesn't get diluted and when I get home I dilute the tea with some of my own tea because it is really, very sweet and I get a few more glasses out of it. 

I would prefer to dine-in because I think they are more generous with the portions as opposed to how much they serve with take out. However, it was still filling, delicious, and not so heavy! Everything was also affordable at just under $37. And at the end of this dinner, you don't feel like you undid your entire week of working out on just one meal :)"}
{"text":"I go here for work lunches all the time. They are quick and the food  is delicious. There are a few options for Thai food in close proximity and this is my favorite."}
{"text":"So I was very disappointed with TSNH especially when it had a 4 star rating.  But then again I noticed other having missed opinions about this place also.  I didn't have high expectations going in, since this was Plan B for dinner, so that's probably the only reason why I didn't give them a 1.

First off there was something wrong with the service, I don't know, it was the most MEH experience I've ever had.  The lady who served us only smiled once and this was when it was time to pay, as if she was only happy to see money. We all ordered water maybe that added to why we got that service.

The food we also received were complete opposites from what I've seen on the pics and what was described in the reviews.  One of the dish we ordered was the yellow curry.  The flavor in the curry was decent but there were very little ingredients.  It was mostly sauce and it was very watery.  Another dish we ordered was the chow mein, the noodles were dry and it was all very salty. And another was the fried chicken, HORRIBLE don't ever order this, it was rubbery and tiny like microwaved chicken.

I don't know maybe I went on bad night or they just sensed that this was my Plan B for dinner.  I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Only giving it 2 stars because of the service. Food is always good here, but this was the first time we dined inside. We arrived around 9:20p and the place closes at 10p. There was 2 other tables in the restaurant when we arrived. When we sat down they gave us 2 minutes to look at the menu and asked if we were ready and we asked for another minute. An older lady approached us twice after that asking if were ready and the second time around she said kitchen is closing so we have to order. We ordered 2 apps and 2 entrees. Entrees came out first and then the apps. You could tell they were rushing. After we got all the food they immediately dropped the check. She made a comment \"take your time\" so we tried to finish eating and they kept stopping by to see if the check was ready. When my boyfriend gave her his card she dropped the check back off and said \"sign it so I can close it out.\" Overall the food was good but the service was rude. 7/1 dine in date & there was 1 older & 1 younger woman working. Should close at 9:30 if you're going to rush the kitchen but you say you close at 10."}
{"text":"So this place is really close to the house. It's a really  small place that's family oriented. The people were friendly and attentive. First time being here and will definitely will be returning. They have great take out available and you also get it delivered."}
{"text":"I love Thai food. I admit I was not a foodie until I met my girlfriend and one of my favorite cuisines now is Thai. I am convinced that there is no better restaurant than Kung Fu Thai, but I am always happy to keep searching. This place was good and more than that, it was surprisingly cheap. My FAVORITE was the papaya salad...oh, my, god. I was craving it the next morning and I will definitely be returning to this place. The reason for four stars instead of five was because when we walked in we noticed a sign that said debit card machine was not working. All we had was a debit card so we asked before we sat down. No one had any idea if the machine was back up LOL. All they said was 'i dont know' then walk away. Maybe I was just hangry but that really annoyed me. The food made up for it though. Try this place."}
{"text":"We ate lunch today and once again no lunch menu offered to us. Not sure why a place would have a lunch menu and not give it to guest. They know us but still don't give it to us. I posted it in the picks. Anyway make sure to ask for the lunch menu because the price is much better."}
{"text":"I love this place for take out. My go to order is the Crab fried rice and pad see ew! The portions are generous and the prices are awesome. 

Whenever I crave Thai I'd stop by to pick up something quick for the fam. They also have cash back on yelp, which gives you a few bucks off every time you dine with them- which is pretty sweet."}
{"text":"We've eaten here multiple times! The chicken pad Thai is to die for!!! The mild is a little spicy but it is so good! We also get the Gyoza and it is perfection! They are not the regular \"dip in sauce\" gyozas. They have sauce drizzled over the top of them and it just makes the whole meal! 

We had it delivered for the first time tonight and my mans exact words were \"he loves his job!\" The delivery driver was happy and got the food to us in great condition! Warm and all in place! We love the Thai House!!!"}
{"text":"Came in for lunch yesterday. A lady quickly pointed out a table for us to be seated.

Ordered the Seafood Tom Yum Rice Noodle Soup in mild. I didn't wait long before it was brought out to me. Love the soup (sour and spicy) and there was tons of it (couldn't even finish drinking it all). Seafood included slices of fish cakes, shrimp, mussel, and fish balls. It would have been perfect if they threw some mushrooms in there. 

Service was alright. Took a long while before they even brought out my husband's lunch. And when they did, they didn't bring him anything to eat it with. Had to ask for the condiments as well since there was none on our table.  

This seem to be the only Thai restaurant in the surrounding area. Not the best Thai food I ever had but will do when it comes to satisfying that sudden Thai craving."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Thai restaurant at this time! Great prices, food has amazing flavor and the portions are on point. Definitely a go to when you're in the mood for Thai food!"}
{"text":"One of the best bangs for the buck in the Las Wegas!  No that's not a typo even though there currently is a red squiggly telling me to fix that.

Thai beef salad, if you were a woman, I would compare you to Paris Hilton... you are cheap and delicious!!  

Side of fried rice, damn you I can't stop eating you!!!!!

I have nothing else for you, this restaurant is the bomb, it has multiple locations, that's how good it is, people just can't have it one spot."}
{"text":"I come in at least once a week. My favorite is their combination beef noodle soup. I've tried other dishes as well like the spicy basil beef,  spicy eggplant, and spicy string bean to name a few. They were great. I would recommend this place for their good food and value."}
{"text":"Thai house 2 has been my go to place for fast inexpensive Thai food. It's less crowded than the one on Spring Mt., both are great and customer service is the only thing that's inconsistent. But overall food is always good. We've tried everything on their menu and all was good."}
{"text":"Cheap, fast and tasty - and you don't have to settle for two out of three.

We had duck noodle soup (I didn't get a taste, my daughter became quite defensive after her first bite), orange chicken and red curry with pumpkin and chicken.  Orange chicken was the bomb!  Tangy, crispy, and light - the breading enhanced the flavor rather than acting as filler.  Red curry was marvelous, with carrots, green pepper and basil.  I've had a lot of Thai curries and this was one of the better ones - light on the coconut milk, nice variety of textures and flavor.  I ordered it medium hot which was right for me and I eat spicy food.  I suspect the hot would be very hot.

Only criticisms are that the orange chicken was simply chicken and rice, it would have been nice to see a bit of garnish with carrot.  And they didn't offer condiments, which I suspect we could have gotten if we'd asked, but the food didn't need it."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Thai in town!!! A must try! I've tried to order something different everytime I'm feeling Thai food and haven't found anything I didn't like!"}
{"text":"I would give this place 0 stars if I could. I should have turned right around as soon as I saw how dirty and disgusting the fish tank was. Because I was with someone else I decided to give it a shot.  Mistake! I ordered the beef Pad Thai to be safe. As soon as I saw it I knew it was going to be bad news. It was very greasy with a very strong vinegar taste as well. I took one bite of the beef and wanted to vomit. I couldn't bear swallowing it. It tasted rotten. Instead of sending it back we paid for it and threw it away as soon as we walked outside. Don't waste your money. Definitely the worst Pad Thai ever!!!!"}
{"text":"I would give it 4 and 1/2 stars as this place is our friends' favorite place for noodles.  It is small but clean.  We ordered chicken satay for appetizer, tasty and sliced beef flat noodles with bok choy, barbecue pork wonton rice noodle soup, seafood crispy noodle with wonton with gravy, and gold/silver noodle with chicken and shrimp.  All had big portions except for the gold/silver noodle which was smaller than before.  Prices are reasonable for what you get!"}
{"text":"We love eating here as it is one of the best Thai restaurants in Vegas!  The food is very tasty and the prices are reasonable.  The place is small but has a relaxing atmosphere.  The service is very good.  Our food was brought out fairly quickly and it was nice and hot!  Give it a try because you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I finally had a visit to the infamous second TSNH.  Some folks say it doesn't live up to the original.  I am here to say that it does!  This is by far the best Thai restaurant on this side of town.  

We ordered the Khua-Kai, the combination Beef Noodle Soup (with glass noodle), and a dish not even offered on the menu.  Every single dish tasted just as good as the other Thai Style Noodle House, which is saying a lot.  Thai food is difficult to cook, and a lot of places have a disparity between the original chef and new chefs.  TSNH2 does not suffer from this hurdle as much as other Las Vegas Thai restaurants have shown in the past.

The Khua-Kai was spot on with the noodles and the sprouts and the homemade sweet and sour sauce.  We quite enjoyed it.  It was a nice balance to the spicier dishes that we ordered.

The combination Beef Noodle Soup is a must try at TSNH, as far as I am concerned.  The broth was just as rich and flavorful as the original location.  Most Thai places use a rather thin broth for this dish, but TSNH uses a thick and creamy beef based broth that cooks all day long.  Its just amazing.  I had this same soup at the original TSNH yesterday, and today at the new location it tasted exactly the same.  Loved it.

Overall, if you live in this part of town, this is the Thai restaurant to go to.  It is the most authentic out of the other spots located in this area, and it just tastes better.  Compared to the original, the interior is much nicer (newer building complex), but you will still see some familiar faces.  Awesome Thai food here!"}
{"text":"I've been ordering from Thai Style Noodle House for a few years. Great prices and delicious.  I've tried several different Thai spots and always end up back here. For those customers that are reviewing and complaining yet frequent the business- maybe you shouldn't be so harsh and judgmental. You keep coming back for a reason so let's give them some credit."}
{"text":"We went to noodle house 2 on ft. apache and trop and it was the best thai we have had in vegas. We normally go to arayna or sweet basil as we look for dining options on the west side / summerlin area. Service was great. Host was great. Atmosphere was nicely decorated with good luck elephants. I asked to have us brought best dishes. We received the house special flat noodle with secret tangy sauce. I reccomend. And then the avocado pantang. Beat curry in vegas. Avocado was perfectly ripe and the shrimp went terrific with it. Make sure to order a thai coffee. Delicious with meal or just to lounge about."}
{"text":"Ok local thia for good prices. Nothing crazy but gets the job done. Come during lunch"}
{"text":"I go to this restaurant about 2 times a month. I love everything here! I have tried almost 20 different items on their menu and every single one has been fantastic. 

Hands down, the best thing here is the potstickers! I wish they had an all you can eat potsticker special because quite frankly 6 isn't enough. :)

This place has very good food at a cheap price. I have never eaten at the restaurant as I always call in and order. 

I suggest this place to anyone in the mood for Thai food!"}
{"text":"Okay I travel a lot and this place is one of the best I have been to. The price is outstanding and this place is worth the drive away from the strip. Go for it!"}
{"text":"First things first. If you are looking for lunch specials or any type of specials...you're not gonna find any here. Same menu as lunch versus dinner.
 
Prices weren't too bad. $6.95 for a chicken pad thai plate. Couple bucks more if you want shrimp instead of chicken.

My boyfriend and I both got pad thai. Sorry...I'm original like that. I just can't go to a thai restaurant and NOT get pad thai. I would LOVE to try something different...but I could just never seem to do it.

I like spicy foods. Side note: not sure if everyone is aware of this, but on a scale of 1-10, 1 being the LEAST spicy and 10 being the MOST. Not sure if its different in other thai restaurants but I personally never knew that. Here I've been getting spicy level 4 thinking #1 was considered the MOST spicy. -__- oh geez. Sooooo....I ended up getting a level 8 spiciness. 

Getting back to the food, I really loved this place. My pad thai came out pippin' hot and the spiciness was on point. Definitely the kind of spice I was expecting. It has a kick to it without having to sip on water every 30 seconds. 

This is definitely a place I'll come back to if I'm ever in this part of town."}
{"text":"Love this place!  I go here so often, as soon as they see me or anyone in my family come in, they already know our order.  Staff is great and the food is delicious.  Hubby and our daughter usually get the Orange Chicken and I usually get the Noodle House Soup or the Laarb."}
{"text":"Good spot but their stuff is SPICY! I got the Tom Yum noodle soup, medium spicy and I was pretty much blowing my nose the entire time. I enjoy spicy but I don't want to drown in my own snot. 

Definitely getting mild next time."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and served in a timely fashion. The house tea was tasty but not my cup of tea. Come on it was a good pun! The curry chicken dish hit the spot."}
{"text":"Delicious food, affordable,big serving and nice staff.. Definitely going back here... We ordered the chicken curry and fried chicken on fried rice we love it along with the thai tea :)"}
{"text":"Panang curry all the way\!  Yellow & Red Curry were good too!  Or even just the hot & sour soup.  Star system is based on 1-10, not traditional 1-5, FYI.  But if not hot enough dining in, the will bring the condiments to bring up the heat, so don't you worry.

3rd time going to give a final 'overview' of this place.
Full of spice, they offer lunch specials, AND THEY DELIVER!! (limited)$15minimum for CC purchases, which is fine as food is worth getting again.

I also recommend take-away, as when I was there, multiple orders were lined up for patrons to come in and pick up."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant, it's always great.  You can always dine in or take out. I believe they offer delivery but I have to double check. Duck soup it's one of my favorite, also they have a variety of noddles. Everything I have tried so far has been great."}
{"text":"This location has better decor and furniture.  However, the food is okay.  Not that delicious.  The portions was a lot smaller than the original location on Wynn st. The service was not great either.  My bf and I ordered Tom Yum Noodle soup, and pad thai noodle.  The tom yum noodle was a lot smaller, and the pad thai was good but it did not have lime (like wtf right?). The thing that killed my experience was the poor service.  The whole time it was very difficult to get a hold of the waiter even though there were a total of three parties at the restaurant.  I would not recommend any one driving that far to this location for thai food."}
{"text":"Good and fast food and for a reasonable price. Ordered out three times now and so far I've had great experiences with this place. It's a little small and crowded if you do decide to dine. 

My favorite dish is the beef lad na, definitely gotta try the curry next time."}
{"text":"So, the good, the bad, the ugly....  Mostly the Good!  in 200 words or less!

The good:
Great prices (GREAT prices)
Good portions (not great)
Very good food with wonderfully aromatic and flavorful sauces

The bad:
As some other reviewers noted, the chairs need to be cleaned or re-upholstered
The place plays like a take out place that coincidentally has tables - as a result the service isn't amazing, its not BAD, but its just not great.  That said, for this price, you can't get amazing service, or the place goes belly up because the economics stop working with that additional server.
Staff is friendly and helpful.

The ugly:
We ordered vermicelli chicken noodle soup.  The soup was GREAT.  We ordered vermicelli because one of the people in the party had an egg allergy.  We asked when it arrived, and they confirmed it was an egg noodle dish.  They offered to replace it (thank you), but the definition of vermicelli (confirmed with wikipedia) is a rice noodle
The Red Snapper tasted more like Tilapia

Look, the food is quite flavorful, and well prepared.  The prices are GREAT.  There are flaws, but we will surely be back."}
{"text":"Love this Thai place. A hidden treasure, very reasonable price and good serving size."}
{"text":"Great Thai place that my co-workers found.  Love the place, although it's not really as hot as you think a 10 star would be.  I'd say that it's been toned a little for the customer base.

Food is fantastic.   Thai iced tea is awesome too if you need a little something to take the edge off.

Price is very reasonable for Thai food and I'd definitely recommend the pumpkin yellow curry!"}
{"text":"My Wife and I found this place after moving to Las Vegas a year ago from Orange County, California. We were soooo excited and happy that we found a Great Thai Food place with Great tasting and with consistency since we are absolute die hard fan of Thai and Chinese food. But on the third visit we placed order by phone for pick up. Upon arriving home and looking at dish we ordered (Mongolian Beef was one), food did not look anything close or taste anything close to Mongolian Beef which we had for soo many times. White color cooked meat in a runny watery beige liquid. Being one of die-hard fan of this dish and having it for past 25+ years I never seen a Mongolian Beef looking like this. Total disappointment. 
Today 8/28 my wife and I figured to give them one more chance. What a Mistake that was. the best part of the lunch was cold can of coke. Pineapple Curry which I ordered was sooo watery. My wife's food had totally different color (Same Dishes we both orders the first 2 visit) and tasted completely different. When asked why the food look  and taste so much different they could not give us an straight answer. Appears they use the earlier customers left over and mix few stuff to serve the new customers order. That seems the only explanation that we can come up with if the owner claims everything in the restaurant is the same as before. 
Bottom line going to this place is like rolling the dice. if you are lucky you end up with good food otherwise you are in for an experience which turns you off from any Thai food."}
{"text":"I'm not going to lie, Lotus of Siam has pretty much ruined me for Thai food. I have a hard time eating it elsewhere. 

I have to say that this place is pretty solid. We got take out. Spicy Thai noodles (5 stars), beef jerky (2.5 stars), panang curry (4.5 stars), and papaya salad (4 stars). 

I'm glad I found this place as it is sort of on the way home from my daughter's school. 

A lot of people mentioned \"huge\" or \"generous\" portions in their reviews. I definitely didn't have that experience....portions were pretty normal and totally fine. I was just expecting a tad more, based in reviews. Maybe they were referring to dining inside. It was enough food, I only mention it in case anyone is expecting a lot for takeout. 

Overall, very tasty and would like to come try more next time!"}
{"text":"Probably one of my favorite new finds in this city.

I was craving noodles one night so I yelped for good noodles in this city for vegetarians. This place popped up. Originally I tried the Chinatown location and loved it so last night I went to this location. It was just as good as the one in Chinatown. I liked the service better at this one.

I ordered the Pad Thai and when she asked what meat I would like I told her I don't eat meat so she asked if I wanted tofu. It was not offered on the menu so I was pleasantly surprised. It's always nice to be offered different options in proteins instead of just settling for no protein at all. 

My boyfriend ordered the sliced beef noodle soup with vermicelli. He loved it. He said it was probably one of best soups he's had. The soup had a dark rich colored broth that looked and smelled really good. 

We'll be coming here more often!"}
{"text":"Excellent fast Thai food! Great fresh flavors, very friendly staff & perfectly priced! Can't ask for more ham that~Yummy"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time last night with my boyfriend and his brother. I love Thai food, so I was excited to try a new place out. 

The food was delicious. I had the Pineapple Curry Shrimp, but substituted the shrimp with chicken instead, which they had no issue with. My boyfriend had the Panang Curry. We also had the Chicken Satay and the Pad Thai with Beef to share. All of which was very tasteful. My only issue was they don't give nearly as much rice as I hoped they would. But, maybe that's just the Asian in me, ha. 

The service, however, was subpar. It wasn't very busy when we got there - maybe three other tables. Our first waitress was nice, but quiet. Which isn't really an issue. She took our order for food and drinks and that was that. The second waitress who brought our food out, wasn't very welcoming - sort of had a \"I don't really care\" attitude. She gave my plate to my bf's brother, even after I said it was mine and vice versa. We also didn't get our drinks, until we asked again, and when the waitress brought them out, she swapped them around again. No big deal, but there were only three of us at the table. 

Anyway, I'd come back for the food for sure, but definitely not for the service."}
{"text":"The Thai House is ok. Came in and try this restaurant few times. The food was ok, but needs more flavoring and seasoning. The service here was ok."}
{"text":"Best Thai food for the best prices! Our server Victor was extremely friendly and had a great attitude. Our food came out right away and we will definitely be back !!"}
{"text":"What I love about this place is the insane value you get.  Think Archi's in terms of prices as almost everything is in the $6-8 range. 

We got the Tom Yum Noodle Soup and Roast Duck.  They let you choose between egg noodles, thin noodles, and flat rice noodles.   The bowls are super big and you can add extra noodles for a buck.

So next time, we will share a bowl of soup and order an entree. 

I have yet to try the Chef Specialties (e.g. Panang Salmon) but based on all the reviews, I'm sure they won't dissapoint."}
{"text":"The Tom yum soup with chicken is awesome. We also had spicy eggplant with beef which was also very good. Service is good and it was nice that the man took the time to explain why they didn't carry a sauce anymore."}
{"text":"Never try Panang Avocado salmon at this restaurant, the salmon was unfreezed completely and so hard. Panang curry taste good but Salmon taste ugly, but fried calamari and combination beef noodle is good"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. I ordered the duck fried rice and my husband ordered the papaya salad and could not be more pleased with the meal and the overall experience. 5 stars"}
{"text":"I finally came here since I work in the same plaza and I've been craving noodles, specifically pad see ew (sorry i never knew how to actually spell this). It was cooked perfectly for me!! and I tried shrimp rolls for the first time ever from this place, and i fell in love.     jon. nbjb kk j.   j.  j."}
{"text":"Reasonably priced great food. Tasty papaya salad, tom ka gai, and green curry. Service was great. Would come back again when passing through Vegas."}
{"text":"My go-to spot for Thai soups. I have enjoyed everything I have ordered."}
{"text":"We went to the restaurant around 10pm and they will close in 30mins. The lady host with short hair look like she get mad with us:( No one come to ask about what we wanna drink!! They were sitting/texting near our table... I always come to Noodle House #1 but thought ta try this location (Noodle House #2)... waste of time n gas.  We drove across to try their food but they acted like they don't want customer."}
{"text":"Something about Thai food will always bring me to check out other Thai restaurants.. it's like a game of who makes the best yellow curry and pad thai..

This place falls in the normal category, which means it's good and I will be visiting again for sure but I'm looking for a restaurant who cam beat one I found in Hawaii that I have crowned the pad Thai champion. 

The service here was pretty on point too.. always coming to fill waters and whatever else drinks I ordered. So don't shy away from this establishment of you're looking to get a fix.. this place is more than enough for that.
 Not to mention the prices were great!"}
{"text":"One of the better Thai places I've tried in town. The restaurant is nice, clean and spacious, and the service is friendly. The menu prices are definitely a steal compared to other Thai places I've been to, and the menu choices are diverse ranging from classic curries to a variety of noodles (each with a description). 

Wanting something healthy, I ordered the Papaya Salad- crunchy julienned green papaya, peanuts and tomatoes tossed together in a sour, sweet, and slightly spicy (level 3) vinaigrette. The vinaigrette also had fish sauce in it, so if you're not a fan of fish sauce, I'd recommend something else. On the side of the heap of papaya salad were a few pieces of cabbage. The salad was refreshing and light. My only complaints are: 1) The tomato pieces on top were mushy; and 2) I wish they added more peanuts. The peanuts added depth to the salad, and cut the vinegary-ness of the dressing. Overall, however, I enjoyed the salad very much. I also tried a bit of the Green Curry w/ brown rice which was really yummy. Spicy, but not too spicy. Sweet, but not too sweet. Just really tasty.

I also am a fan of the water! They put slices of fruit (lemons, strawberries & green apples) in the water pitcher, which I thought was pretty and gave the water a nice taste. The server made sure my water glass was never empty. 

I definitely want to come back to try their noodle dishes (Apparently, the duck noodle soup is amazing). Good eats."}
{"text":"Love this place! Discovered this place back in 2013 and have been coming back ever since, their noodle house pot stickers are one my faves and a must try, their noodle soups are also big size and fill you up very quickly, Highly reccomend this place! 10/10"}
{"text":"Not impressed! First time here, I ordered the basil ground chicken , seasoning was ok, chicken was HORRIBLE!! all fat!! Portions size small, Service was terrible. My water cup was dirty, chairs dirty/stained, entire place needs to be cleaned! Will not return, the one star is for the seasoning."}
{"text":"I  got pad Thai which was really good. I didn't think it was spicy. The spice level is from 1 to 10 I got a level 9. I also got one of the  curries which wasn't good.  I  think I wasted my money on that plus I think it was old.  The Thai tea was good a little bit too sweet.  The service was another story.  As the guy was taking our second order he a mint in his mouth as he was talking it fell out of his mouth and he looks real quick and puts it back.  Who does that? He didn't even say sorry. And yes it did touch the table.  I don't think I will be going back to this location."}
{"text":"Food was alright.  I didn't like the mayo sauce they put on the pot stickers. Service was ok. Everyone was very friendly."}
{"text":"Been going here for a few years now. Would be 5 starts but lately my orders to go have been a hit or miss taste wise. Just doesn't seem very fresh."}
{"text":"I'm usually never on this side of town so thanks to my fellow Yelpers for convincing me to try this place out. There were many other great choices I had near the area but so glad I chose this one.

Small, cozy little restaurant with a pretty big menu and really great prices. I had the hardest time deciding but I went with the panang chicken and some fried flat noodles.

The noodles came out first and I had planned to eat only half of it while the panang was coming out. Well, I've never been good on that portion control thingy and I ended up scarfing the whole plate of noodles down. It came with Thai sweet chili sauce and I added sriracha on top of all that. Very delicious, better than my usual pad see ew. 

The panang was simple, not filled with bamboo shoots and other veggies. Just a nice thick curry sauce and some red pepper flakes and of course the chicken. Although I don't mind bamboo and veggies I prefer my panang simply made like this. It was a little bit salty which may be bad for most but I loved it cuz I am a sodium freak.

I would love to come back and try all the other dishes. The Thai beef noodle soup and grilled meat dishes looked really good. The service was very friendly and attentive.

The great thing is that this isn't their only location. Phewww, cuz out of all 3 this was the furthest from my house. But if  this were the only location, I would definetly come back here. Next time, I'll be going to either the Chinatown location or the one in Summerlin."}
{"text":"I was craving Thai Food one day for lunch and I came across this place. I ordered the Thai beef salad and yellow curry they were both amazing. I will definitely order from here again!! It was delicious!"}
{"text":"The food is great !! Service sucks, they sit you down, get your drinks and then forget about you. Tip order take out...food is ready when they say it is."}
{"text":"The roomie and I have ordered from here a few times. Delivery was quick, prices good and the food is tasty."}
{"text":"Not great.  Small portions of orange chicken (mostly batter) and panang curry(though the curry WAS BY FAR the best dish we got). Also tried the pad see eiw which we should have left...."}
{"text":"We had a very nice dinner last night with my family. What I like about their food is it's not oily/greasy compared to other Thai resto. I gave it 4stars because 1st-high chair's strap is broken. I asked for another one but the server said all are broken. 2nd-plates & utensils need some upgrade. But other than those, their food is worth coming back for."}
{"text":"My favorite location for the Thai style noodle house establishment. The food is always good for the price. The servers are usually polite and seem happy when my wife and I walk in. At first, I didn't like their rad na, but now I really like it! I also order the 3 companion and my wife always orders the khua khai."}
{"text":"Live right down the street from this restaurant, me and my fiancé frequent this place a lot because it's pretty good food, service is generally always great, and it's close to the house. Had a late day today and finally getting some dinner. This is the situation, How are you going to be closed when your sign is posted to be close at 10 PM and it's 9:43 PM? Called at 9:35 to place an order for pick up and no one answered the phone. Ran to the restaurant because it's around the corner from my house, came in doors were open open sign is on and they are mopping, lady at the register says sorry we are closed. Sorry Thai Noodle House 2, u suck ass. Sitting in front of the restaurant right now writing this review and its 9:46... Refuses to serve anything, whack af Thai Noodle House 2!!!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here last night as recommendation of a friend. The menu was extensive,  the restaurant was clean, food was very good but the service was GREAT!  Victor greeted us and lead us to our table. We ordered spicy eggplant (good) pad Thai noodles (better) and yellow curry (best). But it was Victor who made our evening. He took time to explain several items on the menu and told us about their other restaurants (they have 4). You cannot beat the value either. Nothing on the menu is over $9. We will most certainly return."}
{"text":"This was my first time coming to this restaurant. It's located in the same plaza as Sweet Addictions, right across from iHOP. Came here because a friend wanted to try it out, overall experience wasn't that bad at all. 

We decided to do it family style and get three dishes that we would all share. First up was the Papaya Salad, I've never had it before this, but it was good. Nothing too notable, papaya, carrots, peppers, tomato, and cabbage with a sauce that I can't really describe the taste (gotta try it again). I think we ordered a 6 as far as the spicy level goes, it wasn't overly spicy but you can definitely tell it was spicy. I think I was expecting something different as far as how spicy this was going to be, so it caught me a little off guard. 

We got a Green Curry Fried Rice with chicken, also level 6 spicy. This was pretty good, none of us have had it before so we weren't sure what to expect, but it's literally the green curry flavoring cooked into their fried rice. It wasn't overly powering, but you can definitely taste the green curry along with our choice level of spiciness. It contained the chicken, green bean, bean sprout, and carrots, don't recall if there was anything else in it. It wasn't dry at all, which was good, they didn't over cook it! 

And lastly we got the Choo Chee Salmon, which none of us have had but heard good things about. So this was the best thing out of all the dishes we ordered. I really enjoyed the sauce, which was semi sweet. I'll need to try it a few more times before I can figure out what was in it, but it was good and I will definitely be ordering this again when I go back! The salmon was moist and cooked very well. My friends and I all enjoyed it and actually wanted more, though we were pretty stuffed by the end.

The cost overall between three people was $10 each including tip, so it wasn't bad at all. We were all satisfied at the end."}
{"text":"We eat here randomly but enough times to have a good enough opinion to say they have some great dishes. I have tried a few and so far so good. The rice plates are more like a dinner combo for one person maybe 2. The prices are awesome! Fried rice was good, beef pad sew (spelled wrong) is really good, garlic chicken was good ( rice plate ) fast service, friendly staff"}
{"text":"Great staff, great prices with huge portions! My boyfriend got the pork larb and it was full of flavor. I can taste the spices and the lettuce was crunchy and fresh. I got the duck noodle soup. I can't really find this anywhere unless I go to LA, so I had to get it here. It was so delicious and full of duck flavor. Duck broth is naturally on the salty side, so don't be surprised if you think it is salty. It taste great! :) we ordered the Thai tea to wash down the spiciness. The Thai tea is just as good as archies, maybe better. For dessert we got fried Ice cream. Its a giant ball of goodness. The guy that works there, Victor, is really sweet and told us to come back for lunch because the deals are better! I am definitely coming back for lunch to see what else they have to offer."}
{"text":"Actually Thai Style Noodle House #2, this is a sister/twin of Thai Style Noodle House on Wynn Road. I have written a review for Thai Style #1previously. 

The decor for #2 is much nicer than #1. It still has the feel of a local eatery and it's in a newly build strip mall. There is an ornate brass ceiling with chandeliers but the walls are plain orange with a few Pier 1 type art pieces hanging. Nothing too fancy or garish. Nice. The place had a steady stream of customers...not too crowded and not too awkwardly lonely either. A perfect lunch spot. 

The service here was also just as good as #1. One of the waitresses at #2 was the same waitress I had at #1. 

I was slightly miffed that they did not have vegetarian/vegan lunch specials (as I was told that by the waitress) and had to order off the menu. I ordered the Papaya Salad and the Spicy Flat Noodles (Pad Kee Mao on Thai menus usually). I liked that they had the option to get steamed tofu instead of friend. I opted for the steamed and have to say although let's face it, the fried is much better, this was rather good. I got my food within 10 minutes. The papaya salad was consistent with my experience at #1 and the Flat Noodles were also tasty. I didn't like the addition of white pepper on top of the noodles as a finishing touch. I might tell them to omit that the next time I go there. The flat noodles was sauteed with basil, garlic, steamed tofu, carrots, onions and cabbage. Not out of this world but tasty and satisfied me for lunch.

Papaya Salad + Spicy Flat Noodles + Diet Coke = $15. The meal will last me at least one more day. Not too shabby but would have appreciated a veggie lunch special. 

I'm glad these guys opened up something on this side of town. It's close to work and I can frequent when I have a Thai craving. 

PS. I tried to take pictures and make this the first review that I started picture adding but I don't know how to turn off the flash on my camera...currently all my pics are bright lights. Once I get more camera savvy I will be going crazy posting pictures."}
{"text":"Amazing food. I got the Beef Noodle Soup and it was delicious. I would definitely come back to this place and my gf is thai and she also liked it."}
{"text":"I'm from LA and in LA we go to Thai restaurants depending on the type of dishes we're in the mood for. Thai Noodle House has GREAT soup noodle dishes and that's my go to place when I'm craving Tom Yum Noodle Soup and Spicy Beef Soup Noodles. Their Rhad-Na noodles are the best there.. reminds me of my mom's cooking back home. Their Pad Thai is so-so and they add carrots to a lot of their dishes which I think is a little weird. Overall, the prices are great, the portions are huge, and most dishes taste great!"}
{"text":"This place is greeeeaat. They're place is pretty clean and the service for both at the store and delivering is awesome.

The only problem I had was I didn't know the green curry was THAT spicy, and I ordered a number 1. Which burnt my mouth extra bad.

N.H STYLE POT STICKERS WERE BOMB."}
{"text":"I had this place bookmarked for a while and decided to stop by for lunch today. I arrived at 1:55 to find out they do lunch til 4....pretty cool! They have a lunch menu and a vegetarian/vegan menu. I choose the vegetarian menu. So much to choose from. Soups and salads, rice and noodle dishes. I got the spicy basil noodle. I asked for extra broccoli and extra thai basil. I also got a thai iced tea. I'm not usually a fan but the past 2 times I went out I ordered the thai tea and enjoyed it. The dish was good. I happen to like Pan Asian's a little better. PA's has some sort of Thai spice on the dish that is wonderul. I dont know what it is though. I'm going to come back and try a few other things. Id like to try the pineapple rice and the yellow curry. The service was good, although it did seem to take quite a bit for my meal to come out. It was hot and delicious though, and that's important. The price was A-OK for me too!"}
{"text":"Honestly, I don't know jack about Thai food. I eat it occasionally, but not frequently enough to pick up the nuances of specific dishes. So, take this review with a grain of salt. The wife and I got takeout the other night. It's a cute little place... clean, modern, but small. The red curry with chicken that my wife ordered was hot. Very hot... at least for her. She got a level 5 and couldn't finish it because it was so hot. She also ordered extra veggies which cost a dollar. I don't like spicy food so I went with a 2 for my yellow curry chicken dish. Perfect (lack of) heat for me. It was tasty but could have used more chicken. I'd go back to try other dishes."}
{"text":"Decided to pick up some food from Thai Style since I was close by, and I have already tried the neighboring Thai spots (Panna Thai, Surang...).

-Tom Kha:  I ordered the 6 out of 10, but tasted more like an 8.  It was decent, but I liked this soup at Surang more.
-Duck Curry: Again, I ordered 6 out of 10, but tasted like an 8...boy were we huffing and puffing.  It was hot.  There weren't many slices of duck in this curry.  It did came with a side of white rice.
-Mango sticky rice:  I ordered two of these.  The sticky rice was yummy and it was covered with coconut milk.  It came with half of a \"not in season\" mango.   But for the price of $3.95 each, it was still a steal.
-Thai tea:  quite strong.  I enjoyed the tea very much.

It was easy and quick for this to-go order, but there are many other Thai places out there..."}
{"text":"Delicious, cheerful and cheap!  The duck noodle soup with vermicelli noodles was absolutely fabulous and great value at $6.75.  Green beans with tofu was also very good too.  The green beans were crisp, which means they were fresh not frozen and the red spicy sauce was yummy.  The veggie spring rolls were fresh and crisp.  The waitress was very friendly and helpful and even suggested a variety of condiments for my dishes!  My only wish is for this establishment to open in YVR, because I would be a regular for sure!"}
{"text":"I had a great lunch from this restaurant. I just picked up a couple small items on my way home and everything was correct when I got back to my house! 
(With take-out that is always my first concern...making sure everything made it into the bag)
I can't really comment on the service or the decor...but from what I saw it looked nice! 
I will definitely go back and check the place out in further detail. 

Enjoy"}
{"text":"The Ft. Apache location of the Thai Style Noodle House may be the sister to the Chinatown original, but they hail from a different mother.

To be sure, the food is almost as good as it's more popular sibling, but that is no surprise, assuming the recipes got passed along at birth. But that's where the similarities end with this western valley reproduction of a well-loved Chinatown eatery (which is sad news for those of us who live in the western valley).

In my review of the original, I bemoaned the absence of an accommodating server who could provide the suggestions I crave when on a maiden voyage. It is fair to assume the language barrier played a significant role in this, but the server did do an excellent job with everything else - and I had Yelp to help out with the suggestion portion.

The same could not be said for the Ft. Apache location. Not only was there no perceivable language barrier, but, as the only customer during the lunch \"rush\", the server was presented ample opportunity to showcase his skills. It is here where he failed -monumentally.

It's hard to describe the feeling of invisibility, especially if the reader has never experienced such loneliness or felt the overwhelming desire to do a Huckleberry Finn on the fence post. It is especially difficult to imagine being ignored when you are the only customer in the place. Suffice it to say, I nearly had to cry out in anguish EVERY time I needed anything, from placing my order to requesting a refill to procuring the check.

Not only did the server not care about my presence in his establishment, he seemed perturbed by the rare interaction he did have with me. To add insult to massive injury, his response to my credit card was (and I quote) \"Don't you have cash?\" (picture Paris Hilton discovering her rental choices did not include a pink Cadillac Escalade.)

I half expected the bill to arrive in some minimum $25 charge, as some restaurants are wont to threaten with their little placards next to the register. 

I was delighted to see that the server only charged my card the exact amount of my bill - it was, sadly, the highlight of my visit."}
{"text":"3 stars for the food minus -1 for the service equals 2.  Called for explanation on the menu but the guy on the other end was to busy to explain. Asked what goes in the different curries but instead he rattles off the colors. I could sense the impatience in he voice. Already ordered fried rice and i was very tempted to cancel that but since it was my sons I kept it. 
When I went there the place was empty except for 1 table so why couldn't he explain some of the menu to me? He said MAYBE he couldn't hear me. I told him the simple solution to that was to turn down the music, dah!!!!
There are other Thai restaurants in the area. Don't need to put up with that kind of service especially since I'm giving them my business."}
{"text":"It seems that the owners of Thai Style noodle house like to compete with other Thai restaurants. Their location in Chinatown is surrounded by Thai places and on Fort Apache theres an abundant amount of Thai places. I don't think TSNH is a knock out for the other restaurants its competing against, but its cheap.

The value of the items you order is a great bang for the buck and they have a large variety of noodles. Although it always weirds me out when I see a Thai restaurant sell won ton noodles. 

Sometimes the wait time is a bit long (I see an elderly thai lady working in the kitchen which is a good and bad thing). If you come here in a party, I would probably skip the chef specials, not because they're not good, but because you'll probably be waiting another 10 minutes or so while your friends are grubbing. 

Oh yeah, I find it a little weird that not all their drinking glasses are the same color. I think its a little weird when we get 7 waters and 3 are in clear glasses while the other 4 are in red.

The service is nice though, never really had a problem with any orders.

THE SUMMARY:
cheap, variety, long wait, weird cups, decent service."}
{"text":"My go-to Thai pick-up place! Always delicious and super cheap. We usually go with the Pad Thai spicy 4 extra vegetables with chicken and less oil, papaya salad spicy 3 (spicy..!!), sticky rice, and an order of spring rolls. It's always $22 and a ton of food. Perfect for dinner for 2 ;)"}
{"text":"Whoa, how have I not reviewed this place?  I've checked in like 7 times!  Thai Style Noodle House 2 is pretty decent Thai food and pretty decent prices.  It's not my favorite Thai place in Las Vegas, but that doesn't stop me from frequenting this place.

Their curry selection is pretty cool.  They've got avocados and pumpkin in their curries, which reminds me of Pan Asia.  I've also sampled the pad thai and a yummy noodle dish that has chicken, tofu, shrimp, squid, and just a bit of everything in it.  Their garlic pork is very flavorful, and their spice levels are right on point.  I kept hearing about this beef jerky that they have, but I didn't like it.  Really tough and burnt.

The service is quick and friendly.  I definitely recommend this place to my Yelp friends!"}
{"text":"Came here based on it's Yelp score. We were at Lowes and wanted something cheap and Thai. We were not let down. Had the green salad (best peanut dressing) pad Thai and panang curry. All delicious! And all for only $23. Don't live near here but will be back! Service is adequate but not stellar, but who cares when the food is delicious!"}
{"text":"Went down to american shooters to check out some ARs and got hungry. so drove to thai style noodle to get some food. the inside is pretty small, maybe seats 20 people max. the food here is super cheap!! a bowl of noodles is about = $6 and a thai ice tea is $1.50ish. i ordered potstickers, a bowl of duck meat noodles and a bowl of bbq pork noodles. the potstickers were really crispy but they put too much of the mayo sauce on top so its like eating a potsticker sushi roll. the duck noodle was ok the broth tasted good not too salty a little dark and cloudy though. the worst was the bbq pork noodles. the pork was dry as hell and the broth had NO taste whatsover. overall for the price everything was OK. i would go back and get something else to try."}
{"text":"I like this location than the other one on Spring Mountain, not just because its nicer but the staff is way more friendly. I love the pad see yew (idk if I spelled it right haha) with flat noodles. Everything is less than $10 which makes my wallet happy. I also like the beef noodle soup & the fried rice. Can't beat the prices here for delicious Thai food."}
{"text":"Ordered the Kung pow beef, what I got was rice 80% 17% vegetables and 3% beef with some sauce that was nothing like Kung pow sauce and it was so thin it ran under the rice so there was none for the beef. What a waist of money, not ever going back......."}
{"text":"This was our first visit here as we had a taste for Thai. We happened to find this location and give it a try. We ordered the Edamame and chicken pad Thai. The pad Thai was great! Love the bean sprouts with the noodles! Great compliment to the dish. Customer service was awesome! We will definitely be back and will recommend to others."}
{"text":"Amazing food great service! 5 stars for this place the fish tank adds a great touch for the kids. Really enjoy eating here. Great day the Thai way."}
{"text":"We have eaten here for years. Over the past couple of years we have seen the quality of the food and the service deteriorate. The chairs are filthy. The menus old, dirty and damaged. Prices have always been great, but we may have to look for a new Thai restaurant as the staff, chef and management seem to have lost their passion. The owners need to CLEAN the place and replace the chairs and menus. The servers need uniforms and worst of all, the food quality has suffered and rarely does a full table of food come out at the same time. We really have enjoyed Thai Noodle 2, but if they don't improve the dining experience, we will not return."}
{"text":"Compare with another Thai Style Noodle House, which is right next to my house. The food at this one is just okay, I prefer their her one better. And when we enter there's a long line waiting. We waited for 20 minutes and finally made tout seat. The waitresses are good and bad depending on who's the server, we have 3 ladies serving us so the service is not consistent. 
I'd rather go to the one near my house than this one for sure."}
{"text":"My favorite neighborhood Thai restaurant and there are 5 within 1 mile of each other in thus area! Inexpensive, fast and tasty. Try the pot stickers, Kau Kai , duck soup and eggplant. The orange chicken is in a batter so light and fluffy we renamed it doughnut chicken. All but one of the wait staff are friendly and efficient. If you get the girl who invests in her appearance and not her personality or profession, your order will be wrong and you will be asking for essentials like forks and your drinks, getting nothing but attitude."}
{"text":"Everything was good.  It's a cute little place and the service was nicer than usual from Asian joints.  

They had a very creative seasonal item on the special board - pumpkin curry! We gave it a try and it was excellent, the best thing we had.  We also had the spicy eggplant with ground beef, the rad-na noodles with chinese broccoli, the cucmber salad, and the mango with sticky rice.  

The rad-na was extremely soupy with a gravy like sauce.  Way too saucy! It was ok.  We wouldn't order it again.  The eggplant had a really thick, almost unchewable skin.  Otherwise, tasty.  The mango with sticky rice was done perfecty; furthermore, it was only $3.95!?!?!? Holy moly! it's usually a $9.00 item.  

Our entire bill for appetizer, 3 dishes and dessert was $30.  It won't be THE best Thai food ever but it is tasty, friendly, clean, and cheap.  I'll go back!"}
{"text":"I love this place. It's yummy, service is quick, and prices are so cheap it's crazy. My favs are pineapple fried rice and pad thai. That thai spice and flavor is always there. No dish is over $10. I ordered calamari, pad Thai, pine apple fried rice, and a rice dish that came with fried chicken and my total was $30, and it fed me and my dad and sister, and we had leftovers. So good! I recommend"}
{"text":"I used to love this place  but not any more I think they change the chef ... but this location is better than 3rd location... People are not friendly... Not really good service!!! Kitchen looks so dirty . Good for to go order :)"}
{"text":"This is a little family owned business or so it seemed.  Very busy restaurant with a lot of phone orders.  The kitchen is very busy so when we arrived, sat down, and ordered, it took awhile to get the food.  The waitress was nice and you can constantly see the 2 people in the front moving back and forth.  The food deserved 5 stars.  It was very good and the prices were good so I can see why they were so busy."}
{"text":"This location was up to par with their China town location. In my opinion the original location of a restaurant usually has better food but I wasn't disappointed.

We got rad na, seafood salad, and grilled beef salad.

Same affordable prices, same delicious take on Thai dishes. 

Clean, friendly staff, fast turn out."}
{"text":"Every now and then I like to treat myself to a cheat meal and i just remembered how i fell so much in love with the Thai Basil with Chicken just prior to my change in lifestyle.  A friend wanted Thai food, so I suggested this spot since it was closer to both of us as oppose to the other location.

Judging by this dish alone i would have never guess that the two Thai Style Noodle House are sister properties.  It was just so terrible and tasteless compare to the other one.  Not enjoyable at all.  So much that I would not think about coming back and play it safe by sticking to the original one on Wynn.

Oh, but hey, nice ceiling!"}
{"text":"I love La!!!!! Her service is the greatest. I moved to LA and miss this place so much! Love, - G"}
{"text":"Although the service was prompt, we did have to ask for smaller plates for our appetizer which seems out of the norm... We had pot stickers and they didn't have a lot of sauce unlike my previous visits which was disappointing. The Thai tea is always a must. The worst is the flies that were everywhere. It was super unappetizing and gross. I had to keep swatting my hand around our food to make sure they didn't land.  5 mins of doing that and the waitress didn't bother coming to see what was wrong and there was two of them working. I hailed her down asking for a check and to go. While waiting I did notice the fish tank they have is full of algae. We just couldn't eat there anymore... probably not going to come back which is a shame because this spot used to be really great!"}
{"text":"Had the pad sew and fried ice cream and it was delicious. I will definitely come back for that, only complaint I had is that the service was painfully slow. Our server was busy on her phone the whole time and didn't even come check on us. Second she gave me the wrong plate that I never ordered. We had to keep yelling for her trying to get her attention while she was in the front on her phone."}
{"text":"Excellent food at great price!!! We always order the same dish every time we go ( every 2wks). You have to try their Thai style noodle soup w/flat noodle, that's my favorite!!! Pork larrb, pad see eu, shrimp fried rice, chicken panang, papaya salad  are among the other dishes we always order!!!! Very friendly staff....I guess I can say we are regulars here, way better than archi's"}
{"text":"I really like this place!  Small and cute restaurant w two nice ladies working in the front.  I like the flavors; not a cliche tasting Thai place.   I saw they have larb snapper which I'd like to try some day soon."}
{"text":"Finally went to this place since it's closer to my house then the Thai Style Noodle house #1 on Spring Mtn and Wynn. This place is still as good as the first place. I ordered the same things such as the House Tom Yum Noodle which was delicious, Papaya Salad spicy 8 hit the spot, Pad Thai, Fried chicken, and the fried rice and chinese sausage and pork. All item were authentic. 

Service was great. I believe the waitress came from #1. The restaurant is very cute and comfortable. The food came out really fast too.

I would definitely recommend this place over any Thai restaurant in Las Vegas. Thai Style Noodle House #1 and #2 are my first choices! If you want the old school feel i would go to #1 and more modern would be #2... both same in taste.."}
{"text":"This location is a bit far from where I live but I like it the best of this brand. It's a little better than a hole in the wall, but the food is good. Cheap, straight forward Thai food. My only gripe is that they don't have Thai chilis in fish sauce as a condiment. It's not the best Thai I've had but satisfies any Thai food craving.

My go to dish is the spicy eggplant with fried tofu. My son loves the pad see ew (spelling?) with chicken. Their pad thai is also good. My husband likes the Penang curry. Their papaya salad I think is the most authentic in Vegas. We've had ginger chicken, steamed snapper, and tom yum goong as well. I think we've had other dishes, but we get the ones over. Oh, that's right the basil chicken. 

You can't go wrong. It's tasty."}
{"text":"The food is great but the service sucks. The waitresses working there had a huge attitude. My friend ordered Thai iced coffee or tea and asked if there were refills or not. The waitress just looked at him like he was stupid and when he asked the second time she just gave a straight up no and walked away. He bought another one anyway.

What really made this a one star place for me was that when I paid with my credit card and walked outside, to my surprise, the waitress literally CHASED us down the sidewalk demanding to know why we hadn't left a tip. Just to get her to leave us alone she hassled a tip from us, which was 5 dollars and the only cash we had on us at the time. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"When I came to this restaurant for the very first time, the food was great. So, I had a great impression of this restaurant, However, the service is really bad and unfriendly. The servers were treating the customers very differently. The server was very generous and greeted the customers. Yet, whenever we came, she never treated us the same. It felt like she was ignorant. The server was refilling water in every customer's cup. However, she never came to our table, which was a great disappointment. I felt the big difference between the other customers and us. It felt like we were discriminated. It was an unwelcome dinner. Never coming here again."}
{"text":"I love this Thai style noodle house the best. They are always on point with their flavor! I love the ambiance of the location better as well. It is not as bright, and the decoration is well done. The waitress always gets my order right and they make the best Thai tea. I ordered to go for the first time and I think I will stick with eating in!"}
{"text":"Still going strong after all these years.  This little \"hole in the wall\" has been around for as long as my wife and I have been visiting Las Vegas China (Asia) town.  Food is awesome as the flavors are authentic and explode in every bite!  Can't beat the prices either!"}
{"text":"My bf got the thai shrimp fried rice, which was pretty good, while I got a pad thai and it was decent. I should have asked about spicy levels because it was 60% sweet and 40% savory for me. For the large portions, it's very affordable, so I'll come back and try again prepared. I'm just new to the area and shy, so I hope to update this review in the future."}
{"text":"my go to 
i always get the crab fried rice, chicken pad thai, beef pad see, and crab rangoons 
can never go wrong"}
{"text":"I think Thai Style Noodle House might be my newest favorite Thai place! I got to try the original location first and liked it a lot and since this one is a lot closer to home it's definitely a winner. Although my review is a bit biased since I've only had the beef noodle soup as an entree, it was very tasty and definitely a good lunch size portion for $6.50. My friends enjoyed their curry that they had and pad thai as well. I remember trying the chicken satay and crab rangoons which were decent as well. Prices are reasonable and you can't really go wrong with this place. Their thai iced tea and coffee are a bit on the sweet side, like diabetic sweet so just a fair warning.  $15 dollar minimum to use your credit card.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"Inexpensive food! Great cozy place for days when you are lazy to cook and want something to fill your tummy!"}
{"text":"Basil Fried Rice. Get it. It's my favorite thing on the menu because it's freaking delicious. I get take out and have never dined in so I'm not too familiar with their customer service, but as far as I can tell it coincides with other Asian restaurants if you know what I mean. last time I finally tried their soups and not too shabby! I'd highly recommend their soups. easy substitute for Pho for those days when you're craving something hot and delicious and possibly help with your hangover or get over a cold."}
{"text":"Their crab fried rice is really good. The beef curry is too sweet for all of us but spiciness level is on point. Chicken satay is a bit dry but otherwise seasoned well. For dessert, we had the sticky rice with mango and that is really good. 

The service is pretty fast, and the servers are attentive. 
 
Prices are reasonable. Convenient location. Ample parking. 

They may need to refurb the chairs as they have so much stains we were scared to sit on it. Other than this, pretty good Thai restaurant."}
{"text":"Prices are great. Portions are good. Nearby. We're regulars! 

My husband's on a Thai kick. Have no idea why, but he wants to try every Thai place in town. We were frequent visitors of Basil and Lime then Surang's but I believe that my husband and I have found our \"spot\". The staff is really friendly and the food is good. 

If you're used to the traditional flavors of Thai food, then there's a possibility that you may not like this place. AND the reason why I say that is because of the pad thai & the ladnar (Sp?). These are two dishes that I ordinarily do NOT like at other places, there's usually a funky taste to them and I have no idea how to describe them, they taste almost spoiled to me... I personally am not able to enjoy them because of that. But TSNH's version has me going in for more every time! 

We're here a minimum of 2 times a week. Yep-- return visits."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! It's about $1 - $2 LESS per entree compared to other Thai restaurants. The place is CLEAN and the service is good. Very solid dining experience."}
{"text":"This place should be on the top Thai Restaurants in Las Vegas. Their food tastes amazing compared to others. This is our new favorite place to eat Thai food. Best Pad Thai and Penang Curry."}
{"text":"All 5 stars here. Food taste like home, the prices are so cheap, they have great desserts and I'm never disappointed when I go back - so it's consistent."}
{"text":"Quality Thai food at a reasonable price. I love their pad Thai and Thai tea! Very authentic tasting! I would totally recommend to anyone seeking Thai food!"}
{"text":"A great locals eatery! I have been going to their Chinatown location for years before I tried this location that's closer to home. I appreciate the simplicity of the place, the great food and the reasonable prices. No Maitre D, no fancy ceremonial, just great food. Pad See Ew remains my favorite, Spicy Eggplant is great too, and the soups are amazing! Last but not least, you gotta try the Sticky Rice with ice cream dessert."}
{"text":"Plenty of parking.  The place was clean.  Server was quick, friendly, and helpful.  We ordered silver noodle salad, pad see ew, and spicy string beans.  The food came out quickly.  It was well flavored and the ingredients were fresh.  The pad see ew was not overly sweet.  The total bill was around $21.  It was really good, but did not stand out as \"Best I've Ever Had\".  I would recommend it if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Oh my Thai. It is no Lotus of Siam.. It's better. Price, taste, portion, & service wise it's really great! I've tried beef Larb, pad se eu, pad Thai, curry, & mango sticky rice here. All delicious although the main star has to be pad se eu. 
Good service for sit-down and to-go. Very affordable prices and you get a good portion for it too. Every bite is full of flavor. Can't go wrong with Thai Style Noodle House. I've found my new go to place for Thai cuisine :-)"}
{"text":"Good food, prices ,$7-8, portions could be a little larger. Nice ambiance. Fast friendly service."}
{"text":"All you need is one dish, DUCK FRIED RICE! I usually go to the original location but this place is a lot nicer and bigger. Flat white noodles compare to other places taste about the same.  I give it 5 stars because for the price you're getting pretty good food."}
{"text":"Very good find...thanks for previous yelpers as they were not wrong...

The Seafood Tom Yum with noodles was delicious and definitely hit the spot on this cold of a night.

Will be back for more!"}
{"text":"Who's guilty of eating at one restaurant too many time?? This guy! I hate it when I get into these kind of cravings. TSNH makes it so easy for you to fall into this trap. Everything is dirt cheap and addictive.

I can say that dollar for dollar, this place makes the best Thai style steak salad in America. Is that too bold of a statement? Maybe. But for under $8, nothing can taste more amazing.

See, I'm in a good mood so I wrote a 5 star review, but like any restaurant you visit frequently enough, consistency can be their downfall. 4-5 stars based on the chef working there that day.

Another thing to point out is the level of spiciness 1-10.  But that's not their fault, it's our fickle diners. That's why I vote for a Universal Spiciness Barometer.  We need Thai style reform. We need to start here."}
{"text":"I dont know why I haven't reviewed this place since we've been coming here for about 5 years now. Anyway, to start it off, I'd like to explain that the 1 shy of star from a 4 star is due to the piece of hair i found on my Pad Thai from my to go order today and inconsistent service. The service in this place is almost always bad for both dine in and to go orders. But I wont complain too much since husband and I choose to come back over and over again. It's not the best Thai food we've had in town but it satisfies a good Thai food crave. We come back for the consistency in taste and price. My husband and I probably only cook at home twice a month so the rest of the days, we eat out twice or three times a day even. This place is one of our cheap spots. If you might wonder what's the best Thai food we've had in town so far is my friend's family home cooking lol jk. Im saying, I'm not Thai but have had good home cooked Thai meals so I know what to compare restaurants dishes to. I really like Archie's on Sahara and Fort Apache the best so far. And the worst would have to be Thai Place on Maryland and Flamingo. We've had quite a few different dishes from here over the few years and haven't really been disappointed. We've had some of the Chinese dishes as well, Sweet and Sour and Orange Chicken, etc, but I wont recommend them since...why would I when you're at in Thai restaurant? Kids love them though.

Dishes that we usually order on repeat and highly recommend are:
Pad Thai and Papaya Salad of course, Pad See Eu/Ew, Rad Na, Yellow Curry, Panang Curry, Pineapple Curry, Cashew Nuts rice plate, Spicy Basil Leaf rice plate, Grill Salad, and Crab Fried Rice.

Ok dishes:
Three Companion, Tom Yum, Khua Kai, Pineapple Fried Rice and Spicy Basil Leaf Fried Rice.

Would not recommend:
Pra Ram rice plate did not look nor tasted appetizing at all.

Their menu says Vegetarian options are available upon request on each items on the menu. If you are a true Vegetarian then make sure to ask about fish sauce on the dishes. I am a Pescatarian so I usually order dishes with Tofu (steamed sometimes fried) or sometimes Shrimp. My husband eats chicken and beef. All the dishes I mentioned above are good with all, chicken, beef, shrimp and tofu.

I love spicy food but am not a champ at it and my husband is not a fan. But Thai restaurant spice levels are nothing compared to home cooked Thai spice level. So most patrons should be safe here. I usually order spicy level 7/8 for a good heat and still enjoy or even 10 if I want a challenge since I need to drink lots of water since I didnt the past days lol. I can handle them but my husband's limit is 5.

TSNH 2 location is closest to us since it's on the outskirt of Summerlin South. We've also been to the one in ChiTown and Jones but TSNH 2 is better."}
{"text":"The Panang curry is the best I've had yet! And at the price point, it can't be beat. Their menu also offers a variety of dishes from noodle soups to fried rice. Will definitely be coming back for more!"}
{"text":"My go to restaurant. Prices are affordable and food is really good. I order the beef pad sew ew and the chicken fried rice on a regular. I love this place!"}
{"text":"I could eat here every day. (I pretty much do!) Their Thai noodle soup is my favorite! (Very similar to Vietnamese pho). Also their curries are all excellent and I always have their mango sticky rice dessert."}
{"text":"First time here, I found this place on yelp but it's a Small restaurant and the food is delicious and the staff is very attentive and friendly definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Went here for a late dinner after my son's soccer game and we were not disappointed. 

Going into a Thai restaurant I always tell myself, \"The service is going to be bad, but that's okay.. I am here for the food\" and that's exactly how this restaurant was. Great food, bad service. 

My wife and I ordered a well received yelp favorite here, the Pineapple Fried Rice, which was FANTASTIC! Throughout the fried rice were cashews and pineapple chunks which added such a distinctive brightness to the rice. The dish was flawless. I would go here again and again just for that rice alone.

We also ordered the Sliced Beef and Vermicelli Noodle Soup with Bok Choy. This was a perfect entree for this cold fall night. It warmed you right up with subtle flavors of cilantro and bean sprouts in a delicious beef broth. The beef came out at a perfect temp and was very tender. They definitely don't skimp out of flavors and ingredients. My family and I will def be back soon to enjoy another warm winter favorite!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to this location for dinner on a Friday night.  They were located on S Ft Apache Rd/near W Hacienda Ave in Las Vegas.  I have been to the location in Chinatown for lunch.

My friend ordered the Red Pumpkin Curry.  The pumpkin looked like it had been browned or baked and then added to the curry.  The flavor was good.  This entree came out about 5 minutes before my entree.

I ordered the BBQ Pork Rice Plate which I would usually order in a Vietnamese restaurant.  It was brought out with a clear soup at the same time.  The soup could have at least been brought out with my friend's entree so I had something to eat while I was waiting for my food.  The BBQ Pork was thrown on top a pile of rice.  There was no pretty cucumber and carrot garnish.  The rice was not arranged in an appealing shape.  I'm a very visual person and I like to have food that looks good.

The service was almost non-existant.  I did not get a refill of water nor did the server ask if we needed anything after she brought me the Spicy Tray.

I don't know if I would go back."}
{"text":"Pin Kaow is my all time favorite Thai restaurant and I have always been a bit sketcy about trying different thai places due to recurring disappointment.
I noticed this place that is right up the street from my house and was really curious, I read all the reviews and most of them were really good so I decided to try this place for a work week lunch ( not to ruin my date night dinner, if I was disappointed).
Well to my surprise, this place was really good. 
I ordered the Shrimp fried rice #10 (as I always do)
I told my coworker that it was almost perfect, my only hold back was that the shrimp were a little on the medium/small side and were a little dried out but the flavors were DELICIOUS and they actually made it a #10 as most places don't think that I can handle it and usually make it around a #6 or #7!!!
Keep in mind that the shrimp might have been like that because I did get it to go and they most likely just kept cooking in the to go container.

I went home and told my husband about it and we made plans to go that Friday and he would test it out to see if he would like it.
Skeptical as I was, he was so surprised at how much he LOVED IT!!!! 
He oredered the Duck Fried rice #10, we split the Shrimp Pad Se Eww #10 and I again got Shrimp fried rice number #10. This time the shrimp were perfect, I think it makes a difference when you take it to go.
The pad se eww was delicious as was the duck fried rice.
The next best thing was the Price All 2 dishes came to just over $27.00. I couldn't even believe it. When we order those same 3 dishes at Pin Kaow it comes over $37.00. The duck fried rice is $5.00 more at Pin Kaow. 
That is what I really like about the place, no matter how popular they get they don't raise their prices and that will keep us coming back over and over again. 

I would recommend this place over and over again and you better believe that we will be there yet again this Friday night."}
{"text":"Tried this place out yesterday, had the papaya salad, green curry and sticky rice and mango. All were amazing, good portions and great value. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"I have been to both the Spring Valley and Chinatown location. Each time I have been I receive consistent good quality service and food. They use fresh ingredients. I am a vegetarian so I love that they offer all dishes as vegetarian. They are one of the few, so many places in Chinatown only have one or two vegetarian options. I strongly recommend the spicy green bean (because it is already spicy no need to go more than 3 stars on the heat) Also, the Tom Kha soup is delicious. This place could be my new fast-food go to."}
{"text":"Had the chicken pad Thai and it was great! The cashier and guy who took my order was very nice."}
{"text":"This place is amazing.

We got the yellow chicken curry and pad Thai with beef shrimp and vegetable. 

It's family owned business with wonderful service. I wish there there was more family owned places in town."}
{"text":"I've never eaten anything from here that I don't like. This place is amazing. The service is great and the staff is always friendly and willing to answer any questions. The food is absolutely delicious, I recommend the seafood tom yum soup or the spicy eggplant."}
{"text":"Got the green curry fried rice with shrimp, spicy level 10. It was flavorful but not particularly spicy. The mango sticky rice was pretty decent."}
{"text":"A good place to get Thai food that I close by our house. The prices are good too! Would def recommend!"}
{"text":"Love this place! After literally trying over 10 different Thai restaurant, this is my all time fave. Delicious Thai food with great portions and prices! You won't be disappointed! FYI the decor is ok but food is five stars!"}
{"text":"This place was a bust. If you have ever been to David's restaurant pan Asian you will leave here disappointed. The food was not as nearly as tasteful as pan Asian. I ate pad se ew and bit into a bone in my chicken. The sauces were watered down and food was mediocre. Unlikely will be returning. I'll pay a little more for amazing food elsewhere."}
{"text":"Really good food for the price. Not overly greasy, which is always my worry with noodle dishes. We got chicken pad thai and beef pad se ew and both were worth every cent. I recommend!"}
{"text":"Good for quick and easy but super inconsistent. I've been here about 5 times and Sometimes it's great and sometimes it's just meh. Medium can be crazy spicy and hot can be mild.. It's all over the place."}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't left a review for TSNH2! I've been to many of the Thai places around this area and always end up back here. It's inexpensive, open late, less than a 5 minute drive away from my house, and they've got some key menu items that keep me coming back.
Like several other Asian joints, the service is probably not what you'd expect. Once in a while, they'll forget to give you a napkin or have to go back to grab your utensils and there might even be some miscommunication, but the food is well worth it.
Not a huge fan of their pad thai, but I love their duck fried rice and pretty much any of the curries. The portions are generous and the food doesn't take very long either. 

Cheap Thai cuisine that tastes good within 5 minutes of my home... Uhm. What else is there to say?"}
{"text":"Tasty food but they overly charged for delivery even when ur really close to the restaurant..."}
{"text":"After many harrowing experiences with Thai restaurants recently, it is good to return to a solid, familiar place. They have all the Thai classics and then some, with some nice duck and seafood dishes that aren't on the menu at other places. Their duck dishes are a bit too rich to eat alone, but are so satisfying at the right amounts. The seafood dishes are fresh and speak much to the quality of the fish. There's a bit of an issue with spiciness, though - this is one place that could stand to develop a better spice scale, especially since they excel in other flavor categories as well.

The servers here are friendly and very efficient. They seem happy, which makes the whole establishment seem happy, which makes even the busy nights just more bustling than hectic. Again, a solid, familiar place for just good Thai food."}
{"text":"I'm becoming a Panang addict. I have to try it wherever I go. Tonight was no exception. After reading Anthony M's ROTD, I figured this would be a good place to take my Dad for a little birthday dinner with my brother.

Panang Avocado with Salmon. Doesn't that just sound awesome? Well it wasn't mind-blowing, but it was pretty good. Honestly, I still prefer Archi's Panang overall, but I love the fact that it comes with ample large chunks of salmon and avocado. It's kind of a perfect little marriage. You take some salmon and avocado in with your rice on each spoonful. The combination works swimmingly.

As it turns out, my Dad no longer eats spicy food. Fortunately, there are plenty of options for him. He ended up going with the Seafood Wonton soup. It looked delicious and had plenty of seafood. I like the uber-wide bowl they use to serve the soup. My brother went with the Yellow Curry with Tofu. I didn't ask him how it was, but he seemed to enjoy it.

As a side note, it was strange that the place was basically empty when we got there, but within minutes, the place was full. It's like after we sat down, a constant stream of customers just kept walking in until all the tables filled up. Also, I found the TV programming to be interesting. I used to love home improvement shows and seeing an Asian version was definitely entertaining."}
{"text":"I love their salmon and avocado dish! And they serve mango sticky rice, however; I was a little disappointed because the rice was undercooked."}
{"text":"To say that I'll be back after today's experience is an understatement. 

My bf & I were a bit skeptical after having seen this place before, but I'm glad that even if we had been here before, we decided to try it one more time. 

We ended up coming in right around 12:30pm, a time where usually Thai restaurants are fairly busy -- but this one wasn't! 

We sat down, and without having to ask, water was served (always a PLUS). The prices on the menu are more than reasonable...I believe almost all of the items were under $10 -- and the menu is EXTENSIVE.

I ordered my favorite item, Papaya Salad (medium spice) & my bf ended up getting Kung Pao Shrimp. The papaya salad was AWESOME SAUCE. It was a rather spicy, probably more than medium spice, but it was delicious. The kung pao shrimp was very good too. I loved the black bean sauce. It was sautéed until the onions and peppers were tender. ALL THE BETTER. 

I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I have no clue why there are so many Thai restaurants on such a short stretch of Fort Apache, though I'm not complaining.

I've only been here once, but I would come back again. The service was really quick and friendly. I ordered the beef pad thai from the regular menu since it isn't on the lunch menu. It was less than $7 for the pad thai and the serving size was generous. If you prefer more main dish at the expense of not getting the usual side items that come with a lunch menu order, then come here.

One negative is that they only take debit/credit on orders over $10. As a person that rarely carries cash and likes to track all my spending via my credit card, I definitely dislike that company policy."}
{"text":"Thai Style Noodle House of Chinatown has expanded to the southwest side, in the same plaza as Waffles Cafe. The restaurant has been called the best Thai Restaurant in Vegas (not Lotus of Siam),  so there is pressure for this restaurant to deliver if its to carry the Thai Style Noodle House name and it does!

@ NH Style Potstickers - This was a delicious appetizer taking a book from the Japanese drizzling spicy mayo, eel sauce, and some hot sauce. Sprinkled on top is some sesame seeds, white onions, and green onions. The only issue with this item was the wonton wrap was fried a little bit too much so it was hard, not crispy. I told the waiter and the manager thanked me for it and gave me the item half off. Yay! Hopefully in the future they'll fix this issue. 

@ Seafood Wonton Soup w/ Rice Noodles - This place sure gets you your money worth. Filling the noodles with wontons, shrimp, fish balls, sea cucumber,  clams, and fish. The chicken broth is a clean tasting and delicious. A good fulfilling and delicious dish for $7.60.

This place opened this past week and looks like they're getting some foot traffic already.  The decor is nice, doesn't look like the hole in the wall Chinatown version. The fake granite tables, copper ceiling, and simple layout makes this an inviting place to come eat. 

Service is very friendly and attentive. When I explained to them my concerns for one of their appetizer, they were genuinely appreciative. This is a rare thing to find.

A new restaurant (kind of) that delivers the first time, with some minor issues. Great food and service makes you consider going to this place over the other surrounding Thai restaurants."}
{"text":"The yellow curry is to die for. The best curry I've ever had. Also the pad Thai is great. Nice people too."}
{"text":"Sooooooo Dang good. Very fresh and fast, I will be back next time I am in Vegas"}
{"text":"I LOVEEEEE this Thai place! 

I've had pad see eew, drunken noodles (pad kee mow), pad Thai, spicy basil, crab fried rice, beef noodle soup, tom yum... All of their food is very tasty. I have never had a bad experience here. My favorite dishes are drunken noodles and spicy basil. 

Their papaya salad is very flavorful also, just don't get it too spicy. I got #8 and I had to drink so much water. They'll give you a lot of larb, which is also another hit. 

This place is newer, so it's way cleaner than their location in China town. I went there once, and never wanted to come back. 

I come here every week or at least twice a month. Archi's used to be my to go Thai place, but since I discovered this place, Archi's is no longer in my top favorite anymore."}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite Thai restaurant in the southwest area. 

[CUISINE]
Khua Kai: My current favorite item on the menu. If you've never had it before its like a seared noodle dish with egg, served with a Thai sweet chili sauce. LOVE IT! 

Three Companion: The pork had a charred, barbecue flavor, it was a little chewy, but it's pork.

Panang Avocado Curry: This used to be my favorite menu item, (I've ordered this about 20 times) but sadly something has changed either with the quality of the Salmon or the preparation of it. I would not recommend ordering it. The salmon is consistently bad quality or dry tasting.  I asked and they said there was no change. Tried it three more times before finally giving up on it.

[DECOR]
I love the decor here. It's a very small cozy restaurant, there is this amazing faux tin ceiling which is my favorite thing about the decor here. I find myself looking up. I like that they pay Thai television here too. The walls have are half stone. Very beautiful in a casual environment.

[PRICE]
Very good pricing. Main dishes are $7-$9 and very filing. :)

[SERVICE]
Everyone is very sweet and friendly here :)"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! My only thing I ever order is the Duck Fried rice with no pineapple or tomatoes. Service takes a little while to come out and customer service could use a LOT of work but food is delicious no doubt! 

My first time I tried this place the 2 younger staff assisting had an attitude and ignored my table for the longest time and when I needed something I would ALWAYS have to flag them down. But when the owners/managers(or what they seem to be) are around they're always asking how I am doing. Esp the older asian lady who is there day in and day out :)"}
{"text":"First things first: this would be a five star review, however they were out of panang curry when I visited last...this will easily be bumped that extra star if this was an isolated incident.  I loved that panang!

Thai Style Noodle House was a real treat.  This location is a few suites down from Waffles Cafe on Fort Apache.  During one of my visits to Waffles Cafe, I saw that the staff was ordering Thai food; within 20 mins the food was delivered.  After some investigation I saw that Thai Style Noodle House had recently opened this location.

Later that week I stopped by for dinner and ordered a chef special, panang curry with avocado and salmon.  This was simply...awesome.  For my curry fix I've been going to Archi's...if only I found Thai Style sooner!  The avocado was a bit hard, but the flavor of the panang brought a smile to my face with each bite.  I ordered it at a 5 out of 10 on the hot scale, and it was what I expected.  After a second visit, they've been consistent with their scale through the four dishes that I've thus tried.

Since then I've had the papaya salad, red curry, and the pad see ew.  After adding some chili powder to the papaya for a little more kick, it became a great side dish to the entrees.  The red curry was good, but I enjoyed the panang a lot more (they were out of panang this night).  And the pad see ew was a very pleasant surprise!  I've had this dish before at other restaurants, and it came out oily and bland.  But here the noodles were cooked perfectly and mixed in with egg and beef, creating a lovely texture with the soft egg and noodles giving way to the thinly sliced beef.  

I've been expanding my tastes recently when it comes to Thai cuisine, and I can't wait for my next visit to Thai Style!"}
{"text":"I was in Vegas looking for a place to live and I hadn't eaten all day long. I was feeling for Thai food and happened upon this place. It is very unassuming, but inviting. I decided to have the Chicken Pad Thai and I asked for it to be  level spicy. The woman was skeptical but I assured her that as an island woman, I could take anything that she dished out. 

The meal arrived after about 10 minutes, which was not too long to wait for someone eating alone. The portion was large enough that I could have split it into two if I wanted, always a plus. The pad Thai? It was fantastic. The seasoning, combined with the heat was just an explosion in my mouth! Definitely brought a smile to my face. The waiter kept staring at me to see if I could actually take the heat and I did! Ate every bite. 
The only reason that I'm not giving the place a 5 star rating is because I thought there could be a bit more chicken, but the overall flavor more than made up for it. Oh and the meal was super affordable at $7.50. 
This place will definitely be seeing me again when I move to Vegas!"}
{"text":"Seriously the greatest place to get Thai food in Vegas. Their soups are the amazing they have so many choices and you get a huge bowl! Tom Kha is best one. Thai iced tea delicious too. Best bang for your buck."}
{"text":"I love this place. Super great prices and the food is the next best thing compared to archis or Thai st. I always get the pad thai, it's not as peanutty and consistent as authentic places but still good. My favorite is their xlrg Thai tea. The thing is huge for only $4"}
{"text":"I tried this spot for the first time, desperate for some good Thai without having to drive all the way downtown. I was greeted right away by a friendly fella... I placed my order to go after looking at the menu for a minute. I got the potstickers without the mayo (I despise mayo) and the beef Pad See-eu spicy level 7, I love spicy. When I got home, I dug into the potstickers... They were so bomb. I'm definitely getting them every time. Next the Pad See-eu. It was okay, but I tasted absolutely no spice. Really I tasted no seasoning at all, it was bland but not terrible. I probably wouldn't order that again but I am looking forward to trying other items on the menu. Overall it was a good experience, everyone was kind, food was ready quick and the potstickers were a win."}
{"text":"Love the place, always quick food preparation and great prices. Have come here many times and will definitely come again!"}
{"text":"For this price, hard to get better thai food. I've been here over 10 times to eat and more then 10 to take out. Food quality never changed. Its good for quick n budget linch or take out, not cool for a date:)"}
{"text":"Delicious Beef Pad Thai! Their staff is always so nice! The Crab Rangoons are also delicious!"}
{"text":"First time here and was not disappointed. Started with tom yum soup, bowl is huge and we shared it easily without finishing. Soup was tasty, spicy and full of shrimp. Only complaint was there was something hard in it. I think it was bamboo but whatever it was it wasn't edible. My wife had the curry chicken and I had the Thai spicy noodle. Funny story, my wife doesn't like real hot food, so she told them a \"2\" on the spice level, I love spicy so I said medium spice. My wife's food was so hot she was pink and sweating, while mine had a hint of spice but was not hot at all. Both were very good, we'll definitely go back, but be careful on the spice level, not sure how they interpret what you tell them. I washed it down with a couple Thai iced teas and they were fabulous. Service was good, prices very reasonable"}
{"text":"Will return here for sure.  Great food for the price!  Pork jerky = 9.  Silver noodle salad= 8.5 beef soup=7 and Thai fried rice= 9.5,  service=10"}
{"text":"Fifth time here now.  
They can never seem to get my order 100% right no matter what I order.   

Example -
Forgot my salad on two visits. 
Forgot to bring ice coffee until end of meal. 
Ask for level 3 spice on squid salad and they bring me level 69 of hell.   
Every time is something.   

Food -   it's no Lotus of Siam but if ur craving Thai beef noodle soup or duck curry, this place will do."}
{"text":"I just discovered this place last week and yet I have been three times already! I have only had the yellow curry with chicken and the fried bananas for dessert. Both of mine items have been perfect each time and the service has been top notch. My order has ready within 10 to 15 minutes each time I ordered. I will continue to visit this location!"}
{"text":"Always spot on! The potstickers are some of the best in town! Great for take out or dining in if you time your visit right. The chicken fried chicken over fried rice, potstickers, beef salad and pineapple fried rice are really good.
The only complaint I would have is you have to be carefull on your spicy level as it seems one cook goes too out and the other is just right. Always safer to go lower..."}
{"text":"We got some take out while driving past, and we're so happy that we did! Great price for good food. We've only had it once, but will definitely be returning. We tried a green curry, pad thai, and an appetizer sampler. Everything tasted fresh, and it was of course a nice treat the following day as well. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time and got their yellow curry with chicken, crab fried rice, and chicken pad Thai. I literally ate every last drop! Everything was delicious and I will definitely be back! Great fast, and friendly service!"}
{"text":"The food is excellent here. The waiter is very nice. He was super friendly. The place is very clean. They made the sticky rice with mango in a heart shape. My daughter loved it!"}
{"text":"Food - 3/5
Service - 4/5
Cleanliness - 4/5
Overall - 3.6/5

Decided to try this place out because a friend was on his Vegan diet and this restaurant has Vegan choices. I never had the other location but he said this restaurant wasn't bad for having a variety of choice. This location is in the same plaza as Sweet Addiction and where Raw Foods use to be. 

--------------------------------------------Food - 5/5-----------------------------------------------­----
4 different types of noodles you can choose with your different soup bases. I tried the Beef stew with rice noodle. My friend had the chicken broth with rice noodles and my other friend had Vegan Curry.

The Beef and Chicken broth noodle didn't have much flavor. The broth didn't taste as I expected and wasn't seasoned properly. 

----------------------------------------------­Service 4/5-----------------------------------------------­--
The service was standard for a fast food place. It wasn't extremely good but it wasn't bad either. The service was quite fast and when they messed up on my friends order, they automatically took it back and corrected it before serving the food.

--------------------------------------------­Cleanliness - 4/5---------------------------------------------
The location was clean front of house. Some of the furniture was worn down and old but it was still clean. 

Overall
Ok food for good price, fast and decent service. The location was good for a fast dinner   choice that cater to vegan clientele."}
{"text":"Fantastic lunch.  Excellent value.  Nice people.  The green curry pork truly hit the spot.  I've been to Thailand more frequently than to Reno, so I can wholeheartedly endorse this spot.  The dinner menu is quite standard with a few additional 'Chinese-style' dishes.  Beef Broccoli?  Sure.  Why not?  Next time is the acid test - Phad Thai and Tom Kar Gai.  If these pass muster, I'll be a frequent visitor.  Great find!  Thanks, Yelp."}
{"text":"So my wife and I are big fans of the Thai Style Noodle House in Chinatown.  We just recently saw that there is one in our neighborhood.  In fact, it's five minutes away, ON THE SAME STREET!!! We were very excited, and decided on night to have some delivered.  That was mistake number 1 for us.  They said that it would be 25-30 minutes.  After 45 minutes, I called them and they said that the driver was just now leaving.  15 minutes later, the driver calls me and says he cannot find our apartment complex.  I told him exactly how to get to our place from the restaurant, and he tells me it's not right.  So after a little back and forth, I finally convince him that I know what I'm talking about, and he's on his way.  15 minutes later, he cannot find our apartment building, blah blah blah.  To top it all off, they didn't even get our order correct.  Long story short, I wouldn't order delivery from them again, but I would go pick up takeout."}
{"text":"Bomb and cheap Thai food in Vegas, hands down! Their potstickers are very good, as well as the Panang curry chicken, and the garlic pepper chicken. Every time I go I want to feast!"}
{"text":"Thai Style Noodle House was worthy of two visits within a week - lunch specials are a great deal here so we couldn't resist returning!

From 10:30 am to 4 pm, lunch specials are in full swing.  (This applies on weekends too!)  

For $5.95, you choose one item from their list and you also get soup of the day, steamed rice, and choice of appetizer (fried tofu, egg roll, or fried wonton).  For only two dollars more ($7.95), you can make it a two item lunch special from their list.  That's a pretty good deal already!

Soup of the day (on both visits) were an egg drop soup that had chunks of goodies in it and fried garlic on top.  A nice start to lunch.  

First visit, the Husband had the two item lunch special - Fried Garlic and Pepper Beef and the Panang Chicken with the Fried Tofu appetizer, whereas I had the one item lunch special - Yellow Curry with Tofu with the Fried Wonton appetizer.  With the two item lunch special, we thought they would give him less of each, but it was actually two full regular lunch portions.  Definitely a great deal!  They even asked if I wanted soft or fried tofu for my entree choice.  My curry was loaded with lots of veggies - carrots, string beans, bamboo shoots, napa cabbage, and baby corn.  All their entrees were good and tasty and we were both pleased with our choices.  

On our second visit, we both got the one item lunch - the Husband stayed with his Fried Garlic and Pepper Beef Choice with the Fried Wonton appetizer while I had the Panang with Tofu with Fried Eggroll appetizer.  They did get our spices mixed up on this visit though.  I requested medium while the Husband asked for spicy.  His has no spice while mine had all the heat.  It was still good nonetheless.

Be sure to ask for the Thai condiments - sometimes they automatically give it to you while other times you have to ask for it.

Their version of Thai iced tea is pretty good and a steal at $1.75.

Service is fine - both times we went was after the lunch rush so we were attended to as needed.

Overall, Thai Style Noodle House ranks up higher than some of the other Thai restaurants in the area offering lunch specials.

Minimum $15 for credit card use."}
{"text":"Yellow curry and coconut juice was amazing! We'll be back very soon. Our server was kinda mean but the food made up for it!"}
{"text":"Very authentic! The best Thai spot in Vegas in my opinion. There food is so fresh and tasty. I love that it's down the street from where we live. And the service is great"}
{"text":"The foods are so good , I ordered 2 chicken satay super yummy, and the price is so cheap, so 5 stars.i will be back"}
{"text":"This place was sooooo amazing and inexpensive! My boyfriend actually recommended this place for their potstickers (which were a mouthgasm).

The service was okay. We went in on New Years Day and they forgot a few essential things like hot sauce, napkins, extra bowls, and even plates.... Haha but it's okay! The food totally made up for it.

We ordered the seafood soup with rice noodles, basil beef, chicken satay (on the tiny side) everything tasted fantastic and the price I paid was unbelievablely reasonable and way cheaper than any other thaifood place. Good prices and high quality food. I can't wait to come back :)"}
{"text":"Food portions were way off, at least for the entrees that include rice. I ordered an entree for about $7.50 and it was 15% entree and 85% rice. They need to be a little more generous so I feel like I'm getting what I pay for. Will go elsewhere next time"}
{"text":"The duck fried rice is always the bomb. Combination beef noodle was great!! No pics to post cause we devoured it already... Lol"}
{"text":"***YELP 100 CHALLENGE 27/100***

I come here for the affordable price point and good food. Though it isn't the best Thai food I've ever had, it's enough to satisfy any pesky cravings and in my humble opinion they have the best sticky rice and mango dessert. I'm a sucker for those things so I always order it no matter which Thai place I go to. It is not a complicated dessert and I've even made it myself a few times before but there's something about TSNH's version that makes it irresistibly good and so hard to stay away from. Another favorite is the Tom Kah Kai, it's a delicious soup with your choice of meat, it has mushrooms, lemon grass, tomato and has a coconut milk base. It's sooo good and depending on your heat tolerance they can customize the spiciness. It goes for most of their dishes like any other restaurant would. The pad thai is worth ordering as well. The kids really enjoyed their orange chicken and the hubby likes the fried rice with a side order of fried chicken. I have yet to try their curry but I'm confident I'll enjoy it like I do the rest of their offerings."}
{"text":"I love this place!! Pad se ew nom nom.
I love that I can say vegan and they say ok. Not huh. Hahaha thanks for feeding my belly"}
{"text":"Wish I lived closer. Gotta say this place has my new favorite potstickers! A must have. 

Also ordered the Silver noodles with chicken and shrimps (yes the menu said shrimps...love the Asians ) asked for medium spicy and was perfect toy liking. 
A busy little place at lunch time midweek, yet was still served quickly. 

Great job guys!"}
{"text":"I walked in 20 minutes before they closed and let me tell you....I had the BEST customer service ever!!! I wasn't rushed at all. The dish I ordered had avocado in it and they ran out. Never fear!!!! They added a double portion of chicken and shrimp!! Yayyyyyyy!!! Please chk this place out. You won't be disappointed. Promise !!!!"}
{"text":"Always fast service and good food ! I love this place . I come here maybe 4 times a month and the ladies here always friendly. The lemonade is to die for. Try all there chicken rice dishes of my godddd delicious . I'm eating some orange chicken as I'm trying this !!!! I feel like Imma food coma. That's how good this place is every time I leave. The nose you'll spend for 2 is like 20 bux. Try it out, won't be dissappointed"}
{"text":"The food is good but the service is always terrible. Beef and basil should not have oyster sauce in it and charging $2 for meat ball for my choice of meat is utterly ridiculous! I've been to all the locations and the service is the same. Usually Thai people are nice, courteous and eager to please but not here or the Jones location. The original one in Chinatown was the best."}
{"text":"It's really 4.5 stars

I visit the one in chinatown all the time and since  this one is closer to home it gets 5 stars, I will admit the one in chinatown is better though. Even though it should be the same stuff the flavors are not as good as the one in chinatown, but since it's so close to home I will give it that extra star. 

Tried the calamari for the first time the other day and it was really good, portions of the calamari was a little small but I would gladly get a smaller portion of a great dish than a large portion of a bad dish. 

Service is always great."}
{"text":"i decided i was hooked on their penang curry and wanted to eat it again.  however, i got curious about their penang curry with avocado and salmon since i've read great reviews on it.  For my boyfriend, he got what he always gets, bbq chicken over fried rice.

 I am saddened to say that i will be giving the cook only 2 stars.  Ever had old fish and just know its old because of the strong fishy taste?  well that's exactly how my salmon tasted.  i know what salmon tastes like and fresh salmon does not have a strong fishy odor or fishy taste.  I just did not get the same experience as everyone else who's had this.  

As for my boyfriend's experience, well lets just saw that he wasn't as impressed as he was the past two times.  The fried rice was not as tasty and clearly looked like it was cooked in no more than a minute.  Of course i'm over exaggerating but its just not as great as china town location and the first time we ordered from here."}
{"text":"Cheap prices.great food..noodle dishes are what you order here"}
{"text":"I have been here 10+ times. My wife is from Thailand and we love coming here! Great service and food prices are very resonable. The employees work hard and are polite. Im getting hungry thinking about the place :) If you get a thai tea make sure they give the bigger cup I got the smaller cup a couple times and was dissapointed. I highly recommend giving this place a try!"}
{"text":"We were out shopping and wanted something a little different and had a craving for some soup or noodles. We decided  on a combination. I had b\never heard of this place but saw many 4 star reviews on YELP so we stopped in. As you arrive you are quickly greeted and seated. There were quite a few people in here and their bowls looked amazing. Looks like we made a great decision. Drink orders quickly taken (I LIKE THIS). We then looked over menu and decided on shrimp rolls as an appetizer. Very good choice on this nicely rolled flavorful and crunchy. Josie got the Chicken Noodle Soup minus the Tofu. I ordered the Roasted Duck Noodle Soup. They bring the spice on the side so you can heat it as you please. The duck soup had a salty earthy flavor I added to small spoon fulls of the Thai spice in the bowl they gave me. That added the bit of heat I needed and wanted. Josie enjoyed the Chicken Noodle said it filled her and warmed her on a brisk day in wintery Vegas. 

Everything here was on point. Service was excellent food was amazing. We will be back for the other Thai selections on this menu. If you are in area please try it you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Go to the one on jones instead, the food couldn't make up for the rude service from Keo and Meo at this location."}
{"text":"We first tried this through uber eats and loved it!..we like the orange chicken, pad see ew, and pad Thai!..we tried the curry also and it was good too but kinda small."}
{"text":"Yes ,this is #2 and sister to #1 on wynn, near chinatown.
I've found this place while driving by and decided on lunch and have been very happy find,as their lunch special are reasonable and a fair selection to chose from.. Sometimes they forget to give lunch menu, if they do ,just ask...I never had to wait to get in,as I have been there at several different times for lunch and brought friends the last time. Fyi I found if you order any noodle dish to go,they will end up clumpy,best to eat them in the restaurant.. I prefer the red curry, and found it very tasty and of course a glass of thai ice tea to cool off the spices,lol.. I did find I prefer this thai place,then the ones around the corner,which are a little more pricey...
Service has always been prompt and the only downfall is the napkin holder,which are not really napkin holder,but a small cup and I guess have to ask for any thai compliments for the table? I have yet to try #1,as last time there was a wait to get in and I was hungry and couldn't wait 30 mins...I prefer their 2 items lunch and will go back many times...yummy"}
{"text":"As an obsessed, official Duchess of the original location, I felt obligated to try #2! We sampled lunch, and for some reason, I wanted to sample something different, so I didn't go for my usual curry. I ordered up some stir fried broccoli. Yes, American broccoli. I love it, and I wanted it. The dish was very simple and fresh. The green goods in a light sauce, which was similar to a brown sauce you might get at a Chinese restaurant. Of course, they have brown rice, but they do charge a bit extra now (.75). 

One thing that I did discover on this trip was the assortment of Thai condiments in little glass jars on the table. I had never used them before, but I decided, \"Why the heck not?\" Good decision on my part, as I am a big fan of the jalapenos and will probably add them on to all of my future dishes at Thai Style. A couple of those on some brown rice and I could be pretty happy. Yes, I am officially a cheap date.

Of course, the thing to note is the beautiful, new interior, which is very different from the hole-in-the-wall style of the original. Each has its own charm. 

Service was great. We even saw some familiar faces from #1. From what I can tell, they are going to be able to maintain quality at both locations. There were a couple of bumps while they were getting in new chefs for both locations, but based on my recent visits, both spots seem to be on the right track for tastiness!"}
{"text":"Thai food is quick to cook...the technique takes longer to master!  Wouldn't recommend"}
{"text":"Yummy veggie noodle soup... Veggie spring rolls and shrimp rolls are delicious... Lightly fried... Glad my family enjoyed it and they say that Vegas doesn't have good thai food.."}
{"text":"Really good curry. Second time I have been here. First time I got a red curry and second green curry."}
{"text":"Great food low prices, what more could you ask for?! everything is excellent and authentic. We always get the duck fried rice and chicken pad se-eu."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and other locations as well but this one tops them all. I love the customer service and the food seems to be a lot more tasty here. I made a to-go order of calamari, spicy eggplant with chicken, spicy basil with beef, and crab fried rice! Oooh, did I get your mouth all watery just yet??? Everything was cooked to the tee, flavored so well, and just on point! We've also tried the pad Thai and papaya salad which always hits home! If you're craving for Thai food, this is the place to be! Unbeatable prices for the portions you get and definitely worth every bite!"}
{"text":"I decided to check it out because of the reviews and honestly probably one of the worst thai food I. 've ever had. I ordered the pumpkin yellow curry and it tasted like salt and no spices. Also, I could tell it's been sitting in the back for a while and was just continuously reheated due to that the potato's were mashed into the sauce. The reason I am giving two starts is because the service was really good and big portions.

Pros: Big portion, great service
Cons: Yellow curry"}
{"text":"I gave it a 2 star  because of the ff:

1. Server - friendly 
2. Ambiance - okay
3. Wait - we waited for 30 minutes for our food 
4. Food - 2 star ( I ordered pork bbq with papaya salad) pork bbq is good, but papaya is really spicy for 7. My husband ordered combination soup which is alright. 
5. Price - okay"}
{"text":"So my review could be a little skewed because I'm pregnant and starving BUT here's what happened: driving home from work, it suddenly dawns on me that I NEED something spicy. I Yelp places nearby and the word 'Thai' won me over. I call to order Drunken Noodles to go and pleasantly surprised it's ready just as I walk in! I could not have handed her my card any faster. Spork in the bag? Check. I speed walked to my car and OMG. It smells so good. I didn't wanna eat it all in the car but... I just couldn't stop. I mean, I'm eating for two so whatevs I own't judge me. Oh and on the way out, I was casually eyeing people's food and I saw some kind of soup that looked mouthwatering so you betta believe I'll be back. Moral of the story: So good I'm still sitting in my car to write about it."}
{"text":"Dined here for the first time maybe a moth ago and experience was great. Food was delicious and had a street food quality to it. Servers were nice and food came out fairly quick. We had no complaints.

2 nights ago, I called in for a pick up order and the gentleman who took our order was very rude. We were still deciding what we wanted to get and he was very impatient and had a negative tone while taking our order - we almost changed our minds and cancelled our order, but we were in a rush and already on our way to the restaurant. When I got there, I tried to pay with 2 credit cards and he wouldn't let me. When we dined inside, we paid with 2 cards no problem. Our receipt said his name was Victor. 

Our food was great, just the customer service from this one employee was terrible. Go for the food, just avoid Victor."}
{"text":"Great food and great staff , I have been coming here since it opened and each time the food and service has always  been great . There was a time I ordered to go and they said it would be finished in 15 minutes but couldn't get there till almost 35 minutes later but when I got there they told me they remade my food because it was getting cold , thats probably one of the first time a restaurant has ever done that for me haha . But anyways the staff is friendly and the food / portions are great . One thing I would suggest is getting new furniture or maybe new seats because the seats are starting to look a little gross but besides that great over all 5/5"}
{"text":"They had great chicken pad thai and their pad sew (sp?) in black bean sauce was ok. My sister loves it, me I prefer the pad thai instead. I was told they're known for good food/poor service but to be honest i didnt experience any bad service. I also liked the fact that the prices were great and the food portion was enough to share/take home. Overall, I was pleased with my experience. Thank you."}
{"text":"My number one Thai restaurant in Vegas. I usually get vegetable noodle soup with the small rice noodle, pad see ew, pad Thai, spicy beef noodle soup.... top down with flavors that can not go wrong and the employees are always so helpful and friendly. They even remember who I am and honestly sometimes I think I'm there waaaayyy to often.... I should stop but can't help myself!!!"}
{"text":"This place is horrible now with the new owners. The take out order are not what you order because the lady who took the order wrote it down wrong. I called to explain what was missing (a piece of fried chicken) and she told me to come all the way back and pay for it when I already did. I told her to just make the chicken and I swing by to pick it up but no she demands me to pay or nothing. I asked her for her name and to speak to the owners and she refused and hung up on me. Totally rude and horrible customer service. My family used to eat her every two weeks and notice that food tasted different lately and now we know why."}
{"text":"Been a while since we were in.  Cannot recall the last time, but things have changed.  The menu for one, it's not the same. Now I hear they have a new location.  

We made our usual selections, started with a yellow curry.  Chicken, the pieces were tender, the veggies, onion, potato, bell pepper, cut just the right size, and the curry, not to overwhelming with coconut milk, pretty good. 

I love eggplant and to please me, we ordered the spicy eggplant.  The eggplant is sauteed and is cooked well, there is a little hint of basil and thai chile, so not too spicy.  

And finally we got a noodle, I don't remember the name, it was a flat Noodle and came with chicken, egg, green onion and bean sprouts.  it was good."}
{"text":"Fast and friendly service.  

Although not on the menu we requested tofu with our meals and they were happy to add it. 

We ordered the vegaterian egg rolls Delish 
I ate soup and my husband beans,  friend tofu and rice.  Both were good. 

Price point was awesome
Our meals came to 20$ for two entrées and a appetizer 

We would go back again"}
{"text":"They always deliver good food for a very fair price. The service is good too. Not the best thai food I've ever had but overall they're good."}
{"text":"The is food great!  All dishes have a good ratio of meat & vegetables.  If you're new to this restaurant, they do give great suggestions.  For the vegetarians out there, they have a vegetarian menu that they don't normally present unless you request it.  I absolutely love the vegetarian items.  Must haves are tofu larb and fresh ginger with steamed tofu.  Be sure to finish off with mango sticky rice."}
{"text":"Food is good and cheap. Service was bad. We order beef and they have us chicken. We told the waitress and she said oh but chicken is good right? Wtf! Service there is always bad but food are so good. Guess they don't care about customers service at all."}
{"text":"I usually go to the 'Thai Style Noodle House' on Jones because I love their thai fried rice.
So when I found out that there was a Thai Style Noodle House closer to my house, I had to go!

I came in with my mom and dad for dinner. I ordered (of course) the bbq pork fried rice with an egg on top, my mom ordered the pad thai, and my dad ordered the mongolian beef.

I've never actually dined in at Thai Noodle House since I usually take out and bring it to work, so this was my first time and let me just say the portion for the fried rice is huge! You can definitely share it among a couple people. 
I was super satisfied with the bbq pork portion as well! Their fried rice wasn't super greasy like other thai places' tend to be.

For dessert we ordered the sticky rice with mango and this was a real winner for me. I highly recommend it! It's warm sweet sticky rice with a heavy cream on top and mango on the side.
I won't be able to come here without getting it, I can tell you that."}
{"text":"Always eat here with Co-workers for lunch but will never go back. We called to place a order and we decided to have it delivered. The lady taking the order was going to charge the two of us ordering separate delivery charges and had attitude when asked why! Never again will we eat here again, so disappointed.."}
{"text":"Delicious, cheap Thai food! I've been to the Chinatown location, but I think this location definitely is less crowded, looks newer/cleaner, and has better service.  It may be that I'm not observant but I don't remember the other location having duck as an option for the noodle dishes.  Pad see ew with duck is definitely better than the beef, chicken, etc options.  The tender slices of roast duck are nicely seasoned.  We also tried some appetizers, the crispy calamari is fried to perfection.  The fried chicken wings were disappointing, fried until they were slightly jerky in texture and no crispy crunch to the outside =(.  But overall, great place with great food....and helps that it's a few doors down from Sweet Addictions! Definitely head over there for an ice cream sandwich dessert!"}
{"text":"This is my most favorite spot to eat Thai! The cost is so affordable and everything I've eaten I've been happy with. The staff could be friendlier but all in all its great! I've taken a lot of friends and family members here and they all love it as well. We are extremely sad though that they've stopped their lunch specials!!! Super sad about that."}
{"text":"Good little impromptu stop for Thai food! My friend got pumpkin curry and I got chicken pad Thai. Mine was delicious but on the spicy side for my English pallet. They gave me a free Thai iced tea to sooth my mouth which was not necessary but very thoughtful. My friend very much enjoyed her dish and that says a lot as a vegan curry connoisseur. We will be back! And I will ask for less hot haha!!"}
{"text":"I was really pleased with our trip to this spot.  The restaurant was really cute, the service was exceptional, and the food was great.  
The Tom Kha was probably the best I've had in Vegas.  The flavor was spot on.  The Pad See Eu really stood out as well.  It ties for my favorite with The King and I (at The Lakes).  
I'm removing one star because the dish my boyfriend ordered (a flat noodle dish, with chicken, and Thai style gravy) was really gross.  I don't know if it just wasn't our thing...but this was something else.  The gravy was...abundant, and slimy.  I tried to give this a shot after refrigeration, when the gravy \"settled\", but it still looked very visually off-putting, and really didn't taste that great.  
Other than the one disappointing dish, our visit went great.  I'm sure we'll be back."}
{"text":"My review is probably closer to a 3.5 than a 4, but since Yelp does not permit 1/2 stars, I did not want to unfairly punish the place by only giving it 3 stars. For a quick and delicious lunch or dinner, this place does it right.  The curry with duck is my fav."}
{"text":"I love Thai food. But every time I come here I always order one thing: the combination beef noodle soup! Its sooo good. And on rainy days, its even better. If you're thinking its like beef pho, it is not. Its much more hearty and savory. I don't know anyone else tried it and disliked it. Its also called a \"boat noodle\". Yum.

The hubby always orders his favorite dish too. The chicken and shrimp silver noodle. Its so refreshing. Light but full of flavor too. I highly recommend this dish as well. 

Their prices are also extremely decent for their quality. No need to go to an expensive Thai restaurant when you can get it all here.

I'll keep coming back!"}
{"text":"I love this place . There food is very good . They have a number customer service . It's always good I usually try to go to this place once a week . They also have really good Thai tea and there orange chicken is so light  that you taste the chicken instead of the bread"}
{"text":"Great food with great time management. I come here kind of often but this time, the service was S H I T. The neglected and I find it very unprofessional when the employees are eating right in front of us.

It's a bit small but most of the time the place is vacant

I ordered the bbq Chicken over fried rice and it is one of my fav dish on the menu. It's delicious with the sauce!! ($6.95)
Rating- 8.9

Also I got the Panang curry spicy 5. I wish there was more green peppers and meat rather than sauce. It's enough to fill one to two people. ($6.95)
Rating- 7.7

Definitely give this plAce a try if you're into thai food :)"}
{"text":"This is our go-to for quick, yet delicious Thai take out! They have an extensive menu and the staff is always very nice."}
{"text":"Great Pad see eu for the price! Also accommodated my request for no msg, sugar and fish sauce. Nice people"}
{"text":"Place is decently price and delicious. Came here for dinner and enjoyed my experience. Place was empty, but it was 9pm which is pretty late for dinner. I ordered the chicken skewers, tum yum soup, pad thai, and duck fried rice. The chicken skewers (#10 on the menu) were good, above average. I enjoyed eating it with the peanut sauce. The tum yum soup was also above average. I would of liked it with some rice, I liked it but wasn't blown away. I'm a big fan of pad thai but was unimpressed with the dish here. It wasn't bad but I had better at random Thai restaurants. The duck fried rice was delicious and my favorite dish of the night. Definitely a must try. Overall, I had a good dinner and was happy to try this place. I definitely recommend trying it once."}
{"text":"Awesome food. My toddlers loved the fried chicken (thin strips) and fried rice. I had the spicy Thai noodle with 5 out of 10 spicy and really enjoyed it. We also ordered WooChee salmon and the 3 spice sauce was crazy yummy. 
It is a small casual, mompop kind of place. Service was friendly.  We will be coming back regularly."}
{"text":"So my friend took me here because they have really good fried rice dishes and soups. The duck fried rice was super yummy. The first star was lost because our first dish with sticky rice was way too small for the price.. you would probably have to order 10 of those to get full. It's the dish photographed. It tasted great, just very small for the price. The other minus was for the service, I don't think the server we had spoke a word of English. She just came and dropped off stuff. For example when she came with extra plates for me and my friend she just dumped them on the table paired instead of placing them on mine and his side. Will go back to try their Tom Ka soup but not because of the service."}
{"text":"The broth and meat was delicious. The only problem I had was a surplus of bean sprouts and not enough noodles. Everything else was amazing!"}
{"text":"Solid Thai restaurant. I had the avocado curry with shrimp. Their medium is actually close to what I'd say is a medium, unlike many places that go light on spice. The dish is a good deal for the price too, not overly large but sufficiently filling, and the flavor is solid. I was also satisfied with the service. I'd go back again."}
{"text":"I'm so glad we came here! Food was awesome!!! We ordered the Thai fried rice,  wonton soup and the pad Thai ; all dishes were great. Clean flavors, fresh and perfectly seasoned! Service was good too. The young girl who helped us was very nice, same with the young guy. The older lady, maybe the manager or owner, not as friendly but I think maybe she is just too focused in the business. Prices are ridiculously low, less than $7 for most dishes. Highly recommend it !"}
{"text":"Fish Cake appetizer with a sweet sauce - fabulous!  

Roasted Duck Noodle Soup - so delicious!  Broth is dark with loads of flavour.  Garnish of garlic chips for garlic lovers!  Instead of a bowl, it was served in a deep casserole dish.  Different.

Rad Na - Fried Rice Noodles with Chinese Brocolli and Beef in a brown gravy sauce - it was okay for me.  The sauce was on the thick side.   

The restaurant is very casual.  The owner was very friendly."}
{"text":"So my friend and I have had lunch here 3 times.... Food is actually very good and prices affordable, but the SERVICE is HORRIBLE!! Your afraid to even ask for utensils. The last server we had was a male and he had a personality of a chopstick. When you asked for anything he looked at us like we were ridiculous for asking for napkins (hence nothing was on the tables... no utensils, napkins, condiments).  I know it's just lunch but it is a sit down place n you are paying gratuity, make some effort to make your customers feel comfortable while eating at your establishment;("}
{"text":"There's a ton of Thai restaurants to choose from, but this place is not too shabby. Service is great, and the food has been good so far. 

Appetizer combo platter- 4 star. You can get a taste of the crab rangoon, fried tofu (wasn't a fan), egg rolls (kinda like the plain veggie style at panda), fried shrimp (delicious), chicken satay (amazing). I think it's a nice platter to get a taste and all for $8.95 or so. 

Noodle soup with chicken and bean sprouts in chicken broth - 5 star. I got it with flat noodles. Spice level 7. Delicious!

Crispy pork and chinese broccoli- 3 star. The pork tasted a bit off, and it could have been crispier. I've had better, but wasn't too bad. 

Spicy seafood fried rice- 4 star. 

Pad See Ew- 4 star.

Glass noodle salad- 4.5 star.  It's clear noodles tossed in lime. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Missing my Thai noodle joint in LA. If you're ever around the area- hit up Pa Ord Noodle in E. Hollywood... The BEST soups.... So good, after I ate the meat and noodles; I wanted to drink the bowl of soup! That broth is good.....

With that high expectation.... Thai Style Noodle House didn't meet it. Don't get me wrong TSNH is good! But it's not Pa Ord.

TSNH's portion is very generous (love it!),  the decor is clean, service is friendly and they also deliver within a 3 mile radius.

Overall 3.5 stars, good food, good service, and good prices- I'll go for another round."}
{"text":"Papaya salad...delicious!  Love the soups and my husband says the mongolian beef is the best he has ever had.  The fried rice is amazing!  The pad thai is not so great but I can live without as long as I have other great items which I do!  The Thai iced tea is delicious!  This place is so affordable it's awesome!"}
{"text":"BEST noodles I've ever had! This is my new go-to place for my noodle cravings! And super friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Recently I ordered take out here and I was greeted immediately when I walked in. The wait time for my food was less then 15 minutes and I was out that door. I ordered the Pad See Eww- it was delicious, Fried Pork with Chinese broccoli- never disappoints me, squid salad and somtum was not what I expected. I always ask for the squid salad to be less sweet and more on the sour side but they can't seem to make it sour enough. 

As for the Somtum I requested it to be made Lao style with 1 Thai pepper which would be enough spice for me and asked for it to be extra sour. Well it wasn't sour, and I think they skipped on the pepper or didn't use real Thai chili pepper/prik ki nou. It really makes a difference on the type of chili you use. 

Overall, the food is still great and the prices are the best in town!!"}
{"text":"I agree with one reviewer here, there has been a bunch of Thai restaurants popping up all over Ft. Apache lately and I've tried most of them and so far my favorite is still Archie's, UNTIL I found this place!

I called and ordered take out and the food is ready in 15 minutes.
Everything was delicious and just the right amount of spice.
I usually order a 2 spice level and most of the time it will be way too hot but not this place, they got it just right.

I ordered:
SIlver Noodle Salad, Thai Fried Rice with Chicken, Thai Spice Noodle with Beef, and Yellow Curry and my total was $29! It's the cheapest Thai restaurant around here and the food is delicious and very generous portions, what more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Really like this place! The soups and noodles are great. I specially like tom kha and beef noodle soup. Fried rice is wicked too. Pineapple rice is delicious.

I have a weird habit of having dinner here after a long day in the office. Soups are healthy, big, and cheap. Best meal under $10!"}
{"text":"The food was absolutely delicious. And very very reasonably priced. Everything I ate was just spectacular. I was feeling a bit ill so I ordered a soup. I wasn't disappointed."}
{"text":"Pork jerky...check...
Reasonable price...check...
Overall a decent meal for a decent price...I've had better..but will definitely come back for the pork jerky...service is good too, so definitely worth trying."}
{"text":"I really liked the Thai Red Curry (Seafood) I ordered from this place. The price was good, too, something like $8.50. It was just perfect.

Howeverrrr.....

It was just me & hubby at the resto when we walked in. Our server had a lot of time to do things between taking our order & serving our food.

He chose to spend his spare time cleaning the fish tank. Using his hands. I should have taken a photo of the fish tank, its water brown & murky. I'm pretty sure that water had fish cr** in it, plus other contaminants & I dunno, possibly diseases. I didn't see our server wash his hands after cleaning the tank. He just wiped them with napkins. Sorry, I just thought that was really unsanitary :/"}
{"text":"Haven't gone here in a long time and I have to say things haven't changed. 

I decided to see if it had gotten any better, I am referring to the service. it doesn't matter who you get they are all equally terrible and rude. This will be my very last visit here since nothing will ever change. 

I ordered a Thai Chai tea with milk (cold version). The lady delivers my drink and I tasted it and it was pure sugar you couldn't taste anything else but sugar! On prior occasions this was not the case! I asked her to take it back and add more milk less Thai tea. So she brings it back but no change at all even after adding more milk. So after taking one sip I told her I could not drink it and she actually had the $&@;! to tell me not to order it again that it would always be like that. She was lecturing me like a child and for the sake of not making a usual scene like I would if I was alone. This time I was quiet and didn't talk back. 

So it's safe to say if you like crappy service and being lectured just go here!"}
{"text":"Was so hungry after work, thank goodness they were still open.  I ordered the beef pad see ew, and the pork fried rice. Loved them both.  Lots of beef tender noodles and just the right spices.  The fried rice was great , since I have been craving thai fried rice oppose to chinese fried rice. Great service and great food.  Will be going back for more."}
{"text":"I haven't had Thai Style Noodle House in quite some time, but after a great day off with one of my best friend's we decided we were in the mood for Thai food. We initially decided to head to Archi's, but ended up at Thai Style last minute. 

Prices are always great here and service is good too. Since the weather is cold and I've been battling a cold, spicy was what I was craving. I went with the spicy Thai noodles and asked for a level 6 spice level. Everything was just as good as I remember and the spice level was right on mark. I didn't go too spicy since noodles tend to absorb the heat a little more than other Thai dishes. Everything was great and it made me wonder why I don't come here more often. Definitely great prices and great food in the Southwest area."}
{"text":"I went here twice in a row in two days for dinner and both times I broke out in hives on my face, hands and chest. This is the only thing I've done the same the past two days. I had vegetarian panang curry and vegetarian egg rolls both times. This is enough for me to never eat here again (I am a customer who has come back 10+ times,) but after witnessing multiple health code violations on top of this, I will never come back. 

The health code violations are: 1) eating and not washing hands before serving food, 2) putting fingers and/or thumbs inside of a serving dish 3) not wearing proper hair nets when preparing or serving food (I have found hairs in my food or the food of my friends while eating here)

It seems like this place is going downhill fast. 

DO NOT EAT HERE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This is now my favorite thai place. ive been going here three times and never fails me. The price for their food is very reasonable. Dont go without trying their sticky rice for dessert, its very yummy!! I would recommend this place to all my friends and family"}
