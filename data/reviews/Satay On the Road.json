{"text":"Very middle of the road Thai food. Having been to thailand, enjoying the holy host of curries, noodle dishes and meats bursting with flavor, i make it my business to find the top notch Thai places in toronto, Golden Thai being a favorite of mine. Satay on the Road however is more of a \"if your in the area, come and enjoy some\" kind of place. Living just a few blocks away, i find myself with my friends, frequenting this place more often than we should for the convenience. The pad thai is horrendous compared to many other places in toronto. A sickly sweet tomato taste, with the massive portion size trying to make you forget you are eating the most sub par pad thai south of Bayview. The portion sizes are really the only thing that justify spending money on the rather pricey menu. The spring rolls, are passable, but the taste is like no other spring roll i have ever had before, and im not saying that as a good thing. I often find myself quadruple dipping in the thai dipping sauce to increase the appeal of the rolls. Spicy Crispy Beef, another common pick, is, well....good. There is alot of beef, not so much crispy as savoury. I will likely return back some day to test some more menu items, but i dont find myself rushing, and i would urge you not to rush yourself. The dwindling crowd seems to speak for itself."}
{"text":"If you're the kind of person that thinks chicken balls and fortune cookies are a good and delicious example of authentic Chinese food then you would not be disappointed with the quality of \"Thai\" food being served here. Ordered Pad Thai and spring rolls. The pad Thai should actually be renamed as \"spaghetti with ketchup\" on their menu. As for the spring rolls I've had better coming out of a box in the frozen food aisle at the grocery store. Quite possibly the worst Thai food I had in Toronto. I couldn't eat more than a few bites (and I'm not one to waste food)."}
{"text":"Recently purchase a Groupon for 4 , visited with friends today , the choice they provided  were good . Try what the server recommended the crispy dragon Ball , it was actually very nice . The cashew nut chicken was delicious, food was enough for all , yet my friend order from the 5.99 special ( Singapore noodle and drunken noodle ) drunken noodle was something different but was OK .   Overall experience was good . Will definitely recommend my friends and will be back ."}
{"text":"We ordered delivery from here last night, hoping to find a new Thai place we enjoyed.  Our order was extremely uncomplicated: Pad Thai, Veggie Curry, Veg Spring Rolls, Mango Sticky Rice dessert.  The good news:  The veg spring rolls were tasty, and the veggie curry was also good and nicely spiced.   The average news: The customer service was serviceable - no problems. 1 hour delivery, which is fairly par for the course for Thai food.  The bad news:  1)Mango Sticky Rice dessert was the worst I've come across. I'm not sure if they forgot to sweeten it, but it was pretty much just plain sticky rice, with about a dozen 1/2\" flakes of mango on top, with a sprinkling of coconut shreds, and a maraschino cherry. It was also extremely dense and it was hard to exert a bit of effort to make my fork actually penetrate it to dig out pieces to take a bite. I had three bites hoping that as I got further down, maybe it would get sweeter, or softer, or anything to make it better. It didn't happen. Really disappointing.  2) The Pad Thai was terrible. My boyfriend took two bites and quit. It was mostly dry noodles, with just a tiny touch of sauce. Because my curry did not come with rice (I realize some places make you order rice seperate, which is annoying, so I only blamed myself for not remembering to ask if I needed to order rice), I tried to use some of his noodles, and I am vegetarian so I went to pick out the bits of meat and seafood. I was SHOCKED - in the whole order there were 2 shrimp, and 2 very small 1\" pieces of chicken. Also about 4 small cubes of tofu. All the rest was just try noodles **barely** tinted pinky-orange by the ridiculously small amount of sauce.  Needless to say, we'll never be ordering from Satay on the Road again. I mean, Pad Thai and mango sticky rice is pretty easy. Some places make AMAZING stuff, most places it's serviceable - rarely is it not worth taking 2 bites as it was here."}
{"text":"This place is my family's favorite place to eat when were feeling like Thai food. The service is pretty great, and everyone is very friendly. My family and I probably come here close to 3-4 times a month. I would suggest to try the Chili Garlic Chicken, Spicy Crispy Beef, Penang Curry, Cashew Nut Chicken (all ordered with a bowl of steamed white rice of course), and for desert, you must try the deep fried banana with ice cream!"}
{"text":"Came here last week on Thursday to pick up dinner. When I called and ordered 4 different dishes they told me it'd only take 10 minutes which was surprisingly quick.  When I got there around 8:00 pm the place was pretty empty. The latest customers dining in just left and the waitress was cleaning off their table.  As I waited for them to finish packing my food, I happened to notice that the waitress was creating a collection of leftover food the other customers left on a counter by the bar. She grabbed a leftover piece of fried appetizer from an unfinished plate and tried to shiftly eat it thinking I would not notice. I gave her the benefit of the doubt and thought maybe I mistakenly took the leftovers as food that was already there but as I watched her closely, she began to empty leftover desserts (some sort of ice cream) into a styrofoam container, grabbed a spoon (previously used by the latest diners) and took a huge spoonful of leftover ice cream (or whatever it was) and shoved it in her mouth!  I was so appalled and second guessed the food I was about to take home but it was late and we were starving. I thought her coworker would have at least said something or noticed and given an odd response to what he was witnessing her doing but it just seemed like this was a normal thing. Either way, it is highly unprofessional and disgusting!!   The food is decent but if this sort of stuff happens at the front of the house (the whole conception of \"not wasting food\") and is accepted, I can just imagine what it's like in the kitchen!!  Will not be dining here again thinking that someone is just waiting to dig into my leftovers and perhaps catch my cold by using the same utensils."}
{"text":"Went here with family for dinner. There is new management in place and They are very friendly and the service is really good.   we got house platter, pad thai, curry chicken, cashew fried rice. Overall the food was great and prices were very reasonable.   would recommend this plce to family and friends."}
{"text":"Went here for a friend's birthday on a Sunday recently. I am impressed with the decor and the atmosphere of the place but the food...not so much.  A few of my friends and I ordered the favourite Pad Thai. After a few bites, we all realized that the tofu had a rotten taste. I thought it was just my dish but 2 other friends had the same problem. Rotten food = trip to the bathroom...I'm very thankful I wasn't rushing for the toilet. Also authentic Pad Thai have a brown look to it. This one was way too red and the chef had used too much ketchup.  One thing I appreciated was they gave my friend a birthday dessert for free which looked delicious.   I would only go here for dessert and drinks."}
{"text":"So far, this is the best Thai delivery I've had in Toronto, and I've tried all of them that deliver to my area (just north of Danforth).  What seems to set them apart is a certain level of authenticity and a wider variety of menu options.  I've ordered twice already and based on my experiences, Satay On The Road is my new default for ordering Thai delivery. I'm not, by any means, an expert in Thai food, but I've tried many places and it seems that many of them taste very similar.  The exact same menus, and the same western-friendly flavours.  There are a few exceptions (Pi Thom, Salad King/Linda), and this may be worthy of going on that list.  Take, for example, the mango salad.  It was crunchy, the mango still a bit green and under-ripe, the way you see it in Thailand, in travel shows, not yellow, sweet and ripe like most places in Toronto serve.  It was a small touch, but every item in both meals I've had so far seemed to be full of those small details that when summed up, made a huge difference. The menu variety is impressive, as, for example it has two different eggplant dishes in the vegetable section.  It has the same old Thai Style Eggplant that all Thai restaurants are serving, but it also has the Makuer Yaow Siam: Eggplant Siam Style, which is made with minced pork and whole shrimp.  It was so good, I had to have it the second time, and I think it's become one of those dishes I'll order every time I get food from here. I also loved the grilled, marinated chicken, which came with a sweet sauce to drizzle over. The Sambal Shrimp was very tasty as well.   I really love the pork dishes on the menu.  Many Toronto Thai restaurants don't have good pork dishes, but these guys do it right.  Both the spicy noodle with pork and the basil pork that I had were moist and delicious.   We also tried the satay combination, which was an impressive amount of food - great if you can't make up your mind.  I wasn't crazy about every single one of the many satays that I tried, but I was glad I had it so now I'll know which ones to order a la carte (chicken, squid, lamb). The Pad Thai was good, though pretty standard (not overly bright in colour/food colouring).  I appreciate that the default choice is shrimp and chicken - I hate when restaurants split up that classic Pad Thai combination. The ginger chicken was spicy and comforting - brought me back to the glory days of Green Mango at Yonge and Bloor. Of the appetizers, the calamari is very tender and crispy - worth getting.  All of the spring rolls are very good, as expected.  The soft shell crab was good, but not great, though in fairness, the soft shell crab season had just ended, so in my mind, they got a pass.   The one thing we didn't like was the Golden Baskets, which were like palm-sized phyllo dough-like thin baskets, filled with chicken, carrots, nuts, bamboo shoots and herbs, but ended up tasting like a fistful of greasy, deep-fried peanuts.  Sadly, these are included in the appetizer \"House Platter\", which I usually like to order at other places, but these Golden Baskets are displeasing enough for me to just order other apps a la carte.  I've never eaten in, or even passed by Satay On The Road on Bayview, so I really can't speak to the atmosphere, cleanliness or level of service.  Though, I went to the Avenue and Eglinton location about a decade ago and remember it being charming and full of regular customers.  As far as delivery goes, they've done a very good job so far.  If you want to phone, you can find a monthly special offer on their website, or if you're like me and you'd rather order online, they're on just-eat.ca! One time, we ordered the Chicken Wing appetizer and they called right away to say that they'd run out and that they were very sorry.  They gave us a complimentary order of spring rolls! Delivery time was very good.  The first order came in about 45 minutes, and the second order arrived in less than 30 (despite the chicken wing snafu)! The take-out containers they use are good quality, and they're good at separating the hot and cold items, and keeping the fried foods crispy.  If you live in the area and you're thinking of ordering Thai delivery, I would highly recommend Satay On The Road."}
{"text":"My pad Thai here was great! I loved the peanut lime sauce. I can't comment on any other menu item, but if you're looking for pad Thai, this is a good place!"}
{"text":"What can I say. A year ago this review would have been a 5/5 but not anymore. Ordered delivery last night. Fried rice was good, curry Iyam was ok, Red curry beef had chewy pieces of beef throughout but the most disappointing and worst tasting dish was the Pad Thai. I've had Pad Thai from this place on and off for over ten years but last nights had to be the worst ever. What happened? I hate to say it but their standard of quality has dropped considerably. Why? I only hope someone from the restaurant see's all the poor reviews they are getting and strives to improve on it. Don't force me to go further out from my hood to get good Thai food."}
{"text":"Their malay fried noodles are incredible. The staff are very nice and attentive. We've been here a few times and plan to continue coming!"}
{"text":"I've ordered through Just-eat, and it was disgusting food. Had to throw it out as we couldn't finish them. Total waste of money"}
{"text":"satay on the road has been one of my family's favorite restaurants since i was a kid. i remember coming here when i was ten and ordering the same thing that i get now, ten years later: cashew nut chicken with an order of steamed rice and the shrimp chips with peanut sauce.   first of all, the food tastes delicious. i think there's been one or two times out of the hundreds of visits to this place where the food tasted a little spicier than usual but other than that, it's been consistently amazing for close to a decade. i've had cashew nut chicken at other thai restaurants and it just doesn't compare. i can't speak about most of their other food but from what i've experienced they've been by far the best tasting thai restaurant in and around toronto.   the wait staff is quick and friendly for the most part which is great.   the atmosphere of the restaurant is nice... they just re-did it and although i have to say i prefer the original decor which had an authentic thai feel to it, their modern, contemporary approach to their new \"look\" is very pleasing to the eyes and enjoyable to dine at as well.   the value of the food is great. my girlfriend and i come here for their lunch special almost every week at least once and have a full meal with a drink that leaves us satisfied for both taste and hunger for usually under $10, 15% tip included. how can you beat that? really.   not to mention, you can order shrimp chips and peanut sauce as an appetizer while you wait for your meal, at no charge. i have yet to find another thai restaurant in toronto that has that.   five stars to my favorite thai place since i was ten. i was happy to see that they expanded and opened another store on bayview. good for them!"}
{"text":"They messed up my order.  I called.  Owner shouted at me and hung up.  He threatened to call police on me when i asked for a refund (for food they forgot to put in the bag. Do not go here.  The owner/manager is a bully and their portions are small."}
{"text":"Oh was disappointed after hearing good things.  The papaya salad dressing was tasteless (but it was fresh).  The satays tasted like yesterday's leftovers - dry and old.  MUCH better places in TO - Thai places on Bloor trump this place!!  Never returning.  Staff was nice."}
{"text":"I'm sad to say I'll never be back.  sad, because i saw a bunch of awards were given to this place by the city of Toronto for a \"wonderful dining experience and exceptional food\" and i was anticipating a great meal.  the only good thing about this place is prices.  service needs a lot of improvement. (took the waitress 20 mins to come up to us after we were seated and it wasn't even busy)  food is very bland.  we ordered the appetizer platter and were told that due to the fryer being broken we wont get calamari but we will get an additional spring roll (which didn't happen). the tastiest thing on the appetizer plate was the peanut sauce, which we had to drench everything in since everything else was very blah.  i ordered pad Thai and it was a mass of semi translucent noodles with very tasteless chicken and shrimp. (Great Pad Thai's can be found at Pi Toms at Yonge and Alexander - truly an amazing experience)  my companion ordered Thai fried rice and he said the dish had no flavour.   i love a good Thai restaurant (there are so many in Toronto!) but sadly this wasn't one of them.  its a shame this place sucks. i just bought a bunch of \"groupons\" to this place... will have to find someone who enjoys this place at least somewhat or lives near by so i can pass those on to them.   i also wonder how did they get all those awards."}
{"text":"Great taste and generous portions.  We had two very large bowls of soup (the Coconut mushroom soup was so comforting) and followed up with Spicy Fish and a beef dish. Everything was very good.  Will definitely revisit multiple times as long as the quality keeps up. Btw, our server was very nice but alas, I can't remember her name."}
{"text":"Visited them again today for dinner. Food was terrible tonight. The hot and sour soup was too sour and too spicy. The spring rolls weren't as good as last time. Wife had Thai green curry. First time it came as too salty. We requested to change it, they just added some water in it and sent it back. I had Thai spicy noodles and they were terrible. The chicken seemed very old. It had a funny taste. The noodles were also too soft. After tonight's experience, I'm not going back again. The only reason for two star review is that we had a pretty good experience last time, otherwise food today deserved 1 star only."}
{"text":"I have eaten at this restaurant many times and ordered the Thai Lemon Chicken Soup as usual. From the moment the waitress placed the bowl on the table I could tell it was going to be different - and not in a good way. The bowl was bulging with huge chunks of rotten mushroom and underneath this mound there was hardly any broth. It was the crudest soup I've ever seen. I tried some of it and informed the waitress that it was easily the most disgusting Thai soup I'd ever had (and I've had a lot). I pointed out that I should not be charged for the soup which cost $7.45. She talked to the chef who assured her that the mushrooms were not rotten and that he'd just boiled them. Why boil them if they were fresh? Also, why then were all of the white mushrooms clearly covered in black mold? As if to insinuate that I was the problem, she indicated that another customer had had the soup and thought it was okay. In any case, she agreed not to charge me. Any Thai soup I've ever had in the past was a delicate broth with finely cut meats and vegetables. I also had the Cashew Nut Chicken, which was okay. I noted that it had been prepared with seven chili peppers, yet was not at all spicy.  At other Thai restaurants this dish is usually served with three chili peppers at most, which made me wonder whether they might be recycling the peppers - particularly after reading another Yelp review which mentioned that a waitress at the same restaurant had been seen eating food left over by the customers. It's unfortunate, but a change in chef can truly break a restaurant. Needless to say I will not be back."}
{"text":"The only thing going for this restaurant is that it has outside seating.    The Eggplant had nothing other than Eggplant - what?  I've never seen anything like this before.  The cold rolls had a piece of sliced egg in them - ugghhh!    The lettuce that comes with the lettuce wraps was crispy and edible, but, the minced chicken was oversalted.  Someone we spoke to at a nearby restaurant recommended 'Riz' which we shall go to next time"}
{"text":"Below-average Thai food. Started with vegetarian cold rolls that were mostly stuffed with rice noodles, hardly any veggies. Shared a few mains: veggie pad Thai (smelled like ketchup, tasted pretty gross), cashew chicken (good but very sauce heavy), egg fried rice (bland and dry), and spicy eggplant (the best dish we tried).   Service was good and quick, but doesn't make up for the food."}
{"text":"Myself & my guest enjoyed the food.   I had the ribs (I know it's an odd choice), but they were very good, and the side salad (with strips of mango) was really quite good.   I must say though, that I found that it had better ambience after the sun went down. Not sure why....  I would go back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"This used to be our go to Thai takeout years ago.  In recent years it hasn't been as good as it once was.  Today we dined in with a Groupon.  We were surprised to be given a Groupon specific menu when the fine print did not state that this was how it was to be served.  The Thai lemon chicken soup had a nice flavour.  Spring rolls are still decent.  The pad Thai was a little bland and the Thai basil chicken rice we added on was under seasoned and bland.  My husband got a Thai iced tea but he said it was watered down.  Maybe we're more accustomed to better establishments with similar offerings that are now available.  Don't know if we'd go back or order takeout again unless really desperate for something closeby."}
{"text":"Tried the black pepper beef, general Tao chicken with coconut rice on the side. Found the knife work to be a bit lazy as vegetables and meat pieces were not very uniform and some were way too big. Had a large piece of pepper steak that was three times as think as the other pieces and completely raw inside. The taste of the dishes was pretty good but oily. This restaurant has a more Chinese style of cooking than authentic thai. The coconut rice tastes rich and fatty like it's cooked with a bit of coconut oil. Overall not bad but not good either."}
{"text":"I didn't know Thai food can taste bad till I ordered from this place. I ordered the shrimp Thai soup, tasted old. I also ordered the spicy eggplant it wasn't spicy at all, again it tasted old and tasteless. I had to throw it out. I have ordered Thai food before and have almost always had a great experience. I don't know who is running this place, I'm not ordering from here again."}
{"text":"I'm very torn by Satay on the Road. On the one hand they make a really excellent North American style pad thai that is Saucy and delicious, and their Gai Yang grilled chicken is a great example of the dish.  On the other hand, many of their dishes don't seem to show care and concern, and feel very haphazardly thrown together. In the end I give them three to three-and-a-half Stars, because that pad thai and Grilled Chicken are both very solid and hit the spot."}
{"text":"I order through uber eats with them if I forget my lunch at work. The lunch special is enough food to last me 2-3 days of lunches at work. I usually get the red chicken curry. I could do without the spring roll and soup, and have more rice for the week. I will definately try to come eat at the restaurant at some point to try some more of their other menu items."}
{"text":"I've been here twice. Both times I was impressed. The decor is minimalist with a few Buddhist icons and statues. Prices are very reasonable. Last week my wife and I ordered the veggie platter as an appetizer. Bean curd satay toasted to perfection. Mango salad was also nice. I had the curry ayam served in deceptively small bowl. I was stuffed half way through it.  The Naan bread that came with the ayam was a warm and welcome reprieve from the cold outside. My wife had the Padnham Man Talay which is squid and other seafood in a mild but savory bean sauce. Nothing was overseasoned. All told I'd come here again. Very satisfying."}
{"text":"Lunch prices are great. The spicy beef and the green curry are good.  Service is horrible, even for takeout.   Please do not get any of their soups - they are horrible!!!  Received the wrong order multiple times and when I called them about the wrong order, they made me walk back to the restaurant with the wrong food (about a 20 minute walk away)....I think I deserved a free delivery from them but I wouldn't risk them doing anything to my food.  Reminder to self: their Thai iced tea sucks - do not order!"}
{"text":"Some of the best Thai in the city!  All the dishes taste fresh and delicious. The red Thai curry chicken with pineapple is probably the best I've had. For the portion sizes the prices are great!  Friendly staff. Great place."}
{"text":"Sambal fish in chili paste was not spicy like it was supposed to be. It doesn't taste that good either, the quality of the fish is similar to what I would expect from a cheaper Hakka restaurant. However, the pineapple fried rice was good. The food came out in about 10-15 minutes; very quick and friendly service."}
{"text":"Quick lunch? They offer a dozen lunch specials under $9. A small bag of crispy shrimp chips is included with every order!  Nasi Goreng for $7 is my goto lunch dish, which is Malaysian fried rice, chicken, shrimp, tomatoes, onion and a side of peanut sauce. Yum!  That said its greasy (just about everything on the menu)! It's not something I would have too often."}
{"text":"Food was almost inedible! I was very surprised because we ordered take out from this place before and it was good but today even the simple pad Thai was awful. The soup tasted like it had gone badc the pad Thai was over cooked and the sauce did not taste good, and the chicken was very suspicious. Will not come here ever again."}
{"text":"Large portions, decent ingredients and nicely prepared Thai Food that is on the slightly bland side. A little more kick to the food would make it a great Thai place.   Service was incredibly fast and on the ball, but could stand to be more welcoming and friendly. We were, however, very impressed by the restaurants willingness to customize some dishes to our unique requests.   We will return when in the neighborhood, but wouldn't trek across the city to eat here."}
{"text":"didn't think it was back flipping good, but not bad..! liked how they didn't cook the veggies too much and ingredients were more abundant with veggies.. but not too memorable..."}
{"text":"Had lunch. Only two people in the place. Ordered satay special. Beer was good, but nothing else was. Chicken was dry and tasteless, satay sauce was, well, not. Had to chase down the waitress (on the phone) for the check."}
{"text":"I quite enjoy the food here. The restaurant is a little small and parking is a hassle as it is only street parking."}
{"text":"I came here a few evenings ago with a couple of gf's.  It was ok.  Their space easily accommodated my stroller (and they were nice and put us at a corner table).  They were very accommodating. We had items that had pictures on the menu.  The pad thai was ok.  We had lettuce wraps (yum), spring rolls, lemongrass ribs, and a beef stew. Everything was pretty good."}
{"text":"Ordered for pickup from Avenue Road location during an April ice storm (not sure why), food was good, service was odd.  I showed them a copy of a $10 off coupon on their website, however they said it was for their Bayview Avenue location, not Avenue.  Same restaurant, same logo, same menu.  I was told it is a different owner, though not sure that should matter.  Prices are also higher at the Avenue location.  Bill came to more than $90, no discount, no free spring rolls (also offered on the website), nothing but giggles from the hostess.  Ordered cashew chicken, pad Thai, crispy beef (quite soggy) and eggplant, plus 2 types of spring rolls and hot and sour soup.  Food was fine (the reason for 3 stars instead of 1), but was too annoyed by their \"policy\" of operating 2 separate businesses, that I will never go back.  It's a shame because I have been going to the Bayview location since 1994 and this one since it opened."}
{"text":"Not the best food or the service tbh. They dont let you get the lunch special if youre even a minute late. Satay and peanut sauce were both a bit flat and lacked flavour. The peanut sauce can be improved a bit by adding some salt but is still disappointing. On the flip side the ambience is good so maybe a friend who doesnt like food will enjoy coming here. Oh and they also have wifi. Password sataywirelesS"}
{"text":"I may be picky.  So please do't kill me.  First off, this restaurant was advertised as Malaysian/Thai... There weren't that many Malaysian dishes offered, so I was a bit disappointed by that.  Not only that - the curry laksa was not the best.  Curry and some of the rice dishes were pretty good though.  If you want to have good Malaysian food - I would suggest Gourmet Garden or Restoran Malay.  Secondly, service wasn't the best.  We had to flag down our watiress continuously to get her attention.  And note: The Pisang Goreng that says \"banana fritters\" are not actually fritters.  They're actually pancakes with bananas in them.  If you search up \"pisang goreng\" on image.google.com -- that is definitely NOT what you get."}
{"text":"Decent food and reasonably authentic.  Good portions and well priced.  Service was a bit dull and not overly courteous.  This is my second time there and I will return."}
{"text":"I don't usually write updates to my reviews, but in this case I really don't have a choice.  We ordered the Khao Phad Gai and even though the menu lists chicken among the ingredients, we selected the vegetarian option.  You can probably guess what happened next.  Big chunks of chicken everywhere. The food was indeed quite tasty but my dining companion hardly ate any. (She tried her best to eat around the chicken but she eventually grew frustrated and just made a salad.)  This kind of incompetence is pretty shocking in this day and age, especially from a joint that hasn't let us down before."}
{"text":"On the windiest day in recent memory, we decided it might not be such a great idea to go out and eat. Enter Satay on the Road.  We'd ordered from their other location and enjoyed it, so we had no reason to expect anything different from the Avenue Road spot.  We were wrong, unfortunately.  I decided to order an item I've had a few times from the other location: Thai Spicy Noodle (\"Rice Noodle with Basil Leaves, Sweet Pepper, Onions and hot chili\"). The most obvious problem here was that the noodles had been overcooked to an almost stunning degree and were, as a result, so soggy that they were virtually inedible. Beyond that, the dish was devoid of pronounced flavors and, as well, the level of spice was just so-so (even though I specified \"hot\" when ordering).  It's possible they were just having an off night, but I think I'll stick with the Bayview location in the future."}
{"text":"Very large portions of decent, if not absolutely authentic, Thai food.  Tom Kha Gai was excellent, as was a green curry.  Pad woon sen was tasty but a bit salty.  They have a few Malaysian style dishes and some Chinese-Canadian items on a separate menu.  We found service to be prompt and very friendly.    A nice alternative to the rather overpriced restaurants on this stretch of Avenue Road.  Outdoor sidewalk seating (limited)."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful lunch here in April 2017. Very fresh and flavourful dishes, including very good Pad Thai. Very attentive owner, and an overall positive experience. Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Not a memorable experience. We ordered soup and mango garden salad as starters. Soup was great, the salad not as the mango was not fresh. Green tea wasn't the best as it was from a tea bag, not loose leaf as in other Asian eateries. Our waitress topped off the water in our teapot while at the table, using a coffee carafe. Our entrees, pad Thai and beef curry with roti were ok. Not very spicy, adequate at best. I don't think we'll be back."}
{"text":"There's a ton of great Thai restaurants out there. This isn't one of them. Bad food, bad quality, and equally bad service. Avoid."}
{"text":"It was a late sunday night and there were not too many restaurants to choose from. We decided to give Satay a try. We ordered a sweet & sour fish and variety satay skewers. The fish was okay. It was more like your average chinese sweet and sour pork except w/ fish. For $13, 1 of 4 skewers had imitation crab meat. The food was served cold which is a big disappointment. Taste was average or even horrible as it had no taste at all."}
{"text":"This place has great value. We can order for 4 people and it's usually about $30 for pick-up. Pay cash as you get a discount. The curry chicken dish is one of their best."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place. Totally authenticThai food. The restaurant is tastefully decorated, modern Asian theme, clean, service is prompt, depends on what day and what time you go here sometimes you might get a server with a little bit of a language barrier but that's ok..(just be patient..point to the items you want from the menu instead) :) the key is that they get your orders correct and serve it hot! I have been going here for as long as I can remember and now that I work close by I get to go more often. Since the minimum wages went up I notice the restaurant had to let some of there staff go and it looks like only family members are working here. The restaurant does not look busy at times but don't think it's because of the quality of the food. Okay so I notice the price on the menu item went up about $2.00 but that doesn't mean you should stop eating there but eat out at least once a month. Remember I'm a big believer of supporting your local independent/family owned businesses. Im a fan of this place and will always be a repeat customer."}
{"text":"While the food here isn't anything particularly special, the consistency of the food keeps me coming back for more. The staff is always very friendly- quick to seat me and explains any menu items I ask about. I tend to come in groups of 3 to 4 people so we can share a bunch of dishes. That said, if you come alone, one or two dishes will be more than enough to fill you and you will find yourself bringing home enough leftovers for another small meal.  I typically order: Thai Beef Steak, Pad Thai, Chili Garlic Chicken, and Chinese Broccoli in Oyster sauce for a group of three of us. In all cases the portion sizes are great and everything tastes good. (If you hate spiciness you may want to stay away from the Chicken.)  If I were to rate this restaurant on quality of food alone it would be a 3/5 overall, but the consistency of the food, large portions, big menu, and excellent service keeps me coming back for more and bumps it to a 4/5."}
{"text":"3.5 actually, I visited them twice and both experiences are a contrast of each other.  The consistent things were friendly service, large portions & best hot sauce! Green curry was too salty for me, they could not fix it when I complained, they just added some coconut milk or water I guess.  Their Hot and Sour soup at the first visit was just so perfect and in second visit it was too sour.  Spring rolls were amazing every time. Pad Thai, that I had for the first visit was really good.   I might visit them again, hoping for a good experience, I really loved them initially."}
{"text":"This is a mediocre Thai place in the area.  Good if you work in the area and looking for a lunch.  The staff are friendly.   Parts of the patio are shaded.   I had the seafood in blackbean sauce and it has lots of veggies which I liked but only a bit of seafood. It tasted okay.  The spicy sweet and sour soup was tasty. The spring roll was mediocre.   My friend had the crispy beef special and it tasted a bit sweet and the pieces of beef were a bit tough. He usually gets the Manchurian lunch special - and he says that is better.   He also had an iced tea which he said was sweetened with a bit of honey.   Our total bill came to $~25 + tip   Would I come here again? Only with work colleagues as it is convenient.   Would I get take out? No"}
{"text":"Terrible!!  A group of us from work would order lunch from here (only because of they are close and convenient) but today's lunch was absolutely terrible! The curry sauce in the green curry chicken was watered down and lacked flavor! We were charged $1 more for the gluten free cashew chicken meals - and were told that this is because they come with a difference type of sauce.  Well... the cashew chicken meals came without any sauce at all and looked and tasted like boiled colorless chicken on plain rice.  So, we paid more money and got less value. How is that fair? The spring rolls used to be accompanied by a red Thai sauce, but today it was packaged with the familiar Chinese egg roll sauce packets. I could make better food at home.  Nothing tasted even remotely close to THAI food at all! It tasted like boring cafeteria food. What a shame! We are extremely disappointed and will never be ordering food from here ever again."}
{"text":"We order a lot of food from Satay on the road and I have to say that value for money is great! The reliability of their food is fantastic. Navigating their menu is like walking around the hallways on the first day of high school. After a few classes you'll start to get the hang of it. Their food always arrives in a timely manner and is always hot. It's nothing fancy but it will hit the spot.  I would definitely recommend this place if you're in a fix for a lot of food. Try the Mee Goreng noodles which is actually called \"oodles of noodles\" and would serve a family of 72 squirrels (or 4 humans, whichever makes more sense in your brain). I don't recommend bringing a family of squirrels to a restaurant but if you ever find yourself in the need to feed an army of tree rats, take-out from here works wonders."}
{"text":"Got a hot green curry take out with coconut rice all for 16$. The rice portion is huge and can definitely be shared between 2 people. It also tasted creamy and coconut-ty. Huge portion of green curry also but the spicy level could be spicier. Big chunks of veggies and chicken pieces - I think the broth could have been creamier because it tasted a bit watery compares to the other green curries I had at other places. But overall, it's good"}
{"text":"Came here with some colleauges for retirement party due to receiving a coupon for 25%. Unfortunately the restaurant owner had said that they could not accommodate our coupon but as an apology will compensate us with a few free appetizers. He gave us  generous plate of spring rolls and Icecream as dessert. The food was so flavourful with generous servings. Environment was clean and service was excellent."}
{"text":"This place is well nestled in North York which is their second restaurant after the one in Toronto. Compared to a lot of Thai eateries, this place is affordable for consistent quality food. They are known for their Pad Thai.  Competition is pretty stiff with many restaurants in very close proximity. You can get a great deal for a meal at this restaurant on Groupon but the portions are smaller.$$"}
{"text":"This restaurant is below mediocre.  Food The presentation of the food is very poor. We got coconut soup which was floating with many uncut mushrooms and few chunks of chicken. It tasted okay but nothing special.  Malaysian Laksa had huge pieces of bell peppers which should have been cut into smaller pieces. They also used cabbage which  is not a common ingredient for this dish. The soup itself was okay but I wouldn't call it authentic. My bf's Pad thai was horrible. We have been to many different Thai restaurants, and it was the worst Pad thai. It tasted like they used ketchup, and also had a weird \"old noodle\"taste to it. Simply disgusting. Even Thai Express does it so much better!!  We tried to use their Yelp discount, which was $5 Pad thai when you check in. They made us check in, then told us it had expired. A true 'WTF' moment.   It was Friday evening, and we were the only customers there.   All in all, I wont be coming back."}
{"text":"The truth is I had some descent meals here.  But that was not the case last time I got takeout.   The Tom Yom soup was overly sweet and lacking in any other flavours.  The green curry chicken was lacking in meat, and the sauce was watery and had no flavour or heat.  The cashew nut chicken was made with a watery brown sweet sauce.  The pad Thai was too sweet and overcooked (the noodles were clumped together, and were all broken apart.)  The mixed satay platter was completely overcooked.  It came with a side of overcooked vegetable swimming in soy sauce."}
{"text":"Great ambience, great service, great food.  Floor to ceiling glass windows looking into the place from the street.  If you are thinking of coming here, COME!  You won't be disappointed, I never am ."}
{"text":"A decent place if you work or live in the area and want some affordable Thai food!  I head here once in a while for lunch to take advantage of their lunch specials, which all go for under $10. Pad Thai, Green Curry, Yellow Noodles, Cashew Chicken, Crispy Beef.... There is something for everyone in your group.  The prices are great, service friendly and quick, and while the food isn't amazing, it is always consistent.  We have ordered take out to the office a few times and it always comes quickly and the quality of the food is the same when you eat in.   Beats their neighbouring competitor ThaiOneOn (across the street) as Satay on the Road's food is a lot less oily and salty, and tastes a lot cleaner and healthier.  Would I return? - Yes Parking? - Street parking (paid parking on Yonge and free on residential streets) Value for $? - Good Space? - Mid sized/decent waiting area Ventilation? - Good Service? - Good"}
{"text":"Got a Groupon for Satay on the Road.  Decided to try it out.  The decor is nice and comfortable.  Groupon has its own menu which is not shown on the groupon site.  But it was not a bad selection of choices.    Soup had a strong lemongrass flavor, pad thai was super saucey, chilli chicken was not spicy enough and missing the char kind of taste.   All these are not necessarily bad things.. as i know some people do like their pad thai super saucey... but it was not to my preference.  customer service was good as the waitress told me afterwards that they could customize to your tastes.. so for anyone who doesnt like overly saucey pad thai.  you can ask for it less saucey.   autocorrect is telling me its saucy not saucey... whatever...."}
