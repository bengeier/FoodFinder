{"text":"{Have to start by saying this is the Rt 19 location!!  Had an awful food / server experience at the Waterworks location. Foolishly since I'd come to the North Hills WG before and loved it, I assumed the other location would be great too}, Such chic fun interior and interesting menu!  Our Server Scott, in spite of a lonnng day (I asked, he didn't whine about it) was efficient, and professional-style friendly.  Not like  the well meaning Server who thinks \"friendly\" means you came to share the eve with them in conversation, you've met them, right?  Anyway, let's move on to food, that's why we go to Restaurants, right?  And yet...ALL of the above matters in the experience, otherwise we'd go get hot food at Giant Eagle! Best. Roast.Beef. Sandwich. EVER. (Umm, I get them a lot!) Prime rib was well trimmed, with a ton of perfectly carmelized onions, and fresh sautéed mushrooms, generous pepperoncini, lavish amount of provolone, on an excellent baguette...for my side,  I chose freshly grilled veggies, yummy.  Just right crispness.   Hubby loved his Pittsburgh style Chicken salad, fresh, fresh,  and with freshly made Ranch dressing.  When we have twice loved a location, we feel confident it's not a fluke, but a great place. Our first visit was super good food & service too, and when the manager made the rounds to check on our experience, she was genuinely interested. And \"comped\" us a free round of Cocktails!!! That never happens, wish I'd have review then, but hadn't been Yelping then..."}
{"text":"I thought this place was cool. I liked the outdoor bar that had TV out there and live music on Wed nights. I thought the place was fancier than I had expected it to be. But I thought the food was really good especially hot bread and brownie batter butter, yum!!!"}
{"text":"Surprised this has only a handful of reviews as it is usually a busy place though not my favorite kind of place. I've been here a handful of times usually for dinner though once for a very fun hoppin' Friday happy hour with fun 1/2 price appies and beer and wine.  Food - This time I'm reviewing lunch. I got the Greek salad with cup of Seafood Chowder for $9 lunch special. I specifically asked if the soup was red or white (Manhattan or New England right?) and the server said red, it has been ordered a lot, it has salmon, crab, shrimp, lobster. Pleasantly surprised I ordered it. The soup was something like New England with cheese and maybe something red added (tomato sauce?). I was very disappointed. I don't like to waste all my calories on a cup of soup. I ordered red because it should be broth-based. It was what you'd expect from Red Lobster - very high in calories and creamy and rich. There was some salmon and maybe one piece of scallop or crab in my cup. The salad was mediocre with iceberg tasting like it had sat in the prep fridge overnight and the dressing was like full-on canola oil (as if only the top layer of dressing had been scooped on with none of the seasonings - no oregano? no lemon? no Greek.). I ate less than half the salad. The bread which our table of 7 requested was good. The accompanying chocolate (!) and garlic butters were strong and just weird - coming from someone who usually appreciates the unusual.  Atmosphere and Service - usual suburban hot dinner spot with the tables pretty close together and a pretty busy bar even in the middle of the day. Typical service.  In the past I've had good and mediocre dinners here. The seared tuna for example has been delicious and on an alternate visit has given me a stomach ache. I expect that their success will continue given the lack of competition in the area."}
{"text":"This place is great. I love the Chicken with wild mushrooms. I wish they had more appetizer options. They have a cool outdoor seating area with bar.   Great place"}
{"text":"After passing this place multiple times since opening, I finally stopped in check it out. Glad I did.      I started off with a Tijuana Iguana mule that was made with Patron Silver tequila. The bartender mixed it perfectly.      After quite a bit of pondering over the menu choices, I thought I would pick the simple choice and ordered the classic cheeseburger topped with blue cheese, requested they cook it medium.      I had ordered sweet potato fries as a side. They were very good.       When the burger came out everything about it was appealing. It looked ready for a TV commercial photo shoot. To me, the perfect burger. It was perfectly cooked, and wanted for no additional toppings or condiments. Literally, the best burger ever served to me.   Server, Brooke was very pleasant."}
{"text":"My wife and I went there Sunday evening 5/5/13 around 6pm.  Went to Hostess, requested outside seating and were seated right away.  Restaurant not crowded at all.  Sat at our table for a good 10+ minutes, no server came to take our drink or meal orders.  Got the attention of a waiter, who informed us we were not his table, but he would take our drink order.  Since we knew what we wanted to eat, we ordered food also.  Another 10 to 15 minutes went by, still no drinks, food or server(s).  We got up and went down the street to Bonnie and Clydes, had a great meal with good service there.  We have been to Walnut Grove before and had decent service and meals. Now we will think twice about going again."}
{"text":"We went here Sunday night for our weekly family night out. We hadn't been here for over a year and we were pleasantly surprised. The beet salad was very tasty and my wife's steak was very tender. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place is awful. Ordered bruschetta, they came out and gave us a plate of crackers with diced tomatoes on them.  Avoid. Avoid. Avoid."}
{"text":"What an experience!  We had reservations but upon arrival the hostess seemed lost in finding our name.  After 10 minutes of standing around, we were seated at a table for 6 (there were only 4 of us).  No sooner than they took our drink order, the manager came and asked us to move to a different table.  We had to start the ordering process all over again with a different server making us feel as if they were trying to shoehorn us in and had no clue of our reservation.  It took an hour to receive our meals and the restaurant was not over busy.  We never received our complimentary bread even though the server mentioned it twice to us that is was coming.  A second glass of wine was ordered to pair with dinner and it arrived after the meal was already complete.  One guest in our party did not receive the side she ordered but we didn't want to send it back to the kitchen.  We had plans for the night and did not want to be late.  Overall the service seemed slow compared to the other tables around us.  The manager checked in on other tables to ask about their dining experience but avoided coming over to our table.  We did not feel welcomed and will not be back to this location."}
{"text":"We had reservations 4 a party of about 20. Our tables were good but they had ONLY ONE WAITER assigned.  The first hour i was served only 1 drink.  Took 1 1/2 hours for apps to arrive.  Awful experience . 8 of us Did not bother to order dinner.  Felt bad 4 the waiter."}
{"text":"Great beer selection, pretty good food too. I had the Parmesan chicken with gnocchi and it was better than I expected. Would definitely come back next time in town."}
{"text":"Everything we had was delicious. From the hummus and cous cous platter to the mixed grill my fiance had. Great service as well."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the food, service was fine, the one BIG drawback was that it was a gorgeous day and we like to sit on patios whenever one is available. The hostess took us to a table where there were 4 people smoking at the table next to us, so I asked if we could be seated at another table away from the smokers, there were plenty of tables available so she seated us at another table (around a couple of other people who were not smoking at the time) well lo & behold, they lit up shortly after we received our drinks. Now I know in today's world smokers have to be outside, but why are they the only ones that can enjoy a gorgeous sunny day? Why can't they, the establishment, have a part of their patio sectioned off for people who don't enjoy inhaling smoke with every bite of our food? Places had smoking/non smoking sections inside restaurants for years before smokers were kicked outside, and that seemed to work, why can't they do the same outside?"}
{"text":"My other review was flagged and \"hidden\". I suppose we are not allowed to give 1 star reviews? It seems the other 1-star reviews for this place are hidden away too.    Anyways, this place may be OK to get a couple drinks at the bar.  The bar area looked vibrant and busy on a Saturday evening.    The food, however, is something to pass on.  After two bites of my Chicken artichoke dish I couldn't eat anymore.  My girlfriend didn't particularly like her food either.  Looked under the \"Flagged\" reviews if you want to see why.    The menu looks like it had potential,  trying to be \"semi upscale bar good\" and \"different\".  But to be honest I've had better prepared food at a TGI Fridays.  There must have been some problems in the kitchen the night we went, but we won't be back."}
{"text":"Nice salads. Sandwiches . Comfortable place. A bit pricey but otherwise great experience. Excellent service!"}
{"text":"Really overpriced and the food isn't even that great. Quirky little seating arrangement and I wasn't very impressed. Bar service was not the best either. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"I really wish I could give this place a better rating but I just can't. We tried to get in on Saturday night without reservations and were turned down by a very rude hostess despite there being lots of tables open. Her attitude alone made me not want to go.  We went back Sunday afternoon, and sat in the bar area. We ordered the fruit and cheese appetizer plate, the fruit and cheese was good but the warm Brie they served was horrible. They literally took a piece of Brie with the wax outside on and stuffed it in a croissant. It was bad.  The entrees were okay, nothing to write home about. I won't be asking to go here anytime soon."}
{"text":"I've been to this Walnut Grove several times.  I must agree with Gerri about the food being \"hit and miss from visit to visit.\"  The last time I went, I ordered a side of mashed potatoes.  The mashed potatoes had a weird crust on top as if it had been sitting out for a long time and was just really old.  A friend of mine who came with me ordered a seafood dish and the mussels were rancid.  It was so disappointing as I've had good pizzas/salads there before.  To go from serving something good on one visit to inedible the next is too much of a difference to warrant another visit from me."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time since the boyfriend and I had gone to both the restaurants we frequent earlier in the week. Service was very good and we did not wait at all to get a table and order some drinks.   My boyfriend had a draft beer and some French onion soup, which he said was pretty good. I got the Long Island iced tea special which was very good and surprisingly strong. For my meal I got the caprese salad with grilled chicken and it was really lacking. The tomatoes did not taste as if they were fully ripened and the mozzarella cheese had very little flavor. The grilled chicken that was added on also had almost no flavor and was incredibly dry. It seemed as if the chicken had been sitting around for a while and was just tossed on the plate. What little dressing I got was alright and the grilled asparagus that was added to the salad was decent.   For dessert we ordered the tiramisu and it was very good. I would highly recommend ordering that.   At this point I am completely unsure if we will return based on how underwhelming my meal was, but like I said service was speedy and our waiter was very nice, so they might get a second chance."}
{"text":"Food was good, we had the appetizer - chicken brie quesadilla, it was quite tasty, the bread was just fine, and i ordered the cedar salmon and my husband went with the beef street taco, all in all a decent place. BUT!!!!!! We had to wait almost 30min from appetizer to entree....i was so ready to just walk out the door even though our waitress would walk by every 8min telling us our food will be out soon...also, do not order their kids meal, i ordered mac and cheese for my daughter, and it was so small and literally the worst mac and cheese i have ever tasted in my life. My daughter took 1 bite and refuse to eat another and she is usually crazy about pasta. She ended up eating all her side (apple sauce, which was actually in a bigger portion than her mac n cheese...ironic being the \"side\", and that was actually okay tasting). Aside from that the experience was ok, the restaurant was kinda full so i guess i can understand the long wait...so if you plan to eat a quick bite maybe consider somewhere else, this is more like a lets-chat-n-hang while we wait for our food place..."}
{"text":"This was our first visit for dinner, with a group of our neighbors. Food was excellent much better than expected. I had the parmesan encrusted chicken with gnocchi . tomato basil sauce...was excellent! My companions also enjoyed their selections  Good menu, with many options. Something for everyone! I am a craft beer lover, choices were very limited. Wine was ok, but not bad. Service was very good...we will try them again...worth the price..."}
{"text":"Fabulous service especially at the bat. Erika and Mike Bailey are the best bartenders in north hills. Happy hour specials are great especially having two options during the day; 5-7 and 9-11."}
{"text":"Came for the Sunday lunch buffet.  Had your usual pancakes, waffles, and salad along with roast beef, mushroom chicken, and some other random items.  Honestly, everything was pretty room temperature and tasted ok.  I think the buffet was a bad choice because the other people we were with ordered food and they said it was pretty good.  I'd give it another shot but definitely not at the buffet."}
{"text":"Walnut Grove is one of my favorite places... not only is it easy to get to, it's a diamond in the rough!   It's popular, it's chic and trendy, it's awesome food and friendly atmoshphere.   We are regulars at  \"The Grove\" and I try something different every time I go.   I have not been disappointed.   Every time, the service is friendly and responsive.   It's a relaxing place to go and we default to going to the Grove more often than any other place!  It's our go-to spot!  Love  Walnut Grove!"}
{"text":"Soooo...Walnut Grill. Okay, I know there are naysayers here but relax, chill and hit a happy hour! Nice music, half price drinks, great waitstaff and knowledgable bartenders. Oh...and food! Shrimp and pasta perfection! The Reuben sandwich is a homerun as well."}
{"text":"We sat at the bar on a lazy Thursday afternoon and shared a bottle of reasonably priced bottle of Chardonnay and an amazing fruit and cheese plate ($14), which two of us who were hungry when we got there couldn't finish.  The baked Brie was spectacular and the plate included 5 different cheese selections, hummus, sliced apples, candied walnuts, and a big bunch of red seedless grapes.   Our bartender, Aaron was friendly and provided great service.  It was a great experience."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a dinner of fish tacos and a mojita with a friend celebrating her birthday. The servers and service was good. We ate outside and the patio was pleasant. It was a great evening to eat outside. I would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Great place, daily drink specials and friendly staff, it gets busy at times but I've never had a bad experience. They have a beautiful patio seating as well."}
{"text":"We came to Walnut Grill for Mother's Day brunch 2014.   I won't pass too much judgment on service, because having come from the restaurant service industry, I know how awful and different it is when your restaurant suddenly turns half-buffet half-menu. It was pretty bold to offer both, so I think our server did the best with what he had to handle that day. I'm not suggesting a restaurant should take on more than it can handle - I just don't want to blame the waiter for that. That being said, there was a lot of waiting, a lot of empty glasses, and a lot of unanswered questions and requests that afternoon.   One in our party got the buffet, and the rest of us (after viewing the buffet) ordered off the menu, which was much more gluten-free friendly. They did have a separate GF menu, so I was happy about that, but confused as to why some of the dishes actually cost more, with less food, than their gluten-y counterpart. I ordered the GF version of the sweet chili mahi mahi which was missing a side and cost $1 more. It was all a little confusing - there weren't any substitutions to be made or anything. Regardless, it tasted just fine.   Hubby got a burger which he liked but it was a little overcooked. Mom got a flatbread which she really enjoyed and Dad was happy with the buffet.   Holidays are always tough for restaurants, but at the same time, it's what attracts people in droves. Some step up their game, some fall a little short. Walnut Grill did fall a little short, but not enough to keep me from returning. I would like to try it again on some random Thursday and see if the experience is any better for $200."}
{"text":"Perfect Friday night dinner with my girlfriends. The space is huge! The bar area was fairly crowded. We didn't wait at all to be seated. It also looks like they have a big bar/patio area out front for the summer months.   Our server was prompt and went over all of the specials. You'll have a button on your table you. An press anytime you need the server. We didn't have to use it as our server was prompt without being pushy.   It has a very larger drink selection. I love the Narcisi wines. I recommend the peach moscato. They also had a $3 draft beer and $4 Tito's vodka drinks specials. It appears they run drinks specials every day of the week. At our table we started with the fried zucchini planks. They were good, nothing special.   For dinner I had the Balsamic Chicken. Excellent portion. It comes with two pieces of chicken, a side and the daily vegetable. I ordered the sweet potato which came with cinnamon butter.   If you check in you'll receive a free Walnut Ball. I'm allergic to nuts, but my friends enjoyed it!   Will be back. Looking forward to summer months on the patio!"}
{"text":"We have been to Walnut Grove several times over the past few years. Usually the fare is good. Tonight was no exception. We sat in a bar side booth. I started with the suggested wine-Red Rock Reserve malbec which was worthy of a second glass. My Prime Rib sandwich and sweet potato fries along with a side salad were delicious. My date's pork chop and fresh veggies (broccoli and green beans) also tasted yummy. Including the 3 glasses of wine our total was $65. Not over priced. Service was good. I even took them up on the gift card purchase to score an extra $20 card. Obviously, I'll be back."}
{"text":"Ok, takes a lot for me to write a bad review, but I have had it with this place. The last three times I ate a meal here it was simply awful. Most recent disasters were the Smoked Salmon Salad and something they tried to pass off as lasagne. The salad had some sort of salmon looking matter that had a phony smoke flavor added. Not smoked salmon like most would expect. And the dressing was lemon based but overly sour. The two bites I tried I this salad were the worst think I've ever tasted.   The next was the horrid lasagne. It was some sort of attempt to re-imagine this classic dish. Not only was there too much cheese sauce that my daughter described as Mac and cheese like, but the bolognese sauce had some sort of odd spice that should not have been in this dish. Nutmeg perhaps?   Regardless these meals were bad enough in and of themselves but to add insult to injury, these clowns charge outrageously high prices for garbage."}
{"text":"The restaurant was very neat and clean. The had options for seating and in the bar area, it is first come first serve. We sat in the bar area.   The drink of the day is a very good idea. The drink was sangria.  We had tuna tacos for the appetizer. The tuna was delicious but there was so much tortilla and I didn't like that part. There could have been more tuna and less slaw as well. I wouldn't have it again.  There was also a pick 2 meal. I had steak and soup. The steak was amazing and tinder. The veggies were steamed perfectly. My only real complaint about the meal was the lobster bisque, there was no lobster in it, so that was a disappointment. I won't order that soup again if I come back.  Our server was great but around the time we were trying to leave, we couldn't get the check.  All in all, we will definitely return."}
{"text":"Food has always been good. I love the tuna appetizer and the beet salad. Service is usually very good. Only downside is at the bar - way to many middle age, balding, pot-bellied guys trying to hit on girls half their age and 3x as good-looking."}
{"text":"My past 13 hours have been spent on Wexford bar tour. I'm exhausted but hopefully I acquired enough data so bar owners in Dauphin County will ask me why they are so far behind. Totally different then what Harrisburg has to offer. I'll give you the best and work down.  As I sit at the outside bar drinking my Miller Lite which is accompanied by a stellar plate of tater tots I feel an aura.....no make that a mystique surrounding in this establishment. I can't continue to describe it by using words. Make a visit"}
{"text":"The food is not worth the money, I ordered a pasta dish that was supposed to have shrimp, mussels and clams. I found 2 clams that where closed the shrimp were so small, it was just horrible. The appetiser was tasteless. The only thing that was good was the bread and salad. It was my best friends birthday and I felt terrible. The waiter was nice , you had to wait a long time for food and drinks , I was so disappointed will never go back. Had a better meal at steak and shake. The chef needs fired."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good, nice atmosphere. I do find they are somewhat dodgy about seat reservations. I've had s few experiences there that make me question if certain takes are really \"reserved\" or if the servers just didn't want someone to sit there. That aside, the food is pretty good. Most recently we tried the pork nachos as an appetizer. Those were good and had more of an Asian inspired taste which was cool. I had the crab cake. Again nothing bad at all and the service was good, but nothing completely wowed me. Id like to come back in the summer to experience their outside seating."}
{"text":"I have been to this establishment a few of times and I am sure I will be visiting again in the future. Having said that the food is good - nothing exceptional or extraordinary - and the service is ok - no complaints. It looks as a good place for watching a game but also for a date. I haven't visited their other locations but I guess they should be equally good!"}
{"text":"It was a gorgeous November day today and my dad and I took a break from work to stop in to Walnut Grill on Perry Highway for lunch.  My mom gave us a coupon for BOGO lunch.  We started by sharing a bowl of the soup of the day - Asian Chicken Noodle.  It was made like normal chicken noodle with Asian seasonings and glass noodles instead of standard chicken soup noodles. It was excellent!  I ordered the wild mushroom chicken with sweet potato fries and Dad ordered the light potato crusted fish/crab on top with a side of coleslaw.  As other reviewers mentioned, the lunch portions are substantially smaller, but also cheaper.  Food came out in a timely manner, our waitress was attentive and kept our drinks refilled and it wasn't too busy for lunchtime on a busy street.  Things started picking up as we were leaving so I was glad we beat the rush.  I have been going to the Waterworks location for years - even before it was called Walnut Grill and have always had really great food and service.  They have (or had) a nice wine night on Wednesday where they did half-priced bottles so definitely check that out too. 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, the Wexford location has turned back to a appetizer and drink only place again. Poor service, food served was cold. Strangest looking french onion soup, two.pieces of bread thrown into the bowl like an after thought. Disappointing..."}
{"text":"Good food and a great atmosphere. Erica is amazing, the wines are great and at a reasonable price. I highly recommend for lunch or dinner. If you get a chance, check out the patio at night with live music."}
{"text":"Tried the salmon and ravioli. It was very good.  A bit heavy on the spinach and I would have preferred it on a plate instead of a bowl but good nonetheless"}
{"text":"Good lunch alternative in the Wexford area. I had the Shrimp Scampi and vermicelli noodles. For lunch, the portion is slightly smaller for $11 and for dinner, it's $18. You get about 8 medium size shrimps which is pretty generous. The sauce was pretty rich but not overboard. They had a great list of desserts too!   Every Tuesdays, they offer a bogo for active military and veterans. The free entree is up to $20.   The server was polite and took our orders quickly. The food took about 15 minutes to come out which was great since we were on our lunch break."}
{"text":"Horrible experience. They have a real gnat problem in one of the back rooms and couldn't even eat most of the items, because they were covered in gnats.  The manager knew of the problem and still sat people in this area.  Will not go back."}
{"text":"This particular location is great!  I have the pleasure of knowing the owner and I must say they run a great business!  They currently have a meal deal for $16.95 which includes a choice or soup or salad, entree (streak or several selections of chicken) and a side!  I had the steak!  It was delicious!  I'm also a huge fan of their flat breads!  The only reason I'm giving this a 4 was because the wait time for the food and getting our check was rather lengthy.  Otherwise the seating area was clean and tidy.  The waiter was kind and pleasant.  We did have the option of sitting in the lounge or restaurant.  This location is in Wexford but Also rather close to cranberry, seven fields, mars, mccandless, Ross, gibsonia etc.  not a bad deal for a really good meal!"}
{"text":"Wow! First time at the Walnut Grill and it exceeded my expectations. I was coming to celebrate a friend's birthday - my group didn't meet the minimum to reserve the party room, but that wasn't a big deal. Plenty of parking which was great.   For appetizers we got the calamari and the lobster Mac and cheese. Both were delicious but we did find a hair in the Mac and cheese, we got a replacement but the waiter did NOT take it off the check. This was a unpleasant surprise (why I gave  four stars).   For dinner we got the Pittsburgh flatbread, Spinach and Artichoke flatbread, smoked salmon salad, strawberry chicken salad, buffalo chicken wrap, and classic cheeseburger. The flatbreads were HUGE and cooked to perfection. Fries were delicious and the salads were hearty.   Will definitely be returning again for lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"We shared a fish sandwich and bottle of wine. Server was overwhelmed with the wine bottle, had someone else open it. Fish sandwich was okay, but had to beg multiple times for frank's hot sauce. Not an enlightening experience, but we didn't expect much, and they delivered."}
{"text":"I had a great, late-night experience at Walnut Grill. My waiter was extremely friendly and took care of my food allergies with ease. He checked on everything for me and assured me my meal was allergen free. I didn't get sick, so that's a huge deal for me. They have great 1/2 off wine bottle specials on Wednesday nights and food was great. I have never had a bad meal here, to be honest. Although I stick to the salads and appetizers, my family always has a great meal. They love the stuffed banana peppers and the pizzas!"}
{"text":"Worst dining experience in years.   15 minutes to talk to waitress.  Took order for table next to ours that sat 10 minutes after we did.   Over an hour wait for food.  Mahi mahi was swimming in sauce and vegetables under cooked.  So bad, that it does not deserve a second try"}
{"text":"Our first time going last night. I'm really clueless how this place has the reviews it does. We started off with the calamari. It was terrible, literally the worst tasting calamari I've ever had. The only decent part of it was the tangy sauce they have to dip with which I used to kill the taste of the calamari with. I ordered the crab cakes with a loaded baked potato and the brussel sprouts. The most worst crab cakes ever!! There was no breading at all. It was terrible tasting crab with mayonnaise pretty much and just fell apart. The brussel sprouts were hard as a rock and I didn't care for them. The only good part was the baked potato. My boyfriend ordered the catch of the day which was wahoo with a mango relish, the daily vegetable (slaw) and rice pilaf. The fish was extremely small for $20+ dollars and he said it just tasted like pepper and had a teaspoon of the relish on it. The slaw was literally bagged slaw on the plate with no sauce and the rice was extremely overdone and mush. Our kids got the chicken tenders and pizza with fries. The chicken and pizza looked decent and both kids ate but the fries tasted like oil. On the positive part our service had to be the best out of all the times we have ate out in the past 2 years which I did compliment the waitress with. I would never come back again though due to the food."}
{"text":"My wife and I went there for the first time and we enjoyed it.  We went on a Saturday around 6:30 and didn't have a reservation.  We waited about 20 mins. to be seated.  The food was pretty good.  I had calamari appetizer, French onion soup, and chicken and gnocchi.my meal was pretty good.  I enjoyed it all.  My wife had a steak which she was disappointed with.  She said the sides were really good but e steak tasted flavorless.  That was our only complaint about the place.    I will say that we didn't leave there until almost 8:30, but our server did tell us that they were short handed because another server went home sick, so that might have been why it took so long there."}
{"text":"I'm going to preface my 4-star review with the following statement:  I always order the same exact thing because it is always delicious, filling and at least, in my mind, fairly healthy!   I can make no promises on other menu items.    The strawberry balsamico salad with a crab cake is oh-so yummy.   It comes with strawberries, tomatoes, mixed greens, almonds (which I always substitute with the candied walnuts), goat cheese and a balsamic reduction.   It's the perfect mix of flavors and always leaves me completely satisfied.  I have no complaints about the service and they have a nice little outdoor patio and a fairly large bar area that seems to be a happening happy hour spot.  My only gripe is that happy hour specials are only served in the bar area.   If you're in the restaurant, full price for you (w/the exception of the $3 craft beer special)."}
{"text":"We love the  Bridgeville location . This was our first visit in North Hills. Our fresh baked bread had mold growing inside. The manager tried to make things right by giving us a 20% discount on the check as well as treating us to a free desert. Still, I won't be in a hurry to return. In retrospect we should cancelled our meals and left. I can't help but suspect that there might be an issue with their refrigeration.   The rest of the meal was of good quality. Service was inconsistent.  Great at times and slow at others throughout our meal. We had tickets to a nearby venue and they could have been faster getting us our deserts and getting us checked out. They may have been checking them for mold.  We were there after 7 on a Saturday and there weren't many other diners inside. Only one other table was occupied in our section. The patio was a bit busier."}
{"text":"Walnut Grill has great daily happy hour and drink specials. This location has an awesome patio too. I've never had a bad meal, but have had slow service when we went once on a busy Friday night."}
{"text":"Party of 6 for Mother's Day brunch. 1/2 of group had the buffet.  Food was fine for buffet. Other 1/2 of party ordered off the menu. The service was amoung the worst I've ever experienced. Staff was continually harried and overly apologetic even with the restaurant less that 3/4 full.  We were seated at our reservation time but waited about 10 minutes before a waiter appeared to take drink orders. Another 10 minutes for drinks and food orders. When the menu service food finally arrived, long after the buffet diners finished, the servers brought the food to the wrong table and sat the plates down in front of our confused neighbors at the next table. Once they sorted out the mistake, one of the servers literally stacked one plate on top of another so that the top of the beet entree salad ended up on the bottom of a surf & turf plate.   The lobster tail was partially under cooked and much of it went to waste. Due to the delay in service and the generally bad service, we left the lobster without giving the restaurant the chance to make it right, but by then, we'd had enough.   The buffet was understaffed and the condition of the tables and floor around the service was filthy with spilled food. The food was changed out often and was of generally high quality for typical brunch food ( carving station, breakfast stuff, peeled shrimp, mussels, salads and deserts).  We occasionally frequent this establishment so we know they are better than this, but honestly, today the wheels fell off."}
{"text":"Really nice fun atmosphere in the summer, especially outside with live music and fire pit. The food is standard but with some odd twists: the cheese quesadillas came with raspberry sauce on the plate and grapes stuffed inside?? Strange but ok... And the margarita I had was heavy on the mix. But for the most part it was fine, and our server very friendly. Tip: if outside, get seated by the front door if you are sensitive to loud music."}
{"text":"Went the other day for lunch. Other than the very first time when they opened, I have not been impressed. This was the fourth time and I finally figured out what bugs me, besides the food being hit and miss from visit to visit,  their plates are too big.   One of my dining partners got the lunch crab cake and a side. One tiny little crab cake about 4 inches in diameter (I'm being generous) and a good size serving of mashed potatoes were served on a plate that had to be 14 inches in diameter.  They drizzled stuff between the portions to make it look pretty.   The first visit, I had the chicken carbonara sandwich and partner had the pizza. Both were good enough that I wanted to go back to try again. The second visit, we had the same and it was a miss. I especially remember the presentation was \"weird\". It's all the white space on the plates that turn me off."}
{"text":"Can't stop saying nice things about this place. Had the loaded tater tots this time. Very yummy. Spinach dip is still one of the best we've ever had. But the best part of the meal was the filet mignon. Omg! Ordered it medium and it was amazing! Just the right amount of juiciness and taste. Would not have tried it on its own but they had a dinner special called \"pick-a-pair\" and we were able to get 2 small filet mignons (4 oz each) for $30.95. Shared the salad and side. So left plenty of room to try the mini desserts. Ummm... skip the cheesecake. Seemed like a frozen store-bought kind. Not worth the $8 even if it was a sample trio. Not very many places have happy hour on weekends but this place has it Saturday & sundays. Took advantage of the $3 drafts & sangrias! Had select appetizers at reasonable pricing. Overall - good. Will be back for more happy hours!"}
{"text":"Had take-out lunch from here today.  I ordered the fish tacos.  The description did not say what type of fish, so it was assumed it would be a white fish.  It was salmon.  That was fine, as their salmon is good.  However the guac that came with it was BROWN.  Very brown.  The asian slaw that came on the tacos was really soggy and limp, as if it had been made several days ago.  Flavor was good, just nothing veggie was at all fresh.  I'm going to assume they'll be removing this from their menu soon as it is a summer dish.    This was my first meal from there, so will update if I have a better experience in the future."}
{"text":"We had reservations for brunch before wedding dress shopping (note to self - next time avoid a buffet brunch before trying on wedding dresses). We were seated immediately and were SUPER excited to see the Bloody Mary checklist. They had so many awesome ingredients that you could add! Our server gave us the checklists, but no pens. After about 10 minutes of waiting, we asked another server for some pens so we could make our selection. Two of us got medium and one got mild. Our server didn't return to take our drink orders for quite a while (the overall theme was that he was super nice but not particularly good at his job), and then our Bloody Marys didn't come for quite a long time. As in, we didn't have our drinks until we had been at the restaurant for about 45 minutes.   When we got the Bloody Marys, they were CRAZY SPICY. I like a good amount of heat, but these were just too much. As in, take a sip and then chug water. We kindly asked for some extra tomato juice to tone down the spice, which our server provided. But even with the extra tomato juice, they were just too hot. Our sever later asked us if we enjoyed the cucumber vodka we upgraded to and then before we could answer said, \"Oh they are probably too spicy to taste the cucumber.\" None of us drank more than 1/3 just because they were too hot to enjoy (and came out long after we wanted them). You'd think the server would offer to take them off the bill after he admitted they were really spicy, we said they were too spicy, and NONE of us drank them. But nope, no offer whatsoever.  As far as the brunch buffet food goes, it was excellent. The bacon was very good quality. The made-to-order omelets were very good (they offered egg whites, which I appreciated) and they weren't huge, which is good when there are so many other offerings on the buffet to enjoy. My mom said the eggs benedict was very good, but I didn't try it. The bread pudding was awesome - some of the best I've had.   Overall, the food was very good but the service and drinks really put a damper on our experience. I don't think I'd rush back simply for those reasons."}
{"text":"Sigh.. I wanted to love it here. Don't get me wrong, its ok, it's just not what i thought it was going to be. To be fair, this was our first time here.  It is our 7th wedding anniversary and I wanted to go somewhere special and kind of upscale. Well, that wasn't quite what we got at Walnut Grill.  The place is nice, clean, and cool looking. The bar looked great but we didn't sit over there; we sat in the dining room. The waitress was friendly enough, never asked us if we had any questions about the menu and when I asked a question seemed kind of annoyed. We got the Ahi tuna appetizer, which was decent, kind of meh.  My husband got a Cesar salad, which was crispy and very good.  For my entree I got the crab cakes, which were jump lump but small and the sauce was lacking flavor, the veggie were soggy, like they had been microwaved and a little cold and the rice pilaf was so bland I didn't even bother eating it.  My  husband got the rack of lamb, which he really liked!  It was juicy, tender and perfectly cooked. His veg was soggy too but he got smashed potatoes that he enjoyed.   For our anniversary they did give us a free dessert which was very yummy. It was funnel cakes with vanilla ice cream and a chocolate and raspberry drizzle. The funnel cakes were hard and over fried, but good none the less.  This places menu reminded me of Andora in Sewickley but the food is no where near as good. Next time we'll likely go to Andora, same sort of food, similar prices, better service and waaaaay better flavors!"}
{"text":"High on our list of Saturday evening places to visit. We love to grab one of the elevated booths by the bar, get some appetizers and drinks and chat the night away. The food may not blow you away but the friendly staff and good drink selection keeps us coming back."}
{"text":"Always have great service & great food. I recommend the ahi tuna tacos as an app or small plate!"}
{"text":"Been to Walnut Grill 4 or 5 times and owe it a review.  One of the best food and drink Happy Hours in the Wexford and North Hills area for sure, especially when the weather allows patrons to enjoy the spacious patio.  Happy Hour here, at least in the summertime, is a popular spot, but we've actually never had an issue being seated on the patio--and thank goodness for the huge parking lot.  Love that there are $3 glasses of wine during Happy Hour.  A $3 decent chilled Riesling on the patio in the summer...I'm game.  My guy is a fan of the wine deals too and also likes the great bang-for-buck Happy Hour beer specials.  There are cocktail specials as well, though I haven't dabbled in those.  Happy hour food is just as good.  Our go-to appetizers/small plates are the black tip shark bites (love 'em so much I make my husband order his own so that I don't have to share) and the really chunky and substantial spinach and artichoke dip (comes with loads of tortilla chips and seasoned crackers).  Summer days are fading fast.  I recommend heading to Walnut Grill for Happy Hour on the patio before it's too late."}
{"text":"If you don't mind a very pricy menu with pricy drinks this may be for you. The only thing I could justify getting on the menu was a strange salad and I paid way too much for that. They did have an outside bar area but it was right beside a highway. I'll never return."}
{"text":"I recently came to Walnut Grill for a happy hour after having not dined here in years. I had a great time! Happy hour specials are fantastic, atmosphere is casual yet sophisticated, service is good, and both food and drinks are tasty. I ordered a glass (or was it two?) of wine and my friend and I split the Cheese and Fruit Plate. We cleaned off the plate, down to leaving just a few walnuts uneaten. I hope to come back for happy hour again sometime soon!"}
{"text":"Love it here. Attentive service and great food. Sign up for the birthday club on the website."}
{"text":"The happy hour here is ok. Good drink specials and $5 appetizers. I had a Caesar Salad. There could have been 1-2 more ounces of chicken on it. It had about 4-5. It was a $13 dollar salad, and I think that was the cheapest one. I would go back, but only for the happy hour deals. No mores salads for me. I updated this. The food was ok for the happy hour. I was disappointed, but might be back. I might go to another establishment instead."}
{"text":"One of our favorite date night or girls night locations! Food is good, wine selection is nice and we always enjoy the people watching from one of the tables at the bar! Although you can take kids - we never do...some places we like to keep to ourselves:-)"}
{"text":"VERY good experience. The food was great and they kindly offer a very generous military discount to our Vets, which is greatly appreciated. While the food did take a little too long to come out, it was amazing once it got there. The apricot salmon was the best fish I've had in the burgh. Friendly staff, warm atmosphere, and great food; what more could you ask for?   Strongly recommend."}
{"text":"Came in for their advertised breakfast only to be surprised that on Sunday's, they only offer a brunch buffet. There wasn't much food left and it appeared that they didn't plan on refilling the containers. The food was overly salty, the poached eggs were rock solid, and the seafood was very suspicious. Not only was the food terrible, the staff all had terrible attitudes. Our waitress said maybe two words, messed up our drink orders, and spilled all of our coffees without apologizing. As our party was ready to leave, we were even MORE surprised that this terrible buffet cost roughly $25 per person! Dissatisfied is an understatement."}
{"text":"Decent place, but we waited too long for our party's food and when it came it was good, not great. Service was spotty, but friendly. There are too many choices in the area for me to come back here."}
{"text":"Stopped by for Bloody Mary's on a Sunday morning. They were great. Bartender was attentive. This place used to have a Bloody Mary check list that you could complete and have the drink made to your liking. They don't offer this anymore. They should bring it back."}
{"text":"Very good food and great service from Ryleigh!  The food was freshly made and hot!  Everything tasted great and was cooked the way it was ordered!  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Fantastic service and great food!  My wife and I were seated at a booth. The wait staff was incredibly friendly and prompt. They were super kind to us with our newborn baby."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a great dining experience in Wexford, Walnut Grill is one of the best places to check out!   My boyfriend and I came here on a busy Saturday night. We expected to have to wait for a table, but we were seated right away. Our waitress was wonderful. Very kind, knowledgeable, and attentive. My glass of water was never less than half full.   On special that night was the lump crab quesadilla. I'm not a huge seafood fan, so I was a little skeptical about trying it, but I gave in nonetheless. This was the BEST quesadilla I've ever had. Absolutely delicious. I couldn't get enough of it. Walnut Grill knows how to make an excellent.   For my entree, I ordered the turkey club. It was really good. Like, really, really, good. It was served with a side of fries. I enjoyed the cranberry spread that was on the sandwich, it added a nice tang.   We decided to splurge a bit and ordered the creme brulee for desert. (Who doesn't love creme brulee?) This wasn't the best creme burlee I've ever had, but it was still pretty darn good!   Overall, wonderful experience. Great food, wonderful staff. My only reason for 4 stars is the prices. Things are a bit pricey here, so just be aware of that. Other than that, I can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch last week and had a so-so experience. My dish, the balsamic grilled chicken  was cold and small. My dining companion had the Pittsburgh Chicken Salad and loved it, though I think it would have been better with a mixed lettuce instead of iceberg. I am not sure I will be back."}
{"text":"Went to this place for the first time with friends. I thoroughly enjoyed it. We got pork nachos for an appetizer that were smothered in cheese, sweet & sour sauce I believe & jalapeños with salsa on the side. They were amazing. I got the sweet & spicy chicken with mashed potatoes which was really unique from anything I've ever had. My wife had the buffalo chicken wrap which she said was really good. We will surely be returning to this place."}
{"text":"This one star is for the two orders we returned.  The cheesesteak sandwich was allegedly prime rib sliced thin and it was raw when I bit into it.  Outside seared but the inside just thawing pre-sliced unknown cut of beef.  That is how I saw that the beef was not marbled sliced prime rib.  The glutamate was not released from the protein by proper cooking of thin sliced beef and the blood from the thawing part suggested hemolysis of the blood from refereeing.    The Reuben's sandwich had two slices of marbled rye that were not equally toasted on the griddle.  The staff was trying to pass off the inconsistency of the bread as that of the marbling in the dough.  Rather than immediately offering a redo of the dishes it took a manager to decide the return.    Half an hour to wait for food.   From time order was taken."}
{"text":"I got a gyro which was probably a bad idea and the flat bread was uneventful. Gave them at least 3/5 because the cocktails were good."}
{"text":"Prompt and friendly service with great food. Our book club meets here  a few times throughout the year and each time the food gets better (or my choices get better!) Servers are always attentive, cheerful, and keep the drinks and water flowing.  I was initially skeptical of the price of the wild mushroom chicken, but was thoroughly impressed when my entree showed up. The portion was generous and soothed my hangry soul. I've done the pick a pair in the past, but in the future the entree is definitely worth the price! The garlic mashed potatoes had the perfect amount of garlic for this \"everything could use garlic person.\" I'm still thinking about them..... The caesar salad, was....as expected a caesar salad. Great selection of beers on draft! Definitely a worthy option for a meal if in the area!"}
{"text":"Well, this Saturday night was busy for a dinner.    The kitchen was understaffed, bar was -way- understaffed, and more servers were needed.  Food came out very late and barely warm.    We ordered a 2nd round of drinks after rejecting the Long Island Ice Tea as it was far far too sweet -- undrinkable for one of us.  As we were getting ready to leave and waiting for food far longer than we felt appropriate, our second round of drinks came out (ordered long ago...). Tables that were there when we came in were still waiting on food when we left.    The waiter showed that he had them removed from our bill which was nice.  We tipped him well as he would have no control over these back of the house issues.  Manager came around asking \"how was your food.\"  He should have been doing quality control in the back of the house and call in additional workers.    We will try again at some point but stay away from the times where the staffing is not adequate."}
{"text":"Started with italian bread and cinnamon butter.  Both were much to my liking, bread was super soft on the inside, light crunch crust outside but it was not too hard, just right in my opinion.  The cinnamon butter was nice blend of cinnamon and brown sugar imparting distinct flavor and sweetness.    Ordered the Pork Osso Bucco, sweet potato fries and a side Garden Salad with raspberry vinaigrette dressing.  Salad dressing was nice, salad was average, fresh but like the kind you get in a prepared salad bag.    Pork was salty but not very tasty.  I would not order it again.  Flavor did not get into the pork.  Sweet potato fries look homemade and were well done.  Bread and butter - 5 stars Side Garden Salad - 3 stars Pork Osso Bucco - 2 stars Sweet Potato Fries - 4 stars"}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try this new neighborhood place ever since it opened up.  We went here on a Friday night.  The bar area was pretty much filled up, but there was a comfy booth area for me and a gf.  The bar is very stylish and modern, nice ambient lighting, contemporary upholstery, and best of all, huge LCD TV's so we could hopefully watch the Giants beat the Patriots.  We started off with martinis, my friend had a Bellini-tini which she claimed was delicious and mine was an excellent melon flavored concoction.  I could not make up my mind about dinner and asked our waiter for suggestions.  We both opted for the jumbo lump crab cakes at his suggestion.  Dinner was off to an excellent start with a super delicious mixed wild greens salad, the raspberry vinaigrette was good enough to drink.  It was served with warm crusty bread, so yummy.  The crab cakes however, were very disappointing.  They had a little bit too much filler and quite frankly, they just weren't cooked enough.  The accompanying potatoes were good as well as the fresh green beans.  We passed on dessert, but the Giants beating the Pats would have been a sweet enough treat.  I said would have.....  I will definitely be returning, I do like this restaurant.  It has a fresh fun feel to it.  And the food ain't really half bad either.... And while it's far from a favorite restaurant, it's a good place to eat."}
{"text":"I came here for a late night happy hour. They had $4 long islands and half priced boneless wings and flatbreads. We each ordered a long island (which were a little more tart than usual) and shared a few different flatbreads and wings. My bf has had the wings before and said they were amazing, but this time they were just so-so. I had the margarita flatbread with a 'tomato ragu.' The 'ragu' was just a roasted tomato on top of each slice. I didn't really taste the garlic-basil oil, so the only thing that really gave it flavor was the cheese. I would have preferred to taste that oil or have more of a tomato sauce on the flatbread. My bf got the pittsburgh pizza - basically a BBQ chicken pizza with fries on top. It was good, but I thought it was too similar to the BBQ chicken pizza."}
{"text":"I have to downgrade my stars, service when we went was terrible. Our waiter had to be flagged down to refill our drinks a few times. He didn't bring our food. It just was not good. Took him 20 minutes, solid before he came back after he came with the check and at that point we were tired of waiting for everything so we opted out of dessert. The food was solid but the service will keep us from coming back. Terrible! Training needs to happen and these issues need addressed. Why do you have to flag down your waiter for everything? Really disappointed!"}
{"text":"Nice dinner.  Parmesan chicken and a margarita.  Very good.  Excellent service."}
{"text":"I came here for an engagement party and our group was given a private room near the back of the restaurant. The service was good considering there were 20 people in our party. The only complaint would be when the waitress brought out everyone's dessert but never brought utensils.  My only complaint about the food is that there are no healthy options on the menu. We were allowed to select a steak, chicken or fish entree from a special pre-printed menu. Each dish description sounded good (and relatively healthy) until you actually received your food. Everything with the exception of the steak was breaded and cooked in butter. I could smell it from a mile away. My chicken with wild mushroom dish was extremely heavy and not what I expected.  Overall, nice restaurant but the food could use some improvement."}
{"text":"We had our engagement party here 2 years ago and the managers I worked with were very nice and made everything within the budget without compromising the quality and quantity of the food.  We had the wild mushroom chicken, parmesan crusted chicken, a beef dish and a fish dish.  We got the brownie works for dessert, which is one of the reasons why we chose this place for our engagement bc brownie sundaes is our thing.  The only thing about that party was that they had one server for our party of 25.   Anyway, I do frequent this place for the food and happy hour.  It's nice in warmer weather where they open the outdoor patio and have a bar outside.  The strawberry bellini-tini is delicious.  They have a daily drink special and it's also one of the ony places that have firefly sweet tea vodka.  I recommend this place although they really need to do something about the parking lot because there are times when it's so crowded that I get turned off to stay.  Service is also inconsistent."}
{"text":"Made reservations here for Valentine's Day and when we got there, the hostess tried seating us in a crammed corner, cafeteria style. Another couple was way too close to us. We asked to be moved and the staff was hesitant about seating us elsewhere since they expected to be busy that evening, but we were moved and the food came out quickly. The French onion soup was very filling and the mojito's were refreshing. The entrees were kind of bland and small and i don't think they're quite worth the high price, to be honest. This place is a tad bit on the pricey side so i would save a trip back here for a more special occasion."}
{"text":"These guys do a pretty good job and it was a good last stop after a long day of meetings.  Megan, John and myself landed here at about 9PM.  I think I've been to all of the locations for this walnut restaurant group.  In general I'd say they specialize in upscale bar food in a comfortable casual atmosphere.  We got here last night to a relatively busy bar for a Tuesday night.  The atmosphere is pretty contemporary.  The bar itself is large their is plenty of booth seating. I was very pleased with the bar staff.  They both were attentive and friendly while not being intrusive and quick with a strong pour.  I like the fact that they have guiness on tap at all these locations and stuck pretty much to this except for the final nightcap of ketel dirty rox.  We had just left the beautiful but food wise underwhelming d'vine and were in the mood for some good bar food which we got.  We ordered the \"boneless wings\".  I don't know why places insist on referring to these as boneless wings when they are really just chicken fingers dipped in hot sauce. Nevertheless they were really good, crispy not overcooked chicken fingers.  We also tried the potstickers which were so so.  They really didn't have much flavor and I actually prefer the ones at TG McFunsters.  I think we also tried the stuffed hot peppers, but I really can't recall.  It's possible I'm just confusing an earlier meal with this one.  Finally Megan ordered the chocolate cobbler.  Now, I'm not much of a dessert guy but this was really good.  It was rich gooey chocolate with whipped cream and strawberries.  This is a good spot and better to support a local organization than the mega chain franchisees which mostly populate this area."}
{"text":"Overpriced and cold food. If this is what you want then this is the place for you. Slow service due to recent layoffs and prices have increased."}
