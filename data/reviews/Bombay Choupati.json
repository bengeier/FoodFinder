{"text":"This is a great little family run indian restaurant.  The food was very good, I had a chicken vindaloo dinner combo for $11.95.  It was the best value meal I had this visit to Montreal."}
{"text":"The best Indian food that I know of anywhere. Small family owned and operated restaurant with lots of charm. They are often full and have waiting lines for both takeout and seating. Butter chicken and Naan bread are incredible!"}
{"text":"Well this is going to be one of the easiest reviews I have ever written for a restaurant. My first experience with Indian food was about 12 years ago with takeout and it was horrible. I kind of dragged This fear of Indian food with me unconsciously until a friend of mine, who is Indian, brought me to this Establishment. What is really key, key, key about this restaurant is that everything without exception is prepared fresh, from scratch. Nothing is prepared in advance and warmed up or stocked up in the morning for the days clientele. That's why service can sometimes take a little bit of time but the extra wait is well worth the delicious fresh indian fare you are enjoying there. The masala dosa which is a very large very thin crêpe stuffed with potatoes is absolutely unbelievable. Priced at about five dollars it can easily satisfied a small Appetite. The spicy version of the masala dosa is just as good. My go to meal there has to be the tandoori chicken plate. It consists of three generous deliciously grilled pieces of chicken accompanied by rice and a generous piece of naan. The naan there is completely delicious. It is lightly toasted and butter. I have tried other Indian restaurants as well as Pakistani restaurant but the fact that this restaurant prepares everything fresh from scratch Offers, in my opinion, the most mouthwatering Indian fare on the island."}
{"text":"This restaurant has among the friendliest and hardest working staff we have ever encountered. My glass of water was always filled quickly! Often before I could finish it.  The food was fantastic. Hot and fresh from the kitchen. The portions were great. A little more than enough person, but not quite enough for two, but obviously, that depends on your appetite.  The tables and cutlery were clean. I did not check the restroom. They accept Visa & MasterCard, but no American Express. There was plenty if parking in the lot outside.  Overall, a wonderful experience. It was highly recommended by friends, and we'll recommend it ourselves now."}
{"text":"Best Indian food in Montreal and the nicest owners and wait staff.  You should try everything on the menu at least once... I have :)"}
{"text":"Superb - you must all visit! Very friendly and above all - authentic - great beer too :-)"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Indian restaurant in Montreal, and I've been to my fair share! Great food, great service. I love the fact that their food *isn't* drenched in oil, like most other Indian restos. Big peeve. But the folks at BChoupati have everything down pat."}
{"text":"Wow!  If you're looking for the best in Indian cuisine, this is the place to go. Great service. Not inexpensive but worth every cent. Go early because it fills quickly with their regulars. I always leave 20-30% gratuity so that they remember me (not really necessary but they earn it)!"}
{"text":"This is by the far the highest quality and best tasting Indian food I've had in Montreal! Service is excellent but they're understaffed. It's still well worth the wait as the food here is consistently amazing! Every dish here is exquisite, you really can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Had a really nice Dosa  here for dinner tonight and when it came time to pay for the meal I was sure she had made a mistake.  The Dosa was delicious, the service friendly and welcoming.  I'd recommend this without hesitation, and hope to get back soon."}
{"text":"Un resto indien vraiment excellent à Montréal! Le service est aussi bon que la bouffe, avec un staff très souriant et chaleureux qui accueil avec amour.  Le décor est modeste mais on ne manque pour rien dans ce lieu très intime. Les mets sont très authentiques et préparés avec soin. Le menu offre de très bon combo avec bon rapport qualité/prix et le menu végé est très varié.   Je suggère fortement les entrées qui sortent un peu des habitués de la bouffe indienne; Bombay Bhel et Pani Puri sont mes préférés.   Je suggère fortement!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and pleasant staff in a small usually quite busy place.   Best dosa!!!  Great for veg and meat eater."}
{"text":"Butter chicken is worth the detour. Everything else tried is solid. Perfect for takeout"}
{"text":"I visited Bombay Choupati for the first time in 3 years last night, and was disappointed.   The service from Jay was perfect as usual- the 2 servers handle the busy room very well considering the high turnover of tables.   The food was just not up to par, and a far cry from what I remember.   I chose the chicken tikka combo- I received chicken that tasted a bit funky (perhaps grilled near/same surface as some goat?) there was a distinct gamey quality that didn't sit well.  The rice was very overcooked, and had obviously frozen mixed vegetables in it- corn, peas, carrots...  Just unnecessary.  I'd prefer a properly-prepared plain Basmati as (I think) it was on my last visit.   The vegetable curry served with every combo had a nice flavour- but I believe it was the same saucy potato that filled my masala dosa, which was lovely.   The dosa came with a broth-like sauce with the same insipid vegetables in it.   These shortcuts really stood out and I unfortunately will not be going back.   I'm quite sure they will be fine without me- there was a lineup out the door, and the place was full at 6 pm when we arrived.    I have always enjoyed the place and it's run by a lovely family.  I hope that they will read this with open minds, because I KNOW they can do better.  Otherwise, the Cobra beer on tap was good."}
{"text":"If ambiance is not part of the pleasure of your dining experience, I give this Indian restaurant 4 stars because the food and service were very good.  Having said that, the restaurant was small, tight, pokey and so dark that my husband was a black silhouette against the window light behind him. The decor is very dark and tired, however, I understand that the restaurant will be expanding to next door with a big renovation in the summer (of 2017). We will revisit then.  The host was cheerful, charming and obliging. To me the meal was rendered less appealing also because of the plate which was a kind of metal camping or prison dish divided into sections . The food itself was tasty and the meal more than enough. I really appreciated the fresh coriander on top of the vegetables.  The butter chicken was tasty. My husband's beef curry was too 'cinnamony' for my taste but he liked it.  Overall it was a tasty meal in a less than pleasant environment for a reasonable $9.95 but things will be changing for the better!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best butter chicken in Montreal. The long drive to that end of the city is worth it!  I've tried the Butter Chicken, Lamb Curry, and Masala Dosa - and I rate them in that order.  My Friends tried the Chicken Tikka and Tandoori chicken and gave \"delicious\" as their verdict. Appetizers are good but nothing worth mentioning.  Service is prompt and Friendly.  Accepts Credit Cards.  P.s. : if you end up there, don't leave without getting that butter chicken! Trust me, you won't regret."}
{"text":"Went with the family at around 5 on a saturday. The service was quick and courteous. The person that served us (Jay)was very helpful as we were not very familiar with the cuisine. The flavour was amazing and the butter chicken was sooo tender.  We will definitely go back.  I think its important however to try to go earlier as there was a line up as we left at around 6 pm"}
{"text":"Nous connaissions de bons restaurants indiens à Montréal, mais ce fut une révélation quand nous avons commandé des plats chez Bombay Choupati.  WOW !  À notre avis, c'est le meilleur restaurant indien à Montréal.  Tout est savoureux, bien épicé et parfumé.  Le personnel est toujours souriant.  Nous avions toujours commandé pour emporter, mais avons décidé de manger au resto pour la première fois dimanche dernier.  Même qualité des mets et même service accueillant en salle.  Manger sur place nous a permis de découvrir les entrées minutieusement préparées.  Il faut y aller !!!  Et leur pain nan est absolument délicieux."}
{"text":"I came here for the wonderful Yelp reviews, and frankly I was disappointed.  The food was much pricier for Indian cuisine, comparing to what I had elsewhere, and the quality is not really that marvellous. The curry was slightly watery, the portions were small, and the naan I got was 70% burnt on one side. The appetizer that was recommended by the waiter was really mediocre, and it was too sour (probably too much vinegar).  I had the Lamb Curry Thali and I enjoyed the spiciness of the curry and the vegetarian dishes, that extra kick really boosted the flavour of the whole plate a lot better. The Tandoori Chicken was dry and burnt, although it tasted nicely.  The service was great, the waiter was very polite and helpful. Food came out fast but the quality was subpar.  Final verdict: it is definitely not the \"best Indian restaurant in the whole Montreal,\" as claimed by some reviewers, seriously there are way better places on the northeastern part of the island. Maybe I went there on an off-night, but it was really not what I expected."}
{"text":"Their thali are pretty good. All the non-vegetarian curries are good. And we like their chat too. Food is very flavourful and they can adjust the spice level to your liking. We are not a big fan of their Vegetarian dishes or the dosa. The service is always warm and friendly.  It's a small family run restaurant which has been around for many years. And they have been consistently serving great Indian food all those years."}
{"text":"Amazing Indian restaurant! The butter chicken and chicken madras are really good! The size of the portions are ideal and I really enjoy the atmosphere although it is a bit crammed in there"}
{"text":"This is definitely one of the best Indian meals I've had. Each dish was so flavorful. I loved the dosa, butter chicken, goat vindaloo. I would have ordered their enter menu if I could. Their masala chai was great. I would stick to the meat dishes. Not the best palak panner I've hard. Cheese was quite hard and the spinach was very dark. We went around 7pm at dinner time and had to wait about 20 minutes. It was very popular with families and foodies.   I liked the booth seating and even though the restaurant was at full capacity, it wasn't too loud and I felt like each table had its own privacy because there was enough space between them.   The woman running the show was extremely efficient. She was good. She took our order, gave great recommendations, super friendly, and was quick with our needs. The two other employees were nowhere as efficient as her. The downside is our masala chai at the end literally took ~15 + minutes. I'm not sure if they had to reboil the water, but it took extremely long that we almost wanted to get the bill to leave."}
{"text":"I've been passing by this place for a while and I finally decided to go. I'm glad I did, food was delicious. I ordered the chicken tandoori plate, it came with 3 pieces of chicken, some rice, 2 naans and some saucy potatoes. Except for the rice everything else was very flavourful and very delicious. Will be coming back to this place again."}
{"text":"Great food, generous portion and amazing customer service. It's a restaurant owned by a family. I will return again for sure"}
{"text":"After eating in so many Indian restaurants in the WI and the city, Bombay Choupati is hands down the best, freshest, and amazing Indian restaurant I have been to. A gem, always busy, they don't take reservations :(  But truly delicious!"}
{"text":"The foos here is amazing, the only bad thing is that sometimes they are too busy for takeout.  Other than that ia consistently goos"}
{"text":"The food is good but way overpriced. The appetizers doesn't deserve the price as per the portion and presentation."}
{"text":"I had the butter chicken combo for dinner. The food was good but definitely overpriced and a bit overrated. Not the best Indian food I've ever had."}
{"text":"Really delicious!!!  We got the Chicken Tikka and Butter Chicken dishes. Really amazing. Perfect amount of spices and flavor!"}
{"text":"Best Indian food in Montreal, not just the West Island. Everything is seriously delicious, and it's all homemade, even the yogurt. It's far, and in a weird place, but really worth it."}
{"text":"My favourite Indian restaurant in Montreal. Don't think I've ever had better. And the family that run it are just so amicable."}
{"text":"It's good but I had better... their butter chicken looks like a soup and it's kind of over priced compared to many other good Indian places. I recommend trying it but I wouldn't go there a second time."}
{"text":"Sans delicatesse et ni l'avoir subtile pour un deuxième regard, la façade s'efface dans le paysage gris du complexe commercial. La forme s'affronte au fond de sa matière culinaire et laisse un contraste manifeste.   Les thalis poulet au beurre et curry à l'agneau sont présentés au même rigueur que leur goût, soient riches en épices, tout plein de couleurs et des portions suffissantes à la fois en qualité et quantité. Un service qui concilie courtoisie et présence assidue."}
{"text":"I've been a patron here since 2004 and still love it. The food IMO is better than the \"hotspots\" in Park Ex. There aren't many good places to eat in the West Island but they've got a great spot in Bombay Choupati. The dosa and it's wonderful potato filling, the curries, especially the shrimp one, the Vindaloo and Madras are also favourites. And not enough can be said of the hospitable staff from Jay to the lovely owner woman who always pops her head out from the kitchen to say, \"hi\"."}
{"text":"Best indian food EVER!!!  I've been coming here for years as well as everyone else in my family and we don't even live in the West Island anymore.  I love indian food and I've tried just about every place in Park Ex and nothing compares. Being a south indian restaurant means that they serve goat yummm and have some other interesting things on the menu that arent served everywhere.  They're all worth trying! The only issue I have ever had with this place is that sometimes there can be a line up and there have been times where they have been closed without notice.  Its not fun when you're coming from far, just to specially eat there but I've learned my lesson and now I always call first."}
{"text":"I've come here 4 times now, and it's still the same: terrible. I've read a lot of the reviews on here and the one I think got it right is someone that gave this place 3 stars.  First off, my lamb madras (thali) was FULL of bones, which makes it impossible to enjoy.  The portions are very small...they put the (thin and burnt) nan bread in the biggest compartment (where most put the rice and bread and salad!) Than the rice is in the middle (bigger) of the 3 other compartments, and the boney  lamb madras and boring potatoes in the last 2 compartments. Oh yeah, I had to ask the waiter for a menu?! Their water needs to be filtered... The music is good but kept stopping and had to ask to put it back on. I got there for lunch and was very hungry. The meal left me hungry. Portions are way too small. The oils that they use are not easily digestible.  9 hours after I ate there, I still don't feel right. I guess people like this place cause it's cheap? When I parked I noticed garbage ALL OVER the parking lot, even an  empty 40 oz. bottle of vodka. This whole area and restaurant have no standards. This is not representative of tasty, lovely indian food I've experienced at restaurants on Jean-Talon or Darbar on St-Laurent.  After 4 times I will never be going back. This was not an off day. This is just not a great place."}
{"text":"I love this place, best Indian food in the West Island. Since its a a small mom and pop operation service can be a little slow. But its definitely worth the wait. Everything from their tandoori's to their Korma's is fantastic. I highly recommend the Bombay Bhel, its full of flavor a spices and it is sure to please."}
{"text":"Good South Indian cuisine .. crispy savory dosas and chaat. Clean and ambient. Family run and the nicest people you ever want to be served by. Worth the trip to Dollard!"}
{"text":"Packed every night for good reason. Be prepared to wait - but it's so worth it. Such amazing food, kind service.  Great butter chicken, naan, delicious vegan options"}
{"text":"No. Just no. I'm a brown guy and I've had my share of Indian food but this is just sad. Don't even bother with classic indian meals. The only thing they got decently enough was the butter chicken. For obvious reasons."}
{"text":"Came here for a coworker birthday lunch. I had previously been told it was delicious by a close friend so it was already on my radar to try it out.   No joke, it was the BEST butter chicken I've ever had. Spicy, flavourful, rich and creamy, I will be going back for it!! The naan bread was ok and the rice was decent but I found the vegetarian curry blah in comparison.  The waiter was making some jokes which could be taken as offensive but I didn't really mind it.   Delicious, quick, cheap - will be going back for that butter chicken!"}
{"text":"Best Indian restaurant in the West Island without a doubt. Fresh, delicious and always friendly staff. 13$ for for most dinner meals and so many options to choose from. Be ready to wait for a table. Sometimes up to 30 minutes but you will not be disappointed in the least. Authentic 100%"}
{"text":"Before I start my review, please be warned, the restaurant gets full at 5:15pm on weekends (Friday, Saturday and Sunday). You must come here before 5:30pm or you will have to wait. I have been here numerous times and I do wait occasionally, but it is never long.  I have went many times to Scarborough and Brampton in Ontario, and they probably have the best south Asian cuisine in Canada (sorry Surrey, BC), but when I am in my hometown, I have to go come here.  We love everything ranging from the vegetarian menu to the chicken dishes. We absolutely love the Masala Dosa (spicy) and the Aloo Gobi. Whenever I come here, I normally eat those two dishes and I am totally full.  Although, I also recommend the Chole, Aloo Baigan, Tikka Chicken, Curry Chicken, and Tandoori Chicken. Their basmati rice is also amazing.  Waitstaff is super friendly and listens to you, that is a plus for me!  Bon appetit!"}
{"text":"Friendly wait staff. Not a fancy place using Corning ware for dishes. Prices were a little high but ok. Had the lentil soup which I though was excellent with the right amount of spice. Had the shrimp Madras - medium heat. It could have been a bit spicer . The Madras had a sweet undertone, which I though was unusual. Overall, give them a try"}
{"text":"Hands down the best Indian food in Montreal!!! Make the time to get out the West Island and eat there.  Home cooked by a young woman, with her brother helping to run things.  Love! It! The only bad review that this restaurant got was by a guy that gave the Keg 5 stars! LOL! Go figure!! Will keep going back because it is fabulous."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a SCAM!!!  My absolute WORST culinary experience ever!!!  ....philosophically speaking, this restaurant serves a very important utility ... if you want to feel grateful for all lemons in your life, visit this place at least once in your life...  Operated by what seems a collective of inter-related Gujarathis, they are here for making a quick buck and put to shame other Gujarathi run businesses that want to deliver value for money paid.   Here I am not sure how they got such raving reviews, - did each relative /employee of the joint ask 5 of their friends to post positive reviews? I have not seen the reviews grow in number since a couple of months I visited for my first and last time!  For starters, the name 'Choupatty' is incorrectly spelled after the famous Mumbai beach 'Chowpatty'  the home of delightful world famous street food and mumbai snacks - with this bunch of scammers using the name to waylay unsuspecting customers with promise of similar culinary experience!  Next so typical of Gujarathi cuisine, the dishes are a sorry pathetic imitations of the original 'Chowpatty', topped with excess of sugar or sugary sour taste with raw ingredients put in the cooking pot and sloshed around with a hope of ingredients clicking together to become food which I felt only cattle would find amusing.   I could write more but ... writing trash about trash?"}
{"text":"Amazing gem in the West Island! Friendly family owned restaurant, great service. Never disappointed! Come early as they book up fast!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem close to the Montreal airport. I would give the place five stars if the kitchen door of the restaurant did not open into the restaurant. Besides that one remark all I have to say is good things about this place.  I ordered paani puri and my husband ordered sev bataka puri for appetizers - both the things were absolutely yummy. We followed up with palak paneer, tandoori roti, veg pulao and raita --- again all the things were so tasty and palatable that they ended up reminding me of home ... true home style cooking. Very fresh!  Definitely check this place out in case you are in Montreal, QC!!!"}
{"text":"A different kind of experience with this restaurant as the atmosphere is cozy and welcoming but the food varieties and taste it's not what I'm used to. The butter chicken needed more better and texture and the tandury chicken was a bit red to my taste but the nan bread it's fresh and yummy. It's an experience that you want to do for a change. And yes perfect place for vegans."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant. La qualité est au rendez-vous. Le service est dure à battre et la salle à manger est très propre comparé à d'autres restaurant asiatique du coin."}
{"text":"Have eaten here 5 to 6 times a year for the last 10 or 12 years and I have never been disappointed. This is some of the best Indian food in Montreal. Rarely is Indian food prepared with such a fine touch...not heavy, over seasoned but rather light and fragrant. This small family run restaurant is all about the food and making you feel welcome.   Expect to wait...but if you are in a rush, go to one of the many crappy buffets littered about town. The service is what one expects in a resto such as this....friendly and ordered.   The kids love the mango lassy and I am found of the British and or Indian beer they have on tap. No samosas( thankfully) but a nan that is heavenly...try the pain puri or some of the other specialities...just ask.  The vegetarian thali is excellent....and I am a huge carnivore! This has become a family favourite. One word of caution...they close a couple of times a year to go to India, usually around Christmas so it is worth calling ahead."}
{"text":"It all starts with the service. As soon as you walk in your welcomed like family. The food is simply exceptional. The butter chicken is a must. The chole also very good. Nothing here is fried. This is the best Indian restaurant I've ever tried (Bombay mahal doesn't come close!) special thank you to Jay for giving us a perfect dining experience. We would come back just for you but the food speaks for itself. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"The best Indian food in Montreal. Staff are extremely friendly and the food is delicious. Jay and his sister are able to accommodate the Richard spice dish and they do not disappoint. Hard to go anywhere else when you have this fine jewel of a restaurant."}
{"text":"The butter chicken, lentil soup and naan bread are just delicious. Definitely recommend"}
{"text":"The place is small however wins on tastes. We had regular vegetarian combos. The taste is homely. If you are looking for a quick homely lunch, don't miss out. However no fancy or lavish dishes."}
{"text":"Only 4 reviews so far?? C'mon Montreal, get with it!! You're either not using Yelp or you're averse to tiny suburban corner malls.  I've been living in Vancouver the past 20 years & have had many chances to hit local Indian restos as the South Asian community is massive in the Lower Mainland. All I can say is, Vikram Vij would breath a sigh of relief knowing that you have to cross 3 time zones in order to taste the best authentic Indian food outside of the subcontinent! Combo plates came up quickly and nice & toasty, from there it was a blur as I could not eat slow enough.  Damn, I've got 5 days left here & I don't if I can get through the whole menu in that time!!"}
{"text":"We were 5 girls at Bombay Choupati last night and everyone enjoyed the food. Especially the masala dosa (with a spicy coconut sauce which was so good with it), butter chicken, goat madras, gulab jamun and kulfi. The service was very friendly. Our waiter, Jay, was amused by our interesting conversations and chatted with us for a bit. Thanks for an awesome meal!"}
{"text":"On holiday in Montreal, I searched for an Indian restaurant that served dosas and came up with the Bombay Choupati which was in slightly unfamiliar territory for me. After a few GPS misdirections, I finally found this gem and was overwhelmingly surprised! The mango lassi was creamy fruity and delicious.  The vegetarian lunch special plate that I ordered was excellent!  I am heading back next weekend for more more more!!! This is the best Indian restaurant outside of Mumbai (IMHO)."}
{"text":"This is the best Indian food ever!   The butter Chicken, naan bread and appetizers are amazing. This is one of the restaurants that I miss the most in Montreal since moving to Florida."}
{"text":"Best Indian in Montreal!!  I now live in FL and I make sure to visit them every time Im in town! have the butter Chicken, the Chicken vendelu...this appetizer with chick peas..always forget the name...  only problem is that its small...and can take long for the food if you come at a busy time.. but well worth the wait!"}
{"text":"I came here with a friend based on his rave recommendation. Bombay Choupati didn't disappoint. Walking in, I noticed that the place was clean and well lit (a concern when it comes to Indian places.)  The friendly waiter suggested a beer that would go well with my taste and meal (he nailed it). The food came in generous portions and was quickly scarfed down. My only regret is telling them for medium spice when I really wanted \"burn-your-ass\" Indian. On the bright side, it's an excuse to go back :)  PROS:  - Friendly & knowledgable staff - Tasty food - Generous portions  CONS:  - They underestimate the spice tolerance of Canadians :)  Will be going back. This is now my go-to place for satisfying my Indian itch"}
{"text":"Some of the best Indian cuisine I've ever tasted. Bombay Choupati, is a little flavour bomb tucked away in the corner of a small strip mall, located at the end of Sources boulevard. The quality of the good is just so good, the spices are out of this world and are among the most traditional that I've ever tasted. I heard that they go back to India to restock themselves with more spices when they need to. Now you know that's gonna be some authentic stuff right there.  Well some of my favourite choices include the papri chat, Thali's, curries and rotis just to name a few.  If you live in the west or want to try some amazing Indian food, I would highly recommend that you come here."}
{"text":"I am writing this for myself rather than as a review of the restaurant, simply because I want to remember the names of the wonderful dishes we had. And yes, it is worth the drive out to the West Island. This place doesn't take reservations, and by 6:30  on Friday it was full. We started off with papadums and chaat (crispy snack with yogurt and tamarind sauce), followed by bhindi masala (okra), butter chicken and shrimp curry accompanied by rice and naans. We also each had a sweet milk lassi that was very light and not too sweet. The price is very reasonable and the food is great. There isn't too much ambiance, but with good friends and good food, who cares about ambiance?"}
{"text":"This is the best Indian restaurant, in my opinion. My family and I have been going there for the last 20 years. They never fail to make the best food. Their Masala Dosas are fantastic. We have tried them in other places in Montreal, and in other cities, and they are the best. It is a husband and wife team who cook, with their kids and family members who serve. A warm, reasonably priced restaurant with fantastic food. It more than worthwhile to drive to DDO."}
{"text":"It should have been 5 stars but the one hour wait for our food cost them a star.  You can tell this is a family business. Very small and feel at home type of place. Found it thx to yelp. The food was excellent and since we are spice seekers we asked everything spicy and boy was it ever. Even the Tandoori was spicy. My poor kids!!! But we polished everything including the 5 nan. I could see them looking at us threw the kitchen to see if we can handle the spice. And trust me WE CAN!!!! If anyone is looking for hot stuff these people have it. We plan to go back and probably next time it will be 5 stars."}
{"text":"Hidden gem located in the West Island. Food is excellent, spices are amazing. This is the spot to go for Indian food. I've tried others and nothing compares. It is so good that my friend goes there regularly even though he lives in the plateau. The place is not big so be prepared for a line on busy nights."}
{"text":"Excellent food and very friendly staff. The chicken tandoori is consistently delicious."}
{"text":"Came for take out and food was ready for pick up on time. We ordered butter chicken and curry goat both of which were very tasty. Staff was courteous, will definitely return!"}
