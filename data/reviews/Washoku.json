{"text":"Hinoki Sushi in Washoku: One of my new favourite sushi ayce in the sauga area! Came here on a Monday evening and the service was absolutely spectacular! Our two male servers really showed that they cared for our best possible dining experience, only wish I got their names. 

Try their tataki, all 3 options tasted wonderful! (Dinner menu) And of course, their house makimino roll and karage chicken are a definite recommend!

Great quality sashimi, beautifully decorated japanese style atmosphere, amazing service.. but the highlight of it all was their tempura green tea ice cream! Yummmm"}
{"text":"Washoku revamped its establishment once again from having 2 separate restaurants under one roof (Chako/Wasabi) to having 4. This restaurant is inspired by the \"concept of alleyway dining in the streets of Japan\" where each restaurant showcases different kinds of Japanese eats. The 4 restaurants in Washoku are Chako (Barbeque), Ninja (Teppenyaki), Hinoki (Izakaya), and Ichi Potto (Ramen/Shabu Shabu aka Hot Pot).

I had the chance to come and try Ichi Potto (Ramen/Shabu Shabu) with my girlfriend since coincidentally I was craving Ramen and she wanted Hot Pot, so it was perfect. 
**DISCLAIMER - This review is only for Ichi Potto, Have not tried the other restaurants yet in Washoku and will continuely update my rating in other reviews**

ICHI POTTO - 2/5 Stars
CHAKO  -  N/A
NINJA    - N/A
HINOKI  - N/A

First thing I gotta talk about Ichi Potto is the atmosphere. Once you get into the Ichi Potto part of the restaurant you are welcomed with a Rustic Japanese decor with ropes hanging off wooden posts, japanese seafood poster ads on the wooden walls and an instagram worthy backdrop of Sake containers. The feel and look of Ichi Potto really does add to the whole feel of the japanese atmosphere.

Possibly because of the new restaurant, we were greeted with a piece of paper that was basically our menu. The menu for Ichi Potto has all its Ramen for $11.95, 3 types of Shabu Shabu (hotpot) in the range of $18.95 - $20.95, Appetizers and 3 dessert options. Also to add, drinks are refillable when you purchase.

Continuing on, my girlfriend and I ordered Takoyaki ($5.99), the Spicy Miso Tonkotsu Ramen ($11.95) for myself and the Seafood Dashi Shabu Shabu ($20.95) for my girlfriend. I'll be upfront with it now, the portion sizes and amount you get for the price is pretty expensive in my opinion.

The Spicy Miso Tonkotsu Ramen was good but not really worth while. The things I enjoyed about this Ramen were the bouncy/chewy noodles and the tender marinated pork BBQ. Other than that, I would say that the broth of the ramen wasn't necessarily bland, but I would say subtle and could be better. One of my gripes about the broth as well is that I ordered it spicy, but it was not spicy at all, especially considering my girlfriend being sensitive to spicy food also didn't find it spicy at all. I would say that it has SPICES in it but not necessarily SPICY. My main complaint about this Ramen is that it comes in a small bowl and for the price point of $11.95, I'd expect to be satisfied but was still very hungry afterwards. I would honestly go to another place for Ramen to get a better bang for your buck.

Now onto the Seafood Shabu Shabu, this meal also includes a green salad, 4 pcs California Roll and Dessert. The Shabu Shabu in itself comes in a tray with the hotpot and various dishes, importantly I would say that this is fit for 1 person. The thing about the Shabu Shabu is just like the Ramen, and I feel as if you are not getting your best bang for your buck with the amount of food you get. Don't get me wrong the, it is a great experience but the ingredients you do get are not really amazing. realistically for the seafood, you get 2 sashimi salmon, 2 scallop, 4 shrimps, 2 tofu, 3 types of mushrooms (enoki, head and another long mushroom) and 4 pcs variation of fishballs. It came with 2 sauces which is abysmal for a hot pot, soy sauce and shrimp cocktail sauce. All in all, it did not fill my girlfriends appetite at all (possibly because I ate some of her california rolls but still... Like I said with the Ramen, you could easily go to another hot pot place to have more variety, better quality ingredients  and \"more bang for your buck\".

If anything the Takoyaki is the most sensible thing we ordered. It comes in with 6 pieces and is at at a reasonable price point of $5.99. The only thing is, is that it I had to ask for the sauce and it seemed like it was deep friend. It was crunchy on the outside and soft in the inside which was honestly pretty enjoyable.

My final thoughts over Ichi Potta is that I wouldn't recommend having either the Ramen or Hot Pot at this location. I feel as if you can go to a restaurant that specializes in both these dishes separately for a better price and a more filling portion for a way better price (at the same time, not sure if the minimum wage increase has an effect on the prices but it's pretty expensive for what you are really getting). I wouldn't come back to this part of the restaurant but will definitely try the other restaurants."}
{"text":"This place is a logistical mess. 

The concept of having a \"4 in 1\" restaurant is cool. It brings to mind \"Marché Mövenpick\", but Washoku fails in nearly every aspect. 

Firstly when you come in there are only 2 sets of menus that are taped to the front desk so only 2-4 people can actually see what the options are at a time. There is no signage or anyone explaining how a \"4 in 1\" restaurant works. Is it market style like Marche? is it buffet style? is it separate restaurants? 

It happens to be just 4 distinct \"restaurants\" (really rooms that don't get along) that aren't related at all in operation besides sharing a common hallway. Once you choose a restaurant you cannot enjoy any other \"restaurant\" without paying for a whole new meal. The concept of the 4 in 1 is therefore meaningless. 

The food quality is below average. Most items were worse than something you'd find at a Mandarin buffet. Low quality meats, sushi rolls made with too much rice, and grainy ice cream.

I love the concept but this place doesn't deliver."}
{"text":"Terrible food, zero quality and regard for taste. We opted to try Hinoki all you can eat sushi among the four restaurants. Torched sushi was not even torched. Dark chocolate cake was literally those  two-bite brownies you buy from the grocery store. $33 dollars plus tax and gratuity is already added came up to $40 dollars per person. Definitely not worth your money for such bad quality sushi. Worst AYCE sushi I've had so far."}
{"text":"Coming from Toronto, this place here is truly a trek for me. I decided, hey, if I'm going to travel wee out west, I might as well go for gold (We chose teppanyaki).

Now a little about the business. Washoku is essentially a 4 in 1 restaurant. They offer several dining experiences: teppanyaki, izakaya (ramen, sushi etc), shabu shabu, and bbq all under one roof. Sushi is AYCE for 31 ish dollars, probably for dinner, shabu shabu is roughly 20 bucks, bbq is around 25-30, and teppanyaki can go up to 40-50 bucks a head. Teppanyaki dining area was pretty posh and I opted for land and sea which consisted of salmon, shrimp and filet mignon. We were served 4 pcs of california roll, salad, miso soup, and complimentary dessert. They also served very fragrant tea which I believe is jasmine.The main meal came with veggies and steamed rice or you can get fried rice for $2 extra.

I have to say the quality of the meat is definitely up there although quantity was moderate. I think the cuts of meat including the salmon were good and fresh. Our chef didn't overcook anything, and my filet mignon was cooked perfectly medium rare. We even had a cool massive onion volcano to boot. Who doesn't love a good show? Service was friendly, warm, and attentive, chef included.

I recommend coming here if you want less of a crowd and quality meat. I definitely want to try their other dining experiences, maybe shabu shabu next time. This restaurant is located in a huge complex with theater nearby ,so why don't you do dinner at this place and a movie? Might work out pretty good!"}
{"text":"Hinoki review: Saw an ad on IG and got excited after i heard wasabi has packed up and renovated to a japanese food hall. Unfortunately it was only the name that changed. Quality of food items were mediocre at best. 

They did a good job with the renovations. It has an izakya atmosphere minus the crowd and noise. However, nothing else to rave about. 

I felt that the sashimi was best eaten cooked/ torched and they kept getting our order wrong + giving us less than what we asked for (which was reasonable, my family doesn't over order). The garlic beef steak felt mushy, didn't have that juicy steak feel to it. oh and they charge for tea too.

Not worth the $30.99 tag on the weekend dinner."}
{"text":"Washoku is my favorite place.  It combines four restaurants under one roof.  They have Ninja (Teppanyaki), Ichi Potto (Ramen & Shabu Shabu ), Chako (BBQ) and Hanoki (AYCE Sushi).  I was there last night at Hanoki and it was impossible to try everything but what I had were delicious.  It was fresh and large portion.  The Sashimi salad was delicious but it was missing salad dressing which made the lettuce a bit dry.  Please add Sesame salad dressing and it would kill it.  Lobster bisque was hot and tasty.  The deep fried squid balls and sirloin steaks were on point.  The  Octopus sashimi were the largest portion I have ever seen.  I was in heaven.  Staff are friendly and customer service is above and beyond my expectations. I would definitely go back even though it is far from home but it was worth the drive.  2 thumbs up to the staff."}
{"text":"Average food for the price. Poor service. Food ordered either wrong or never served. You have to constantly follow-up on the food you already placed an order. Portions are small."}
{"text":"Washoku is composed of four Japanese restaurants under one roof! There is the AYCE Korean bbq, AYCE sushi, a la carte teppanyaki, and a ramen and shabu shabu Restaurant.

The first thing that strikes you is the more upscale decor in the main dining rooms for KBBQ and teppanyaki. The sushi and ramen/shabu shabu room has an authentic \"Japanese Izakaya\" vibe which I personally loved! 

***My review is for Ichi-Potto which serves a la carte ramen and shabu shabu (Japanese hot pot).***

The food at Ichi-Potto was good but I can't say that it was great. We ordered the beef sukiyaki shabu shabu, but it was more of a shabu shabu and not a sukiyaki. The broth was a little sweet but overall it was a fun experience, as the set comes with your own pot with ingredients to add in. It also came with a California roll! 

The karaage tonkatsu ramen was decent! They have a large portion of karaage (although the spices don't strike me as Japanese). Also, the egg was not runny and there was a large amount of noodles. The tonkatsu broth was tasty, which held the dish together. 

Overall, Washoku is great for large groups who want to taste a variety of food - bbq meats, sushi, ramen, and teppanyaki. The servers were really kind and also offered complimentary appetizers and desserts!"}
{"text":"If you're looking to be disappointed by the cost, food and management, this is the place for you.

For the price we paid, for two people, $80 and some change... we got low grade quality food at its finest.

The interior design and the service of our servers were magnificent. I loved it. The food totally did not keep up.

Unfortunately, 12% service charge is automatic no matter what your party size is.

As I could see, each end of the restaurant had different amount of traffic. Where we sat; it was not as busy as the other hot spots. The servers are running around giving their A++ service while we have these two management in suits, just standing at the entrance taking to each other and observing the staff instead of getting to know the guests and helping out with the staff.

I've worked in a restaurant environment before and these managers needs to be axed. Useless. Goodbye.

All the hype for absolutely garbage. 

PSA BlogTO needs to stop hyping up places when they're completely trash and stick to what's good."}
{"text":"** This review applies to Hinoki**

The Good, The Bad and The Ugly

The Good:
- The server was nice and helpful!
- The inside decor and environment is better than most AYCE Sushi places that I have been to.
That's pretty much it.

The Bad:
- Food quality is mediocre. The sushi rolls were overfilled with rice. Seeweed papers on sushi were chewy. 
- The sashimi did not seem fresh at all.
-  Asked for Strawberry Cheese Cake and got store bought New York Cheese cake with few drops of strawberry jam on top.
- Asked for a regular green tea and got Jasmine green tea instead. They also charge you for this green tea even though you are paying $31 per person..
- Food Quality is not worth $31 at all.

The Ugly:
- This one is my favourite: I asked for a Dark Chocolate Cake and I got store bought Two Bite brownie with chocolate sauce on top. Classic!
- We got charged 12% service charge and we were only two people..We did send back 2-3 dishes because it simply did not taste good. I am not sure if we were charged because of that, but if anyone is considering this \"sushi\" place, please confirm about this service charge before ordering."}
{"text":"It was cozy, but the menu was disappointing. 

I tried the following and all of them failed to meet my expectatios.


Shrim Tempura - tasteless and the dipping sauce was ok.

Deep Fried Prawns - its not even prawns. You can buy it any ready made torpedo shrimp

Shoyu Ramen - salty and the fishy flavour was overwhelming

Fried Soft Tofu - was alright

Fried Chicken Wings - too much five spice and I can still taste it as speak. Tastes like Chinese Food rather than Japanese food.


Dark Chocolate Cake - store bought mini brownie."}
{"text":"This place use to be wasabi and was renovated. It has a nice look and feel and the servers were attentive and friendly but the food was not up to par. We opted to try HINOKI their ayce sushi. For $30.99 not worth, and on top of that 12% service charge (only 2 people eating). The server told us the 12% service charge is for the manager? So tip is additional."}
