{"text":"Ordered one of their party trays. The portions were sort of on the skimpy side. Presentation was not good. The rolls and nigiri were sort of mashed up against each other, which made it kind of embarrassing when it was tabled at our party. Quality and taste was nothing spectacular, just your average fare. Also, they forgot about our soups."}
{"text":"This place has a great selection for all-you-can-eat, the prices are reasonable. I don't really order anything else than all you can eat or salmon lover lunch special. If you get delivery make sure you check your order though because they have messed my order up countless times, being g from forgetting a MISO soup to forgetting my spicy mayo... Also make sure your roll is right, iv asked for spicy cali roll and often get no spicy mayo lol. It's a good place to go for cheap sushi."}
{"text":"I can't understand why does this place has such low ratings. We went there for lunch and had pretty good time. It was not the best place, but quality was good and very tasty, service was fast. Also we got water very soon after we gave first order sheet and were getting refills frequently. Prices are average. Definitely will come back and try dinner menu."}
{"text":"This restaurant is always reliable, clean, fast and very tasty. Always a great place to go for lunch and I have had many business meetings here that work well in this environmet. Food never fails to be wonderful and fresh."}
{"text":"Sushi was good, server was not; She didn't bring our menus for like 10 minutes. She forgot what we wanted, and sighed with a huff when we asked for the firehouse roll, she let out an exasperated puff. She took my plate when I wasn't looking,  then blamed it on being her first Saturday working. At least she admitted that was inappropriate to say,  so she plopped down our bills and hurried us on our way.  Go there for the sushi, it was delightfully mediocre, actually don't go, you'd have more fun staying at home playing poker."}
{"text":"Service here is always a gamble - they sometimes get stuff wrong or forget items, but when they do get it right (which is most of the time) it is very good."}
{"text":"Terrible service, and incredibly rude waitress and kitchen staff. In fact, we can clearly hear the staff talking about us in the back!  We were there approximately an hour before closing. However, the waitress was incredibly impatient and was rushing us to order. At the end, she even complained to us about having to wait on us to order our food.  All in all, the food was mediocore. I will definitely not be going back! Stay away from this place!"}
{"text":"Got there during their All You Can Eat which was limited and the food was blah. Its sad went Loblaws actually makes better sushi then a Japanese restaurant. It wasn't worth the 12.99$."}
{"text":"A great All-you-can-eat option at $19.99. Very good fresh sashimi, local friend says it's the best he can get after having tried several from downtown and this vicinity.  The sashimi on their buffet menu consist of red tuna (they limit the red tuna to 3 pcs per person), salmon, tai, surf clam, crabstick (if I have a gripe, it's this one. Fake kani on your sashimi list???), and what I thought is swordfish but they call it white tuna. Very good indeed for its level of freshness and quality considering it's buffet items.  Their tempura was another one you shouldn't miss, great batter and good fresh shrimp. Their mixed veg tempura came in only sweet potato version but it was good so complain there. But there was no tempura sauce, not sure if they overlooked it. We had some of their sushi, maki rolls and handrolls; all good! You can get unagi as sushi and handrolls, nice tender and well marinated slices with good eel fish fats. Handrolls were great as ingredients were fresh and nori was of good quality and crackling crisp. Tried their ton katsu which was sliced too thinly and greasy, so not so great. Their teriyaki salmon was over cooked so not cool.  They have Sapporo beer here, my preferred brand over asahi which they have too. Tall 700ml cans, what a great meal overall!"}
{"text":"The sushi here is decent for the price, I've had better in Toronto but it's better than grocery store fare. Now everyone's been saying how bad the service is here and I need to agree. You'll sit down and you see the server isn't busy but won't take your order for 15 minutes. The sushi doesn't come out quickly after that either. I come here from work and my break is short so this makes it hard to actually eat here.  Overall if you have the time and are desperate for some cheap all you can eat sushi in the beaches it's the place."}
{"text":"I was a little apprehensive to go here because some reviews said the service was very slow, but its within walking distance so we went for dinner last night.  Well the service was as fast as I've ever had by a very nice waitress, the food was yummy and the atmosphere relaxed.  I'll be returning for sure."}
{"text":"I've been here lots of time, and don't know why I'm seeing all these 1 star reviews.  Good sushi, good service, good price. Plus, it's one of the very few all-you-can-eat sushi's in the east end.  If you're thinking of going here.. go! It's good!"}
{"text":"Not too impressed with this sushi joint in the beaches.  Typically the busiest in the area and inexpensive, but the low quality is not worth cost savings.  Very little fish is usually found in specialty rolls.  Sashimi is dry and devoid of flavour so is obviously not very fresh.  Service is mechanical and unfriendly.  There are much better in the beaches."}
{"text":"Super fresh.  Great price for during the week.  Nice casual place.  The toronto roll is really good!"}
{"text":"Mediocre sushi. Not so bad in and of itself, but when you have to wait very long to receive it in a relatively empty restaurant, it doesn't help. For over $20/person one would be better off going to their local sushi place and not falling for all you can eat blandness."}
{"text":"I had walked by the fa√ßade of the restaurant numerous times and thought to myself how classy it appeared. When I finally decided to check this place out with a friend the inside was as elegant as the exterior. It has an atmosphere of finesse. The restaurant wasn't too busy for a Tuesday at dinner time and we got a quiet booth.  My friend and I began dinner with some veggie tempura as well as the miso soup and salad that came with the sushi combo we ordered. We were also pleasantly surprised when the chef sent out a complimentary tuna appetiser (tataki I believe). Afterward, our sushi and maki combo arrived at the table and looked great. There was a nice variety of fish and all of the sushi and maki were made well. It was my first time trying squid sushi which was quite an experience. It has an interesting texture I've never felt before.  Overall this restaurant was nice and had a good atmosphere! The food was solid, but the slight upgrade in quality, for me, wasn't enough to make up the difference in price. I'm not too picky and think I would rather spend a bit less money on an AYCE location and go to town on slightly inferior sushi. The sushi was superior, but only marginally so. Enjoyed this place anyhow and the service was excellent!"}
{"text":"Food was tasteless, bland and dripping in grease. Miso soup tasted like hot miso water. Fried veggie noodles tasted like the dirty pan they were fried in. No spices or sauces or flavourings whatsoever. Very few veggies, just squishy carrots and cabbage. So gross. Gyoza were a crime against gyoza. Full of something ground up that you can't identify, and with an unpleasant taste. Foul. Yam tempura was dripping in grease. Cheese wontons were just ok but the sauce served with it tasted rancid. All of the other sauces were so watered down they were verging on flavourless. We didn't finish anything except the side salad, and the dressing was weird on that as well. What a waste of money."}
{"text":"I've been to a few AYCE sushi places and despite the reviews I've read, this place isn't so bad. I was here a few days ago on a Saturday and maybe it was just my luck that everything was pretty good including the price! $21.99 for dt on a weekend! Usually it's more cuz it's the weekend but anyway price aside...  The food was not bad and all the things that came out were pretty fresh! Food mostly came out in a timely manner with the orders being correct. It was somewhat busy. We had 3 ppl in total so we had quite a few things to order. We are big eaters sooo yeah haha. The service was not too bad and also the servers were polite and responded well when you flagged them. I don't see any big issues aside from maybe getting one or two more servers to help out. Overall I think this is a decent AYCE place and should be given a bit more credit. Again, it could be just my luck and this was my first time going there..."}
{"text":"The all you can eat lunch menu is a good deal.BUT....  ......the service is the WORST in the entire Beach. Rude, lazy servers ignore you and usually get the order only partly correct. Also, when you ask for a second order (it is all you can eat!), the servers give you serious stink-eye!  This is based on a few visits. Hoping the really bad service was just bad luck, but NO! It is consistently HORRIBLE!  Avoid! Avoid! Avoid!  Yumei Sushi is better as is Japango or a few other places further down the strip."}
{"text":"Why does the east end get the short end of the stick when it comes to good, affordable Japanese restaurants (Sushi Marche aside and I have yet to try Guu)? We decided to try this place because one of us was cranky and hungry. Alright, I was cranky and my husband was hungry (it sounds like missing members of the 7 dwarves). We had already sat down when we heard this horrible horking noise coming from the kitchen. Most normal people would walk out then and there. We're meek people and decided maybe he was just clearing his throat and not spitting a loogy into the food.  I asked the server if he knew what the udon broth was made of. It was like I was asking him to figure out the square root of 2403403493020. This became such an ordeal, I gave up and ordered the vegetable tempura dinner instead.  The vegetable tempura was incredibly bland and the potato tempura was so thick and uncooked, it got left behind in the basket. Even the water tasted funny. It's probably not a good idea for the waiter to look into the glass as he approaches the table and look like \"oh hey! What the hell is that??\"  Bikkuri just plain blows!"}
{"text":"Terrible first impression. Yes it was packed but when asking about a wait time the waitress just looked at us and started talking to the cooks and started laughing and didn't address us. We left to go to Yumei sushi just a a block away. Waaaaay better sushi and atmosphere. Sorry but this won't get a good review from me.   We won't come back for sushi when the service is terrible."}
{"text":"Really good ayce sushi. Service is fast and polite if not particularly friendly. Lunch has an abundance of choices including seaweed salad, scallops and more. My favourite here is their spicy salmon roll."}
{"text":"Sushi is good but not spectacular. Menu is okay but not with a lot of variety (compared to other AYCE sushi places within the same price range) One big down side for me is that the lunch menu doesn't have seaweed salad. Service is okay but not the most efficient. Location is good so overall the place is average"}
{"text":"This restaurant serves very low quality fish.  I used to eat here for convenience, but as the quality continues to degrade I worry about my health.  The service has dropped significantly over the past six to eight months."}
{"text":"One of my friends and I always come here when we are craving sushi. Not because it's particularly good, but because we are fatties and this is the only all you can eat sushi restaurant in the Beaches that we know of.   Since I first started going to this place, I've discovered way better AYCE sushi places. The selection of food is quite small. They have the basic miso soup, edamame, seaweed salad, teriyaki, katsu, gyoza starters. They also have a limited selection of sushi and sashimi. Ice cream is their only dessert option. None of their specially sushi blows my mind. I find all of them very plain and uninspiring. We ordered a bunch of sushi tonight and most of them consisted of avocado and shrimp tempura. Not much creativity there. Sashimi seems to be fresh, but not served cold enough. By the time we got to the last piece of sashimi, we weren't too into it because it was at room temperature at that point. Salmon teriyaki was dry.   Service is not the greatest. We didn't have water until after our food was served. No refills were given. No quality checks were made. And we watched our server walk by our order sheet several times before she finally grabbed it. Granted, she was the only server working during a Friday night. However, the restaurant only has about 8 tables. Most people were gone by the time we got there. I try to be fair when judging service because I'm put in that position almost every day of the week, but I didn't feel like our server was particularly busy."}
{"text":"pretty good i would say and ive eaten a lot of sushi in my time.  this is an all u can eat concept that my friend and i tried and the food cane out in a timely efficient manner and the quality of food was good too.  honestly no complaints.   service could be a tad friendlier as it was pretty straight forward but otherwise it was reliable and i would go back for more sushi if i am in area."}
{"text":"I used to go to the Bikkuri on king street quite often and really liked the sushi there. So the name stuck with me and when this place opened a few years ago I was happy there was another location. However the food wasn't great when I tried it before. The sushi wasn't great quality and there was a lot of rice. Yesterday I ordered take out from here because I was on the area and decided to give it another try to see if things improved. It hasn't. We ordered the sushi for two dinner and a salmon teriyaki. The sushi has a bit nicer presentation but the fish is sliced very thin and there is a lot of rice. Some of the fish seems not fresh. The salmon teriyaki was a good portion but the sides was two pieces of broccoli and two pieces of carrots. Based on my most recent experience not sure if I would come back for take out. Overall not memorable place for sushi takeout."}
{"text":"I went here for AYCE lunch and it was ok. It was about $13 and had a nice selection. Things that aren't often on lunch menus were on the menu like unagi, ice cream, and cheese wontons. You can get refillable drinks for .99 which is a bonus. I'd say the food was on the high side of average. The rainbow roll has shrimp in it instead of california roll which made me sad as I hate shrimp but I ate it anyway. Also the picture is a gross misrepresentation. On the AYCE lunch menu the rainbow roll has avocado and tuna. In real life it is nothing but salmon and butter fish.  I didn't care for the service, it was very robotic and not very attentive. You seat yourself, write your order yourself, and have to flap your arms in the air if you need a drink refilled or want to place an order. I'll probably go back for a lunch if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Easily the worst sushi I've had in my life.  It is run by Chinese people who have no idea how to make Japanese food.  We ordered grilled salmon and there wasn't one burn mark on it, it was clearly microwaved.  You have crazy low standards if you give this place more than 2 stars.  You're probably the type of person that would buy roti and doubles from an Indian guy from Mumbai and think it was authentic.  Avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"Don't understand why this place has such low ratings, it's the best ayce sushi place in the city. Their lunch and dinner prices are fair, and I've never had a bad experience.  Granted, the service wasn't the best but you can't ask for much at an all you can eat place.  Sushi always tastes fresh, rice to toppings ratio is a lot better than some other places, simple menu so you're not too overwhelmed but still a wide variety to choose from.  Don't really have any complains and you should give this place a chance."}
{"text":"We had lunch here yesterday around 3:30 pm. I hadn't been to the Beach area since around 1995 when my brother had lived there and we drove out from Bronte for something to do on such a nice sunny day. We saw this place and decided it looked ok for lunch and went in.  The dinner pricing for AYCE was on - not sure when \"lunch\" ends there - but that was OK with us. Service was slow, eating came before service for the staff who were seated around a table by the kitchen door. We ordered some dragon rolls and a California roll to start and the rolls were a disaster - just an absolute disaster. The flavour was OK but they just fell apart, even before we tried to pick them up. They arrived on the plate looking like they'd been dropped. I was surprised they served them like this. We had to ask for soy sauce dipping dishes and little side plates all we were given with the food was a napkin and chopsticks.  We were given two slips of paper to write our orders on and once those two slips were gone we were ignored until we signalled that we wanted the bill. We didn't want any more food anyway but it would have been nice to have been asked. The food apart from the disaster rolls was ok - the sushimi came in thick generous chunks that were almost too big to pick up and put in my mouth - a knife was almost called for there but at least they weren't skimpy. The tempura was nicely done, light and not greasy. The waitress was friendly but as noted above not particularly attentive. We were two people, there were three people at one table when we arrived and another two people arrived about half way through our meal so the waitress was not rushed off her feet.   The bathroom was clean but almost out of toilet paper and there was a dead fly on the ledge where they keep vases of dried flowers next to the table. Two people, two large Sapporo beer, $68.91 before tip Was it worth it - NO. Would I go back - not a chance."}
{"text":"This is our favourite Japanese delivery place to order from.  PLEASE NOTE: This rating is on my scale for delivery food, not my scale for Japanese Restaurants. This is one of our go-to places for ordering in. It's consistent.  Things they get right: - Everything is yummy - Sometimes they include a FREE bonus item of some kind with your order - LOVE IT!   Things they get wrong: - Edamame comes with no salt on it (that might not be a bad thing for some people - now that we know this, I kind of like being able to apply the amount I want.   Other notes: - In our three times ordering, they consistently delivered 10 minutes before the estimated delivery time!  Thank goodness we finally found an acceptable sushi delivery place within our geographic area!"}
{"text":"I have tried numerous times with this place. I am a fan of the 10 dollar sushi lunch, the Danforth is filled with them. So moving to the Beach I gave it a try for lunch. I have gone three times, and every time it is awful. I have a few friends who claim it used to be great, or sometimes when they go, it is ok. I have yet to have this \"great\" experience.  The customer service is non-existant, I blame the owners here, one waitress who looks about 18 working a room of 30 seats by herself. The quality of the fish is awful, inedible  in my opinion, the fried food tastes like they haven't changed the oil in a year.   Well I think I now have food poisoning from eating there yesterday, spent all night curled up in bed reeling in my stomach. I won't be back, ever. Bring a barf bag."}
{"text":"The service is not so good and the quality of the fish is terrible. This is one of those Japanese restaurants that put a fat ball of rice for a tiny little piece of fish for a sushi. Terrible."}
{"text":"My son and I stopped by this restaurant as soon as we settled into our AirBnB. The food was wonderful. It's a little sleepy hollow but has a great atmosphere, pleasant staff and it's clean. I had the miso soup, and donburi. It was excellent. Plan to visit again on future trips to Toronto."}
{"text":"We often come in for lunch, but tonight we came for dinner with our inlaws. Service was very fast, and even thought it was AYCE not a single items was forgotten! Which seems to happen at a lot of the other places we've been to.  Sashimi was fresh and tasty. All of our rolls were well made with a good rice to filling ratio. We'll be back."}
{"text":"My go to all you can eat sushi place in Toronto! Amazing staff and food. Always fresh and polite 10/10 would eat again!"}
{"text":"I ordered spider maki and when it arrived it was soggy and disgusting and looked like someone else's leftovers, it honestly looked like they gave me something off someone else's plate it was half the size it normally is (I have ordered from them before) and to make matters worse I called to complain and was told that tempura is supposed to be that way?? Needless to say they have lost my business, don't waste your money this town is full of great sushi places!!"}
{"text":"I've been here with my fianc√© many many times, and more often than not, we were the only customers in the restaurant, during regular dinner hours.  The lack of customers both surprises and amazes me. The food and the service are par for the course, plus the restaurant is conveniently located near a subway and with pockets of residential areas behind it, so there should be no reason why it is always so empty. It's equally fascinating how the business has survived for this long. For as long as I can recall, this has been the case for the past 2 years and I have no clue how Bikkuri maintains profitability. But of course, that is none of my business so I will try to devote the reminder of this review talking about the food.  What can I say. The food is good. Not Earth-shatteringly so, but definitely above common expectations. I have ordered sushi, noodles, teppanyaki, curry rice and everything is lovely. It is on the pricier side and a 2-person meal could easily go over $60 so perhaps that's the reason behind its lack of popularity?   Still, if you ever want something slightly more refined than your local sushi take-out place, do give Bikkuri a try."}
{"text":"We decided to go here after seeing them listed on Blogto.com as they were rated pretty  high. Perhaps our expectations were too high but this was not as good as we thought. The food was mediocre. We explained we didn't eat fish or mayo to the server, and they still continued to bring us items we couldn't eat. The server was awful. She forgot to bring almost everything we asked for, therefore having to continuously ask for things. She was more focused on cleaning the tables that left than her current customers. We didn't receive food that we ordered, and had to also order it again. We won't be going back here. The service = awful, the food = bland and made with no love.  They should NOT be on Blogto."}
{"text":"One of the top, if not the best, sushi places I've been to in Toronto. This will now be my family's go-to spot and I've been to places in San Francisco, New York, and around Toronto.   Service was great, don't know what other reviewers are talking about. Went for lunch on a Saturday. Very chill, friendly atmosphere and delicious food.   The special rolls were amazing and salmon melted in my mouth. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I just moved to the area, and when I asked what there was worth eating around here, the answer was Bikkuri. So I thought I'd give it a try. Way better than Ikki sushi which I just tried today. When I went it to Bikkuri it was not too crowded but not to sparse. The food was good and sushi was fresh. Whatever we ordered came to us (which you can't say always happens at all you can eat sushi). Only complaint I do have (for now) is that the wait staff don't seem very knowledgeable on their product. It may be a language barrier or it may just be they don't know what's in their food.. Also when you want to be served, you have to hope someone pays attention to you and comes over. But all in all the food is good. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Generally ok experience. Only reason I go to this place is when I am craving some sushi for a decent price, I never come with high expectations. The quality and service is only alright."}
{"text":"stopped in for dinner after work last night. all you can eat sushi was great. tiny little place-and the service was not excellent (it was good-just not friendly/never asked if we wanted drinks/if we were happy). You just have to speak up if you want something (green tea/water etc...and then for refills of those as well). I'd go back for sure. Busy place-so i think many ppl love it/it must be a fav place for many ppl. (i saw other sushi restaurants around the same area that were not nearly as busy/packed."}
{"text":"My coworkers and I opted to try a new place out for lunch and we opted to try Bikkuri, despite hearing about the steep difference in prices in the area. I don't know if we'll repeat visit this restaurant though.  The decor in this restaurant looks like it caters to high-end patrons but certain areas look like they need a bit of dusting... not really reassuring. The servers are a bit slow and don't tend to you unless you call for them. I can understand if the restaurant is bustling, but if there's only two other occupied tables, I'm sure you can manage.  Their bentos were $20+, so... being the cheap person that I am I chose the Curry Katsudon for around $10. The curry was just okay... nothing amazing. It's nothing like the Japanese curry I had from CoCo Curry in Japan. It lacked a lot of flavour and the dish itself was very heavy. The meat to vegetable to rice ratio definitely needs a lot of work. There was very little meat and a lot of filler vegetables and rice to compensate.  Bikkuri needs to re-evaluate their menu if they want to stay in business. Steep prices for dishes that scream 'pinching every penny'."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!! As a friend and I walked into the sushi restaurant, we were not greeted by the waitress and made us switch seats three times.  As we got our food we noticed that there were some items that we did not order (we got the AYCE) so we flagged down the waitress.  When we told her that we did not order a couple of the items on the table, she huffs out loud and takes them and walks away without saying a word.  This happened more than once.  At one point I noticed the waitress talking to the chefs in their own language and kept on looking at us back and forth laughing.  It made us feel so uncomfortable and ruined our time.  The sushi was mediocre at best as the quality was poor.  As we got our bill, she did not bring back our change as she assumed that the change was automatically her full tip.  Not once did we see her smile at us or hear from the waitress say \"hello\", \"thank you\", \"sorry about that\" or \"bye, come again!\".  The waitress never said a word to us as we left the place.  WILL NEVER COME BACK AGAIN."}
{"text":"I can't say I liked this place much. Rolls are priced like Beyonc√© made them but tasted like mall food. I came here with a group of 10 on a Friday night; the restaurant was completely empty, that should've been clue num√©ro uno.   Tea and water was not served to us immediately after seating. In fact, all of us were left unattended until the waitress decided after 1 minute that we've had enough time to decide what we wanted even though we sat down not long ago. We tell her to give us a little more time and then she disappeared to god knows where for 10 minutes. Amazing service!! Much applaud, very wow.   Fast forward to everyone getting their orders down, food didn't take long to get to us. Most of the group ordered sukiyaki rice bowl, which I'm extremely sorry to say looked like last night's hot pot leftovers. The rice to leftovers ratio was awful. We're talking about 90% rice and 10% everything else. Apparently it tasted like last night's leftovers too, vouched by 4 people. Aye. $10.99 leftovers!  For me, I got the grilled squid and spicy scallop maki. None were amazing, none were even good. I had a really great grilled squid and unagi poke bowl at a place at the food court in STC recently and that was mind blowing. These dishes here? Doesn't even come close to what I had at the mall. Now imagine that. *thinking emoji* the squid was awful dry, no sauce at all and the maki was so small even my palm was bigger than all 6 pieces. And btw, my hands are notoriously known to being small af. (No one has smaller hands than I do) The total of these two came to $22 before tips. No thank you; never again.   The other side of the table shared a boat that came with only a few pieces of fish and rolls. It was a pathetic attempt, good try. But no.   Overall, nothing outside of what your average food court food would be like, probably even worse given what I've had lately so verdict: first time, last time."}
