{"text":"Serves here is horrible they took hours to take our order for food. Saw them take everyone else's order we had to stop them so they could take our order. Then they took way too long with our food and drinks. When we tried to play the billiards they sent us from the front desk to the bar and back. Wouldn't let us pay so we could get a table. When we needed refills they still ignored us. Nobody ever helped up. Never coming here again."}
{"text":"Good value on the summer pass but terrible service from the waitstaff in bowling alley. Bowling lane malfunctioned and was not fixed even after the staff was notified. NOT a great overall value. Games are very expensive."}
{"text":"Our first time here, came with a few of my buddies. We were checking out the place, it's huge with a lot of things to do. You would think that the bowling or laser tag hostess will be social and talk to everyone but instead they are rude and like to only socialize with one another. Our server Josh was really nice however, he changed the experience. He was really patient with us, but the bowling host didn't explain anything to us, just told us what the price was and sent us on our way and not to mention she wasn't too nice, same with the obstacle course and laser tag host. We traveled a long way to see this place and only had one good experience."}
{"text":"It seems like a great deal. I came here for the MLK weekend special. It was $17.95 for all you can play bowling, laser tag, etc. what they don't tell you is that you will spend 2+ hours waiting to play any of the games. So in the end you spend the whole night there and only get to play 1 or 2 games of anything. Essentially it's a huge rip off. Might as well just go to a bowling alley or laser tag place. I won't be coming back for sure. Also the service here is atrocious. You will spend 15+ minutes at the bar just waiting to get a beer."}
{"text":"Food has gone downhill. We usually like getting a drink and ordering food while the kids play. Today the service and food was horrible. Such a bummer, it was nice to have a good place to hang out while the kids played or attended a party. New menu = horrible food and service. We brought it up twice and no one cares."}
{"text":"I'll give this place 2 stars based on the fact that the franchise as a whole is not bad, but this particular location needs a serious revamp of staffing and customer service.

When you work in a customer service field, which is pretty much ANY business, you can recognize quickly where it is lacking. This place reeked of poor customer service. I understand it is busy on the weekend, and I understand it is a popular place, but when multiple wait staff pass by your table in the billiards area and don't even ONCE ask you if you are doing OK, need water, food, etc., there is a problem. We waited over 45 minutes, and eventually just had to go out of our way to grab someone to ask for drinks and a food menu. 

This issue continued into the bowling area, where once we got our lane, we were again ignored. A waiter came up to the table RIGHT NEXT TO US and checked on them and didn't even acknowledge our existence. We had to go to the bar to order another round of drinks, and waited another 20 or so minutes there to be acknowledged by the bartender. The cherry on top was the fact that they were out of clean glasses. 

I have had much better experiences at the Main Event in Tempe and unfortunately will not be visiting this location again. Save yourself the headache and go to Uptown Alley in Surprise, for they have great food, more activities, more room, more bars, and MUCH better customer service."}
{"text":"Thank you management for coming up with a solution to my past review. Going to give this place a second chance!"}
{"text":"Our family was excited to try this place. We had kids between the ages if 6-14 and between the long waits to do anything, the ropes course being too scary for the 6 year old, the video games being....get this $1.65 - $3.00+.....EACH.....we really didn't enjoy nor did we find value in the winter pass. We literally played 2 rounds of bowling. Well the kids did. The staff, as I see mentioned in other reviews, was in fact really rude. One girl literally rolled her eyes with a heavy sigh because I had to try a few different sized bowling shoes for my daughter (they run about 2 sizes too small). Didn't realize I was completely putting her out. ((Shrug)). I gave two stars because the food is actually pretty good there and reasonably priced. Sorry though we don't intend to return."}
{"text":"The cards are a lie and the customer service is terrible here.  We were told that the cards that we bought could be used for food,  beverages and activities.  The cards specifically state this fact and we were told this repeatedly. We went to use the cards for food at a later date like we were told we could.  However,  when we went to pay they said the card cannot be used for food and beverages (even though the card specifically says this). This is not the first time we have had a negative experience.  The practices here are downright deceitful and I would not recommend this place at all.  I would give it zero stars if I could.  I will definitely not be back."}
{"text":"Fun place, bad experience. 

It was around 12:50 and only my party was at the bar. Knowing they stop serving food at 1, I tried to flag the bartender, whom seemed to intentionally ignore me, to no avail. 

By the time he decided to come up to me, the time was 1:10 and \"regretted\" to tell me that I couldn't place an order. 

Terrible service. It shouldn't be this difficult for me to try to spend money at an establishment."}
{"text":"Fun family entertainment   Pizza was out quick. Got reimbursed for bad photo booth  and the place was clean!"}
{"text":"Shitty service we went to celebrate a friends birthday we were greeted to order drinks then our server never returned with our order we then go to the bar to order drinks and we get snobby attitude we then pay $6 for watered down drinks we decide to sit and order food and our waitress takes our order doesn't come back til our food is ready we sat with empty drinks for about 20mins then one of our friends had to get up and find our waitress to get service. Overall a horrible experience for an overpriced indoor castles and coasters themed building . We won't be returning, I only gave a 1 star because a no star isn't an option"}
{"text":"We all usually go to Main Event if we want to do anything fun with friends or family. Today my sister and her friends were at Main Event having a good time. They went to go eat and their waiter was very rude, from the start but they just kept being polite and had smiles on there faces. When the waiter bought over there drinks he spilled all the drinks all over her friends phone and his clothing, her friend didn't mind at all but the fact of it is, is that the waiter never apologized, all he said was people make mistakes and had a attitude and walked off. When the waiter came back her friend asked to speak with the manager. The manager walked over and he acted like he didn't care either, her friend was still being polite and told the manager he could have at least apologized. The manager then said \"well I can just give you a $5 game card.\" Her friend then said \"no thank you and said I would like a apology sir.\"  The manager than said no. After he said no repeatedly her friend said \"okay I would like my drink for free please\". the manager then said \"oh I see what kind of person you are\" and her friend than said \"I am not any kind of person it's just disrespectful when someone doesn't apologize for something that they did and than to act like they did not care. Especially since he spilled it all over my phone and possibly damaged it, I'm not asking for you to pay for that I'm asking for a apology\". The manager than said \"you guys need to leave or I will call the police because we are fearing for our lives\"!! Her friend than said \"If I was going to do anything I would of said it or done something by now but I didn't, I just want a apology sir!\" The manager than again said, \"I am going to call the police if you do not leave\". 

What gets me is that how are 16 year old kids going to make you fear for your life? They are good kids, weather they are at home or in a public place because they all know better. All the kids wanted was a apology and his worker should have apologized as soon as it happened. The managers name was Johnny, but when they asked for the other young mans name the manager said \"you don't need to know it\". Unbelievable!"}
{"text":"Don't waste your money.  I brought my kids for the Spring break special and they were bored after 20 minutes. Go to Amazing Jake's instead. They don't have half the items listed on their website."}
{"text":"This place has a lot of cool stuff but it is over priced and you have to wait for an hour to do anything there. The bowling game is limited to an hour and will shut off on you when your time is up regardless of where you are in your game. The gravity ropes were a two hour wait. Not worth the time or money."}
{"text":"Wow so I'm here now and asked the manager if they could change the music apparently they can't cuz they have never heard of Spotify or Pandora. They only have 2 songs on loop! Really Iggy Azalea and a one hit wonder from the 90's.  How freaking annoying is this?"}
{"text":"Nice place to have a good time, but if you really want to get some bowling going go to another place, you have to pay for the hour and  if you are a big group you will barely make a game for the hour, otherwise if you want to have some drinks and don't mind about bowling this is the right place!"}
{"text":"Hosted my son's 8th birthday here. It was 16 children most on the spectrum, and one huge adventure. We started by arriving about 15m before the scheduled party, the host greeted us and took the cake and goodie bags to a staff manned area. We had to sit in the main hall way by the entrance until the start of our party which was a little odd, there ended up being 16 kids and sets of parents just sitting by the entrance... we then started the bowling game which it was not explained to me the kids would throw the ball once (ve twice) per turn and the confusion took away from the game, which was ultimately cut short. If you have a large number of kids please have multiple hosts and small activities for them to work on in between turns. The food that was served was hot dogs and chips(plus a drink) which wasnt bad for hot dogs. Only downside there wasnt a seating area for the parents, nor food available for the parents. There was a snack bar with food for purchase, but it was not brought to our attention until the tail end of the party. The game room but design id awesome, the prices per game not so much. They were given a 5.00 game card included with the party package  (one per kid) and 5.00 in this game room doesnt go very far. Most kids were out of money in roughly 10 minutes of playing. I know its not chuck e chesse where games are 1-2 tokins (.25-.50) but 1.25 for one play on a fame seems a bit much. Over all the kids had a blast and were sleep in the cars before we could leave the parking lot. I would return and it is a great place for kids on the spectrum to be able to frequent. The hosts were great (Levi was our main host) and tried to make everything perfect."}
{"text":"I think it's over priced. $36 for a bowling ? Also no military discount. I'm surprised because the main event in San Antonio has military discount. Pool table wait is atrocious."}
{"text":"Yesterday, I took my son to Main Event in Tempe.  We got there around 3 pm and it wasn't packed at all.  We walked in and someone greeted us right away and directed us to the bowling shoe station.  The place was clean, and spread out, so not crowded.

The cashier informed us of a Spring Break special going on, which included the following from 1-5;  unlimited Laser Tag, Gravity (this tightrope walking maze they have), Pool and Bowling (separate charge of $3 for shoes).  So we bought that.  

We also purchased a game card, which they offered a deal of $65 worth for $50.  Was cool to get that considering the games are sorta expensive ($1.50-$3 per game).  We had a technical difficulty upon retrieving the card after the purchase, but they got tech support on it right away. No prob.  

Laser Tag was real fun, games were fun, but expensive.  Bowling was great!  Food and drinks were pretty good.  Staff and service was great.  Overall experience was good, especially seeing my son so happy there.  I'd go back again, but only during specials because they're kind of pricey."}
{"text":"3 Stars! Yep, that's it. It averages out, well...on the lower side when I round down, and here's why:

- The atmosphere is a 5. It has a nice setup and it's still fairly clean (most places tend to become filthy after they've been open a few months).
- The life-size games (Connect Four, Ms. Pac-Man) are an easy 5. Old school games bring back childhood memories, and adult for that matter.
- Laser Tag is a 2 at best. Give me something to REALLY do while I'm running around a dark room. I think they could've done better here. Wow!
- The food...ehh..I'll give it a solid 3, it's nothing to brag about.
- Drinks...must I go there? Holy cow! I'm only giving it a 2 due to my Stella Artois on tap! I just had the same rita made 3 times due to the sweet n sour, or lack there of. It's siphoned through the soda machine spray, so you KNOW what that means. Yes! It's watered down with that good ole Arizona non-filtered tap water! WTF?! First two were crystal clear, almost like water. I had to ask was there any Grand Marnier in the darn thing. It was watery, so she took it back. Next one was even worse. Third one, absolutely awful. Shoulda got a Stella Artois on tap to begin with! Man!"}
{"text":"Too bad there's not an option for zero stars. Went there for the first time and it'll be my last. Ordered a chicken sandwich and part of my sandwich was undercooked,  so I sent it back.  The kitchen manager came out and loudly explained in front of my large group how I  was wrong and the pink color was from their marinade and they temperature check everything.  How come the rest of my sandwich was white?  I asked to speak to the manager and I told him how embarrassed and disrespected I felt. He was apologetic but it didn't seem genuine. We didnt even stay to do any of the activities,  and judging by the other reviews, we didn't miss anything.  Save yourself the trip and go Dave and Busters instead."}
{"text":"Probably the best place for birthday parties In The west valley. Reasonable pricing,great staff,clean & fun. Customer service is awesome!!!"}
{"text":"Ron was our waiter and although he struggled a bit with some of the card payments. He made sure to do his best to resolve the issues with a smile in his face. Very nice guy 
The young lady working the prize desk was alone and was very nice. She helped us even with the super busy line that was never ending. 
A few people at the main desk helped me too when we got our cards mixed up. And one of the bar tenders was very pleasant explaining how to reserve the pool and shuffle boards."}
{"text":"Had some problems,  but Andy the manager took care of us, was thoughtful and understanding.  Wish that could be said for the rest of management and poorly trained staff."}
{"text":"We held a party here over the weekend and it went great!  Our hostess was named Micayla and she worked hard to make everything go as smoothly as possible.  I loved that she served the kiddo's drinks while they were bowling, and loved even more that she brought out the cups labeled not only with names but also what they were drinking so it would make refills easier!  She did an awesome job.  We loved how our party turned out.  Thank you Main Event!"}
{"text":"Happy hour implies a set of hours in which drinks and appetizers are offered at a discounted price. I called ME and asked if they had happy hour and if so what time. I was informed that they do have happy hour from 4-7 and 10-close S-Th. I show up on a Thursday, sit at the bar, ask the bartender about happy hour offerings and am encountered with a belittling chuckle. The bartender told me they didn't have happy hour. I told the bartender I'd called to make sure and it was the reason I showed up. Bartender then tells me that the happy hour applies only to billiards rates. Huh???? 

Next, we ordered the Chocolate Brownie w/Vanilla Ice Cream. Within the first five words, the menu uses the word \"warm\" to describe the brownie. The dessert was served with the brownie room temperature, at best. 

Overall, my first impression is that this place is a joke. 

The food and drinks were very reasonably priced. Didn't partake in any activities but I do recognize that those can be over-priced unless there are any promotions when you choose to visit."}
{"text":"Came here for a group party.  Had a party of 10 people. We started with a full buffet menu.  We selected the BBQ menu.  I was NOT impressed by the food - it was average at best.  However they did give us a nice private room with a big Screen TV.  After our 1 hour in a private room we were taken to go bowling.  Our shoe rental was included in our package.  We had 2 lanes reserved for an hour & a half.  We were able to bowl 2 full games.  Our time actually ran out prior to the second game ending and they extended our time so we could finish.   We then went and played a game laser tag which was super fun.  The laser tag game lasted like 12-15minutes.  We all also got a $10 arcade card.  So we played games for about 30 minutes.   Also throughout the whole night we had an unlimited beverage package (non alcoholic) and we had drinks on demand.  Super nice.  After the arcade we reserved 2 pool tables and played some pool.  We spent 5 hours here and it went by rather fast.  Total bill was $452 for 10 people and I tipped our host $50.  Overall it was a super fun place with a great atmosphere and environment.  Our Host MICHAEL was Amazing!!!   Service was on point and great staff.  If the food would have been a bit better it would have 5 stars."}
{"text":"We went to this location and was treated horrible! We never got a waitress and when we asked the manager about not having a waitress he seemed to have a attitude or be irritated that I was speaking to him about not having a waitress. We had been there over an hour and had to order our food at the bar and bring it to the table, when other table had waitress or servers helping them. Honestly I felt like we were being discriminated against, all the other tables had service but us. This seemed really odd and bothered us."}
{"text":"I can completely understand the low ratings, but I also understand a new place getting off the ground.  It takes far too long to check in to the action, and it's super crowded.  That said, my family, which includes kids age 6, 7, and 16, had a great time, even waiting a couple hours for a lane.  It was fun, lots of games, lots of food options (pizza actually wasn't a penalty, as is so often the case at joints like this).  If you can stand the noise, and you come with some patience, you can enjoy yourself."}
{"text":"We reached out to Main Event to plan a high school reunion. The first attempt, I didn't hear back from anyone so I called a couple more times. I finally spoke to someone who emailed me options. I spoke to her again and she said for a reunion we didn't need to make a deposit until about 2 weeks prior to event. I called back to book it and was told by someone else they needed the money the day we booked. We contacted Dave and Buster's who worked with us and we had an AWESOME event."}
{"text":"This is THE BEST entertainment building in all of Arizona. 
They have a HAZMAT-themed lazer tag room (kind of scary, but I'm a chicken), a climbing structure that you walk on a rope, and your belted in, but what if you fall??? I got right back down to the ground once I realized I had little support and I was close to the ceiling. 
They have a futuristic bowling alley with color-changing lights and touchscreen computers. No one stares if you can't resist doing telekinesis to win the game like I did. 
The food is amazing with good soda and gelato!!!!!
I would go here, even though it is more expensive. It is MUCH better than 
Amazing \"Dingy Jakes\" Jake's!
It is over-the-top fun."}
{"text":"Everyone u speak with tells u something different. When we got there, we spoke to an employee and she told about the packages and the promotions. We waited in line for an hr then when we finally got to the counter to pay the person there said the promotion was completely different. They tried to sell me unlimited pass,but in reality it was not. Laser tag and Gravity are scheduled times; about every 3 hrs and limited # of People can go in at a time. For bowling, u have to pay extra for the shoes. There's always a waiting line to play. After u finally bowl and u want to play another game, u have to get on the waiting list again; wait for another 2-3 hrs."}
{"text":"Booked a birthday party for my daughter 6 weeks in advance. Two weeks after booking, I needed to change the date. Called and was told, \"No problem, we'll email you a new confirmation with the new details.\" Days pass. No email confirmation. Called back to check and was told, \"Don't worry about the email, we have you scheduled for the new date.\" Uh, no. All I need is to arrive on the new date and be told they have no record of our party. I want a written confirmation. Called back again and finally received a new email confirmation. Was also told they'd call 3 days before the party for the final headcount. The day before the party I realize they never called for the final headcount. Checked my caller ID and voicemail. Nothing. Called them and was told by a snotty, condescending teen that, \"We called. We'll change it this one time,\" Wow. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. (eyeroll) The actual place is fun (yet overpriced) but if you book a party know you'll have to babysit the staff."}
{"text":"So much potential, but this place needs to train their staff on service. I had my daughter's birthday here and it was the biggest waste of $500. Should have just got in the car and drove to Disneyland.  

If you're considering Main Event for a child's birthday, just take my advice and DON'T do it. Their party hosts don't take food or drink orders(so what's the point of a party host?) and there aren't any servers around to help either. They brought my daughter's cake out but forgot the forks and napkins. Took 10 more minutes for them to bring those out. They never cleared our dirty plates or empty glasses. The host brings the bill while I'm handing my daughter her gifts. I thought it was tacky and rude to ask me to sign in full display of our party guests and while I was in the middle of watching my daughter open her presents.  

While we were leaving I overheard a server tell another employee, \"Dude, I'm so drunk,\" and then they start laughing. That sums this place up. 


NEVER AGAIN."}
{"text":"I visited Main Event with co-workers on Thursday.  We were all very excited to enjoy happy hour after a long week.   Unfortunately, the service left a lot to be desired.   It wasn't busy and our table was dirty.    The waitress did not offer any happy hour specials. We had to ask.   Once we placed our orders,  she literally brought one item to the table at one time.   We had to flag her down for drinks.   There were six of us and she brought only 3 plates and 2 sets of silverware.  The food was good but drinks were way over priced. I will not go back for happy hour but I will return to enjoy bowling and games."}
{"text":"I was nervous after reading the reviews, but my kids  and I had a great experience.  Employees were friendly and helpful, good food and service!  Video games are a little pricey, but is what it is.  If anyone plans on going on the zero gravity attraction you need shoes (my daughter were flip flops) but they let her use bowling shoes and socks so she could go on it...really great idea since I thought she wouldn't be able to do it as a result.  Would recommend for kids or adults and comeback."}
{"text":"Broken machines, expensive prices, and staff who act like they don't care. You don't get to play long for the expensive price either. Maybe bowling would be a better experience, but the videogames are a rip off."}
{"text":"Was here for a visit w my family. I like it. Watched the okc and gsw game on all the TVs. I loved the concept. Good was great and the service was wonderful. We only came to eat and drink so I cannot attest to those parts of the building. Overall I'd come again on my next visit over."}
{"text":"Came to main event for the first time for a company event. We did the bowling and had some food. Bowling was awesome. I thought the pictures taken before hand and displayed was pretty cool. Music was amazing the whole time there. Restrooms were well kept. The only downfall I had with this visit is the food wasn't the greatest but other than that, I would definitely come back with friends. Definitely a good place to bring kids/family. Gets busy on the weekends though so be prepared for a wait for laser tag and bowling."}
{"text":"I'm appalled by the bad customer service I had  last night...I had my family with me and paid for an hour of bowling and during that whole time never did I see any employees come ask us if we needed anything to drink or eat on top of that before getting a lane we had to wait a whole hour...the menus at the bowling lanes are just there for you to look at I guess...so after waiting 45 minutes I finally decided to go get a drink myself at the bar and the blonde girl bar tender that was there and not busy but flirting with the drunks I guess trying to get a nice tip from them, totally ignored me as I waited patiently for 15 minutes in front of the bar counter to see when she will be done flirting with the drunk guys..she totally ignored me nor she acknowledge me...the other bar tender girl in the black hair finally ask me after she was done helping others if I had been helped which I still wasn't , so she was nice enough to take my order....while the blonde girl at around 11:36pm 6/30/17 was still flirting and talking to a drunk guy at the bar doing absolutely nothing...she never acknowledged me which was so unprofessional of her part. Then one of my kids wanted ice cream which I went to get for him and I was so disgusted by the way the African American young girl served it not only is she touching and counting money but she doesn't used gloves to serve it....well she wet the ice cream scoop with I supposed hot water and while she was getting the 3 scoops they served the dirty water from her hands was dripping into the ice cream below I pay for the ice cream but threw it immediately in the garbage knowing how sick my kid could get from her and this place being so careless for the safety food handling of this place. I totally don't recommend this place because you will have a bad experience not unless you go eat and drink somewhere else then just come here to just use the pool tables or the bowling lines ect...just forget about being served the menus are there just for u too see. Never again waste of money, time, and bad family experience. This just reflects back to the management of this place!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed going there today... not too busy (of course, it was noon on a Monday!).  It was my daughter's first time bowling and playing laser tag... she went home very happy.  The place itself is pretty new and has a nice interior.

Having said that, I did find it to be expensive.  We paid for the $18.95/person for unlimited bowling, laser tag,  etc.  I think that was worth getting... I was surprised by how expensive the arcade games were.  So, if you have some money to spend, I think it's a nice place to go..."}
{"text":"A friend of mine just went here and told me about a bad guest service experience she had. I remembered my review and the update I have. 

I was contacted by the manager and he apologized. Which was all I wanted. He offered to send me a gift card that I could print out from my email. Which was really going above and beyond to make it up to me. However I never received that email. 

I don't want to sound like I'm trying to get anything for free, but if you offer something to someone you already screwed over you should probably follow through."}
{"text":"We had my son's 8th birthday party here, and spent 500 $ for 13 kids package for laser,  pizza, and video cared  and two adult trays of food, and 3 extra game cards for little kids. You would think that for that much money, we would have great service, however, my husband and I were disappointed. First, it started that when we came in, our reservation was not correct, we had made changes the day before and moved the time up 30 minutes, however, this was not passed on to the staff and it took 15 minutes for it to finally get done. Then when we went to sit down at the table, we only had one table for 16 kids and adults. This was appalling, since we had confirmed that we had 16 kids total, and that we would have food for the adults as well. When the 4 pizzas were put on the table, I asked about the other two trays for the adults and they brought it out, but had NO WHERE to put them, so I asked about putting it on the table next to us , that way we could get seating, but of course that was taken. finally the host put out a folding table in the corner , squeezed in where the food was put down. We had over 14 adults with no seating, just standing, and this was not to our liking at all. For our sons' birthday parties, we always like to accommodate adults with food, drinks, and SEATS, but this was not the case this time. Very disappointing, my husband and I have had parties in all the major venues, D & B, Amazing Jake's, etc. and this was totally a disappointment, especially for the money we shelled out.  

On their defense the kids liked laser tag and the arcade games were fine (too expensive though), however, we did not have ENOUGH SEATING for a party with 16 kids and their parents...

Recommendations:
1. Enlarge the party area, do not book two tables back to back, that is very uncomfortable and frankly, rude
2. Have two hosts for each part, our host had too much to do and slowed the party down
3. Have some parties in the front area where the seating was, that area was totally empty"}
{"text":"So my rating is based on there nachos. They are horrible. Hardly any cheese some black beans and chicken. Stale chips. I have had other entries that were decent. Quesadilla was one. But the Nachos were the worst I have ever had."}
{"text":"They have played 2 song on repeat. I can't with this place, a cassette tape has more song than there playlist. The screaming kids are a pleasant break from these tired songs. There 3 different sport games on and they can't even put that on. I'm debating putting my headphones on and listening to legit white noise. I promise you I won't be back."}
{"text":"The website makes it look vast and extremely busy. However it is quite small and there really isn't a lot for a large group to do if you don't like bowling and you don't want to pay $1 to $2 per video game. We drove an hour to celebrate our son's birthday with people who live in the area and it looks like a bust.

The building is lovely and the games are bright and engaging. There are a handful of pool tables that have been claimed by very poor players who don't intend to leave any time soon. The staff is friendly. The prices  are steep and I am not convinced it is worth it."}
{"text":"Walked into main entertainment on Wednesday  sat down at a table for about 10 minutes and no waiter took my drink order or ask me if I needed help. About three waiters walked right past me made eye contact but it seems that they were more focused on the bar than me and my family party of six. As me and my party decided to get up and go I walked over to the customer service table and spoke with a manager and said hey maybe you should speak with your waiters in regards to there customer service manager acted like I was not important and said yeah I will go head and do that I felt like he was mocking me. To make things worse it was not even that  busy  but it seems like there were more focused on talking then helping out customers. But no worries drove over to Dave and Busters and they managed to salvage my night."}
{"text":"Fun, clean and friendly. Only downfall is that it's very overpriced, especially with a big family."}
{"text":"What an absolutely amazing concept. Video games! Bowling! Laser Tag! BEER!!!! But don't be fooled my friends because it DOES have some major issues. Although the games are awesome, they are a bit overpriced. Fine, the games are brand new and very clean so I didn't mind the prices too much. 

Now we get to customer service. Oh boy, that's a big issue. You come to a place like this which is super new, super clean, super flashy, and expect EVERYTHING to be super. But no no no!  We went to the main booth to get game cards and the girls there were too busy talking to each other. Almost seemed like we had inconvenienced them by interrupting their conversation. Anyway, we got our cards and went to play games. HAD A GREAT TIME! While we were playing games, we noticed it was starting to get busy. Time to relax and grab a beer. The bartender didn't really pay attention to us right away. But there were people sitting at the bar already so we assumed he was busy (although I didn't see him making any drinks). Then a waitress walked over to the bar and he started having a conversation with her. That's when I got annoyed. I finally said something and he said \"Hey guys what can I get for you?\" like we had just walked up or something. No \"sorry I didn't see you sitting there because I was too busy flirting with this waitress\" or anything like that. Anyway, we got the beer and relaxed. On my way back to the arcade area, I got curious about Main Event and decided to stop at the main booth again and ask how long it had been open and just get some general info about the place. AAAAAANNNNND....... ONCE AGAIN.... I interrupted the two girls having their conversation. 

Went to play air hockey. The scoring seemed to only be counting one side and not the other side. I told one of the two guys standing around between the arcade area and the air hockey area. He apologized and helped me right away without hesitation. What a breath of fresh air.

I will be going back to this place again because the games are awesome. But the crew certainly needs to be retrained or replaced. They will end up hurting this business."}
{"text":"No Stars for this Gilbert establishment when it takes your money and doesn't care about telling you that the scam they are running with this 7 dollar all day pass is just a bunch of BS. Me and my family were treated like dog shit when I asked why do you offer this to people for bowling let them bowl for an HR then tell them they have to leave. Go put your name on the wait list again but now it's 2 1/2 hrs wait time. This is highway robbery I would never come to this place for anything ever again and I hope people see that this place is so disrespectful to U.S. Veterans as I am one and proudly wear my hat every damn day. I will let my entire network know not to ever come here and waste their hard earned money."}
{"text":"First timer experience:
This place was packed in a Friday night around 9pm.  Filled to the rim with ghetto people.  Service was extremely behind and it was a challenge to get a beer within a 45 minute frame.  The only food I tried was the artichoke dip.  Way too salty. Not surprised, but still thought I should note it.
The bowling was on a 1 hour wait.  Once we got our lane, it had technical issues.  We flagged down Kayce.  She is the ONLY positive thing about this place.  Kayce got a lane dude to look into the issue,  it still didn't work so she moved us to another lane.  I wanted a refill on my Stella.  Asked some dude in a blue shirt, nothing. Asked another dude in a shirt practically begging for another beer wanting to give my money to someone in exchange for alcohol. Nothing. Again, KAYCE, promptly delivered.  
Long story short.  It was very frustrating to have a group of adults go out who are all busy living lives and wanting a night out.  Some young \"manager\" attempted to salvage the experience through our bills, but we will absolutely never return.  Terrible."}
{"text":"Great looking place. Clean, TV's everywhere, (place would rock for Steeler or pens game), nice chairs and different types of seating areas. Areas for eating and cool side areas for drinks relaxing with friends. 5/5 on that.

Great for kids. Laser tag, bowling, arcade, shuffle board, pool tables. 5/5

Very good food. Wife did stake, myself burger, kids pizza and chicken fingers.  Bob a supervisor and Dana the server were great and made sure everything went correct with our food due food allergies.  5/5

Price is a bit more than I like on food and drink. Place is awesome looking and has great attractions so maybe that justifies 4.75 Miller light bottles and 7 for a glass of wine.  Kids pizza are nice sized but 10 each.  They do have day and half passes for  laser tag and bowling that make that affordable if you sticking around for a while.  4/5.... Maybe I am just cheap.

Parents night out. When it was Latitude 360 there was a stage for live entertainment at up stairs bar. It's gone. The laser tag is now where the comedy club was....  3/5.  Not sure that's even what they were trying to creat...."}
{"text":"This was my 1st time here and we decided to celebrate rate my son's 13th birthday.  We had a small group, well below the minimum required for a party package.  Tried the \"Fun pass\" for the 5 kids.  It was OK, bowling was bowling, they have soon funny animations on the monitors, but nothing special.  Had a waitress (Ashley) come by as soon as we got to the lane.  I told her we were getting set to start and we'd look over the menu.  No one ever came back by.  Had the kids line up for laser tag only to be told after they stood for 20 minutes they had to get a ticket with a time to play.  45 minute intervals, too long.  Video games are too pricey for what they are.  If I am spending that much, I expect the guest experience to be outstanding, which it isn't.  I will commend Trevor, he was very pleasant and offered information as I was leaving that I never got upon entering and mentioning it was our first time.   Overall I will stick to Dave and Busters or Brunswick, at least they make you and your $$ ($100+) you  spend feel welcomed there."}
{"text":"My closes friends and great family for my 26th birthday. This had to be the worst experience ever. The food was horrible. We wait over an hour to get served. I will not come back here ever again. They need a new management. You can't run a place off of one server and crappy food."}
{"text":"If you're Black or Hispanic don't expect to run a tab. You will have to pay as you go or pay upfront. I wish I would have read the reviews before I wasted my time coming here. The server we had was rude and a liar. The manager wasnt any better. I will never come here again."}
{"text":"Had a house margarita and couldn't finish it.  It was so bad.  Won't be coming back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Dec 22, 2015: My large family, ages 8-60 went to this place. I would have given a much higher rating if it was not for our experience with several employees that were out-of-line. Both times we entered the laser tag room, an employee YELLED at everyone to shut-up so he could talk and made all kinds of threats if we didn't listen to him. He was very disrespectful and far more immature than the few kids who were talking. This was quite unnecessary, he seemed to either be showing off for someone or floating on a power trip of some sort. In addition, the young man stationed at the front entrance was unable to answer the simple questions we had for him regarding the establishment. He either seemed mentally disabled or impaired. The concept is great, the place is great, but the employees definitely need customer service training."}
{"text":"Upon receiving a message from Main Event I did reach out to their district manager, Steve Jackson, as requested and have not yet heard anything.

Additional Update: I did receive an e-mail from Steve, the manager, who was very apologetic and seems to want to rectify this situation for guests. I was offered a gift card (as another Yelper mentioned being offered) so, when I get it I will likely go back and update this again with my second experience."}
{"text":"Exact same as the Tempe location..  All was fine except our waitress while bowling.  Very rude, short mannered and acted as if I did not spend enough money for her to be bothered.  Lets see.  Single father of two boys.  $75 for an hour of bowling and about 10 video games after.  $44 for two beers a pizza and some spinach dip on a Tuesday evening.  8/1/2017 at about 5:30.   I know this place is a treat for my boys so we have been a number of times to the Tempe location but I will never return to this one.  I work to hard to be snuffed by a 20 year old waitress.  She could not push my bill in my face fast enough to try and get me out of the bowling area.  There was no one else around.  Should have been the opposite."}
{"text":"Great family place!! Well staffed and the food was delicious! Thank you Casey StPier for awesome hospitality!"}
{"text":"Where to begin? First when we checked in and we're out on the waiting list it was confirmed that we had an hour to wait. After spending a large amount on drinks and games waiting for the lane to open, i was told it would be another 2-hours???? After requesting a manager suddenly a lane opened up and we were bowling. I should mention we signed up for the unlimited bowling and we're never told anything about time frame or only an hour to bowl?? After 1-hour we were told that are time was up???? We paid $50 for 1 hour I guess? After my wife asked to speak to a manager he claimed that the front desk was supposed to inform us that they were to mention this. Well they did not and he was so 'kind' to give us another half an hour. If we knew that we would pay that much do an hour we would have never paid $50 to take our 2 boys bowling here. It's a complete scam for the $7 per person unlimited bowling. Never again!"}
{"text":"As far as the whole place goes, it's not a 2 star review, this is directly for the bar. Even when there isn't that many people around the bar you still have to wait forever to get a drink. The prices are pretty steep as well. Last night I was there and had been waiting to be served and instead of helping me and all of the others at the bar, the employees were having a whipped cream fight. Just when I thought it couldn't get much worse, the manager came by to take my drink order. I think his name was Casey or Cory or something with a C. He was the biggest asshole I had ever ran into as a server. I asked what they had in bottles and he just said \"a lot\" and that was it. Really dude?! That's so helpful. He totally acted like I was taking up his time by being there. Next time I go to main event, I will for sure be pre-gaming."}
{"text":"Stopped in after I left Walmart with my son, machine took our money, without any hassle manager came gave him what was on the card Plus another $40 for free!"}
{"text":"I had both my kids birthday parties here, and then been here about 7 other times. It's clean, staff is nice, their equipment is taken care of, and food is good. 
They are a little pricey, and a few times been understaffed, which is the only reason they don't get 5 stars."}
{"text":"Excellent place for a bowling party for kids!!! 
Had my son's 5th birthday party here for bowling. What a great party! The event manager, Alina, was very helpful and accommodating. The staff also made everything very easy the day of the party!!! The party hosts help with everything! From helping the guests to the party area, getting all the kids set up for bowling, the staff even cut the cake and served the guests! Can't say enough about our great experience for a child's birthday party!!!!"}
{"text":"The service in the restaurant portion is very bad!  We came here on a Monday night for a party my daughter wanted to attend. I sat in the restaurant to do some work. It wasn't overly crowded at all, and it was difficult to even place a food order. I wouldn't recommend coming here unless you have to."}
{"text":"We came here for our sons 11th birthday and we had an amazing time! The unlimited wrist bands are awesome. If you like thin crust pizza I wouldn't advise ordering their pizza. I t was a little short on the toppings. The foods we ordered were pizzas,hamburgers, wings, players platter ( spinach dip, wings, ribs, celery, carrots, loaded tater tots). The platter states it feed 3-4 but we received 4 wings, 4 ribs, 2 celery sticks, 2 carrots, approximately a hand full of tater tots the spinach dip, with about a hand full of chips as well. We had a nice amount of dip but not nearly enough chips. I think most people would eat more than 1 wing so I think it would feed 2 at best maybe even 1. We also ordered salads, loaded fries, and additional loaded tater tots. I had a sample of everything except the burgers but everyone reported they were great.

The bowling was great and the children loved that they could add photos to their name. The laser tag was fun as well. The gravity ropes they reported were fun as well but I did not try.  The game room was amazing and we had a blast. The place was very clean and the staff was amazing. 

My only complaint/ suggestion  is that we had people in our party who only wanted to bowl. The rest of us had wrist bands. We had two lanes and they were advised they had to purchase a lane for an hour. It would be great if they sold individual games. We already had two lanes and they didn't want a wrist an unlimited wrist band because they were elderly.


I will definitely bring the family here again my son stated he had the best time ever."}
{"text":"So I received an email from Main Event's management promising a gift certificate. I figured I would give them another shot. It's been 3 weeks still no certificate."}
{"text":"Cool place, although my son got stuck on the gravity rope (he's afraid of heights) but he seemed to have enjoyed everything about it. I had a birthday party for him here and the host of the party was amazing and exceeded my expectations, so if you have a party there, I recommend requesting America (I know... crazy name!!) But great new place for the town of gilbert!"}
{"text":"It was all fun and games until  they had someone at the front doing someth set up with a table and a lap top with a shirt that said BLACK LIVES MATTER in big block letters. It's a family place i definetly don't think that is acceptable for a company to allow someone to sit INSIDE their establishment and promote that. Especially with all the violence going on."}
{"text":"Had a really fun time. Purchased the unlimited pass. Was able to bowl, play laser tag, and complete the ropes course several times over. Good was average. Beer was cold. A good experience, overall."}
{"text":"This place is complete trash. The arcade is extremely overpriced. The employees are useless,  vexing, and disrespectful."}
{"text":"this place is were it's at. great time!! Food is great for a arcade. but this isn't any arcade. You walk in and you have arcades to the left and pool to the right a beautiful bar with excellent staff. I was really surprised as this was my first time here. not gonna lie this place was packed. So glad this pace is on avondale I love right across the street. Didn't have any problems with service I sat at the bar and was  greeted by Donny the  bartender right away. he couldn't get to me right away but at least he knew I was there. This place is like a night club. great time for everyone. I'll be back!!"}
{"text":"This place has the worst customer service ever!. I decided to check out main event with my family to have dinner and let the kids run wild. First of all i walked in and saw the hostess stand empty, i tried asking 3 people if it was open seating and they all said something different. So i went to sit. Took over 20min for someone to get to me but it wasnt to take my order it was to ask me to check in with the lady in the front first before being seated. We decided to just leave and grab pizza which was a separate place in there which was better and quicker. The games where expensive but good prize selection. Alsoi didnt even try bowling because i can see how frustrating people where.  I want to love this place but i can't, im going to stick to dave and busters or Peter Piper"}
{"text":"You need to extremely patient to enjoy any time here. Been here three times. First time extremely busy opening nite and I chalked up the craziness to being new. Second time went 1 hr earlier than what I told friends to join me at. I couldn't reserve a table at the bar, I had to wait like a hawk to try and score a table for my group. I had to wait and practically hover over parties with little children sitting at the bar tables until they got up. I practically had to arm wrestle with other people to see who was going to win the table.  Bowling was booked for 4 hrs. And there was no way I was going to bowl that night but I learned a lesson (call ahead and reserve a Lane). Third time I call three hours ahead to reserve a bowling Lane. Guess what..... Yup they are booked for the day...... The whole day! They didn't even give me an option. The attendant did say I could walk in and I might get an open Lane but they expected to be slammed. I don't think my chances are very good. I love the family friendliness aspect but cmon kids at the bar?"}
{"text":"I will give this place an honest 3 stars. Now to be fair I haven't been in a few months, but when I went it was extremely packed (which is not Staffs fault). However staff was not even making an attempt to accommodate and take care of hungry and paying customers! The laser tag was AWESOME. Really cool arena with lots of areas to duck and hide! The food was okay. Nothing amazing. I think they were either short staffed, or under trained when I went. Maybe because it was a little newer after being opened. Didn't get a chance to bowl but the lanes looked awesome. Cool lights. Cool ambiance. Price was comparable to that of D&B's.  I want to come back and bowl! Check it out for yourself"}
{"text":"Went here was really crowded and the music is crazy Loud! Then when you get inside its even louder I think the owner is deff or something! I've been to a lot of places but the music is sooo freaking loud I just took my money elsewhere for this reason . It's sooo crazy loud and not good music like 90s hits off of Pandora."}
{"text":"Lots of activities, place was clean however service was poor. People could be more friendly, respond when you ask a question and employees should stay out of the only family bathroom in the place! Many places to go in the valley, no plans to return to the Main Event."}
{"text":"Had my 9 year old sons Birthday party there recently. We had our 10 year old daughters party there this past summer so my son wanted his there. We paid for the bowling/gravity ropes package that included $5 game card and pizza.  Pizza finished early so our host told us we could start gravity ropes early (12:40) and still go till 1:20. We were supposed to start the gravity ropes at 1p.  The guy running the ropes got our kids off at 1p and I asked our host what up? She was arguing with the rope guy and he said our kids had their time and that's it. After all the harnesses were off and at 1:10 we were told kids can go back up till 1:20. Really? By the time I would round them up and get harnesses back on it would be 1:20. I asked for manager.

So manager comes, I explain that host said we would get until 1:20. He repeatedly asked me what do i want him to do. Over and over. I said I want the kids to get 20 more minutes of gravity rope time. No can do, they had another group starting at 1:20. Again he asks me over and over what do I want him to do. I finally ask what will you do? Another host suggests free round of laser tag. Great! Should make her the manager.

One last thing I don't appreciate. When you book a party they tell you how much and that gratuity is included in price. When you get your final bill it has final price and line for tip. Nothing about the \"previously billed 12% service charge\" is listed.  Very cheesy. It is clean there but not the best experience today."}
{"text":"Place is so much fun but expensive. Would be a lot better if the staff was not so rude and did not hate their job so much"}
{"text":"Worst Customer Service EVERRRRRR, which makes sense as to why they only have 2 1/2 stars. So i go to the bar to grab some water. I'm standing at the damn bar for 10 minutes. This girl, Andrea who is working the bar is completely ignoring me and grabbing guys their beers before me as I've been standing there forever and longer then them. Let's keep in mind I'm here as a mentor and I have a little girl standing next to me, so I keep it classy...okay now I will carry on. 
I calmly continue to stand there as if I have all the time in the world to waste. She finally looks at me and I'm like can I have a glass of water? She's like umm if you want water you can go next door (to the pizza place) so I'm trying not to get ghetto in front of this little girl and I go next door and wait 5 more minutes to get my water!! 

IF I wasn't with the little girl, I don't think Andrea knew what she had coming for her. 
First off, she could of easily given me a glass of water but for whatever reason she chose not to! Idk if it's cuz water is free and she wouldn't of got a tip or she was just in the mood to be rude. Or cuz I'm a female?!!! Idk I'm still beside myself as to why I was refused a glass of water after standing there foreverrrr. 
Then I go to the manager on duty and I told him what horrible customer service they have. He said he would speak to her, but he also seemed just as clueless. 
The problem is that everyone who works here is so young and could give two shits about their job. Down to when I was paying for bowling and games, the customer service all together just sucks!
I definitely will never be back. It's expensive as hell and you get shitty service....so there's that."}
{"text":"Very happy with our birthday party experience. Celebrated my son's 8th bday. Our party host was very helpful and accommodating. Very clean place with lots to do. Food was really good!  The kids were entertained. No complaints here! We will be back again soon!"}
{"text":"I brought my young boys here on their winter break and they loved it. I got the $24.99 \"pass card\" which gave them 3 hours to play the video games (since I bought this package together, they weren't allowed to play any games where they could win prizes and they were not able to earn tickets for prizes (it's not like they needed any more \"junk\" so no big deal). They had laser tag, bowling, an elevated rope course, video games, interactive floor, and foos ball table. They also serve pizza as well as other foods. They hold corporate events there as well. I'm not sure that I would want attend an adult type meeting there, but that's just me."}
{"text":"3 rd time here with the 3rd disappointment. We wont be back. Fat cats is much better. After paying 75 dollars for all you can bowl on Monday night we were kicked off the lane after the 2nd game.  Then u have to get back on the waiting list to bowl again and get a different lane. What a joke. So its actually all you can bowl depending on how busy they are. Ill be disputing my credit card in the morning for false advertisement.  The 2nd time we came we played about 200 bucks worth of games racking up points for our kids and then we went to cash in and they said our card malfunctioned and they comped us 100 points. I had over 5000 points. Waste of money and horrible customer service. Stay away."}
{"text":"I was their for pricing and research and was greeted by and  under enthusiastic hostess. The place is very clean and smelled very clean. The prices for bowling are pretty expensive and if you want laser tag you have to check in early. I was their at 2pm and they were booked until 3:45pm.  It looks like the pool table are really close together and they won't last long if they continue to allow children to stab the felt with the cues.  I hope parent won't allow this with their children either. 
I will return for the full experience hopefully they will have a new greeter."}
{"text":"Very fun place for kids and adults. Not a lot of activities because the arcade games ruin it all $1.65-$1.95 PER PLAY!!! You can go to amazing Jakes, peter piper, Chuck E. Cheese's, Dave n busters, or Brunswick bowling for $0.50-$1 a play. With Main Event, it will drain you broke and the prize section is cheap prizes and priced a lot of points. If your here hang out don't play the arcade games just do bowling, pool, laser tag, and the obstacle course. I spent $20 and only got 100 points. Most of the games me and others play always scam you and you never get your points. PLEASE MAIN EVENT ENTERTAINMENT LOWER YOUR PRICES ON ARCADE GAMES FROM $1.95 TO $1! Or come up with a happy hour for everyone!"}
{"text":"Me, my dad, and my boyfriend came here the first time to bowl. Payed about 50 bucks for an hour, which was okay I mean I guess. Drank some beers and bowled for about 30 minutes. We got hungry and found out they stopped serving food at 11. SO, in result, we ordered a pizza to be delivered. Got it delivered and we were stoked. 10 minutes later a short lady manager told us that we couldn't eat the pizza because we were in a restaurant, which is weird because we were in a bowling alley. She told us we couldn't eat the pizza so we told her to give us our money back, and she said no. So she left not telling us anything after that altercation. We left and she called the cops for eating pizza..... cops were chill and told us that my dad is never allowed there again or he will be arrested. Funny thing is that it was 10 minutes till closing time and this manager lady couldn't even let us finish the damn pizza.... funniest thing ever, but there wasn't even a sign that said you couldn't take outside food inside. WORST PLACE EVER. OVERPRICED. LASTLY MANAGERS THAT HAVE NOTHING BETTER DO TO AND HAVE SHORT PEOPLE SYNDROME. I rest my case. I LOVE PIZZA SO IT WAS WORTH IT. DNT TOUCH ME BIISSHHH."}
{"text":"i don't get why the arcade games are so over priced. i've been to many arcade venues and this tops off as the most expensive one for no reason. While i was here, i ran into a few arcades that didn't work and just took my money. The claw machine plush are stuffed in so bad that you can tell no one has won anything. Main Event does have a variety of different things (bowling, net climbing, dining and arcade) for your family to do but in my honest opinion the service doesn't match the product. 


Main Event is always busy when i visit but i am convinced it's because it's the only establishment like it other than Dave and Busters. the building is very appealing and when you enter, you feel like you're somewhere else. Most of the time it's clean but during those busy hours, you'll experience dirty tables or sticky floors. 

next time you come to Main Event, make sure you plan ahead to get a table or to bowl."}
{"text":"The place itself is fun for the family. The restaurant on the other hand is disappointing. Beth was my server, she had multiple forgetful moments, their milkshakes are blended with ice and my check was wrong. She never came back to give me change on my cash payment either."}
{"text":"Definitely will not be returning. Games are too expensive and bowling is ridiculous. Our lane needed to be reset after every other turn and the dumb pins kept slipping from the bowling pin holder when it does its sweep. It didn't just slip down and fall but fell forward and out onto the lane to where we needed someone to come to our lane more than once. You're on a timer of an hour which really doesn't even give you time for more than one and half to two games if you have a party of 6. I'll stick with Dave and busters for games and go to an actual bowling alley for bowling. Don't waste your money."}
{"text":"Service can be slow on some days but tonight Charlene, Kacey, and Julian were fantastic at the bar, will gladly come back anytime they work"}
{"text":"Main Event has something for people of all ages. Arcade games (with tickets that you can redeem for prizes), bowling, laser-tag, billiards, shuffleboard, and a high ropes course. On top of all that, they also have a restaurant inside that you can get food at between games. Definitely a good place for a birthday party for youth kids--as it has everything they'd enjoy. 

I've been here multiple times and have done something every time and have always been able to be pretty entertained. The downside of Main Event is that they because they have so many things to do, their customer service is spread pretty thin. We went for bowling yesterday, and rented 3 lanes for two hours. At one point, one of the lanes wouldn't reset/rerack the pins. The button wasn't working, and the \"call for service\" kept saying that all of their customer service reps were busy at the moment. We had to ask out waitress to get somebody to help us. But after 20 minutes of waiting, they finally came to fix it. 

Another small issue that wasn't too big of a deal, but still was an inconvenience to us, was waiting on our waitress. We finished bowling and were packing up when we gave her our payments for the food we had ordered. But we still had to wait around for 10-15 minutes until she came back with our change/credit cards. 

Overall, Main Event is a great place to hang out. They have lots of different activities for you to do and keep yourself entertained. But that's also their problem. They have a lot of everything, but don't really excel at any one thing."}
{"text":"Finally something close to work for a fun Happy Hour.

The Pilsner beer prices were reasonable, considering the area.  

I agree that the bowling prices are insane, but they do have some great specials.  You just have to look for them and get them at their ticket booth, I suppose.  

We walked around the arcade, took some fun pictures and got some game cards.  Games are anywhere from $1.10 to $1.65 in some cases.  

I'm sure they are still working out some kinks, being open only a month.  Will definitely give it another go around here down the road.  

Compared to Brunswick Zone in Gilbert, I'd have to give Main Even a nod on the side of not a bunch of rugrats running around, but the bar at Brunswick is more self contained, which is a plus for them.  And they (Brunswick) have karakoe."}
{"text":"Giving it 3 stars solely because the bathrooms are absolutely disgusting! First of all, highly recommend providing seat covers, and second it was obviously that only the bottom half of the mirrors were cleaned (leaving water marks running down the top part, thirdly the bathrooms were not well maintained (TP everywhere on the floor and just dirty half ass job of cleaning). Other than that, the night was super fun, reasonably priced drinks (didn't order food, but seemed like normal bar and grill type menu). LOVED the characters for bowling that was unique and entertaining, but overall I think this place is overrated."}
{"text":"The first time we went here, it was nice. There were open pool tables, friendly and attentive staff and pretty good food. The second time we went here....it sucked. The staff didn't look to sure about what was going on, the drinks sucked and it was a madhouse. I understand places will get busy, but when I have to go to the bar to get my own drink...and refill, and nobody ever stops by the table at all....I have an issue with that. :("}
{"text":"Kids are running this place and it's obvious, as they probably not where they're supposed to be. A lot of waiting around for workers to show up so we can sign up for laser tag AND it's morning! Not crowded yet. Come on Kids! Get it together! You're at work!"}
{"text":"I was out with a couple of friends last night  shooting pool. However as it turned 1:59am the lights were turnt off and as it hit 2:00am (close time) one of the employee from the bar yelled at everyone to \"get out and get lost!\" Some of the employees then started cursing and started getting mad that a couple of customers were still in there little pass 2:00am.  One of the employee then advised \"I do not want to clean this s*** up!\"  That is not professional at all especially if your an employee talking to your customers that way! It could have been handled in a professional way!"}
{"text":"Great place to have fun for the entire family. Not much for little kids to do but kids 7 and up will enjoy the laser tag, bowling, gravity walk and arcade games!!! The arcade games are from $1.10-1.65 per game so you will go through 30 bucks very quickly!"}
{"text":"Such a terrible waste of time :( I have suffered through a personal outing here with friends and then again for a company event. Because of the slow service, rude and un-attentive staff, LONG wait times to bowl or do anything really... Dozens of people from the group started leaving in huge waves. The clients paid so much for this and their group was having a terrible time! Ugh. Don't do group events here... These people don't know what the heck they are doing ! Don't even waste your own money going here with a date or small group of friends"}
{"text":"Nice place but don't like the fact that when you buy a fun pass at the kiosk .  You don't get $5.00 free like you would at the counter. Also on the kids meal doesn't include a drink unless you get the pizza one. Kid combo is $5.95 drink is $2?95. If I'm going to spend that much I'll go to Wing Stop where I van get it all. As far as arcade goes you're better off going to Peter piper or chuck e cheese. My son only really likes gravity and laser tag. This place is OK but not the best. Bye the way the most expensive game here is $4.65 the least is $0.65 a $5.00 card don't get you much. Good thing my son don't like arcade games. His friend that does got to play only 3 games on the card. They need to adjust the kiosk to add on the additional free $5.00 like they do at the counter."}
{"text":"My work had a team build event here and it was great. Donovan was a great host.  I didn't experience the issues other people had here with waiting as it was during the week.  I think having to wait it just going to happen since there is only one of these locations in the metro area.  I live an hour away and would take my kids here over Dave and busters at least during the week.  They need to build one in the north Valley like happy Valley and I-17. It would do great considering all the family communities around it. The waiting is just going to happen based on the demand of a great facilities and service. Only way to fix it is build more.  I would even have my kids birthday parties here if they were closer."}
{"text":"This place is definitely worth it.  The games are not overpriced and my kids of had a blast we've been here three consecutive weekends in a row."}
{"text":"Wonderful place to host a birthday party! We had our daughter's party here and everything went so smooth. Bree was our party hostess and did an amazing job. I can see where it would be a little pricey for a family to spend the afternoon playing games, bowling,ect, but I thought the party prices were very reasonable and well worth it. All you have to do is show up and bring the cake. Doesn't get much easier than that!"}
{"text":"The Staff was very accommodating and helpful for our large group that came in at 4:00 p.m. on a Sunday. They were able to find a spot for us and took our orders in a timely fashion and got us our food in little to no wait time period Brandon was awesome and the other 3 who work with him helped out tremendously thank you so much. We will be coming here a few more weekends this year and we may stop back by because they were so accommodating. The food was good for a establishment like this. We are  feeding hungry hockey players and we need to keep them fed and entertained.s all we have to do and keep them entertained. This was a Sunday night during the Labor day."}
{"text":"The music is SO loud!  Lots to do but you have to scream at the people you're with in order to be heard. The moment you walk through the doors, you want to cover your ears."}
{"text":"So .... I planned a Friday night out with my Meetup group Space is the Place. Our party consisted of about 14-16 people. About 1 weeks ago I called Main Event to try to reserve  space and check on recent promotions.  The most recent promotion as advertised on the website was \"Unlimited play for $5\" until Saturday, November 5th.  I mentioned this on the phone when I spoke with (Angela).  She informed they were no longer honoring that deal HOWEVER, if we come in together and mention it they'll honor it.  We arrive there (about 5 of us at once) and guess what ... the promotion was over weeks ago and they would honored it.  I explained I spoke with someone about a week ago and explained the whole story and nope .. nothing!  So we were offered a 3 hour unlimited play deal for $34.99 or the arcade card 3 hour unlimited play for $12.95.  We opted for a round of bowling ($36 an hour up to 7 people + $.95 for the shoes) and a round of laser tag (forgot the price).

We were told it would be a 25 min wait for us to get 2 lanes next to each other.  No problem!  We all went back to the eating area with a buzzer for more drinks and dinner.

Before we ordered dinner, our server reminded us of which dinner items comes with a free fun card.  She also says ..\"also .. right now we're doing a promotion for $5 unlimited play .. any game ).  We look at each other like O_O .. the hell?  She noticed the faces, excused herself and went to the front register to confirm what she just told us.  The verdict:  The promotion was over!  No problem at this point .. we already paid .. we just questioned the truth at this point.

Dinner:  Pretty darn good!  I ordered the grilled salmon with a side salad instead of the almond rice.  I'm not a huge rice person.  The salmon was grilled perfectly, a little salty and served with grilled artichokes and tomatoes on the side.  The salad was a spring mix, it came out room temperature/ a little on the warm side, so the greens were wilted a little.  Someone else in our party order a bacon cheeseburger ... regular  ... nothing special.  Someone else order the chicken pasta (I can't remember the name).  Pretty tasty!  One person ordered the friend fish and chips .. it's cod.  Cod is delicious but it was a little salty, just like the salmon.  One person ordered the chicken tender basket .. regular nothing special.  Lastly, someone ordered the pretzel  ...... my Goodness that thing was huge.  Really huge and its accompanied with stone mustard, and hot cheese. It's so good!  Must be a sharable item!

After eating and going for another round we realized that we were waiting a really long time for our lanes.  We got our buzzer at 9:05, at 9:50 I went to check on our wait time.  BINGO!! 2 lanes were available immediately so there we went.  From there .. everything else was a GO!  We had 7 people on a lane, everyone kept walking off to get drinks and more snacks (Note: we literally only saw the waitress one time.  Once!  She never came back). We ran out of time with 2 more rounds left, we asked if we could just finish the last 2 and the young lady at the front with glasses and brown and blonde hair was kind enough to give us 15 more mins to finish.  

We'd definitely come back and give them another shot.  Especially because with most of the food items you get a $10 gift card. Oh .. speaking of which .... I ordered 2 entrees, closed my tab at the bar area and moved to the lanes and totally forgot to retrieve my free fun cards.  I wasn't until I got in my car to leave and my friend said \"Well ... we at least have to come back again to use our free fun cards\".  I yelled, \"Crap .. I forgot mine\".  I went back in and showed the manager my recipe for the salmon and chicken pasta and he came back with 2 fun gift cards for $10 each.  So .. We'll definitely be back and I'll update my review."}
{"text":"The MOST horrible service ever in the bowling area. Got to our Lane and waited for one of the servers to come take our order. After about 20 mins of waiting and still no server, I had to get up and flag one over myself. She came over, took our order etc etc. After waiting an hour, yes an HOUR.. and not even our drinks had come out but yet seeing everyone else around us getting their food, I finally got up and asked her about our order in which she insisted that it would only take a few more minutes. Okay, understandable. Maybe they're a little backed up in the kitchen? Who knows. 

Anyway, after about 15 more mins of waiting she comes over to our table and says \"I'm sorry, but what did you guys order again?\" Uhhh are you kidding me??? I proceeded to tell her and she tells me to just come with her to the register where she puts in my lane number and come to find out there is NO order even inputted into the system under that lane. I asked her if my order was even put in and she assured me that it was and that somebody else probably took my food by mistake. She told me that it would only take 10 mins at the most and everything should be out. At this point, you can imagine how irritated I already am but I go back to my table anyway and continue to wait. Finally, about 15-20 mins later, the food comes out. I ordered the blt Cobb salad and she looks at me and says, \"oh, did you need silverware?\" Why of course not. I was actually planning on eating my salad with my fingers. Like really????? Took her another 5 mins to bring over the silverware and by this time, I honestly lost my appetite. 

I have never experienced such awful service before. For the amount of money I spent there today, I expected way more. That experience alone is enough to make me not return. 



Btw, the garlic fries are disgusting! They came out practically soaked in oil and looking like they were 3 day old fries that they reheated in the microwave. No thanks!"}
{"text":"We went there to celebrate my godsons birthday, when we arrived we were amazed by how busy they were, found us a table and waited about 15min, frustrated I got up looked around, that's when this night turned into the best night ever!!!! Kimoni pollard came over with a huge smile asked if we've been helped, from there he took over and never left our side kept up on everything also sang happy birthday, , bowling was good and specials were just right beer super cold bonus, i want to recommend you give kimoni employee of the month."}
{"text":"Came with family ! Service over all was slow ! Getting service and drinks was slow and waited two hours for bowling and another 2 hrs for laser tags ! Bad with service !!"}
{"text":"Love this place for date night and for family night. Great place to hang out with friends also"}
{"text":"Great time something for everyone from bowling to video games, lazor tag  .. I would however suggest someone check the bathroom more regularly no toilet paper or soap and when serving food make sure it's warm.. the mixed drinks are weak you may want to pre game ."}
{"text":"This place sucked the first time I came.  And continues to suck second visit. 

21 and under crowd. Terrible service"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times but tonight was the best! Wes at the bar was super attentive and made my crazy ultra Bloody Mary mix olive drink perfectly. We bowled and Leah was our waitress. Talk about excellent customer service!! I work in customer service and I would hire her in a second. Thank you Wes, Leah, and Chanel for your exceptional customer service. You guys rock and make us want to come back for our company team builders!!!"}
{"text":"Our first experience was on a weekday, the food was quick and the service was about a 3. Lots of staff, however some are less stellar and you can see that other servers and bar tenders are not happy to have to make up for them. We had to ask for our player cards for the current promo- and the server was unaware even though we pointed it out prior to the close of our tab- she said she thought we should bring our receipts to the main counter. Another server came and asked us if we had received our cards and took it upon himself to get a manager (it ended up taking 3 managers) to resolve the problem since we'd already been cashed out. Good on the 2nd server- but very poor on the 1st. We also saw a bartender wipe away the extra foam from a beer with her HAND...."}
{"text":"This place is cool , I like the concept.I don't like when  nickel and dime you.They have a special..18.95 for wrist band.but bowling shoes extra....yeah no thanks ! We have gone a few times.I think we will go next door or Fat Cat's.better prices for sure.Another thing I noticed while I was a the ordering at the bar ..a young boy had asked bartender and asked for glass of water.She ignored him just looked away. I get it its probably annoying to have kids come to the bar, however he shouldn't of been ignored.So if you want to pay a lot for a fun day and get terrible customers service at bar. This is a place for you"}
{"text":"Haven't been disappointed yet! My kids love going there for bowling or the arcade games. I enjoy the pool tables and the drinks! Great for a fun night out!"}
{"text":"The kids can't get enough of this place!!! We have been 3 times since moving to PHX a month ago. Right now they are saving up their allowance money to go again, because it isn't cheap!! We do the $17.99 wristband specials, but even still, they burn through the game $$ pretty quick. The food is decent, however, the drinks are very diluted and last time there was no server in the lounge area, so the manager was waiting tables. The place is super fun though."}
{"text":"What a rip off!!! Sad we came to celebrate my nieces birthday with 15 people and the manager Andrew said we have to off the 4 lanes because there were many many people waiting for lanes and gave us 30 minutes for 15 people to bowl on 2 of the lanes. The other 2 sat there empty for the 30 minutes....after the 30 minutes we had to give up the other 2 lanes...go figure it's their policy!!!! If you have a group and want to bowl DO NOT COME here."}
{"text":"I thought it was a good place to hangout with friends. Good music, pool, and tv's.
The cons for me is that the service of the waiters is bad. We had a table and needed to walk to the bar to ask for my sons drink. They hardly check up on you. Food seemed a little pricey. Arcade games are real pricey aswell. When an arcade cost $2.05 for about a minute of game action, your money can go away fast. 
I would go again but to get a beer with friends and play pool."}
{"text":"Crummy birthday party packages. My son has wanted to have his party here for a year so he and his friends could play laser tag and gravity ropes. I called to book a package, however if you choose laser tag and gravity ropes it is a one time only through the 15 minute laser tag room and one time only in gravity ropes. Main event pushes for the kids to bowl for an hour instead of laser tag or gravity ropes to fill up time. My son doesn't want to bowl. I can go to Brunswick to bowl!
I decided to allow him 5 friends to meet there and buy wristbands instead of a party package. Apparently, the wristband passes end on September 7th (which I was not told that the wristband special ends sept 7th when I called in July to book a party package), so it would be $8 per child per activity. You can do math, it's ridiculous ($48 for 6 kids every time they want to go through laser tag or gravity ropes!!!!). Who could afford that nonsense? My son is so disappointed. It is his big double digit, 10th birthday.
Now I'm scrambling to come up with something else after agreeing to this for the past year."}
{"text":"The rudest employees ever. First thing we get there get into the laser tag and the guy is yelling at us and treating us super bad. We then go get a bowling lane and my friend asks for water and the girl was like get them yourself so we had to figure out where to get our own water and serve it ourselves. Never have we been served like this. Then a worker comes and asks us if we want a refill and we told him about the other girl and he said it was their job to get our food and drinks.  honestly really rude place I would not go to this location. They treat you like a heard of cows. Read the reviews do not go here. What place asks you to serve yourself."}
{"text":"Came here to do a mini birthday party for my daughter and her 4 friends. We showed up at 9:30am, so the place was practically empty.

I have to say, the establishment itself is nice; everything looks clean and pretty, from the bowling alleys to the bathrooms. 

We started off with the ropes course, which was pretty fun for the girls and we'll arranged.

Next, we did the laser tag and had my first rough experience. The guy doing the \"demo\" wasn't even remotely helpful, just told us to watch a video. Well, I and 5 girls were trying to get our vests on, and we had no idea how they went on correctly, so we couldn't watch the video. Then we were rushed into the arena with no idea how the guns worked.

We followed that up with games and we had more problems. For such a shiny, new facility, there are a LOT of games that take your money...and do nothing. We had to ask for help 3 times. And these machines aren't at all cheap, we're talking $5.60 for a photobooth...which refused to spit out the pictures.

Finally, we went bowling. My shoes were absolutely slick on the bottom, so I was sliding everywhere. Our lane froze up on us 3 times, requiring help, all of whom said that they'd increase our bowling time to compensate (we lost about 15 minutes) but never did.

All in all, for the crapload of money I just gave Main Event, I was expecting a whole lot more...."}
{"text":"I had a great time here hanging out with my friends. We came here over the weekend to enjoy the $20 all you can play Labor Day deal. The package came with unlimited bowling, laser tag, pool, shuffle board, and the ropes course. The laser tag here is awesome! No basic troubles with the guns or vests working properly and the course is two levels! The scheduling staff was very helpful and mad ensure that my party had something to do the entire time we were there. In addition to the previously mentioned this Main Event location also has a ton of new arcade games, a full bar, kitchen and a pizza restaurant. Although I personally did not eat anything while we were there the food all looked pretty typically of what I would expect from an establishment like the Main Event.

Pretty cool place. I wish this location also had the rock climb wall and the mini golf that is listed on their main website."}
{"text":"Took my kids here on Saturday and expected it to be packed and there to be a long wait to do everything. To my surprise, it was the opposite. We put our name in place to bowl, ordered some food and by the time our food got delivered, we where ready to bowl! They brought our food to our lane so we could eat and bowl. The food was okay, but what do you expect, it's just one of those things. The kids had a blast running around and playing games. My oldest loved the laser tag.

My only complaint is that some of the staff was rude and slow. But hey, that's life. 

Pricing isn't that bad. It's about average for a place like this. Would go again in a heart beat!"}
{"text":"I may have walked into this place out of The Twilight Zone. It was QUITE strange. 
It seems like a great place and idea. Games, bowling, laser tag, restaurant, etc. 
However, without any customer service, it is only that. 
We had a 13 person party and when we asked if there was any deal that we could have for a group, the manager was curt and said, \"only if you book 2 weeks in advance and our sales office is closed now, so no.\"
We decided to go over to the bar and inform them that we had a 13 top in the dining area, which the bartender told us he would inform a server. After 30 minutes of waiting, we went back to the bar and the bartender told us, \"the kitchen is closed.\" At 10:30 pm, the kitchen closed.
We had to track staff members down to get any services, then when we did, they were rude, short and upset with us. 
They treated us like we were trespassing, when we really just wanted to eat and bowl.
The bartender appeared to be high as he had glassy eyes, would start serving us then wander to another patron before going back and not returning. He poured us drinks and couldn't remember if he charged us (despite us being two of four people at the bar). 
It is a great place to go if you do not want to be bothered and just want to relax with the other high schoolers drinking red bulls at the bar, before going to the party in the parking lot of underage youth who were recreating a scene from Fast and The Furious or play hide and seek with disgruntled staff members, but not if you wanted to bring a family here or have any sense of customer service."}
{"text":"Nice venue and fun place to take the kids.  Minus some points as their arcade games aren't as fun as other similar places.  Bowling makes up for it!  Haven't had a meal there yet so I can't comment on their food service."}
{"text":"The bartender is legit. He spent time, checked up, and made the drink exactly like I ordered it. Place is tidy well staffed and has lots to offer."}
{"text":"The food was suprisngly good, usually don't expect much in terms of quality from a place like this. The service though absolutely horrible."}
{"text":"Growing up in Texas, I was fortunate enough to have access to Main Event numerous times a year! So when I was informed they were building one where we currently reside in Arizona, I was ecstatic. My wife and I stated numerous times as we walked in \"This place is Beautiful.\" As we began talking to the employees, our experience started tumbling down a hill, but not a small hill, a mountainous hill relative to the heights of Mount Everest. Our experience began to cling to hope, hope our experience would get better! It has too!! This is Main Event!! Unfortunately, during our theoretical hike, we found no other hikers (workers) once we sat down, we yearned for just a drip of water, saw mirages of artistic entrees, and dreamed of cheap bowling shoe rentals (seriously, $8.00 to rent shoes?!?). Seems a bit high...considering it was $5 to bowl....for an unlimited amount of time, except our bowling fun extravaganza was cut short at an hours limit...during unlimited bowling. (We were in the building with maybe 10 other customers?) don't get me wrong, they have SOME standards ; my sons pepperoni pizza was amazing. My wife's pasta; comparable to a  old folks home cafeteria. As for my Beer battered cod, fries, and coleslaw; the cod was great; all three tiny pieces, the fries typical, but the coleslaw...hot? I love coleslaw, I've lived across the country and had coleslaw just about everywhere. My coleslaw for some reason sat under a heat lamp next to the rest of our food, and was hot enough to dry out just as it reached our table. 
Unfortunately, the games amongst every thing else were extremely expensive and some broken. They did give us a $10.00 promotional card that starts in January for some reason...But honestly you couldn't pay us to come back. 
Do yourself a favor, open up your Maps app, type in Amazing Jakes, and select go / navigate / drive. The extra drive is worth it... Your going to save money, play better, feel better, eat better, and be happy. 
Thanks Jake's for always being there...."}
{"text":"I was NOT a fan of this place. At 1st I thought hey cool place but quickly changed my mind. The bowling sucks because you have to pay for the hour and then you get kicked off your lane. The drinks were terrible I guess the waitress said something was wrong with the lines. Nope nope not coming back here. Waste of money."}
{"text":"Came here one night for a work-related event and had a good time. This was the second time my workplace had an event here that I know of so it looks like it's good for that type of thing. It was a meet and mingle type of deal so I mostly met folks from our vendor and made LinkedIn contacts and did all that cheesy networking stuff. Our vendor's corporate culture centers around alcohol to a crazy level and we were all handed drink tickets like they grew on trees or something - it probably also helped that everybody who was expected to didn't show up due to other engagements so there was lots of extras. The food consisted of tacos, sliders, and boneless chicken wings. Also chips with some type of spinach dip. From looking at the menu on the website I take it our marketing folks opted for the Casual Get Together menu option. The tacos were the best item IMO. Everything else was just ok. I wasn't footing the bill so I didn't really care and the more drink tickets I cashed in even less so. Ended up keeping my gaming cards for another time since the mingling and drinking was the main point and the games were a distant second. Place is huge but it wasn't too crowded that night. Will probably come back again. If you like FlipSide or Dave & Buster's - you'll probably like this place. It's on that same road that keeps curving and passes by Total Wine as well as IKEA. Lots of parking since it has its own lot."}
{"text":"It's like D&B but smaller and more kid friendly too. Came the other day for our company holiday party. Was pleasantly surprised by the quality of food the kitchen puts out as I only expected bar food, i.e. Pizza, chicken tenders, etc. We were served decent Italian food, raviolis, meatballs, and salad and all were good. They have all the standard arcade games, bowling alley, laser tag, and a ropes course. They also have a pretty Devon bar area with cheap drinks during HH (4 well drinks for $22? DONE!). Definitely lots to do and a great place for summer!"}
{"text":"Amazing place for families lots of games great deals for a low price staff is very nice and the food is extremely good"}
{"text":"I had a great experience hosting an all day corporate meeting/ team building event there. Their new healthy food choices helped keep me on my diet!  My daughters church group is hosting a lock in there in a few weeks and I feel much better about her attending now after hosting my own meeting there.  I will be back!!"}
{"text":"Nice concept but very poorly executed. We ordered the gigantic pretzel, when it finally arrived it was cold. The kitchen was super slow and the service was awful. No dressing for the salads, bent silverware, it felt like no one cared. Our check came to $78.26, I gave our server $100 and waited for change. When the folder was returned, I was given $20 back in change and no copy of my receipt. It just was strange."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE. Extremely overpriced. You'd be better off going to Chuckie Cheese or Dave and Busters, There was nothing exciting about this place. It was very confusing because they had multiple counters and you could only purchases certain things from certain areas. All the games were 2-6 dollars but the average was $3/4. 

The service wasn't bad but the place it self annoyed me how expensive it was, when you're not getting much in return. 

I will not be going back."}
{"text":"First time at this place was a nice experience. It was very clean and the people are friendly and informative considering our many questions. For people who are unsure of what this place is, it is very similar to a Dave and busters however it does have some extra activities including a ropes course, laser tag and bowling. All of the video games are also very updated and a lot of fun. My only disclaimer, is where you save on the price of unlimited laser tag, bowling or the ropes course you will pay handover fist in the prices of their video games.  Most of the video games are about $1.65 per play!  Something to consider if you plan on bringing your family."}
{"text":"I am very disappointed with Main Event's lack of professionalism.  I signed my 3 children up for a camp during the week of June 13-June 17.  On May 5, I received an email from their Event Coordinator letting me know that there will be no camp on Thursday, June 16 due to a private event.  I had already paid for the 5 days and planned to work during the hours my kids were in camp there.  Now, I must figure out other arrangements for my 3 kids during that time.  I strongly caution anyone from signing their kids up at Main Event.  You never know when a private event may preempt your kids' time there.  True, Main Event is willing to refund money for that missing day, but not I am in a lurch."}
{"text":"Place was pretty nice and well kept. Very clean and friendly staff. We payed $29 for two and had unlimited access to pretty much everything. The food is overpriced and you don't get much for what you you pay for. 
The bowling lanes are so much fun and will definitely come back just to bowl."}
{"text":"I really was impressed when I first walked in, the place is really nice, we were able to get a bowling lane in less than 20 minutes, which isn't bad for a Friday afternoon, but then the service went downhill from there. Upon receiving our bowling shoes, the girl at the counter asked if we wanted a server to come over to our bowling lane to which we replied yes. When we arrived at our bowling lane, we used the little console at our table to order an appetizer, their nachos, it acknowledged receipt of our order and stated that our order would be right out. We had paid for an hour of bowling so we had planned on enjoying our appetizer and maybe a beer or two. Well about 25 minutes later, well into our bowling, still no server (we couldn't order alcoholic beverages from the console), and no nachos. So I asked a young man nearby who worked there if he could find a server for us, he said something into his little handheld device, so we thanked him and continued to bowl. Another 10 minutes went by, and still no signs of any server, and no nachos, mind you, by this time, we had less than half an hour left of bowling time. So now my husband goes back to the front counter and informs the young lady who helped us secure our bowling lane that our requested server had still not arrived. He returns to bowl with me. We let another 5 minutes go by and I see the same young man again, so at this point, I'm getting really frustrated so I ask him for a manager, a few minutes go by and still nothing, and who appears to be a manager is standing around talking with another employee. Finally a server comes up to us to take our drink order, no nachos in hand either. We placed our order, contemplating whether or not we should even bother at this point, and then we inform her that we had ordered nachos over 30 minutes ago, no apology, just a blank stare and an okay from her, then she promptly walked away. We finally got our nachos and beers with about 15 minutes left of bowling. I have to say that the repeated attempts to contact a server from each employee seemed like we were bothering them or putting them out, they literally would all give us these blank stares! Maybe social media has put a real damper on our youth these days, inhibiting their communication skills. 

The entire experience was rather strange. The nachos ($11) were cold, but we still ate them, our time was up on our bowling lane before we knew it, so we finished our beers near the bar. Oh and after all of this, and leaving a bad review on the little console, still not one manager bothered to approach us. The two gentlemen who appeared to be managers stood around chit chatting with one another. Needless to say, we won't be back, which is unfortunate because it's such a nice place with so much potential. I also have to mention that there were a moderate amount of people there, it wasn't packed at all so there should be no excuse for the horrible customer service we received."}
{"text":"This place was really beautiful inside.  Extremely clean.  The bowling alley offered decent shoes and was spacious.  My only issue with this place was the customer service.  I went there on my birthday.  My group booked bowling and the tight rope activity.  What we didn't realize is that the placed closed earlier than we anticipated and we wouldn't have enough time to do both activities.  I asked the manager if we could get a pass so we could come back the next day, not a refund.  I made sure to clarify with him that we didn't want our money back, just a pass for another day since we paid for the activities upfront.  He told me we don't do things like that.  It was an example of substandard customer service, especially after we spent $200 dollars on bowling and drinks."}
{"text":"We've been twice now to go bowling and waited well over 2 hours and never ended up getting a lane. After the first time we decided to give it another chance but the same thing happened. We won't be back. Today we waited over 2 hours. They said it would be a two hour wait. We went to check how much longer and they said another hour and a half. Between all of the money we've spent on games drinks and food you'd think they'd give us better service. We will be at fat cats down the street."}
{"text":"Came here with work colleagues to find out there is no Happy Hour here on Fri & Sat. But decided to give this place a try and ordered some of their Garlic Fries. They came out lukewarm and had so much oil they were soggy. No garlic taste at all. The pizza we ordered we just average. Food wise nothing special if not a little disappointing. 

I personally wouldn't try this place again but if your looking to take the family out, your kids would have a blast. There is a lot for them here and you can enjoy a beer. Little pricey game wise too."}
{"text":"Great place to come for games and indoor activities when it gets hot outside. I've had a lot of their menu items here and they are all typical \"bar\" food nothing spectacular but still will satisfy your hunger. It seems like they never have a happy hour here so drinks seem pricey for what the place is. At lest with dnb they do half off liquor twice a day."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is very positive and the excitement is high with everyone smiling and playing games. However the games are extremely overpriced. If you're there just to play games you can go to the self kiosk & purchase your game card. The cheapest game there was $1.65, all of the claw machines are rigged, and some games didn't work after we swiped our card. Wanted to purchase drinks but the bartender was too busy to even notice us waiting for 5+ minutes to even get noticed. After 30 minutes and $50 on games later we left."}
{"text":"I thought this place was great! I got the summer pass & felt as though I got my money's worth. Bowling atmosphere was great. We played around with their camera option on the bowling monitors. Laser tag was fun, but they didn't give out official start times so I felt as though the game wasn't fair or didn't have official \"sides\". (Hey laser tag is competitive). Ropes was fun too

We only ordered the thai wings & parmesean garlic fries. Those were so good!!! 

If I were to complain about anything, it would be the price of their drinks, but then again I'm from Michigan so I don't know how things price out here in Arizona."}
{"text":"This is a 5 Star review because of our server, Jess, at the bowling alleys. She was absolutely amazing. I'm a regular at Main Event and this was the first time our server showed attentiveness, personality, and the upmost costumer service. 
Will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times and its honestly just an OK place to visit every once in a while. Don't like the fact that adults and children are mixed. Trying to walk around and play games at the arcade while trying to juggle a beer and trying to avoid all the kids running around on the weekends is a pain. Also the waiting times for bowling on the weekends can get pretty crazy. There's better places for people trying to just shoot pool, or drink and play games, or to bowl at. The gravity ropes are pretty fun though and they do have a nice selection of arcade games, if I was to come back I would just come during the week to try to avoid the big crowds/wait times that come with the weekends."}
{"text":"We went there for my sons birthday. The birthday package of 15.95 each is not bad. Sign up for a fun card and they will email you a $5 one allow 1 or 2 days to get the email but I received mine immed. Our party package included cheese pizza, drinks, laser tag, $5 arcade card for each kid. The pizza was really good all the food looked fantastic so the kitchen is definitely ok.  

Our party host was Mia and it was organized and not as chaotic as I thought it would be. 

Be advised the games and activities are expensive. All the arcade games are from $165-$195 EACH and laser tag and gravity ropes are $9.60 after tax each, on peak. 

Look for specials and take advantage of them. They have a Monday night all you can play arcade special, plus summer break camps that include unlimited bowling, laser tag, etc. 

Otherwise this place can get very expensive but it's fun."}
{"text":"Love the cleanliness and newness of the arcade games. A little pricey but there's something fun for everyone. Bar, restaurant, bowling, laser tag ($8), gravity ropes ($8), picture booths, air hockey, skee ball, tvs and a ton of arcade games"}
{"text":"Wow. What an awesome place for kids and adults alike. This was our first time visiting. We used the summer fun pass special, what a great deal. When we arrived, we walked right up to the check in counter, the associate was very kind and explained everything to us, and made sure we had no questions. The manager Jim was standing there and offered to show us around. My boys wanted to play laser tag first, unfortunately there was a game going on so we had to wait about 10 minutes, while waiting, Jim showed us around the arcade, even set my boys up with 1 free game, trying to scare them. Lol.  Laser tag was a blast. We then went on the gravity ropes, now, I'm a big chicken, so it scared the hell
Out of me, but it really was a lot of fun, coordination helps. Lol. After that if was off to play Billiards.  Then a little lunch, they have a very nice restaurant inside, average cost for restaurant food, and pretty decent too. Then we went bowling, they have the greatest bowling here. They have a bowling game called \"toons\" where it takes 3 different pictures of each player and then after each turn, it plays a little story with all players in different scenarios, riding a motorcycle, parachuting, dancing, etc.  Back to the gravity ropes we went. I didn't go this time, but both my boys did, wow, what an experience, there does not appear to be any sort of time limit that they can stay up there, but I guess that probably depends on how busy they are, my boys spent about 30 minutes up there going on all the different obstacles.  Forgot to mention, my boys are 10 years old, this place is awesome. Now, I do have to say, without the summer fun pass, this would have been way to expensive to bring my family, and we also went on a Monday, I don't really know how busy the weekends are. But I definitely say, try this place out before September 1,  2014 and take advantage of the summer fun pass.  The only thing that bummed me out about this location, is that there is no Mini Golf and No Rockwall. And the video games are really expensive and not included in the Fun Pass..... Extra Kudos to Manager Jim, he went above and beyond to make sure my boys had a good time, he was always available to answer a question or help out where need be. Another shout out to Drew at the restaurant, thanks for the great service.   I only rated 4 stars because I was bummed that there was no rock wall and no mini golf, also because of the cost of the video games. But over all experience was fantastic.....

{"text":"My husband and I decided to take the kids bowling on a Monday night at 6:30pm. We went online to reserve a lane prior to leaving the house. Since the website only allows you to reserve a lane 48 hours in advance (ridiculous), I called the location. The girl on the phone was extremely rude and said it was a 1.5 hour wait for 1 lane for a family of 4. When we arrived, the employees were rude once again telling us that it would have been best to reserve a lane 2 days ago. 2 days ago I didn't even know we were going to go bowling! Not a great experience. We will go to Brunswick next time!"}
{"text":"Was here for a group holiday party, the food was good and it was a lot of fun.  Lots of different things to do.  Gets pretty pricey to play games most are over $1 each time you play."}
{"text":"Basically a Dave and Busters with a nice bowling ally combined. If you're just going bowling, the deal was worth it. Anything else, get ready to drop
some dough. Food was expensive and small portions but good! Service was really good and staff was friendly. Super fun if you have money to blow! Haha."}
{"text":"Great fun spot and it's only $10 per person if you go before 11am during the summer for an all day pass that lasts until 5pm. The pass includes bowling, pool, laser tag and gravity rope. That's a great deal. I feel like going all the time now after finding out about this special. Cool place for a kids birthday party."}
{"text":"This place is really close to us but the waiting time here for the pool table is ridiculous. They messed up and gave us the wrong timer when we went up to get our table Andy told us that we had been given the wrong timer and had to wait AGAIN! Another hour goes by and nothing... so not worth it

Hello, Chris Could you please provide an email to respond to"}
{"text":"Glad they opened a location in Gilbert. Individual activities can get expensive so look for the package deals. If you go there before 10.30 AM, they have a special for $12.99 which seems like a great value. Food is a bit on the expensive side which is in line with such venues. Nice places for kids to hang out with their friends, while parents can also have some fun. We had a large group and everyone had fun."}
{"text":"Tonight our office of 9 employees headed to main event for a team building party. Sad to say this will be our last time visiting! We arrived on a Monday afternoon at 3  for drinks and food, after having one or 2 drinks we played laser tag and then decided to bowl. The bowling alley was super nice and we were able to order drinks from a waitress. That's when a party came to a horrible end! After a gal in our party tried to order a Third drink (3 in 31/2 hours) our waitress told us that she was \"slowing her down on her drinking\" we ordered 5 drinks between 8 people! Our waitress told us that she would have to kick us out if we ordered another drink!! WHAT!!? My co worker was so insulted that this women was talking to her this way. The waitress when confronted by me proceeded to tell us that she was trained to look for signs of when people had too much to drink but when I asked her if she knew how drinks we had she had no idea! Then she told me that the women in question had ordered two drinks within a few minutes of each other, we told her the drinks weren't even for her! We spent close to $500 and were treated like garbage!!! Beware if you are going here for fun!! Not so much. Thanks for stealing $500 welcome to the neighborhood main event!!!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere is okay, kids had fun, first drink was great, ordered another one and they got It wrong twice. Overpriced food for the quality, low grade meat, brown soggy lettuce, soft bacon, but the bun was nice and soft lol. Waitress was very nice but I could tell she was stretched beyond her capabilities, completely not her fault. Asked for a manager to let her know and she came over and offered another meal, didn't say much and never returned to check in. Will NOT be back again. Had to ask a few different people to get the kids water smh"}
{"text":"Decent variety of activities including bowling, laser tag, a billiards room, a jungle gym, and a selection of mediocre arcade games. The food selection is an ok selection of American goods but there is something for everyone.

Overall, it is a great place for a variety of activities if you have a big group with eclectic tastes. Not great at everything they provide, but they provide a lot so there's something for everyone."}
{"text":"Nice place, awesome laser tag facility. Good selection of games and the prize center had some nice prizes. Everyone was very nice and friendly. Was pleasantly surprised with how much I enjoyed the food there. Would go back, about as expensive as Dave and busters but a better place for kids."}
{"text":"Yesterday was my first time going to Main Event. I've always wanted to go because it sounds like endless fun! Before I went, I checked reviews (as I always do) and read 0 positive comments. They were all negative, stating things like \"I will never go back\" and \"I would never advise my friends to go there\". I thought they probably just had a bad night, so my boyfriend and I decided to go anyway. And I will never go back ever again. We started with bowling and it took about 30 minutes just to get started. They have touch screens where you begin the game and it's so complicated if you're a first time user. We had to walk to front desk 3 times before someone would actually come over and help us. They moved us lanes 3 different times until they finally put us on one that actually worked. Each lane has tables and the ones at our lane were filled with food leftovers from the previous bowlers. You'd think they'd come and clean it up, but they never did! Even after we asked twice! We even threw some of the leftovers away ourselves just so we could have room on the table to set our stuff down! We asked for a server so we could at least order some drinks, and that took another 15 minutes. They have a laser tag arena and I asked one of the employees if it was open and he replied with \"I don't know\". Seriously? Don't you work there? It was unbelievable. The worst customer service I've ever experienced. It's such a shame because it's a very nice place and anyone who has never been is excited to go. But it was a huge let down."}
{"text":"Today I took my family to Main Event in Tempe AZ for the first time. I have booked corporate events at this locaiton but have never attended an event before. We arrived and it looked like it was busy, but not horribly crowded. When we got to the cashier we asked to take advantage of the Funbination promotion - I asked how long of a wait it would be, the cashier said 20 minutes to bowl. At the time this didn't seem bad so we paid for two adults and two children plus shoes. We then bought $50 worth on a funcard and played some games while we were waiting.  Well, twenty turned into 45 and finally our buzzer went off, we snagged shoes and followed Victor to our lane. We began bowling and after what we thought was our first round, the waitress comes and brings us our ticket to cash out. At this time, I asked to leave it open as we were going to order more food - she then shares that we have to leave our lane and get put on a wait list to boaw again...WHAT??? 

My husband and i look at each other clearly confused - this is supposed to be unlimited. I question the waitress and she offers to let me speak with a supervisor as I shared that I was unhappy and wanted my money back as this wasn't wait I had paid for and no one shared this would be the process. I had a one year old with me and if we would have been aware that we would have to wait to bowl a second round then we wouldn't have stayed. - I wanted to be able to bowl consecutive games with my family - not wait around and relocate. This was the first we heard of this stipulation to the unlimited options and we were expecting a manger to be apologetic and caring...instead I got Jason - who was rude and unapologetic and who began telling me that all the employees share this informaiton and he \"knows we were told\". (pretty much accusing me of lying.) 

At this point i am incredulous at his demeanor and how rude he was - (Consequently, I also responded in kind with very terse words and comments for Jason on his behavior - which he clearly did not want to own as he felt he didn't need any feedback. - trust me he does.)

He was so self-satisfied and smug with his certainty that he was right. He actually said he was, \"99.99% positive and it would be a miracle if we weren't told we wouldn't be able to play consecutive games\" he wouldn't even listen to my complaint of not being told - and my ask for my money back as I clearly did not get what I had paid for as this aspect of the day wasn't explained.  He was such a jerk about the entire thing I asked to speak with someone else and he said there was no one else in the building for me to speak with - I asked for his name and information and he gave me the information for his GM (who I am also emailing over this issue.)

All in, we spent over $150 at this establishment and sadly, I will never be back to this location and am writing about this experience so others know not to visit this store as clearly there is no care for the customer. 

Reading the other reviews it appears that many feel the same way and it also looks like a few have encountered Jason, the uncaring manager and walked away feeling the same way as I. Ripped off and upset."}
{"text":"Went to Main event for the second time on Sunday. We tried to take the kids there on Saturday evening but it was so packed that we didn't think the unlimited laser tag, bowling, billboards and gravity ropes would be worth it. We came on Sunday afternoon instead. It was a good move as it wasn't too crowded. The deal was $15.95/person from 12-4 pm. We got there at 1 and went straight into a 15 minute game of laser tag. When it was over we went to sign up for another round. Since it wasn't super busy the girl at the counter signed us up for three straight rounds. It was really cool as we didn't even have to take off the gear for 45 minutes. All in all, we played 5 rounds of laser tag and a bunch of video games. The kids had a blast. Tons of fun. Didn't bowl or anything else this trip because the laser tag is what the kids wanted to do. However, when we arrived it looked like there were plenty of lanes available. It was definitely more crowded as you got closer to 4pm. Will be back."}
{"text":"I just took my staff here for our holiday party and it was awesome!  I guess that on Sundays, or at least the day we went our passes were for all day play, so I felt like I got my money's worth for sure.  The food was good, our service was great and the laser tag was so much fun!  I can't wait to go back.  Don't let the rope gravity fool you, if you are afraid of heights it is a bit scary.  I couldn't finish it the first time, but faced my fears and finished the second time!  Overall I thought it was great!"}
{"text":"This place has some potential but has a lot of kinks to work out in order to avoid frustrating the customers. 

Pros: The bowling lanes are very cool! They take photos of the bowlers and put them alongside your name on the screen that shows the scores. And they superimpose the faces from your team onto various cartoons during the game. My kids thought this was HILARIOUS. 

My kids also loved the interactive video playing on the floor outside the bowling area. I watched jumping on pretend bugs, toppling pretend bowling pins, etc for a long time. They all seemed to love it. 

Cons: I was able to watch the interactive video area because I waited nearly an HOUR to be helped at the dining table in the bowling area. I think I would *still* be there if I hadn't sought out a server myself. And there was a cluster of people near the entrance to the bowling area, which was annoying and made it hard to get in and out. I don't know if they were waiting for a lane, or just socializing there bc they had friends playing in the nearby lane, or what?? But the staff should have relocated them and cleared the flow of people in that area. 

Also the process of buying a ticket for the gravity ropes course was very confusing. We waited in one line, then were told to move to the other line, which meant we had to go to the back of that line and start the wait all over. The bottleneck also blocked the entrance to the shop. 

Let people buy laser tag & ropes course tickets at the kiosks instead! And make sure the staff doesn't ignore people waiting to be served. 

Also the nachos were terrible. They were served without salsa (?) and so once you got the few toppings off the top layer, you were left with a stack of chips and nothing to eat them with. The pizza was very good."}
{"text":"Only reason it doesn't get five stars is because the first time I came there was a great bargain and the second time I came I had to pay triple the price for the same attractions!

Laser tag is super fun-- must try! Gravity is for those brave souls who like to suspend themselves while walking across planks. Bowling has a nice twist as you get to take photos and cute little videos play as you get strikes, spares and gutter balls. 

Good for a date or a big group because there's so much to do! They also have arcade games, a bar and pool tables. Lots of big screen TVs with sporting events playing."}
{"text":"We enjoy coming to main event. Our last visit 4/14 we played games for 2 hours. Decided to eat and the service we got was horrible. Our food was cold, we saw our food coming out than they took it back to the kitchen and for about 10 minutes they couldn't figure out it was our food. Then we ordered a burger for my daughter which was way overcooked. The server forgot to bring plates for our wings. He forgot to bring napkins, he brought 2 we had 3 people at the table. We waited 15 minutes for him to cash our check. I believe his name is Michael and this is the second time we have had him. Get better service."}
{"text":"Kudos to Steven and Justin as we had a couple hiccups and they both went above and beyond to make this a 5 star vs a 2 star review! 

Best recommendation I can give it to call ahead of time to make sure they do not have a bunch of private parties as they will tie up all the time slots in the laser tag!

Thanks again guys for all you did to make it right for my 2 kiddos and I!!!!"}
{"text":"Not a nice place when they charge you $29 for one hour of bowling,then you see a placard on the table saying a summer pass is only $9.95. When you go to the desk to ask why wasn't I offered this deal they said it's actually $17.95  then when you say I am not happy with it all and the double price besides the printed advertisement all over the place for $9.95 all you get is an I'm sorry. This is serious bullshit fraud! If you want to get ripped off  then this is the entertainment place for you! I think someone should investigate their false advertising as this was an atrocious violation of consumer advertising and trust!"}
{"text":"I go here for unlimited bowling to celebrate my birthday... Only to get kicked off my lane halfway through. Apparently, despite being told that the lane is mine for as long as I want it, they kick you off for rotations. Bait and bloody switch. I highly discourage spending your money here. Go to Brunswick at Tri-City Bowl."}
{"text":"We hosted a surprise birthday party at Main Event and the event was a success!

Our party host and server, Becca, was fantastic. She was helpful from the moment I arrived and helped us setup the party area for the birthday. We had almost 30 people and Becca made sure that everyone was taken care of. The food arrived on time, even though we also had a last-minute order when we realized we would have more guests than we anticipated. She also helped us pull off the surprise by being our eyes and watching for birthday boy walk in to the facility. 

The guests had a great time later on playing games and laser tag. Would definitely host another party at Main Event. Thanks to Becca, Carlos and the staff for helping make the evening run smoothly."}
{"text":"I was hesitant after reading the negative reviews, but my teenage son wanted his bday party here so I did it anyway. I am so glad I did!

I had to make a couple changes to my initial reservation and each time I called, it was absolutely no problem at all.  Even though I was afraid my requests for change would be seen as a major hassle, I was never made to feel that way. Each of the sales staff I spoke with were very accomadating and courteous.

 Any other kids party I've had, I've always been the planner, chef,  host, etc.... I think the best part of having it here was someone else took over all that and for the first time ever I was actually able to enjoy my child's birthday celebration instead of worrying about food, schedules, activities, refills, etc! I was an active participant in the fun instead of a frazzled parent!

Everybody I came in contact with from initial reservations to the very end were so friendly and helpful. Our 2 young party hosts were on the ball with bowling shoes, drinks and keeping all of us on schedule and busy.

Most importantly, my son and his friends who attended had a great time and that's all that matters to me! I would definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"Came in around 10pm on Monday night. Got into line and bought the unlimited games and activities package at 10.95 each its a pretty good deal. Went over to bowl and asked for a server. It took 30 minutes to show up to our lane. Even after we told 2 other people we needed someone.  Anyways we had a great time and enjoyed playing all the games and laser tag"}
{"text":"Absolutely by far the worst experience I have had in quite a significant time if not ever, in regards to showing children a good time.  First of all, when trying to schedule a birthday event for my grand children we called several times and got a different story or explanation of prices/packages each time. Employees are obviously misinformed. After much confusion we eventually settled on a specific package and scheduled a time. Upon arrival and checking in, we were told our package was a 2 hr package. We had been told we were getting a 4 hr package for our price. After some deliberating and the employee eventually agreeing that she had indeed quoted us a 4 hr time period for our package we were given what was promised (kudos to Alyssa for making the effort to make the customer happy and helping us, I admit the normal time is indeed 2 hrs per the web site (we learned later) but we were quoted 4 and this was our first time. The explanation of how things work could have been better. We picked a spot out and settled in with cake, gifts and guests etc. only to find out a short time later that we had servers at our disposal at our reserved bowling lanes. As we made the attempt to pack up our party and move to our lanes we suddenly were alerted by the children that they had been told our bowling lanes were given away to some other private party. 
After speaking to Alyssa, she explained that the party that had taken over our lanes was told to do so by staff because they had accidentally given their lanes away. So we were forced to wait an extra hour for another set of lanes to open up before eventually getting our spot. Shortly after this,  I found they were still trying to to charge us for the same hours even though we didn't get our lanes till an hour later than promised. This was also fixed after being brought to their attention(kudos to Alyssa again, keep this one she's a winner). 
A little later we were signed up for laser tag, we prescheduled 10 of us from our group. Show time was 2:15 and although some of our group showed at 2:15, the other part showed at 2:16( this is literal and no hyperbole or exaggeration is made here, we were literally 1 minute late (shame on us!). My kids were told that they were too late and the group had already gone in and they would have to wait. If there is a sign up sheet and I was given a receipt, how did they get the full amount of participants in if we weren't there(there were 10 of us!)? This means the employees aren't checking the receipts of people going in thus creating confusion and possible conflict between prescheduled patrons. Upon approaching the young man to speak to him about this and expressing my unhappiness about this, he responds to me by saying, \"dude, your family is not the only family here and not the most important thing here\". I swear if I were not at a family type location I would have made sure that was the last time he ever calls an elder man \"dude\" again let alone is disrespectful to someone like me again. Yes, Im literally saying I would have knocked his cocky ass out if we had been anywhere else other than a family setting(FYI, I don't pretend to be a tough guy nor do I ever talk this way but for him I would make an exception) I cannot remember his name, but if I hear it again, I will know it. It was an uncommon name. 
At our seats, after opening a tab with a credit card, we were approached by no less than 3 different servers. 2 of the the at least three servers insisted I did not have a tab open,  and insisted I needed to pay for what was ordered then and there. So we paid with cash in order to avoid any more confusion. As we got up to leave, we were approached by an employee who informed me I need to close out a tab of 2 drinks before leaving. Seriously?! After all that?! Where had this guy been all this time?! Don't get me wrong, the two drinks were ordered and needed to be paid for but what about all that other confusion with the other servers! I knew there was a tab open somewhere. Again, terrible organization and communication with these employees. My advice to this place is to improve hiring practices or hire at least one adult to run this place right. The appearance is that it is run by young individuals with no concept of customer service. FYI, I have never in my life written a review this long (but they gave me so much to tell! LOL). It has the potential of being a really awesome place but definitely in need of some structure and discipline (but keep Alyssa! If not I'll hire her!).
P.S. I forgot to mention that one part that I initially thought was really cool about their packages is that they come with a set of $10.00 cards for each participant towards the arcade games. That is, until I realized that their arcade game prices range from $2.65 to 4.90ish! For an arcade game?! Really?!' After spending several hundred dollars here my verdict is this: Poorly trained, unknowledgeable and rude employees plus expensive arcades equals a bad outcome."}
{"text":"For a party of 10 way over priced for the experience. The lanes for bowling kept having technical difficulty. You have an hour to play and we spent over a quarter of the time sitting waiting for several repairs. No apology - no extra time given - no discount. Spelled my daughters name wrong for her birthday party. The food is way over priced. They include gratuity and your party host only receives 12% of that which is a joke. The rest of the \"gratuity/tip\" goes to those that help?! Who else helped? The people having to come and fix the bowling lanes? Laser tag is part of the party package and the kids get to go 1x for 10 minutes. $5 on a card when the cakes on average are $1,20 to $1.90 seriously. I could think of much better parties for just under $500 and that wasn't even for their big party package."}
{"text":"Management is spread too thin because of a crappy system!  Servers are non existent at the tables unless you wait 30 minutes and then go to management.  Once we had someone it's fine.  Becky is a great waitress and saved the night! 

Come in with a plan ....bowling, laser tag, sky walk - otherwise you will spend a lot of time just waiting!  Bracelets are worth it if you are going to do everything!"}
{"text":"I can here with some colleagues for a corporate outing. This place has something for everyone -- bar, restaurant(s), pool table, \"jungle gym\", arcade, the shuffling game, and of course bowling.

It's spacious, clean, and modern. The bowling lanes are plentiful as are the balls. The staff seemed to be pretty attentive, especially considering the size of the group. Downside is that I can see this place getting expensive fast. And the food is so-so, but it's definitely great for a night out with friends where the focus is entertainment and not necessarily food/drinks.

Bonus they were giving out free pairs of socks. Unheard of!"}
{"text":"This is the first time and definitely the last time we will come here. The only thing I will rate this experience on is the service at the restaurant near the entrance. We sat down at 1:55 for lunch at 2:18 as I'm typing this our table still doesn't have its drinks for everyone seated here. We had to complain to the manager who talked I've rme the entire time I was speaking to him. The server (the ONLY server) had 5 parties including us. Granted they were large parties, but his manager should have stepped in and helped him out. Finally the server came to us and took our food order, and actually stopped listening halfway through the order. I stopped talking and he waited about 20-30 seconds and said \"I'm sorry, what?\" As he finally looked back at our table. We finally got a new server about 2 minutes ago, who got thrown in the mix and is nice but is in a position to not. Rectify anything. The challenge here is 100% management and their lack of leadership. None of these instances would occur if they knew what they were doing and were better coached in training and customer service. We are still pending our food order. We are now 30 minutes in and our table finally got all of its drinks. (Will update after food comes) 

----Waited about another fifteen minutes for food. Order came out incorrect. Finally the actual manager came and talked to us. She apologized for the service and comped our lunch, she also gave us a free hour of bowling for our family. We will not be using it however. It was our first family outing there and combining it with the service, and the little one burning his fingers when he tried to eat his chicken tenders, it was too much to take a second chance."}
{"text":"This place is fun, the food and games are great! My son and I had some food, our waitress Corinna was great. She had another large birthday group to attend but she would still take good care of us. 

We are coming back for sure. Main Event management make sure to take care of Corinna. Thank you."}
{"text":"Food was sad, service was slow and the price a little too much for what I wanted to spend in an hour bowling and a ok lunch with the coworkers."}
{"text":"It was my sister's birthday and our friends wanted to do something for her and we heard so much about this place, it is a little pricey but absolutely fun, awesome vibes and cool people. Sucks that we had 8 people (max is 6 per lane for bowling). We also dominated in laser tag, so it was a good night to say the least, definitely coming here again!!"}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever! My family and I came here on a Sunday night for what we thought would be a great bowling experience. Unfortunately we were WRONG! Our night started off well, we bought out two lanes and started bowling with no problems.. halfway through our game we realize we're thirsty and no one has come to take drink orders! HALFWAY THROUGH THE GAME!! Are you serious!!!!! This is when I take it upon myself to ask one of the servers for drinks which he seemed annoyed to have to do! 15 minutes later he comes back with our drinks and then never came back for refills.. I about lost it when I realized the hold up was due to the fact that the servers were just hanging out and talking as if they weren't at work!!! We ended up paying $14 for drinks we didn't get until the end of the game very disappointing, never again..."}
{"text":"Similar to Dave and Busters with a few extra games, but the service is terrible. When you walk in, if you plan on eating, there are no signs directing you what to do. When we tracked down an employee and asked, they said to just sit at a table and a server will find you. We didn't get noticed as a new table until flagging down a server. All 4 orders came wrong the first time, and food service was very slow. Arcade is ok, but when trying to do gravity ropes, we stood in line to buy tickets assuming we can go and use them since there apparently wasn't a line. Turns out there is a 2 1/2 hour wait, and the ticket counter has no information on the wait times for any events except bowling."}
{"text":"We enjoyed the bowling and laser tag, but the rating was for our waiter. His name was Tony. He forgot our order entirely and we had to re-order after waiting 20 minutes. Then, upon payment, he gave us someone else's credit card. We informed him of this, but it made us wary to give our own payment in credit lest he make the same mistake and someone used our card to charge their order. After we reordered an additional time he brought us our food and requested payment. We paid in cash and gave him $25 for a $19 meal. He never gave us change, so we requested the change. After waiting another 20+ minutes for him to continuously \"forget\" our change he claimed he didn't have $1 bills to give us. So he gave us a $5 bill. This was obviously so we couldn't give him anything but a $5 tip. It was so weird I feel like we were being conned or something... We ended up just giving him back the $5... Really bizarre

Also we ordered an alcoholic drink and he didn't ask for our ID. The people bowling beside us looked underage and were also indulging in alcoholic drinks..."}
{"text":"BEST. NIGHT. EVER.

I'm not even sure where to begin but me and all of my buddies were thrilled about our experience here. We came for my brothers bachelor party and were greeted by the manager Casey, who helped us have the best experience ever. Casey, I'm not sure why you decided to come help us but we are SO grateful. Your generosity, kindness and eagerness to help us have a great evening has made us fans for life of Main Event.

Our server Maddie was incredible. She was attentive, made sure we all had our checks squared away, ensured that our drinks and food came out on time. She was very delightful to work with.

The bowling crew were super helpful setting us up with games, helping us get drinks and settling on the tab.

The facilitators of laser tag were both fun, funny! Delaina and her male co-worker (I wish I could remember his name!) were so awesome!

All 16 of us said at the end of the night that it was one of the best nights we've ever had. We will most certainly he back and will tell ALL of our friends looking for something fun to do to head down to Main Event in Gilbert!

{"text":"Drinking, bowling, arcade, lazer tag, pool tables, gravity course...pretty cool place."}
{"text":"Came here for my sisters birthday. It was fun! It's a big place. Not cramped. Spacious I love it. There was also a game going on that day too. They had huge screens by the bowling area but you can see it even if your not playing bowling. So of course the game was on and it was fun to watch. 

They also have gravity ropes, mini golf, pool tables, hockey tables & video games. Also they have a photo booth to take photos. 

Some days they have deals going on for $7 for bowling or laser tag & so on. Sign up for emails to be in the loop. 

Also Monday's they have a deal for $10.95 for all you can play activities or you can choose unlimited video games or $20 funcard for food & fun. From 4pm to close."}
{"text":"Went there today with my 4 kids to bowl and play arcade games but our plans soon changed. I went up to the service counter to inquire how much it was to bowl for an hour and I was surprised by their response. The total was going to be $125 for five people for one hour and that included the shoe rentals. I was blown away and I told my kids we can go to old town Avondale and get a better experience and price. We decided to play a few arcade games before we left and that was not a good experience either. There were about 7 pre-teen boys running around playing catch with each other not to mention they were jumping all over the arcade games as well. It was very annoying and they had no consideration for anyone else in their way that was trying to enjoy the arcade area. I looked around to see if there was any staff members who can tell them something but no one was around. This place employs quite a bit of young teens who seem like they don't care about what's going on. I doubt I will ever go back to this place again due to poor management, overpriced goods and very loud atmosphere. If you want to spend a lot of money in a couple hours, receive mediocre customer service,and not be able to have a conversation because of the noise, this is the perfect place for you."}
{"text":"The yelp score and the reviews say it all. The lack of customer service is exactly what my family and I experienced tonight. I went to the front desk to ask how much longer for a bowling lane and one of the employees snatched the pager out of my hand and said with a very rude tone just go to lane 17!! I immediately asked to speak with a manager to let them know what just happened. I spoke with Carlos and told him my story and he responds back and says there's 2 sides to every story. As a manager, Carlos should be trained better to deescalate the situation, not to put a customer on defense and make them feel as if they're lying by responding the way he did. I asked what did the other employee said, and found out that the employee who snatched the pager out of my hand, accused me of saying when is my f'ing lane ready, which was a complete lie. Carlos then proceeded to tell me they have a zero tolerance policy for profanity which made sense to me why the employee would lie for her defense, because she knew what she just did, snatching the pager out of my hand. Hypothetically speaking, even if what the other employee said was true, and I did use profanity, are they trained to snatch a pager out of a customers hand to escalate the situation more or go get a manager? After all, I, the customer was the one to ask to speak with a manager. The deals and atmosphere are great for families but like all the other reviews the staff needs more training on customer service. I asked to get the GM's information and have not spoken with him yet. There were three other managers on duty who came over to listen to my story and not one of them apologized for the employees actions and behavior. What should have been a fun bowling night with my family turned into us not bowling and leaving very disappointed on how we were treated as customers. I strongly encourage them to read these reviews and take them seriously because if they don't I can't see Main Event expanding. After all if it wasn't for us paying customers they would not be in business."}
{"text":"Woohoo!!! Talk about a fun spot to go! I tagged along with a friend whose daughter was having a birthday party at Main Event this past weekend, and I may or may not have let my inner child run rampant. I probably had more fun there than the kids, haha! I mean, when you walk into a ginormous place that has bowling, arcade, laser tag, pool tables, air hockey, food, drinks (yes, a full bar as well), what more can you ask for?!

The first thing my friend and I noticed was how big and spacious it was... the second thing we noticed is that, even though there were a bunch of kids running around, the place smelled fresh and clean! I've been to other places where it's not pleasant being there because the ventilation is not the greatest and let's face it -- a bunch of kids running around, some still in diapers, etc... I think you get the point. But this place was NOT like that! It was fresh and super clean (thanks Main Event staff! Gold star for you!) 

While the kids were bowling, we sat up at the bar and ordered a Pineapple Mojito (I'm not sure that's officially what it's called, but it was a mojito and had pineapple juice in it). We asked our bartender not to make it too sweet, and she nailed it!!! It was sooooo delish! We also ordered some chicken wings that were amazing (there was too much skin on some of them, I thought, but yummy nonetheless). One thing I'd like to see management bring out with the chicken wings though is the little hand wipe towelettes that usually come with them -- they were a bit messy. Maybe? Perhaps?

Then we played some games with the kids and had pizza (which again was pretty dang good! Not cardboardy or fake-tasting, and baked just right). The prizes the kids can \"win\" with their tickets are cool as well. 

Definitely a fun place to bring the family and/or friends to hang out, especially in the summer when it gets a wee bit too hot out during the day. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Best experience for our family! Came here to escape a storm during our vacation to Phoenix.  Had a blast here with a group of 16, ages ranging from 5-55+!

Mark at the desk was exceptional and gave us a lot of value for our money and was great with all the kids. 
Anthony was our server and he was so attentive and on top of our many, many orders. And very patient. 
Wonderful experience."}
{"text":"When I first walked in I thought this was a really cool place. If our experience had been better I would probably go here often. Courtney at the downstairs bar was great. We went upstairs to bowl and we were asked if we wanted a server and we said yes. Well the server never came so we had to walk back downstairs to get our drinks. As we were walking back up to our lane we were confronted by another server who said to us \"you know you have a server upstairs right\" we said we didn't know that because we hadn't seen her. She said \"she is up there she is just busy\". We never got service upstairs until three hours after we had been there and by that point we had already gotten everything we needed from downstairs. They even closed the upstairs bar at 10pm on a Friday night. Although it wasn't very busy for a Friday night. It was so slow some of the employees were bowling. I really liked the bowling lanes and good price for the fun pass but the staff wasn't great except for Courtney at the bar."}
{"text":"My two younger daughters went to Main Event today with their older sister.  This was supposed to be a fun day for the girls but customer service was not at it's best today.  Our younger daughter stated that she went to ask a staff person a question and the lady rolled her eyes at her for no reason and was giving them attitude. Later the girls went to cash out their tickets and the card reader told them an amount of tickets they had but at the register the reader said something different. They were short 200 tickets. The manager came and they explained that three different readers gave  them different ticket counts but he would not honor their lost tickets. Kids and families go here to have a good time, be treated with respect and for good customer service. If this business can not provide any of these things then they are in the wrong business."}
{"text":"Great alternative to Dave and Busters; however, the service is absolutely horrible! Order your drinks 2 or 3 at a time because it takes them forever before bringing the next round. I've been here on several occasions and every time it takes a good 30-45 mins to get a second round of drinks."}
{"text":"This is a very nice, fun establishment.  It's clean and the food is decent.  Obviously it's expensive fun.  My biggest complaint is that we came here around 1pm on a school day, it wasn't busy at all (my child had fall break).  My child only wanted to do the ropes course.  After 10-15 mins the young kid working the ropes course told everyone their turn was over.  That was rather annoying seeing that nobody else was waiting to get on.  When my child did ask to get back on at least an hour later he obviously was annoyed.  His hanging out time with other young employees had to come to an end.  Management obviously needs to over see the younger staff members to ensure they're doing what they're getting paid to do."}
{"text":"I will premise this by saying we came on Memorial Day, and they've been open about 5 days, so I'm sure there are kinks they will work out and I look forward to updating my review when they do! 

Overall, this place is awesome. We took advantage of a play all day pass, and in about 4 hours my family played 3 games of laser tag (and it's not a cheesy one at all!!), 2 turns on the ropes course (the zip line was a huge hit!) two games of bowling, ate lunch, and one game of pool.  Two kids, 12 and 9, and my husband - no complaints!! There is absolutely zero for toddlers, that's a little bit of a bummer but I wasn't expecting much either when we came, so we sat out and watched. Everything is clean and new, the staff seem well trained and they really hustle, and the food is awesome. WAY above expectations on the food!! The chicken nachos, omg. And the kids meals looked way better than most restaurants while still only being in the $6 range. In general the food was not nearly as expensive as I expected. I love the system of checking in for a time to return to the laser tag and ropes, cuts down the standing in line to nothing! That aside, even on a holiday weekend with a special discount running it never felt crowded and we never had to wait for what we wanted to do. We came just after opening and stayed until a while after lunch. 

The not so good:

1 - they seem to have a lot of technical difficulty with the laser tag, and were constantly running behind. 

2- service in the bowling alley area is very slow, maybe understaffed. It was hard to find someone, and the intercom mostly just gave us a message saying they were busy so we couldn't call our server. Because of this, we barely got drink refills. The glasses seem small, are full of ice, and then when we can't get a refill it's a $3+ bummer. 

3 - it would be helpful if they had staff wandering the arcade area. We had a game malfunction and had to wait in the laser tag line to get a staff member to help."}
{"text":"This review is coming from a father of a 4 year old (and also knowing that this location just recently opened, giving a little understanding for new concepts, and new employees):

We walked through the front doors on a Tuesday, right around dinner time. I was expecting a slower than usual night, being Tuesday, and it was light traffic as expected. (That's what I was hoping for.) We weren't greeted immediately, as we approached the dining area, so I was a little confused on seating policy, but as I looked to see if I could seat myself, we were approached by a polite staffer. We were seated near a window, and had a decent view of most of the entertainment from where we sat.
The waitress was great, the food took quite some time to be prepared it seemed... a nacho & some sliders. I ate the nacho... It was alright... maybe a 6/10, maybe on the bland side of a nacho. My 4 year old ate the sliders, so I can't say much other than she ate both of them, and seemed satisfied/full. That made me happy enough. The wait staff seemed to work well as a team, and we were visited several times to make sure everything was going well.
The bathrooms are new and it wasn't too busy, so clean is expected, and I didn't have any issues there, so score one up for the good!
Right outside of the bathroom to the left is a \"horror\" arcade game... it was a little nerve-inducing to my 4 year old... placement probably could have been better on that one, but I was able to calm my kiddo, so I won't knock it too hard, but that might be something for management to keep in mind.
We made our rounds through the arcade, my daughter's favorite game being the Princess Castle ball toss. She also enjoyed one of the \"virtual ride\" games... it took us on a race through some \"Star-wars-like\" canyons & desert landscape. Much more intense for her, than for myself, but the fans blowing at you like the wind in your face was a neat feeling. Watching my daughters expressions was priceless.
Unfortunately my daughter was too small to enjoy the gravity ropes course. I'm not sure if she would have attempted or not, but I wanted to find out. Must be 4 ft. tall I believe they said.
I saw the entrance to the Laser Tag, I will be partaking in that soon enough, but not on this particular visit.
There seemed to be plenty of bowling lanes, I am excited to get in on that!
The highlight of our night was actually the projection games (free) that they had near the middle of the building. My kid could play there until she fell asleep running! She had a blast & I can't wait to take her back!

Update:
I originally gave this place 5 stars, but have decided to reduce that fat stack I gave them. Two reasons...
1. I wasn't here for it, but I had an understanding friend come in on my recommendation, and made my original 5 star review look foolish. He took his girlfriend bowling for $36/hr + shoe fee. He said it wasn't overly busy, but that he couldn't get his waitress to even come to their lane (they serve food directly to the lanes). She approached the table next to them several times, keeping my friends on the back-burner, not even bringing them water to drink, not even asking them if they wanted drinks. So, for $36 per hour, you can't even get decent service... Heck, I wish I got paid half of $36 per hour for half-a$$ work, that is waaaaaay overpriced. By the time they were able to talk to their server they were 30 minutes in. They finally were able to order, asked for water to drink, and appetizers (they were going to get meals, but with only 30 minutes left to bowl, why do that). By the time they finally got their food, they were done bowling, and still didn't even get the waters they had asked for.
They told me they will never go back... I'm trying to convince them otherwise, because it's a convenient location for us to all hang out in. (I forgot to mention, the server explained that they were short-staffed, but when you're making several stops to the lane next to them, and paying no attention to your other tables, you're just not very good at your job.) Also, good business practice would be offering some sort of discount off your bill for crappy service... this was not offered.

2. I went there on 3/24/16 with my daughter, and her mother, it was not busy. Drinks took 30+ minutes to get to the table, and burger and fries an additional 15 minutes (45 total for those who are math-impaired) after ordering. Again... good business practice would be offering some sort of discount off your bill for your crappy service, especially when prices are so high... this was not offered.

After my first visit, in which service was not so grand... I had chalked it up to new people, getting settled in to new jobs, new positions, trying to figure out the \"lay of the land\". I still gave a 5 star review... Weeks later, I actually feel that the service is now even worse than it was before. Here's the deal... when you open a place like this, you SWEETEN up the customers, they will return. OUTOFSPACE"}
{"text":"first time here today with the kiddos (3 of them ages 12, 10 and 5)  we got there before 10:30am to get the unlimited bowling, laser tag, and ropes which was a good deal $12.95 plus shoe rental. Not bad at all you get to stay until 5pm and gets the kids out of the house.  The place wasnt packed but for a Tuesday there was a lot of people here.  We switched off bowled a game then did the ropes, and then a few games of laser tag and then back to bowling overall it was a fun day.  Being our first time here i had a lot of questions for staff everyone was very helpful and nice.  We didnt eat here we only bought fountain drinks and then left to peter piper pizza across the street to eat for an hour to meet some family members so i cannot comment on how the food tastes but the establishment was very clean and i glanced at other families food who did order there and it looked good.  This place is fun for kids and parents the games are pricey but thats everywhere."}
{"text":"Came here with my 3 friends to bowl and eat.
We sat down to eat while we waited for our lane what he was about 30 minutes.
We wanted to get food before we played.
The waitress was slow as hell and she failed to ask ME for my order while asking everyone else.
It took her 25 min to come back with my friends 2 drinks.
The buzzer went off for the lane in 30 min. 
She then took another 20 to bring us our app. That my friend ordered.
The service we got was shitty as hell. 
Myra was her name I think."}
{"text":"I was so excited to go to main event with my boyfriend! We got there and played some games (overpriced) but decided to go eat. We sat in a booth for at least 10 minutes before the waitress came to say \"I will be right with you\". Then another 10-15 minutes later, still no sign of the waitress or anyone to even take a drink order. Extremely frustrated, we went to talk to the manager to let her know what happened and that we didn't even want to wait any longer to eat and were leaving. All she said was \"okay I will check what happened\" and that was it. No apology, no offers to help make the experience better, nothing. I will not be going here again."}
{"text":"The customer service was not the best, We bowled for 2 hours and not one time did a server come over and ask us if we needed anything.  The laser tag person didn't explain anything didn't help put on vests All he did was open the doors and tell us to go in we had no idea what we were doing, so it wasn that much fun. The ropes course could use more help and an explanation of what it's like up there."}
{"text":"My hubby took me here for one of our date days...but the only reason why we were able to go was because of the deal they are having for May and June.  For $20 you can get a bracelet worth $40 in game play or you get can get unlimited play for the laser tag/bowling/sky rope course/pool...but only during the 4-hour slot from either 11-4 or 5-9.  We had thought it was unlimited every thing.  Meh.  We decided to get the video games bracelet because we didn't want to just play bowling, pool, and laser tag when we could have done that elsewhere for cheaper.  

They do have a fun variety of games...the best being those that are app games like a huge Fruit Ninja and Temple Run.  It's too bad the freaky 3-D zombie game only had one set of 3-D glasses...because it could have been much scarier.  Main Event also has the typical games you could find at Dave and Busters, so we played several of those as well.  

We didn't have any of their food or drinks.  But this is a new facility that is pretty clean...for now.  I would have preferred just going to D&B because of the no kids allowed after a certain hour.  It was a bit of a pain to try to and wait for certain games and have kids cut in front of you.  

I doubt we will be going back since outside of the deal we got it's pretty dang expensive."}
{"text":"I was really surprise at how fun and cool this place turned out to be. Spacious and open, you don't feel like you're tripping over the little peanuts.There's plenty to keep the kids entertained from the interactive games to the mesmerizing moving floor. With a very well stocked bar, there's pool and bowling to keep you from going stir crazy. Food was surprisingly good and moderately priced. The bowling was definitely my fave part because of the animated cartoons in between each player. Pure utter entertainment. Love seeing your personalized selfies become animated clips of \"cheer squad.\" If I wasn't in my sundress, I would recommend strapping on the harness and doing the obstacle course so you get a bird's eye view of everyone below. Definitely coming back as a group outing or family get together; on side note, perfect for teambuilding event too."}
{"text":"My two kids and I came here last weekend just for a night out. Off the bat let me say it's not cost effective at all hence the 3 star review. The place was clean, and the food was pretty good. Service was great and overall cleanliness was pretty on point. The arcades is the reason we chose this place for a Saturday afternoon time. There aren't a whole lot of games, but that being said most of the newer games were there. Average price for the arcade games was about $1.65 per play! Like yikes! We easily spent a hundred dollars in about an hour's time. Games like JP and terminator the shorter thing which you find at most theaters was about that price. Didn't get a chance to try out the bowling and laser tag since the lines were too long and we didn't have the patience that day lol. Overall think of it like a fancy chunky cheeses with a limited menu Applebees. Didn't buy any alcohol since I was with my two kiddos, but it seems like it wasn't cost friendly either as most were walking around with beers, including the ladies which is a clue for me. Unless you're ready to spend a couple hundred dlls on a two or three hour's time including food then be warned.  Will we come back? Most likely not since we're big gamers and this place will stomp your wallet on it."}
{"text":"Good concept, almost like uptown alley , except service was absolutely horrible , the worst , Rachael from the Front desk was rude , I've never had such horrible customer service in my life , never have met anyone as rude as Rachael . It was only 11pm and they just closed out our tabs even though we weren't done ordering , we had just started a new bowling game . Only good thing about this place was the pizza other than that , hopefully management is reading this , get it together on the customer service . Definitely will not be returning .

Update review 3/10/16

Unfortunately came again , because I had family come from out of state and really wanted to try it out after I advised not to , same issues with horrible service . Ordered drinks as soon as we got to our lane , few mins Ordered their amazing pizza , didn't see our server for a while , pizza came out , still no drinks . Service really slacks here , all around , from checking in at the front desk , getting shoes for bowling , lane service to laser tag , to redeeming prizes , just bad bad bad ."}
{"text":"Very fun atmosphere! Bowling, pool and shuffle board tables, two full service bars, laser tag, awesome arcade and lots of tables. Best option is to buy a pass for the day and take your time having fun! Very clean and up to date with games and technology. The employees were very friendly and helpful. 


It was a bit pricey, but worth it for the family fun! 
There was a two hour wait time for our group to bowl, but the left us plenty of time to enjoy the other activities. They'll give you a buzzer that alerts you when it's your turn. 
One hour for each bowling session and I believe fifteen minutes for a pool table session and fifteen minutes per laser tag game. All included with the day pass! Arcade is always pay as you go with a reloadable card or credit/debit card. Arcade games cost between $1.00 to about $3.00 depending on the game."}
{"text":"The building itself is nice, new, and clean.  The food is only ok- but everything is so expensive!  I brought 5 girls- bought the \"unlimited pass\" for $20 but you have to reserve a time slot for laser tag which wasn't for 2 hours after we arrived!  The bowling is include but again you have to reserve it and pay an additional charge for shoes!  I gave each girl a $25 game card that they blew thru is 15 minutes!  Way over priced and the girls weren't even that impressed!  What a disappointment. We won't be coming back."}
{"text":"First time visit. Here on a Sunday afternoon. Grossly understaffed. No one at door to greet or seat us. Took 20 minutes to get drinks. Appetizer wings came with our meal instead of ahead of it and were small and undercooked. Burger was average. Food took over 30 minutes. Took 20 minutes for a refill of pop and the waitress said it was because they ran out of glasses. Will not be back to eat. After the meal we blew through 40 bucks in 30 minutes on overpriced and ridiculously short video games. There are games that cost 1.65 and my daughter literally got to push one button once and then it was over. Cheapest game I saw was 1.50 per play and nothing lasted over 60-90 secs. Had a lot of hope when we walked in but we left this place feeling frustrated and ripped off."}
{"text":"Not well lit and if you get hurt by their equipment they will not take responsibility.  It was dark in one area of their gaming room and my mother tripped over one of their arcade games.  She unfortunately fell and broke her arm and had a badly bloody nose.  When we went to get a manager they only offered a  paper towel.....they didnt even seem concerned at all.  We took her to the hospital and her arm was broken from the fall.  Main Event took absolutely no responsibility and will not help with any of her medical bills at all."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible! We ordered some food off the menu and the food came BURNT. So we send it back and this time the food was undercooked! So we called over a manager. Him solving the situation was asking,\"so what do you want?\" He was just RUDE. Never going back!"}
{"text":"Visited this place the first few months when it had its grand opening. It was super clean and well taken care of. But it has seemed to decline in customer service and cleanliness. Went bowling around noon and it wasn't busy maybe only four other groups on the lanes. Right away, we noticed the lanes were super dirty with what appeared to be dried food stains and food crumbs near ball area. That was a major problem seeing as we have our own bowling shoes. We ended up having to wipe the floor ourselves. That grease and food on floor doesn't help keep the life of our shoes. Looks like they don't sweep or mop that area and the booths are no different. Sticky and dirty tables. Only sat in one little area that we had to wipe with one of our many disinfectant wipes we used during our visit. Because we had no customer service for about 30 minutes. As our time on the lane had already started we couldn't wait for anyone to show up. Went there to enjoy ourselves but ended up having to hunt down a server to help us. Management needs to step up and do its job. Or just hire better employees and train them better. With how much we spent there it could've gone so much better. I mean that's what we're paying for right? New equipment, updated video games, and at the very least, a clean atmosphere. I hope they address these problems. We just got invited by friends to go back there. Great! So I will update on how this next visit goes."}
{"text":"This is a fun place. The girls that covered our party were wonderful...BUT almost 700.00 for a child's party!!! NOT worth that:  Ridiculous. It was actually well over 700 because we added a tip for the girls even though the tab had a 75.00 tip for them already.
UPDATE: I received a message that the district manager would contact me. Well he/she didn't. My vote stands this venue wasn't worth $700 for a birthday party. The time allotment for bowling didn't let us finish one game. There was no organization to get the kids on the ropes or in the laser tag at one time or at all. Totally not worth $700."}
{"text":"We went on a Saturday night. 2 adults and 5 kids and this was definitely a teenager hangout spot. Not family friendly. 1 hour wait for a lane. The absolute smallest lane I've ever seen. No space to move or sit comfortably. Was told a waitress would come to our table, never happened and when I asked for service, it never came. Was a complete waste of money and time. D&B next time for us. Will not return to this apot, I'll leave this place for the teenagers. This was definitely not intended for families, to much going on, arcade to close to the front doors, bowling lanes/seating was way to small. Should of put more thought into the set up. Oh well."}
{"text":"This place was terrible. I will never return, and I will advise all of my friends never to attend. Unless a manager sees this and refunds my $100 bowling costs.

1- I ordered a Stella Artois at the bar. This is the only beer I drink. The manager pulled the tap for the Stella and handed me the beer. It was definitely a Sam Adams Seasonal Lager. I had other people taste it at my table, and they agreed it could not have been Stella. When I brought it back to the bar to say it's not Stella, she looked at me like I was crazy, poured a new one from the tap and said, \"They're the same color, it's from the right tap.\" My argument was that their tap must be incorrectly hooked up to the wrong beer... Again, \"you're crazy\" look from manager. This was my first beer of the night-- I wasn't some wasted freeloader trying to work them over. They were genuinely serving the wrong beer.

2. I then asked for a Stella bottle because I wouldn't drink the Sam Adams they were passing off as Stella. They were out of Stella bottles.

3. Earlier that day, I had booked a 7pm time slot for 2 bowling lanes. When we arrived, they placed my party of 6 at non-facing seats. My party was completely separated from each other by a physical barrier instead of being allowed to face each other. Also, 15 minutes of our one-hour time slot was taken by fixing their broken bumpers from blocking the gutters.

4. I am a vegetarian. I asked if I could order their loaded fries without bacon. The waitress assured me it would be treated as if it was a religious preference against pork. When it arrived, no bacon was apparent, but as I ate it and looked under a few tots, there were several bacon pieces hidden underneath. #secretmeated

5. When I asked to see a manager immediately after ingesting and finding more bacon in my food, he comped the tater tots and offered $50 game cards. My friends and I expressed that we wanted to leave and would not be returning. This is when he should have refunded our entire bowling experience to save any chance of me returning. Game tokens are not getting me there."}
{"text":"Pizza - Average at best, went with a party and finished four pieces of pizza before I got a drink. They took the drink order first, placed the pizzas on the table, and returned with drinks 15 minutes later. Seemed pretty bizarre to me. They had tons of staff standing around the soda fountain staring at us doing nothing. It was just really strange. We asked for a pitcher of ice water for the table, they stated they didn't have pitchers. I carried in a water bottle so I lucked out I guess. 

Pro Tip: *Bring your own drink, while waiting for your drink, so you can eat your pizza that is getting cold.

The arcade games - Cost a crazy amount: $1.10 - $4.50+ 

Pro Tip: *Bring a few hundred dollars to play the arcade games.

Pool Tables: All booked up

Pro Tip: *Bring your own pool table

Bowling: The saving grace of this place. Tons of shoes, bowling balls, lanes, everything was great. 

Pro Tip: *If you don't like to bowl go somewhere else.

Well that about sums up this place. Better start lifting weights, that pool table is going to be heavy to carry in. Enjoy."}
{"text":"Cool idea but service is really really poor. Wait staff is rude and it is terribly overpriced. :( what a bummer"}
{"text":"My sons 10th birthday was a blast. Kids and adults had a fabulous time at Main Event. Big shout out to our party host Alyah. You did a phenomenal job of ensuring everything went as planned and with so much ease. Thank you. Thank you."}
{"text":"I love taking my family here. We can really unwind & not worry about much. The staff are always mindful to ask if we want drinks, food, how everything is. The staff is wonderful with children! 

2 floors of bowling provides, an almost, guarantee that lanes will be open, if you don't have a reservation. 

The menu options are great for those who have dietary restrictions. Though, the kids menu could be more extensive."}
{"text":"Kids had fun with laser tag. Paid $122 for unlimited for 6 of us. They shut off bowling mid game and told us we only had an hour of bowling. So we didn't want to pay for more time. We questioned the front desk on time limit and she said they shouldn't have done that. She got a manager to give us a partial refund. He said he'd have to take my wrist band (but since we weren't done our time doing other things) I suggested a discount on gaming cards. The manager said corporate wouldn't allow him to give us free stuff for no reason. Apparently there was no reason for what happened to us. Then he said he was confused as to what I wanted. I spent $70 in food also. You would've thought they'd make it right. Not ok to take advantage of families."}
{"text":"This place is beautiful, as flashy as it could ever be and expensive as heck. I think it's going to be great for adults who want to let loose with bowling and pool, great for parties, but not the best for families with young kids.

The reason I say that is because it's simply too pricey. I went there tonight with my husband and son. We wanted to bowl for an hour, and it was $34 for an hour. What? Fifty cents per minute of bowling? I was hoping we could get the early-bird rate of $22 per hour, but was told that that pricing ended at 5 p.m. I checked my cell phone as I was being told this, and it was 5:03. OK, so this is going to be THAT kind of place.

So we got our game, and with shoe rental and tax it ended up about $44 for an hour. Bowling is very high-tech, with the ability to choose different types of games and even different ways to decorate your screen.

The food is fairly reasonable. We had a child's chicken finger meal, a margarita flatbread, chicken wings and three Coronas and the total was $50. The chicken wings were so soggy that my husband sent them back (the first time I've seen him do this in 11 years of marriage). They graciously made new wings for him. They still charged us for it, but that's fine, I have no problem with that.

So we left after less than two hours having shelled out more than $100 (with tip). Yikes.

We didn't play any video games, but the ones I saw were about $1.10 or more per play. Your kids will go through the cash pretty quickly at that rate.

The service is absolutely impeccable. The wait staff is a constant presence at the bowling area and was there to help with anything and everything. The food was served on nice plateware, and the paper napkins were black. They brought out lemon slices in a small bowl with our ice water -- a very nice touch.

Pros: Very high tech, good-looking, clean and well run. Lots of friendly employees. Food and drinks are reasonable. 

Cons: Bowling and video games are extremely expensive. I just can't pay $44 for an hour of bowling for a family of three."}
{"text":"Came here last night for my boyfriend's birthday and we had a blast. It was our first time at main event and we've been to the Westgate Dave and Busters several times and now we know where we will be returning! Our bartenders were Robert & Jenna and they were awesome! I love seeing people who ENJOY their jobs. The drinks were on point and my boyfriend ordered some classic chicken tenders and fries but they were really good! Better food than Dave and Busters will ever be capable of serving lol. We bowled and then played pool, didn't have time to try the gravity ropes but will next time. This might be odd to add but the place smelt really good too. The entrance smelt like a nice hotel! The bathrooms were clean!
The only downfall of our experience was the front desk. There was an employee who looked like he'd rather shoot himself in the leg then help customers. Whenever I was talking to him he was looking at me like I was an idiot then would answer me super short and condescending. I would state his name but I like to give people some slack because I know that everyone has bad nights... I had to deal with him when buying games and picking up bowling shoes.. Anyways awesome night I'm very pleased! Thank you Robert and Jenna for taking care of us you guys are awesome!"}
{"text":"Our family of 16 had a great time here last night. My
Only negative would be the price of the games. Everything else was so fun. Our server, Anthony, went above and beyond for us. He was awesome"}
{"text":"We were here for my daughter's birthday. We normally do something fun, and active. Since none of us have really been here before, we figured we would give it a try.

For a Friday Night, this place wasn't as packed as we had expected. It appears that the allure and the newness of the place seemed to have worn off. We were able to find parking right by the front entrance right away.

Once inside, we opted to have dinner first, and had to wait for quite some time for someone to acknowledge that we needed menus and our drink orders. Not a good sign, since this place wasn't even that busy.

The waitress was nice enough, but her manner was too dismissive and inattentive for our taste. When she did finally take our food order, she took off and didn't ask us what we wanted to drink. After a few minutes, she came back and finally realized that she didn't take our drink order. 

Unbelievable!

The food became an issue as we had ordered pizza and wings. And the pizza tasted like frozen pizza that was heated in an oven, the wings had too much batter, and not enough sauce on them. Food quality doesn't seem to be a priority here. At least from what we tasted as far as the lack of care and thought put into its preparation. Perhaps, we caught them on an off day. However, I was already making mental notes of why I would never come back here.

They did have a good amount of video games and skill games that we enjoyed, in spite of the dreadful food experience. And we did get a chance to do some bowling. However, we did not get a chance to play laser tag because, at that time, the line was just too long.

All in all, as long as you can ignore the poor service and bad food, it isn't a bad place to hang out and have fun. However, there are other places that offer superlative service, food, and fun - the whole package, without the negatives."}
{"text":"Personally I love going to main event especially on mondays. For 10$ you get all you can play bowling, gravity, laser tag and billiards or the all you can play game card. I would have given it 5 stars if we didn't have to wait for some things and if the shoe rental was included. We also tried the food and it was alright. Typical food you would find at an entertainment venue. So if you want to have fun for cheap go to main event."}
{"text":"Clean fun place for both kids and adults alike. We did the unlimited wristband for bowling, laser tag, Gravity ropes and billiards and got about 3 hours of fun with my 1.5 and 4.5 year old. Obviously there was a lot there that was too big for them but they both loved bowling and my 4.5 year old was allowed to do laser tag (she was a little shorter than the height requirement). She LOVED it. Food was good. Service was nice. Went on a Sunday so wasn't super crowded but it was Father's Day so not sure how a regular Sunday during summer would go (evening). They have a floor game for the kids that kept them entertained for almost the whole time we were there. We would def go back."}
{"text":"Clean, modern bowling lanes. Bumper lanes and even a thing that looks like a plastic bowling ball slide for toddlers. Laser tag was a blast. Great place to spend a couple hours  took grandsons, 7 and 5 and there was plenty to do. 4' tall and over for laser tag.   Reasonably priced packages--get there early for cheaper prices and less people. Will go back again and again."}
{"text":"This time at main event was so much better then my last experience.  I am hoping next time will be the same and I can move my stars up.  
I like enjoying a meal while we bowl and relax.  But an hour is very short.  We got the wristbands which was nice but my issue is that you still only get an hour and then you get put back on the wait list.  Tonight our server was awesome and asked the manager if we could have another hour because we just got our food.  Because the wait wasn't long they said okay.  Thank you for that.  I just feel that we were spending money by ordering drinks and food that if we are still bowling it should be okay to stay. Two hours to bowl seems more then enough time so I think they should change it and if they do I will move my stars to 5.  
We also did laser tag and the rope climbing thing and that was lots of fun.  So overall we still felt like we got our money's worth for buying the wristbands. It was a nice family fun day for us."}
{"text":"There is a God!! We are here every Wednesday for a bowling league and always have close to nonexistent service. Tonight, out server is a darling old man who is just so freaking awesome!!

Food is still very meh."}
{"text":"Service was slow, beers and dip were good. Our pizza came out very burnt on the outside, not cooked on the inside, toppings in piles, and cut by a child. Asked for a remake, which came out much better...after a long wait. Still got charged for it. We'll go next door next time..at least they make up for their mistakes/inconveniences."}
{"text":"This was the worst place ever went to eat and play had to seat ourselves wipe out own table and flag someone down to take our order after sitting for 10 min with not one person trying to get us a drink order or anything the worst customer service ever!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This is a large entertainment center near the Robinson Mall for the whole family.

They have a restaurant, bar, bowling alleys,  laser tag, video game center, outdoor patio, and private rooms.

The entertainment is good and it's nicer than the other entertainment center that was here before. The food looks good but is just OK.

A fun place to hang out!"}
{"text":"Had a birthday party there for my little one , wow it wasn't busy like usual, usually waiting list to bowl when we tried to bowl there before.., we got lucky , quiter, open lanes, nice party. Booked online. Only thing is customer service at purchase area needs to be worked on. No smiling faces,or thank you's. Customer service should be about the customer, in front and in prize area room. Happy place for kids workers should be happy to be there too."}
{"text":"Main Event is a blast. Pricey, but a blast. 

Main Event is a Dave and Busters style entertainment complex principally featuring bowling, laser tag, a rope climbing course, and arcade games. The place is rather high end, but not excessively so- theres table side service at the bowling alley, but not to the extent seen at posher places (a welcome relief, multiple course meals need not be at a bowling alley).  Thankfully, everything is super clean. 

The price of entry here can be on a per-game or unlimited pass basis. The former is about $6/person for laser tag or ropes and $26/hour for bowling or something like $40+ per person for unlimited. In other words, you can easily make things cheaper with the unlimited pass, if you have the stamina. 

The food here is good for bowling alley food. I would not want anything simpler or more complex. I tried the garlic fries, which were slathered in butter. Normally, that would be a problem... but they were delicious.  There is also lots of alcohol available, though I wouldn't recommend drinking it in conjunction with some of the more energetic games (e.g. laser tag). 

The laser tag here is manic and fun. I couldn't help but shake the idea that some people were way into it and played it way too much, but that added to it. It was fun to get my butt kicked! Note, however, that the place had major stank - some people had overwhelming BO. 

Bowling was great. The lanes were excellent, the machines fast and fun, and the software on the scoreboard was entertaining (you can take pictures and get statistics!). 

The arcade games are good but could be better. No DDR, but Pump it Up was present. Lots of ticket games, which are kinda lame. The driving games were a blast. All machines are retrofitted with credit card like readers, which might have been done to add price - a single driving game was $1.75(!)

All in all, this place was an expensive blast."}
{"text":"This is your one stop shop for fun! They have everything from bowling to a ropes course to laser tag all with a full bar for adults! Me and my friends went on a Saturday night and only had to wait about 20 minutes for our bowling lane ($36 an hour). Each group is given a server and the food is worth purchasing- I'd recommend the meat pizza! We also played one round of laser tag ($8 per person) and a few arcade games. It's a great place for a party or a night out with friends. I had to deduct a star though for our server. She definitely didn't want to be there and it showed."}
{"text":"This place is only for kids or families who are not going to order food or drinks. This the second time I come here with my family bowling and we can never get a waitress over to us, even after calling front desk for a waitress several times. Worst service ever! Even Brunswick bears them in service."}
{"text":"Took my 14 year old daughter and several of her friends (both boys and girls) for her birthday.  We bought a birthday package that included and hour of bowling, a game of laser tag and a $10 game card.  It also included a personal meal for each person (pizza, chicken fingers or sliders and a drink)  We also ended up adding on an extra game of laser tag for everyone and the rope course.  The extra game of laser tag and the rope course were $8 each per person.  

We were met at the door by our party coordinator, Dana, who was as nice and helpful as could be.  She took the kids shoe sizes and food orders, took them to get bowling shoes and then took them to the lanes.   They ate while they bowled.  They were then taken over to the laser tag and I think this was their favorite activity.  There are two levels, lots of places to hide and a couple different game modes to choose from.  They then went to the rope course which was challenging but doable.  Dana then took the kids back to a table for cake - they provide the plates, napkins, serving utensils and candles.   The kids were then let loose to play in the arcade.  

My impressions:  The place is very loud and pretty large.  Our party started at 4pm which was perfect.  By the time the party was over at 6:30, it was starting to get very busy with lots of older teens and young adults.  The kids said the food was good - not spectacular but, good.  The party package was reasonable and it was nice to have a party planner with us.  My only issue is that they have a 10 person minimum.  That means 5 people per lane of bowling.  You don't get much bowling in with that number of people.  Also, as kids get older, their circle of friends gets smaller so I think a better minimum would be 8.  We actually had 2 people cancel at the last minute and we still had to pay for 10 regardless.  I think 8 people would be much more reasonable.  

Both the boys and the girls said they had an absolute blast.  I think this is a place were young kids, teens and adults would have a great time.  But, I also think our experience was made better by have a planned party with everything organized so there was no waiting - everything was already scheduled which definitely helped."}
{"text":"Very clean facility. Bowling ally was top shelf. Food was decent and the bar was great. I don't love to play video games but I could not drag myself away from then here. Not one \"out of order sign\" in sight. Will defiantly go back."}
{"text":"Came here To spend Christmas Day with family and friends. Pretty good time.It sure beats sitting around the house and watching everybody sleep in the recliner's. 2 Hours bowling, 5 shoe rentals, $68 Including tax. I thought that was a good value. We end up staying 6 hours. We will definitely come back to this location."}
{"text":"Went here for a work Christmas party. This place is insane. Everything you could ever want. I was so surprised when I walked in and saw the place. Talk about WOW factor. I would normally never go to a place like this. I'm not a big \"entertainment center\" type person. This place it's definitely a place I would go back to."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I only gave main event 2 stars because I had a lot of fun doing the events and they had good food. But the employees were very rude and didn't look anyone in the Eyes. We had a big party and we orders about 10 waters and 5 sodas and they took 45 minutes just to bring it to us. The ladies didn't help us in any way and we waited 10 minutes just to do an activity that needed there assistance"}
{"text":"Our kids (ages 11, 4, and 2) had a lot of fun here playing the archade games. But..... it's way too crowded - 3 hour wait for anything other than the archade games. The food was terrible. The games are way overpriced."}
{"text":"I hosted my company's holiday party here. I booked on a flash sale. The events team was awesome to work with and accommodated all our needs. Thank you Ashley! We had unlimited billiards, laser tag, bowling. Every employee got 2 drink tickets and $10 to the arcade. In addition, we had a BBQ style buffet. The price was within my budget so I would highly recommend having any occasion party here since there is so much to do!"}
{"text":"All in all, i have to say this is a fun little place.  The menu was divers, the food quite good, and the entertainment abundant. The pricing was great with food and game card combinations.  Really an enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"Get the unlimited pass it is a great deal and it will save you money. This is great for the pre-teens. Adults can have fun too but mostly for the kids. Good idea so much under one roof. Big place."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place. Facility is very nice.  We bought New Years Eve package included everything but arcade.  We had a good time, however, we bowled for over an hour and not one waitress checked on us. I'm very disappointed in the service."}
{"text":"Prices are so high, food is so bad, service is horrible, and this place is so loud."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! There's so much to do! We went during the wrong time of year though. Unfortunately, even at noon on a Friday the place is packed with holiday parties so there's no available pool tables or bowling lanes. I'm sure it will be a blast after the new year. This is basically a shiny new version of Dave and Busters."}
{"text":"Main Event MANAGEMENT please respond. Why is there a tip line on the receipt that I signed when I purchased arm bands for 5 people and 50.00 in tickets for the arcade? What am I supposed to be tipping for???....I'm buying tickets and arcade time. Just seemed greedy to me. Would have given 4 stars otherwise. And please by saying \"you don't have to tip\", it just makes it worse. Puts a customer on the spot to hand back a receipt to the cashier with a line drawn thru the tip part of receipt. I totally get tipping the server that came to our table tho, just not when buying an armband and/or arcade time.  If i ever come back i will bring cash to avoid the awkwardness. Will tell my friends the same thing. Please get rid of the tipping at the cashier box. It's tacky. We spent 250.00 that night, for arm bands, arcade time and food, and drinks. (oh, and the awkward tip at the cashier box also)."}
{"text":"How I feel about this place: Ehhhhhhhhh....... Yea.

I've been here twice now. The first time we checked out everything other than laser tag. We bowled which I enjoyed, played games, and even went on the tall ropes thing above the games (I got off right away because it was scary lol). This place is pretty nice, its huge and even though its super packed you can't tell much because of the space. 
What I have noticed is it's pretty much a rip off. You expect the games to have similar pricing to somewhere like Peter Piper. No, they're way overpriced. Most games are over $1 to play just once.... and it's not like the toys you have to choose from with your tickets are anything great. 
The bowling is nice, the seating in the areas are great and you can even take photos to put up on the screen when all the funny little clips come on while bowling. The only thing that sucks about the bowling is it seems that the time starts the second your buzzer goes off. So you have to find your lane, get shoes and find a ball all while your time is ticking away, so that seems pretty unfair. Not to mention the wait is really long! Like an hour + long. If you want to play multiple times and get your money's worth I would suggest someone in your group sign up for another buzzer right when your first buzzer goes off so by the time you end bowling you're closer to being able to start again. 

From what we tried food/drink wise everything seems really good! This time I ordered some of their mixed drinks and was surprised I liked every drink I ordered. It does seem like they need more servers in the eating areas. I ordered fries and a drink before my friends who ordered full on meals. All their meals came out quick and tasted great. However, it took close to 40 minutes just to get a drink and fries. I'm not someone who complains at all because I can understand how hard it must be to serve so many people and know customers can be over needy. My friend's mom ended up noticing and asked two different people why I did not have my order. I felt bad for our server because she seemed overwhelmed but her service was great. 

I will probably go back if invited. But this is not somewhere I would choose personally to host a party. I wouldn't suggest it for children either, definitely geared toward adults."}
{"text":"Games are extremely overpriced. Watch out for the \"tip\" line. My kids were doing the gravity ropes so I thought maybe it was the man suiting them up? I asked the teen behind the register and she giggled and said \"nope me.\" Nothing was done to warrant a tip. Nothing.Very disappointed that there was even a tip line on the receipt to begin with."}
{"text":"This place is pretty awesome. I almost think I like it better than Dave and Busters, but I haven't decided yet. I went this past Saturday with my boyfriend, his parents, his sister and her boyfriend, and our two friends. It was free to get in, just like at D&B. But then you have to pay for games and stuff. We started with a $35 card. The games are all a lot like D&B games. They also have bowling, laser tag, a pizza/gelato area and a pool table area. I had a lot of fun. We played this one game where you have to touch all the lights when a bubble thing would like up and get as many as you can compared to your opponent. We played that numerous times. And of course air hockey which is one of my favorite games. We played one round of laser tag which was a ton of fun!! We were gonna bowl but it was $36 an hour. I think that was per group but still.. The bar is in between the pool area and the pizza/gelato area. After laser tag we sat down and I got a gelato to split with my boyfriend. Let me just make a shout out to a girl named Hanna there.. She works in the gelato/pizza station and she was super friendly and helpful. I hope she gets recognized for that. Definitely found one of my favorite gelato flavors because of her. It was the salted caramel. I wanted to sample a couple different flavors and she was super nice about it and friendly. So definitely talk to her. And to end the night my boyfriend and our two friends played a game of pool. We lost both times against them haha. But overall I had a fun night at this place. Everyone should check this place out."}
{"text":"I thought this place was great.  
The people working here were very nice and helpful, the place seemed very clean, and it was large without being overwhelmingly large.
Will return!"}
{"text":"This place was cool!  

The bummer is I got a skin infection from the laser tag.  I will say right now, I doubt i'll go back, and i'm probably only one of a few.  It still had to be said though, my trip to the ER wasn't worth being quiet about."}
{"text":"The manager, Joel, is rude and clearly sick of complaints. He looked overwhelmed when I went to complain about his incompetent staff. Our waiter got our order wrong, we had to ask for plates, napkins, forks, and even sugar and cream for our coffee. The laser tag employees were inconsiderate of us waiting our turn to play and allowed the prior team to walk right back in. I'd rather drive to the Tempe location because it isn't a huge joke like the staff at the Avondale location. Even the girl at the prizes was rude to me after I asked to speak to a manager. She was rude to my son and I while we checked out for prizes. I knew we should have gone to Dave and Busters."}
{"text":"Having fun up until they evacuated us. Not sure what happened but this is not very cool  we were evacuated and they gave is a raincheck. Came back and had some fun. Bowling lanes have animations that are cool. Food was fine. Kids had fun."}
{"text":"We went here last night for my friends birthday and I can't speak for everyone but for myself, the service was pretty terrible. After waiting for 2 hours, we were finally paged that a lane was ready. Upon getting to the shoe counter, I was rudely told by the 18 year old female clerk that only 6 out of the 8 could play. After several confused questions as to why that was, I was informed that \"those were their rules\" with no explanation or empathy given. 

My friend - who's birthday it was, decided he would not play. Being that I found that pretty ridiculous, I requested to speak with the manager. After seeing the size of the booth and the screen, I found out for myself that there simply was not enough room/screen space. I told the manager I finally understood that, but that the employee could've been friendly and explained that to me as I was very confused. The manager didn't appear to express much empathy as well, only providing me with excuses for his employee and a game card. Unfortunately, I had to repeat to him that 2 of us could not bowl and were going to leave, and that the game cards were useless. 

Long story short, if you want to stand around for 2 hours among a crowded building full of obnoxious kids, expensive prices, blaring music, and workers that have no idea what customer service means, then this is the place for you. 

That being said, I did go to the Tempe location with a much smaller group on a Thursday night on a different occasion, and there was no wait or much interaction needed with staff."}
{"text":"My son and I had an amazing time while we were there. However I will say it is very expensive. Definitely not the place to go if you are on a budget. However if you want to splurge every now and then I highly recommend this place. Be sure to keep an ion your children it gets packed pretty fast. It also has an amazing bar. The food is not to be desired. I'd personal eat somewhere else And only go here for activities."}
{"text":"The two star reviews were very accurate for this place. It was our first time here and we had no clue how things worked. We went to the desk and the girl seemed annoyed that we had questions and just played with her Rubix cube with out looking up at us. We asked about the rope course and she said there was a two hour wait on it and bowling and laser tag. Ok it's Saturday evening and places get busy but the rope course was empty and the guy was standing around. The place was dirty with trash all over the floors. And there was one police officer posted up at the door and four more standing outside. Kinda makes you think this place is not so family friendly."}
{"text":"This place is awesome it's 2 floors bowling on each level, billiards, restaurant, bar, and games on the first level.  On the second level party rooms, laser tag, another bar, patio, and of course more bowling lanes.  You can eat and play for & $17.95 or $24.95, but if you don't want to play games it's great for just having a drink and watching the game on the big screen with two bars on each level.  The staff was great I even got a tour of the place and after 4 on Mondays they have unlimited play packages at great rates which I believe includes laser tag, bowling, and billiards."}
{"text":"Went here for a Christmas party for work and the food was horrible!!!  They had a taco bar but no tortillas or shells half the time,  the slider burger patties were cold and looked like cat food,   the pretzels were hard as a rock,  the fried chicken bites tasted like frozen badder and when the brought out more meat for the tacos the guy working there couldn't even tell us if it was beef or pork!  After leaving this event we had to go home and make dinner,  very disappointed in the food,  won't be returning here again."}
{"text":"Great place to bring your kids. It can be expensive, so be sure to get an all day pass. Main Event is similar to Dave & Busters, but substantially better. It offers bowling, laser tag, arcade area, billiards, obstacle course, restaurant and bar area.

The bowling is excellent, very well lit, offers automatic gutter barriers for kids, table service for food/drinks, and more. The arcade area features two very large classic arcade games, has to be at least 10 feet high, for PacMan/Galaga and Space Invaders. Laser tag and obstacle course also very well done. 

The restaurant and bar area also works well for adults waiting for their kids to run out of energy, or money.

Overall a great place for family entertainment."}
{"text":"Great place, wonderful service. Pizza was good and facility is new and clean. The kids had a great time at the birthday party we attended. Our server was totally on top of everything .. So helpful! 
The few cons I experienced were the Music was too loud for me, it was hard to have a conversation anywhere in the building. I thought the video games were very pricey - although I feel the same way anywhere like that."}
{"text":"Overpriced and management could care less about your service needs. Will not be going back. Wrote review a month ago and management said they would try to make it right. Gave them my email they requested and never heard back anything from anyone there ever again. What a joke. They don't realize that word of mouth from one unhappy customer turns into a lot of people finding out how they don't take care of their customers. Kinda like their service there also. Try another place that will treat you better and want your business!"}
{"text":"Last time I spend time at the place. They make you pay a non-refundable $50 fee just to be put on the waiting list! I have never paid a non-refundable fee at any bowling place anywhere. Food was OK at best. The fries were as salty as they come. Maybe to sell you more drinks? I was in the 10 frame with one shot left...they shut the lane off/down. BAD MOVE. The games are 1.75 to 1.95 each, wow talk about over priced. Thought it would be fun but not so much."}
{"text":"Lots to do, love the pizza ice cream parlor. This place is awsome for kids and parents. Atmosphere is great."}
{"text":"There was a lot to do for kids but the service is bad the food was meh and the prices out crazy high for what you get. Just glad I won't have to go back!"}
{"text":"Fix the USBS on the Pump It Up Fiesta 2 machine and you have 5 stars!!! - update: Steve Stafford reached out to me and fixed this problem in no time! No complaints! Updated to 5 stars!

Great place and super cheap on Mondays. We only come for the arcade!

The whole 'Eat. Bowl. Breathe. Sleep. Whatever' thing that businesses have going on these days is cringeworthy, but t is what it is!"}
{"text":"I loved it, the main even is definetly a fun place to take the young ones especially on a Monday night!!"}
{"text":"This is a very nice Main Event location, but aside from the building being REALLY nice, the service was the WORST I'd ever gotten. My friend and I sat at the bar for 15 minutes plus (no exaggeration) as the bartenders walked past us several times. Then 2 young white females walked over and stood next to us  at the bar less than 5 minutes and BOOM. Service. I guess after that they couldn't just walk by and act like they hadn't seen us there. So we ordered drinks, and they were good, I ordered my food (chicken tenders) and we moved to a table because we obviously weren't getting service at the bar. They finally brought my food but with NO dipping sauce. So I was waiting for someone to walk by so MAYBE I could order a dipping sauce. Again NO SERVICE. Nobody came and asked if the food was ok, if we needed a new drink, a water to follow the alcoholic beverage NOTHING. So by this time I'm PISSED OFF. My friend who was with me had never been to Main Event and here I was raving about how nice and fun it is and THIS was her first experience. (She was NOT impressed) Our bowling lane was finally ready so we made our way there. Once there, NO SERVICE on the lanes. AT ALL. So I kept leaving the lane to go to the bar, first for BBQ sauce (gave me some chipotle sauce instead) and then for all things WATER. And I stood there for 10-15 minutes waiting to order 2 glasses of water. I kept waving to get the guys attention as he stood right next to me. He held up a finger and walked away AND DIDN'T COME BACK. So I asked the woman next to me to tell him that I just wanted water while he took her order. That was the only reason I got any kind of water. After bowling for an hour parched af. I've been to Main Event's Texas locations MANY TIMES. I was excited to know there were locations here, since I just moved here in January. It was actually one of my favorite places to go. I had a fun card with over $25 on it and was excited to get to Main Event and my night was TRASH. I will never return to this location again. I really wish I had the heart to just walk out of there and not pay for my food and drinks. Because ya'll didn't deserve a DIME of my money. I would have tipped negative if I could have. They need to go through a retrain on hospitality. Just throw the whole team away and hire a new crew, because the one they have SUCKS."}
{"text":"Main Event was one of the biggest rip-offs I've ever been to. I went with a friend during their Spring Break promotion. The promotion was $18.95 for unlimited bowling, laser tag, billiards, and gravity ropes. When we arrived, the representative said that laser tag and gravity ropes had a 2 hour wait each. She then stated that bowling had been free all day and we could do that no problem. After shoe rental, the total came to $50 for each of us. We assumed we'd bowl for a bit and by then be able to do the other activities. 

When we started bowling, I asked the waitress where the garbage can was and she directed me down the stairs at the end of the ramp. Translation: they don't even have garbage cans at the actual lanes - you have to walk down the ramp and stairs at the center of the alley to even throw food away. We ordered drinks and some appetizers and started bowling. After an hour, our lane shut off. I asked the waitress how to restart it and she went to the front desk and another man came up to us and asked what the problem was. I told him there wasn't a problem - we just couldn't figure out how to restart the lane. He informed us we had to vacate the lane because others were waiting. Keep in mind we've been here for ONE HOUR and the lane next to us wasn't even being used. He said there was now a wait and we had to leave but he'd be \"happy to put us on the wait list\" which was ANOTHER HOUR. When I confronted him, he had a robotic answer of \"I'm sorry for the inconvenience\" which was obviously insincere. We had just spent $50 for one hour of bowling and would have to wait at least another hour to do another activity. It was an absolute sham. 

The funniest part was the waitress who said she AGREED the place was a ripoff and that if she didn't work there, she also wouldn't come because it was too expensive and not worth it. 

Needless to say, Dave and Buster's is infinitely better - better food, better pricing, and better customer service."}
{"text":"Visited last night for my first time, what a joke!

Waitstaff was impeccably slow with their delivery times, and my order for drinks was messed up numerous times. It wasn't extremely busy and I felt I could've done it better myself by just walking to the bar instead of letting their employees do their job. They opened me 2 separate tabs without telling me, so of course I only paid for the one I knew I had open. My boss actually ended up being charged my 2nd tab! Looking over my bank charges this morning shows they not only charged my boss for that 2nd tab, but they also charged my card as well! I tried speaking to Spencer, their operations manager of 6 months. What a typical ass, didn't want to admit his staff was incompetent and undertrained and gave me the impression that these issues were my fault. I will not be returning, their competitors give a better atmosphere and I've never had any issues like these. I've actually never had issues like these. I wasn't offered anything in return for my troubles which I thought was absolutely absurd. If I could've given a more negative star review you bet I would've!"}
{"text":"Called to see how long the wait was to bowl and was told 1 hour. Drove ten minutes to main event then when I arrived it was a 2 hour wait. This place lies to get people in the door. A bunch of teenagers working here with horrible customer service."}
{"text":"Terrible restaurant for lunch. Waited 15 minutes to get a server in which I had to ask for one. Nice guy when he did get our order. Order buffalo wings and a Caesar salad and my son had a cheese pizza and an Oreo milkshake.  Got the food fairly quickly except they gave me the wrong wings and the fries were terribly over seasoned. The pizza sauce on my son's pizza was a mess and way too much for a small 7 inch pizza. The milkshake tastes great but as you can see in the picture never wiped down the outside of the glass. This not what I would expect from a franchised food and entertainment business."}
{"text":"Fantastic place to have a great time.  Zip line,  laser tag, bowling,  tons of games,  tickets for prizes,  look for the specials if the cost is an issue usually found on the website. Beautiful clean establishment,  Friendly staff.  Right next to Top golf so great for doubling the FUN."}
{"text":"Main Event, overall, was a blast for a party of 5! We took advantage of the summer pass deal, about $20 per person, to bowl, laser tag, high rope, and pool unlimited! You really can't beat that deal. 

The staff were mostly friendly, they make everything simple to understand. However, the high ropes woman was a bit on edge, which I understood it was already around 11 pm, but she didn't make it the best experience. 

Bowling was a lot of fun and the simplicity of choosing a bowling ball makes it easy for those who don't frequently bowl. All you have to do is choose a weight, then the size of your fingers. This helped to prevent discomfort for my fingers that I usually get while bowling. 

Laser tag was loads of fun! It's cool that you don't know who's team you are on until entering the play area, which prevents any unfairness of teams. They give a lot of time to play, enough until we were all out of breath. 

I had a great time here! Only fix would be to be a little more clear with high ropes, checking in, time allotted, etc."}
{"text":"We called ahead to see if we could reserve a spot for a party of 9 and we were told there were no reservations so ok fine. We arrived and pay $20 for 3 people and shoe rentals for bowling which was still all good and we were told that bowling was a 1.5 hr wait but thinking we could the gravity ropes and laser tag but everything was a 30/45 min wait but by the time it was your turn for everything else, your lane was open to bowl. So the only thing we could do was play the arcade games which were $1-$2 per game & anyone with kids knows that can get pricey. In the end it was far to much money to get nothing. We got a refund and left - poor flow and needs to be worked out."}
{"text":"The bartenders suck... Good luck getting anything without trying hard. At least the bar back girl was friendly. Also be prepared to be asked if you want to open a tab every single time you order a drink. Talk about short term memory."}
{"text":"Young siblings came to town and we wanted to have a fun experience. The AZ heat leaves only a few options for non desert living individuals. So we look up prices and are blown away at how reasonable the \"fun pass\" they offer actually is. $10 gets you most of the big attractions including the gravity gym, bowling and laser tag. Since my little sister has never played laser tag that's where we went first.
First thing I noticed is the smell of urine throughout the laser tag arena. 
Second thing I noticed is that most all of the employees hate their jobs.
Third thing is that there are no rules  followed.

Now I'm a grown man and have expectations for business establishments. This whole let's just give kids guns and not supervise, doesn't fly with me at all. 

On a side note, the ladies at the front payment desk where very nice, knowledgable and their customer service was on point.
Your shuffle board table was fun and your arcade games were modern and accurately priced. 

Notes to management:
-Demote the guy running the laser tag today too a dishwasher, not only was he on something, he also was clearly not interested in doing his job since he spent his time on his phone playing Pokemon (don't underestimate a grown mans eyes). 
-clean your laser tag arena more thoroughly and depict the rules in a more efficient and understandable manner.
-have a referee in the arena to ensure the game is being played correctly.
-minimum age requirement for laser tag should be 8 years old."}
{"text":"I had the most amazing time celebrating my 22nd birthday with my family and friends. We were a group of 11 and all got the championship package. We did the gravity ropes, laser tag, bowling and arcade games. Then we also had an hour to eat and I want to recognize Hector for his amazing service! I've never been so pleased with our server as much as I was with him. He took care of our entire group and made sure we all left happy. This has been the best birthday I've had by far and I know my entire group loved being there as well. We will all be recommending this place to our friends for the near future. Thank you also to Spencer for taking care of any needs/questions we had once we were there! Over such a great experience and I can't wait to come back for another event. Thank you so much hector for making this night memorable, fun, and easy going for all of us!"}
{"text":"I initially felt like I was having a bad experience. I guess here you pay for an hour of bowling and whatever else. So it was like 48$ bucks for two to bowl -- seemed kind of steep! But the lanes were really nice and it seemed really cool! So first they assigned us to a lane that was broken, and the employees near the bowling area seemed confused as to why they would assign us to a broken lane. Anyway, we quickly got reassigned and then someone came by to apologize and gave us some extra time (15 minutes). That was nice! After one game, a really noisy crowd of probably drunk people were put next to us. (It's after midnight). One of the drunk guys goes, \"Hey, hey, hey, hey\" multiple times until I addressed him with, \"Yes?\" And he goes, \"You're really hot!\" And then he continued to harass me so I told my friend I didn't want to bowl anymore. We returned our shoes and went to play the games. Shortly thereafter a manager (DJ) came up to us and found out what happened. He was so very kind and understanding. My friend actually did most of the talking as I was playing a game. DJ wound up refunding me for the bowling (we literally only bowled for less than 20 min) and gave us some game cards! I really appreciated that. I'm glad that someone is paying attention and notices things. I wouldn't have complained or even said anything because that's just how I am. I'm glad there are people like DJ who care about the customer and treats them fairly! Thank you!!!!"}
{"text":"So we came to have a date night. We went and grabbed a beer, and saw that four of the pool tables were reserved, so we asked if the one open table is reserved, the supervisor said no. When we went to go play on the table, a customer came up and said that one is also reserved as well. So we decided to just bowl instead. We went up to ask for a lane, and they continued to say that all of the lanes are reserved until 8. There were 10 people in this entire building, and one group was playing pool and one group bowling. There was literally nobody in the building, but everything was reserved. If you are going to rent out your business, then post a sign in your door, or maybe let your staff know."}
{"text":"Overall, it was an ok experience.

Arcade: not many selections for games.  Mostly car or shooting games, not much of a selection.  Price seems high per game (nearly $2) but I guess that's the going rate.  Games were all working and in good condition.

Laser Tag: the laser tag itself was fun.  Took my 2 boys in with me.  Arena has good obstacles.  However, the young man running the show seemed to be rude.  All he kept talking about was no running.   Literally he kept repeating Don't Run.  Then he was laying on the floor hiding in a corner.  He wasn't playing.  I nearly stepped on him.   I don't understand why he was even in there.  

Prizes:  what a joke.  Dave and Busters looks to at least take pride in their selection.  Main Event looks like it went to the Dollar Store and just got a few things. 

Food: ate the pizza.  $24 for a large 9 slice pizza and 4 medium drinks.  Not bad.  Pizza was pretty good and only took may be 10 minutes to make.

Overall for 4 game passes, 1 game of Laser tag for 3, and pizza I paid nearly $200.  Seemed pricey.   Place was busy but clean."}
{"text":"I have came here a few times before and I really like how easy it is to get to it. It's right off the freeway and tons of parking. They have many different activities that is family and friend friendly. They serve alcohol and their menu has something for almost everyone. There are days that they have specials/discounts so it would be a good idea to look into that, because it can be a little pricey."}
{"text":"I have driven past this place a few times and had no idea what it was until I popped in  yesterday to check it out.  Comparing to say, Dave & Busters, it has about 30% of the games, but also has a bowling alley and billiards in addition to the food and full bar.  Sunday through Thursday they have free billiards until 7, so of course I took advantage of that with a bucket of beer.  The help was friendly, and the place is still relatively new so everything is clean (for the most part).  I don't think I would come back to pay full price for anything here, but if it's happy hour or a promotion I could swing it for sure.  It's only a couple of blocks from where I work so it's possible this will happen sooner than later.  I munched on the southwestern egg rolls and chicken quesidilla - both were ok but neither knocked my socks off.  Still, totally worth checking out if and when the price is right!"}
{"text":"I have had horrible service from this place. From the bar not knowing how to answer questions about the gluten free alcohol they have. To just the bartender being extremely rude and by passing you when there is no other ppl at the bar to order. Then when you finally get the chance to order they are rushing you when you ask them about their special drinks. They need to hire personable ppl. That's why it's called customer service"}
{"text":"I came here with a group of friends on a Saturday night for a birthday. We sat in the bar (which is open seating) while we waited for our bowling lane to open (2 and a half our wait) and waited patiently for a server to come by to get out drink order. I had to stop two servers and even the manager over the course of an hour to get someone over to out table to get one round of drinks in. The manager was good for nothing and basically told me \"everyone sat down at once, what do you want me to do?\". Hm, I don't know, how about your job? Then when our server finally made it to our table she greeted us with \"I've been here since 11 so I'm going to cash you guys out right away so I can leave\". Super professional. So after we receive one round of drinks we sit there for another HOUR while waiting for our new server to acknowledge us so we could order food. Finally Wes came to our saving grace after I stopped him while walking by. He got our food and drink order in immediately and apologized for the terrible service. Unfortunately that's all he would do for us. Our other server Chandler couldn't care less about us and we waited 45 for our drinks to get to our table. We received our food and finished eating before we could even get drinks. This was by far the worst service I've ever received and extremely poorly managed. Wes, you deserve to be promoted to manager."}
{"text":"I took my daughter here on a Friday afternoon and the service was horrible. The first thing we wanted to do was grab a slice of pizza, $4.50 per slice and only 3 old slices were available. We stood there waiting and recieved no service so decided to go to the restaurant  side. We sat at a table top for 10 minutes with no service. We ended up just leaving. This was the worst service ever and I'm never going back."}
{"text":"Indoor fun activities, perfect anytime of the year.

They have bowling, laser tag, gravity ropes (you attach yourself with harness and walk on ropes) and arcades. You could spend pretty much all day here.

They have pizza restaurant within to cater your party, or a bar to hangout to watch your game. Yes they have a full bar here.

Free wifi is available, convenient while waiting.

My mini me was invited to a birthday party here and had a great time. Now she wants to have her next party here. I was told price is actually reasonable, I guess we might be back again"}
{"text":"Came to play pool with my oldest son. Had to wait but Jesica the bartender was very attentive and helpful!

Very clean and nice atmosphere!

Great for parties!"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times recently for fathers day and my birthday. On fathers day the visit was alright. My dad and I wanted to play shuffleboard but they didn't have any sand so we couldn't play... so that was a bummer. I had to ask 2 times for a server while we were bowling. The place is kind of over priced if you ask me... its similar to dave and busters. We ended up having a good time because of company and we love to bowl. 

On my birthday a few weeks later they still didnt have sand which was really annoying to me... like who does your ordering? I was told its because \"the kids waste it\" which isn't a good excuse to me. Stop handing out the sand to kids. At any other bar (shuffleboard is in the bar at this place) the bartender collects an ID for the supplies to ensure it is returned in good condition. This place just wastes their supplies and allows kids to terrorize the games. I complained to the manager (I think his name was Jon) and he apologized and then came up to us about 25 minutes later and told us he sent someone to get sand at Walmart which I thought was a nice gesture so he's cool, nice guy. Same thing happened at the bowling lane again though, I had to ask twice for someone to come over and take my order. Seems like they are careless and don't pay much attention to the customers. We had a good time this time as well but I still think Main Event should work on their customer service at the bowling lanes and stop being so careless with their supplies."}
{"text":"Good family fun because it has a lot of variety. There's video games, billiards, laser tag, bowling, climbing bridge, restaurant and random things. All of the kids seem to have fun. 

Look for specials. On a Monday last week, it was $10 all you can bowl, laser tag, etc. 

Oh and you also get waiter service while you bowl. It's kind of cool since you don't have to leave your lane and the waiter brings you food and drinks.

Good family fun OR good group hang out with friends too!"}
{"text":"Complained about the service to Jon the manager the associate laughed her ass off to him  to him. Which proved my point . Hire kids n that endanger your business. We got a refund n left never coming again"}
{"text":"My husband and I enjoy eating here. The bacon cheeseburger is our fave. Unfortunately when it comes to the bar there's a lady usually in the evenings that has been rude to us and seems to always be in a bad mood which is why we prefer to go elsewhere now."}
{"text":"This place sucks! If you are planning on eating and drinking, you might want to rethink it. Horrible customer service! Food took over 30 mins and no one ever checked on us! This was on a a Tuesday at 1pm...not that busy and they were fully staffed!!!"}
{"text":"What is there to complain about? Pool tables, 22 bowling alleys, laser tag, arcade games, and a killer zip line. There are many choices for food and it is fast and easy. 4 kids, 7 hours and $60 for everything except the arcade games. Lots of fun on a HOT day."}
{"text":"We decided to bowl here during our visit to Phoenix/Tempe. They feature current arcade games,  billiards, laser tag, gravity play, and bowling. They have a restaurant and serve food and drinks at the lanes as well. The waitress was very friendly and checked in on us twice, although we did not end up ordering food. The complex is very clean (even saw an employee scrubbing down the arcade games) and features music and fun lighting effects at the lanes. I like how they had the bowling balls organized by weight and size; very organized and easy to find what you want. 

Cons: We waited to be helped at the counter and several staff members saw us and didn't come over to help. We paid $30 for one hour of bowling, which seemed a bit steep."}
{"text":"We paid for the whole package and when we went or play laser tag they said we didn't have the ticket to be able to play. What is the point of paying for the whole package if you don't get to do everything? Thank you for wasting my time and making my bachelorette party oh so shitty."}
{"text":"If I could give negative stars...that would happen. However I'm currently here, and have been waiting over 35 minutes for my next drink. The bus boys/servers refuse to buss the tables next to the pool tables even when we asked like 3 times! Someone came over to take care of it but instead they just fucking piled it right in the center of the table and left. As much as I thought this place was going to be amazing, it's failed at not only the excitement that I had being my first time here but it's made me realize what a huge mistake this was and to NEVER come here again. So fucking sad because there's video games.... shit."}
{"text":"This place is super cute but, customer service could be improved.

- Upon making the reservation, the customer service rep said that we could make changes to the reservation up until Friday, party was on Saturday.  I called on Friday and increased the number of guests.  The staff didn't know about the change and said they would have to speak to a manager to see about getting another bowling lane even though I did have a confirmation of the changes.

- Party host should have help in taking and filling drink orders.  After 20 minutes of eating pizza, the drinks arrived.  If servers worked as a team instead of by themselves, they would serve their guests quicker.

- I believe it's rude to give the customer a bill in the middle of the party.  And then for it to have a mistake on top of it. They were wanting to charge extra for another lane added (again relating back to the initial mistake).  

- Instead of saying \"We have these tables reserved for another party at 1:50pm\".  The party host could have said, \"Shall we move along to cake now?\" The host was slow in moving the party along and my son didn't have time to open gifts there.

- At the end of the party.  The manager (possibly, someone in a white shirt) only gave us half of the gifts in the locker. I thought there were more so I went back and asked if there were more, they said no, it was someone else's.  Turns out they were ours. We are still missing a gift, who knows where it is."}
{"text":"Awwww, 2nd time here visit f from California and our fresh on the floor, throw them to the wolves Tamaron (Tammy)was our server. So cute, sweet and perfect."}
{"text":"Don't go to main event!!!!

So I recently went to main event in tempe on Saturday 3-3-18. It was my friends bday and we figured it was a fun place to go out with friends and have a good time..........nope I was wrong. To start the night off 2 of my friends arrived at 5pm reserved a lane but were told it would be a 2hr wait. Ok understandable since it was a saturday. So I arrived with the rest of my group at 645 pm to find out that the lane still wasn't going to be ready for an extra hour. So we then preceded to request a pool table and again were told it would be 2hrs for a table. So finally we go reserve a spot for laser tag which that was a shorter wait time since you only get 15mins a round. So by the time we were done our bowling lane still wasn't ready for another hour. At this point it was a waste of money. We each spent 30 plus dollars for \"unlimited\" play but only played a round of laser tag. Finally we get our lane and we finally get to bowl. We order some food and drinks. Well then we didn't even get to finish our game because you only get so much time on the lane and the game locked on us so then our friends began to leave then after 15 mins it came back up for us to finish. So in that time we realized that 2 of our friends never received their food and when the server came over to us she then began to say she did bring it over. Well we ordered the triple play and nacho plate. Our other friend ordered the spinach dip. Well spinach dip comes on the triple play so the server tried to say that it wasn't part of the triple play and then corrected herself and said that she did bring 2 out when she didn't even bring any of the food it was a different server. So after that I asked for a manager and told him about our long wait times and the food mess up and then he told me he would take care of the spinach dip order but yet no apologies for the wait. Regardless of what day it was they should be capable of handling the busy rush since it's a popular place. I'm truly grossed out with this place and will not be going back! They need a better system to organize the wait times and also account for how many parties they except since I also saw plenty of party groups there. 
Also if I could give zero stars I would but sadly I have to give one. So don't waste your time or money here it's over priced and the food isn't worth the money."}
{"text":"It's completely packed to the brim with little kids all night long to closing and your only option is to sit among them waiting until the laser tag and bowling are available. I've been there on a Friday night and most recently a Saturday and each time we were told it was a 3 hour wait for bowling, over an hour wait for laser tag etc. The first time i went a friend had ordered a drink and it took them about 40 minutes to get it, they also ordered food and never got it at all, this last time we ended up just leaving right away and asked for our money back. It's just a shiny Peter Piper Pizza, definitely not for an adult outing and I don't think I'd bring my kids here either just for the fact they have such terrible customer service."}
{"text":"We had so much fun! Party of 4, went it, ate at the bar, food looked and tasted good, I had the hummus with fresh and crisp veggies (nothing that I hate more is good hummus and dry vegetables) pita was excellent, my friends had chicken and waffle, I tried it, it's legit and the mac & cheese was awesome too. 

We played laser tag, 15 minutes $8 per person, it was really fun, nice set up and very clean. The coach that played with us though, she killed all of us like 10 times and was kinda cheating and was not fun having to wait for your shield to go back up once you get shot by her.

I would definitely recommend this for fun things to do with friends or family when in the Valley. Will be back soon for sure."}
{"text":"Took my 15 yr old nephew.  Summer rate before 11am of $10 was a bonus!  But they get you in the end.  Drinks were $3.50 and shoe rental for bowling was $5.  Laser Tag was a nice surprise, large area with a upper deck."}
{"text":"Updated review. I brought my family in and the staff was very friendly and attentive. Good service all around."}
{"text":"Ok, LOVE the concept, the facility is beautiful and the entertainment options are really nice. The lack of enthusiasm of just a few members  of the staff leaves something to be desired and kind of drained my own excitement. 
I attended a Holiday get together at this location on 12/20/17. The 1st person to greet Us was Ebenezer; His level of customer service was unmatched by anyone else that I came into contact while there!! He was smiling, very informative and always seemed to know when our glasses needed to be refilled. 
I watched the interaction between my coworker and the gentleman running the ropes; he, too, was very engaging and attentive. 
My interaction with a gentleman that, I believe was, a manager, was very positive; he promptly addressed my concern and followed up with the party planner to address any additional concerns. 
Now, the ladies in the prize area, where you sign up for Laser tag? They are either unhappy employees, or being held hostage. They never cracked a smile, never said a word that wasn't required, did not seem to really care that our group was there. I do realize they are not there to entertain, per se, but, they could \"appear\" to enjoy helping customers, being employed, or even alive. 
I, too, see the same thing daily in my job, but for those I serve, it is, very often, the entire experience that counts.
Will I go back, or recommend this place to others? Sure, I will just be sure to remember that a lot of the enthusiasm will come from within and tell them to bring their own (& ask for Ebenezer  )"}
{"text":"They have a lot of things to do.  Eating, bowling, games, etc.  The place is clean, sparkly, and beautiful.  But it can get a little confusing when you have never been there.  Where to pay, where to play, and what to do.  I walked around the place and it was too much simulation.  Don't know if I was tired or just not in the mood, but I left."}
{"text":"Fun place, ropes, laser tag, bowling, food and drinks. Went there with our team of Market America distributors. Enjoyed drunks and food but only get 3 stars due to the services.   We were bowling and couldnt get a waitress over so we could order food and drinks.  Finally got our food but no sauce for our strips and no napkins.  Had to ask.  While we were bowling the bar came down on the pins and said our time was up. We hadn't finished our game. Who does that?  Let us finish our game!  Then we are walking away and a employee asks us if we want to play another game. Really?  They wouldnt let us finish our game and then they want us to play another one?"}
{"text":"The server ERIC is amazing must go here. David the manager is awesome. Charlene the bar tender is amazing!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Went in with my family who were here from out of town Friday night. We wanted to do something fun and decided to try here for the first time. At first our visit was rocky as we were lost at what to do and kept getting sent back and forth but Stephanie (I think that was her name) really turned out night around! She got us a bowling lane quickly and helped clear everything up. Then our bowling lane broke and we got delayed but the manager (I think) gave all 6 of us a game card for an hour and a half of free play. All in all we had a really good night minus the few set backs. Highly recommended doing laser tag!"}
{"text":"We went today for a birthday party. Staff was helpful, and the food was awesome. The downside,  is that the games were really overpriced, as well as the activities. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"My family and I which came out to a party of 12 and weren't sure what to expect of this place, None of us except one had ever even been inside. We got the Triple Play which included unlimited drinks, the pizza party, an hour and a half of bowling,  one activity (gravity ropes, laser tag) per guest, 1 10$ arcade card per guest.  Before I start my analysis I'd like to say all of us had fun, but even though we were not supposed to be assigned a host, we were only approached once by the person who was supposed to be helping us and I found it rather difficult to do something as simple as get a drink.  We were only given drinks twice the whole time we were there, for unlimited drinks which we did specifically ask for and I think even paid extra for I expected a lot more.  The food was good and we got more than enough food for everyone, it was the better part of the service we received.  We tried reserving the laser tag room or so we thought, you can reserve the laser tag arena, but others will play in the same course and 8 minute time limit that your party does.  There was some confusion when it came to this partly on us not knowing how the whole thing worked, but again this was our first time there and hardly anything was explained to us.  The laser tag was the most fun part most of my party had while there and I have to say if we did come back it would be for this activity mainly.  We spoke to a manager who calmly, swiftly, and very generously comped us for 12 half hour arcade cards which even though your not able to try the prize winning games gave us loads of fun on other arcade style racing, shooting, and air hockey games.  Everything considered it's a great place to have a party, but ask a lot of questions and maybe even try the place out as just a walk in, which they do take.  Understand exactly what is going to happen and when, also knowing exactly who is your party host/attendant is key to having a good experience here.  *Update* we went back just to play in the arcade and realized my son never got his birthday bowling pin that everyone at the party signs, this causes me to take one more star off.  Such a shame, the place could be so great, but falls so short."}
{"text":"Came here with some work friends for some bowling on a Monday night, brought my kids as well since it was \"all you can play\" in the arcade. I purchased meals for all my kids and my friends also ordered food. 

We had to go multiple times to the front desk to have our bowling lane \"fixed\" the waiter was very slow and didn't bring the basics, like silverware, without being asked. The food was really underwhelming and my fries were straight up cold. When we asked for our checks it took us half an hour to get them and then another 20 minutes for the waiter to bring our cards back. At this point I realize that I hadn't gotten the cards from the deal where if I buy a qualifying meal I get a $10 gift card (which for me, meant $40) so we wait 10 more minutes for the waiter again to come back and bring the cards and while he is gone getting my gift cards we realize one of my group also qualified for a $10 card and he didn't get his either, so we had to wait for him again. Because of coarse he only brought the ones we SPECIFICALLY asked for the first time.

Probably won't go back again, the bowling was fun when it was working, but I can bowl at other, better quality places that won't disappoint this badly. Will probably give my gift cards to someone who has more patience than I do."}
{"text":"Came here with a group of friends on a Thursday around 2 pm. Laser tag was fun but sat down at 2:40 for food and it is now 4:15 and our food still has not arrived. It took 15 minutes for us to receive our drinks 

The staff is very nice however there is only two servers working. 

Would not return."}
{"text":"Ok, so we wait in line at the main payment area for ten minutes because we promised my younger son we would all play a game of laser tag if he was good while we were shopping at Lamps Plus. The girl then informs us that for laser tag, there is a separate line in the back.  Another seven minute wait--- and guess what?  There was a SEVENTY FIVE MINUTE wait for laser tag. 

I was not happy. 
My wife was not happy. 
My son was really not happy. 

Three stars are generous."}
{"text":"The three star rating for Main Event is pretty accurate.  On the one hand, there are plenty of things to do.  As a family of 8, we rented two bowling lanes for an hour and also played a game of laser tag.  I'd forgotten how fun laser tag can be!  I was the \"Most Trigger Happy\" during our game and ranked 2nd out of 10 so I was pretty amazing.  The prices here can be pretty hard to stomach, especially if you visit on a Friday evening like we did.  The bowling was so expensive for only one hour!  We were only able to play 1.5 games in that time period.  Make sure you bring a wad of money with you to Main Event, because it will be gone by the end of the night."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good for kids. They seem to have a lot of summer specials going on which is nice. They've got some great memorial day specials. For $13 the kids can play from 1030 to 5 PM. This includes their skywalk activities thing, laser tag, bowling and pool. I'm sure there's more that's included in that but I don't really know. Plenty of arcade games but you have to pay for those by purchasing a $1 card that you get to reload all the time. They have some kind of special going on for $11 that's includes all of the arcade games but I don't know the details so you'll have to figure that one out for yourself. The food is ok, we did have one of our items forgotten about but they didn't give us any grief about taking it off of the bill. They didn't make any attempt to do anything for the inconvenience either though. Decent place to spend the day and not have to put out too much money unless you buy food. That's the kicker"}
{"text":"Hi. I sent Steven an email but received no response. Should I expect a message back? Does he still work there?"}
{"text":"Updated: I am very impressed with how quickly this was responded to. I am still at the location and the district manager called me to apologize and the manager promptly came over with a $20 video game card for each of my kids.  The response from the district manager was understanding and swift and my kids are grateful for the extra video game time.  I updated my rating from 2 stars to 4 stars and we will likely be back in the future.



The winter funpass is a good deal for cabin feverish kids, however the staff and management are rude and inattentive.
I brought my kids here to beat the winter blues and get some work done. I got the kids the winter funpass and sat at a table in their restaurant area.  The staff never came over, regardless of walking by several times.  On each table there was an ad for \"Buy a $25 gift card, get a $10 bonus card.\" When I asked about this, I was told the ad expired yesterday (there was no expiration on the ad) and that they would not honor it. 
The manager stated that they were in the process of removing them, but had only gotten to the sign on the front of the building.  The ad was on every table with no expiration, however he was unwilling to honor. 
I am not one to complain, but any other establishment would have honored their posted promotions.
It will be awhile before I come back, if ever.  For the money, Dave and Busters or Ultrastar are much better options."}
{"text":"We went to the Main Event in Tempe today because we were turned away by the local Dave & Busters. My boyfriend and I took his little sister to go out for a day of fun in some AC, and were told we could not enter D&B because he and I were under 25 with a minor, we are both 21. So we huffed, turned around and left. 

We found out there was a Main Event in the area and went there instead, where we were more than welcome to enter. We not only were treated by a friendly staff, but we were even give a free game of laser tag as compensation for having to wait a little longer than promised for the rope climber we had originally paid for. We will definitely be heading back from now on!"}
{"text":"Games are great, bowling is a bit much per hour tho. Had great time playing the many other games they offer. Was not too crowded even for a saturday. Will def be coming back here and bringing friends!"}
{"text":"At first I thought this place was awesome...then they sell you on a wristband package to be able to do unlimited activities there. Sounds great right? But you don't know what surprise you're in for! We had a group of 5 all purchasing the wristband spending about $125. 

A couple reasons why this place is getting a bad review. 1) it's not even busy and they tell you 2 hour waiting listen to bowl. 2) it's not really convenient to order food and keep getting moved around and move lanes if you're bowling. 3) no one really has all day to get on a wait list, so that is where they rip off your party. 4) the service is just ok 5) it's actually cheaper paying for what you want to play. For example, we bowled 3x, it would have only been $90 average instead of getting the wristband. 

It's not busy and they make you wait 2 hours! Wow! Rip off! See the photo!"}
{"text":"Seems cool and all but it's a rip off honestly. Overpriced and bad service. They had us going back and forth because people who work there do not have good communication skills, one person says one thing and the other person says the complete opposite. Get your sh*t together! Lol The bar was okay, but they tried to give my credit card and bill to someone else who was complaining   That they lost her card!! Lol just a mess!
I wouldn't go back willingly."}
{"text":"Bad. Bad. Bad. No service element at all. Bunch of staff standing around hanging out while my drinks sat waiting with the bartender. And booking a group at a lane before the day of is a joke. You have to sign a non refundable contract and lucky if someone actually assists you."}
{"text":"Love this place and their food! I go here all of the time. I usually sit down and order food but I had a few kids with me this time so I just went to the little restaurant inside and got a few slices of pizza. BIG mistake. I had to pretty much flag down the girl that was supposed to be working there. She seemed really unintelligent and a little off. Maybe drunk or stoned? Not sure. Her name was tamy or tamera or something along those lines. Either way, I was really annoyed and I just wanted a couple quick slices of pizza. She could barely count my change right. Other than this irritable experience, I love this place. Most of the other employees are awesome and always help me out!"}
{"text":"Very stylish place, great idea! The place is ran terribly. When you pay for quality you expect quality not just with the environment but with the staff.  Went bowling with some friends; again great equipment, but no lane servicing at all. We had to leave the lane for a good 15 minutes to go to the bar and get drinks. This was at around 5 pm on a wednesday, with no crowd and no waiting. You'd think at $29 per hour +$5 for shoes you're at least be paying for some kind of lane service. At the end of your hour, even if you are on your last frame and you don't finish they dont do a courtesy time frame to let you finish your round like they do at top golf(2 min). Wouldn't recommend going here unless you're okay with mediocre service."}
{"text":"They kicked out Bride & Groom from laser tag after they'd reserved for their party far in advance. Turns out another party booked later, then showed up w/too many people, grabbed all the laser vests and the staff's solution was to turn a portion of the bridal party away, including bride and groom."}
{"text":"Took my kids here today to celebrate my sons birthday. I bought the all day play pass and we headed off to laser tag. The young lady at laser tag informed me my youngest son (5) was too short to play, being that I was alone with my kids I could not leave him out by himself or send my 6 year old in by himself so I went to ask for a refund and go elsewhere where the Birthday boy could play laser tag as this is all he has been asking for. The Front desk paged manager to come issue my refund. To my surprise the Manager walked us to laser tag and gave us the go ahead to play. I stayed by my 5 year old side during the game and they had so much fun they played 4 times.  The manager even came and found us and gave both my kids a play card and wished my oldest a Happy Birthday. What I thought was going to be a bad day and having to tell my son we couldn't celebrate where he wanted turned into a wonder 4 hours of fun. I am so appreciative of Steve, the Manager that assisted us. We will be back to play again soon!!"}
{"text":"WHAT A JOKE!!!! This place has no integrity and ran by people with no sense of customer service. Decided to go for a day out and enjoy this place. Heard both very positive and very negative things about this place but am always someone who wants to put their own opinion on a place. Spent $75 for the kids to enjoy some of their arcade games and things like that. Kids wanted to play Laser Tag so we sign up. Girl named Mikenze was nice enough to help and charges me for the 5 of us to play. She said next one starts at 2:15 and to just go stand in line and it runs every 15 minutes. It was 1 so we were like ok kids can play some more and the wife and I will enjoy a drink and appetizers at the Bar. Andrea was great and very personable and should be a valued employee. An hour passes and we go stand in line. People in line are holding a paper. I figure I must of just not got mine. I ask and they say I was never signed up but next available 1 starts at 3:30. I was frustrated at this point and asked why I was charged but not signed up? They called the Manager Jesus ( Here's where the no sense of customer service comes in) I ask for a refund so we can be on our way we weren't going to wait an additional hour and a half. He asked for my receipt. I did not have, must have lost between the receipt for the $75 we spent on cards for the kids to play or the $35 we spent at the bar with food and drinks, and the $45 for the laser tag I had lost it. I explained that I had only been an hour and a half at most since purchasing could you look it up. NO is what I got. I said are you really not going to give me my money back, he told us to remove the wrist bands before he refunded the money (like we were going to stay and actually do it at this point!!!) he said he could only refund me $38. I said well the total was $45 and the extra was a tip for them suiting is up and helping during laser tag. Which at this point we were not going to and had not done. He was very rude and said sorry you should have kept your receipt. I explained that we had been here a while and already spent over $150 there is not a way to look up a transaction? NO is what I got. Meanwhile in the back Mikenze is doing what Jesus should have been doing and looking up my transaction to give me my money back. Mikenze did find it during this conversation (2-3 minutes maybe) and apologized and offered to give it back in cash. Realizing she was putting in the only effort and essentially doing her boss Job I just decided to leave without the additional money back. When a company meets an issue is when you find out how much integrity that company has. Not sure if this is what they were trained to do but Jesus handled this so poorly it was embarrassing. I will not ever be going back. Nothing was offered to try and make it right, nothing was done to try and get us in laser tag, nothing was done but a manager arguing with a patron on simply giving his money back.  Really would stay away. Heard too much bad stuff and now dealing with it first hand...."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst service ever!!!
We waited over an hour for some burgers and fries. They are completely understaffed - and it is a Thursday night!!!!

The managers are incompetent and unwilling to help their waitresses keep up at peak demand. They couldn't even get the silverware for almost an hour. The food runner had no idea what they were bringing and where it went. 

Terrible is the only way to describe it. We spent over $530 with 3 families and completely ruined our night. 
DO NOT VISIT!!!

Here is a pic of the burger to confirm a lot of what was stated above.

Update : GM sat down with us to explain that they had a staffing issue. He was disappointed in the picture of the burger and spent time apologizing for our experience. Good news is that he cares about his product and tried to make the experience better."}
{"text":"Fun environment to go kill some time or for a night out of the house.  Overall the place is just not as well maintained as it should be.  Went today and was a little disappointed in some of the details.  

They have a game that is for kids to win tickets that is based on a fireman putting out fires (it squirts actual water). It seems like the water was almost completely dried up and little squirts came out here and there between sputtering and bursts of air.  I tracked down one of the employees who was literally playing a game when I was looking for him.  He swiped his card to try it out and was kinda staring at it and half playing it... he just kinda let it go, no offer to put the $1.35 or whatever back on my card, or even a \"sorry about that!  I'll get it fixed now\"

Went to change a diaper in the family bathroom and the changing station is broken to the point where I had to put my knee under the front of it to keep my son from rolling onto the floor while I was changing him.

We played some games that gave out cards and chips instead of tickets and when I took them to cash them in at the prize room (like they do at Dave and Busters) the girl in the prize room told me \"oh!  You use those out there to play the game, we don't cash those in\". I asked how and she said \"honestly I've never played that game... no clue.\"  There is a kiosk where you put them all in and cash them into tickets to put on your card but I had to ask more employees to even find that machine.

Overall it wasn't a bad experience and I would still go back, but it's those little things that can make or break an experience and today definitely wasn't a 5 star visit."}
{"text":"I frequent Main Event often with my friends mainly to Play the Pump it Up machine. It's a fun atmosphere but the games are extremely overpriced and they don't have a ton of games to choose from. They've been opened for a year and a half and not once have they upgraded any of their machines or brought in new games. I actually reached out to them on their web page about upgrading their Pump machine to the newest version (Prime) and I never received a response back. We spend a lot of money at this place and it's sort of a slap in the face when you don't acknowledge your regulars who are there every weekend."}
{"text":"$1.65 for games? Change it to credits like Dave n busters so I don't feel like I'm getting ripped off. The food is descent but the service is horrible. If there are a lot of people sitting at the bar or the tables they should have some type of system for anyone to notice us. I waited 15-20 minutes to ask someone to take our order. Bowling is only rented $36 for the hour not per game-RIPOFF-. Expect to spend the whole day if you want to try laser tag or anti gravity walk- there's always a waiting list for 2-3 hours later. The only competition is Dave N Busters and Main Event does not compare especially if you have a children's party like I did. My host was excellent but I had only one host getting drinks for 13 kids and 10 adults and it was hard getting refills. I know I will never host a party there again. This place is good if you're by yourself and just want to get a beer."}
{"text":"Very fun place! Took two of our children there and they had a great time. We loaded 4 cards up with $20 and bought the $18.95 passes for bowling, laser tag, and the sky walk thing. Laser tag was a lot of fun! We will more than likely be back soon!"}
{"text":"We were super excited to find this place so close to home...my husband is an avid bowler and was looking forward to having a location so close to home. First of all, it costs over $30 for one person to bowl for one hour...are you kidding me?!? We arrived at our lane and it wasn't functioning properly from the start. In an attempt at 3 frames, the machine malfunctioned 4 out of 6 balls. Meanwhile (while the hour clock is running) we sat and waited for them to reset the machine. We spent probably 20 minutes just trying to get through those 3 frames. Several employees came by, yet none of them had the capability of taking our food or drink orders, several of them called for a waitress who never materialized. I was only there to have a bite to eat and a beverage while he bowled, so needless to say, I wasn't a happy camper. My husband finally got a manager who refunded our game and offered us some game cards for their arcade. I hope my husband enjoys them because I will never go back to this establishment."}
{"text":"I would give it 5 stars but our server was pretty bad. He ordered the wrong food, mixed up ppls bills, took forever and gave us the wrong drinks. Im not sure what was going on but Im guessing he was having a rough night idk. However the bowling, zip line, laser tag, and arcades were all fun in one place! Great for group events or parties."}
{"text":"So... basically, this is a glorified bowling alley.  I am used to going to Brunswick but we thought we'd give this a try since it's closer to our house. Prices are bit more expensive to bowl but their food is cheaper than Brunswick. We paid $48.75 for a Sunday afternoon (11:30am) and bowled for an hour and rented two pairs of shoes. I thought this was fairly expensive. However, we got the loaded nachos for about 10 dollars and they were pretty good. 

Servers were very slow in the bowling alley area and didn't refill our empty glasses. I don't think it was there fault I just don't think they were staffed. Monitors and screens are a great touch. We also enjoy the arcade game section so we can pretend we are 10 years old again. Overall, for what we are going for, we enjoy it."}
{"text":"Our server Brady deserves 5 star however the establishment and experiences was mediocre at best. We had to ask twice to have the bubble gum removed from the lane and when our lane broke Brady tried multiple times to get it fixed. We pressed for service multiple times and got no response. We missed over 20 minutes of our hour limit. Brady was very apologetic however the manager could've cared less. We had purchased the special so we could return at any time to bowl again. That is not customer services. The games are over priced and when I asked to pay the difference so my child could have the small stuffed animal that she wanted we were shot down."}
{"text":"We were in from out of town and had seen commercials for Main Event. We went in trying to get out of the heat and sat at the bar. Unfortunately we sat there for 20 minutes without any acknowledgement ( there were two bartenders working). If they were busy and told us that it would have been a few minutes we would have been totally fine, there was NO communication at all. Sadly we left and went to another local sports bar. It was somewhere that we would have spend some time and money at had the service not been so poor. I have never posted a yelp review before but have never experienced such horrible service."}
{"text":"Are you kidding?!? The new pricing structure is ridiculous... $9-10 per person per activity (e.g. Laser tag, gravity walk, etc.). Bowling is a separate charge and us charges hourly; the hour starts when you sign in, not when you actually start bowling. Food is priced at mid-level ($12-15 per plate) and all of their \"craft\" cocktails contain \"fresh sour.\" Out drinks sat empty until we ran to the bar (multiple times) for refills. Unbelievable rip-off. Never again..."}
{"text":"We have been to main event at least three times in the past month and always have great service in the dinning area love there pizza"}
{"text":"Don't waste your money here. 

Honestly hate to complain when I had a fun night.
BUT. Had to send my chicken wings back because after about 20 mins, my wings and another person's in my party also came cold.

That's whatever. Sometimes cold wings happen. I understand that. 

Went to get a coke at the bar, because service for the (birthday.) party we were celebrating was so slow and delayed. 

Bar service was even worse. Whoever was working the bar was absolutely horrible tonight and is the main reason that I will not give this place anymore business. 

What I took from my visit is that the yelp review is correct, bad service when you consider what you pay for and is ONLY a fun time because of what they offer. Aside from that, horrible service and I would not recommend unless you have a decent sized group of people to spilt the tab with. 

Will not come again."}
{"text":"Plenty of pluses. Loved laser tag; one laser didn't work. 8 yr old enjoyed all the games. Good layout. Service was somewhat slow. Server Kyle did a good job. Food was good and the pricing was fair. The Arcade choices were substantial there was always an open game. Will be back with grandkids."}
{"text":"THINGS I LIKE: 

Service people are usually pretty friendly
Location
Fun atmosphere
Lots of thing to chose from
Full Bar

THINGS I DON'T LIKE:

Average price per arcade game = $1.65 (almost 3 times higher than the SAME GAME at other arcades)
Almost $20 for a PIZZA....yes, a PIZZA (mediocre at best)
Tall beers = $8+ after tip (WHAT??)
Blowing through $100 in an hour and a half"}
{"text":"We tried it out as it was closer to home. The average arcade game was $1.65 where as if you go to fat cats much cheaper and same games if not similar. No happy hour and the drinks/food isn't anything impressive. It just seems way over priced we will not be back as there are other options closer cheaper."}
{"text":"This place is great as far as the activities avalible but I'm writing this from the prospective of a parent.  I came because of some deal they promoted and come to find out at the register... they hide in the promo that there are hidden fees i.e. shoe rental, lazer tag fees ect. I also wouldn't come after dark as alcohol is served and last thing I want to a bunch of tweens liquored up in the next bowling lane next to my kid. Call me old fashioned but I pass and hit jump zone or something alomg those lines."}
{"text":"Horrible service, we had to stand in line for 10 minutes and there were at least 5 other staff just cleaning shoes. We got food, but never got anyone to come to us. We had to order from the bar, and when we got the food it was cold and horrible. Wouldn't ever go back. Staff wasn't even nice."}
{"text":"We had a blast! I loved this place! It's not bad pricing also. They offer many packages about 25$ for a full day of unlimited. So that is a great deal if you ask me. There are also cards you can add money for games and your tickets will go to the card. The laser tag cost is 9.95 a pers person if bought outside of your daily card.  We had great time as adults here. Pool, bowling, food. Although the food is bar for it's good and many many options for all. We will be back again.  One complaint when we played laser tag the young lady that was running it was rude, and kept telling at everyone. I get that it's not easy when you're dealing with kids but yelling is just not the way to go about it. Its clean and the rest rooms are clean. Games are about $1.65 a game and they have a good selection. I think they could use a few more games and the one game we played was $3.00 and my gun didn't work. Other than that good service at the front desk being we had never been they explained it all to us and we left in full understanding. He was kind as well. I reccomend. We will go back  again many times I'm sure"}
{"text":"Sorry but $88 for 3 people to bowl for 2 hours is just crazy.  Pints are $4.75 and soda is $3.25.  This is a glorified bowling alley.  The arcade games are crazy $1.95 to play one game of Space Invaders.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"Called and said less than 1 hr wait to bowl.   Would not take reservation by ohone.  Got there literally 7 minutes later and told 2 hr or longer wait.  Teenager behind counter thought this was hilarious.  Bathroom was a disaster. Very mismanaged.  Don't bother."}
{"text":"Finally something interesting for kids. Went there with my nephew and niece they had a lot of fun. A lot of things to do with family"}
{"text":"This place is pretty cool. My wife and I went out with some friends and we had a great time! They have laser tag, bowling, rope jungle gym, arcade, full bar, and pool table lounge. The only downfall is the lines are fairly long for the laser tag and rope jungle gym and you need tickets to reserve a timing...it gets kind of annoying. Place is clean and employees deliver great service! I'll be back if I am in the area on a weekend."}
{"text":"WOW. Do not waste your money and time coming here. The food is by far the worst I have ever seen and the prices are $$$. One small glass of soda is $3.25 and most of it is ice. It shows that they are squeezing their customers every penny so they can afford the fancy lights outside the building. A $30 game card got my daughter a lollipop and one nerds worth of tickets. The staff is unbelievably rude or not even present. Honestly uptown or D&B is way way better. Usually coming to a fun place like this u don't want the fun to end however we couldn't wait to leave."}
{"text":"Server was horrible. Didn't fill drinks. Forgot about our food. Food came out cold. Food wasn't even good. By the time we got our food we were so hungry we eat it anyway. Played video games. That was fun but games are $2 each to play one time. Way over priced."}
{"text":"Normally I'm not the type to write a review but there was no manager available at the time I asked and the website wouldn't let me write a private message longer than 500 letters... soooo here I am writing.

 We came to celebrate a birthday with a group of 10 adults... stood at the horrific bar for 34 minutes before any one of the slow as molasses bartenders even acknowledged us... again 34 MINUTES!!! Every seat at the bar top had a dirty glass or plate on it. Even the tables had plates and dirty dishes all over them... no manager, busser or extra hands in general were around to help the 2 bartenders that were getting destroyed on a Saturday night... I will probably never come back as it was my first time and waiting that long for a \"what do you want\" from some poorly trained and supported bartender left a bad taste in my mouth. We stayed hopeful we could turn it around and played some games and bowled but in my opinion it wasn't worth all the money we all spent."}
{"text":"It looks Very fun with plenty to do for the whole family, however, With football playoffs and open seating, they should figure out a way to not miss anyone trying to order or sit down for a drink. The wait for activities was a little over 3hrs. It was packed. 

We walked in, sat down, but someone in our party had to go and find someone to help us.....20 mins later. No warm introduction , nothing. She asked for our card prior to ordering....The food came fairly quickly...always pass on the spinach dip... That needs more attention than we did honestly."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to be when I'm bored. They have super awesome deals daily which is great if you wanna do everything they offer. There's so much to do here. Bowling, pool, arcade, high ropes, and laser tag. Not to mention the bar  they always have awesome music too. Great variety. Not too pricey either. The beer could be cheaper but hey, it's a bar right? Lol"}
{"text":"My coworkers and I went here for a holiday party. We went there early so there was really no one there. My team and I got to bowl and that was a lot of fun. The lanes were clean and so was the entire bowling area. Our waiter was really nice and prompt. The games were pretty expensive, but I guess there's nothing you can do about that, except not play. 

The food wasn't that great. Glorified fast food. I will not be coming back for the food. The food is a little overpriced for what you get and the taste, but when in Rome. You'll have fun, but don't expect too much."}
{"text":"Bowling, laser tag and the games were fun as expected. The service, however was not great. I consistently waited on employees to finish their conversations before acknowledging me."}
{"text":"This review comes from me stopping in at lunch time on a Saturday. 

I came in with no kids and wanted a burger and a beer. When you walk in you immediately notice the open space and loud music. There are kids running around everywhere. They have some video games and a bowling alley. The game area is not too extensive so don't come here thinking you are going to play video games all night, you will quickly run out of options. They do have 6 pool tables and a skeeball machine if you are into that.  They have some bowling lanes towards the back with videos playing on large screens. 

I headed to the bar where I asked for a kilt lifter and a menu. The music was so loud the bartender couldn't hear me so I repeated my ask. She then said something but I couldn't hear her so we went back and forth like that yelling at each other to put my beer order in. 

I get a menu and immediately notice this really is all bar food. They had a few hamburgers you could pick from. Some over priced appetizers and a bunch of pizza options. I paid around $20 for a beer and a hamburger. I got the food and it was average at best. Frozen thin patty and fries. 

My Opinion: 
If you have kids and want to bowl, this is probably the place. If you don't have kids and are just looking for some beer and food, I would say go somewhere else unless you find the bartender attractive and want to sit here and stare at her (she is pretty cute) since you won't be able to hold a conversation over the music. 

Overall I would say the \"other\" entertainment place is much better for kids and adults. So if you want to bowl, this is your place. For anything else, keep driving a few more miles and you will probably have a better experience."}
{"text":"Main event entertainment was so much fun! We went for our work team bonding :) we did the dynamic duo. It included 1hr and a half of bowling and our choice of another activity with a buffet of our choice! We chose the \"just for fun\". It included tacos, sliders, chips and pretzels! We made a good choice. Bowling was fun! The music was great! The costumer service was outstanding! I will for sure recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"Good bowling, but arcade is WAY OVERPRICED!

I can easily go to other arcades with more games and half the price. Not worth it at all."}
{"text":"Way Too Loud

It wasn't just my 40 year old ears that thought it was too loud, our 3 kids kept complaining it was too loud to enjoy the cool activities here.  We ended up leaving because of the noise after about an hour, which was really a shame because they have some great games and large screens to play on.   We asked the people working there about the noise and were told: \"you get used to it.\"  

I don't just mean it's regular-arcade-level-loud.  This place so so loud my 10 year old got a headache for the rest of the day and when I was laying down at night I noticed my ears were still ringing (from 6 hours ago!!) It's hearing-damaging-loud here.   We were frequently unable to understand what our kids were saying no matter how close we were to them. 

The laser tag area is fantastic but unfortunately b/c we were a small group the employees didn't bother to really explain how the guns worked or give us any instructions, so it was frustrating.  I'm sure when it's busier they probably take the time to explain things better, but we feel like wasted our money on laser tag, although the equipment and setup/course was high quality.  

So overall: good games, fun laser tag, but bring ear protection or even better convince the management to turn down the volume (especially for the sake of the employees.)   We are not planning on returning."}
{"text":"Save your time and go to Dave and Busters! I took my daughter to check it out over spring break. We went right when it opened up thinking that wouldn't be a problem. We were the only people eating at 11 am but to my surprise the server was confused with what we were ordering versus who ever was talking in his ear with the ear piece. Our food came out and I was disappointed. The parmesan chips are disgusting. The sliders were very over priced. My daughter had a pizza and it was just ok. I had ordered a margarita and they forgot it and then finally got it at the end of the meal. When I went to pay they didn't have change. Ridiculous! Then we went to play games-this is the only reason they get two stars, they had some new games that I have not seen in Dave and Busters but the rest of it was overpriced! I didnt bowl or check out laser tag. Not sure if I will go back to do so."}
{"text":"If you're coming here hoping to get good food, you won't. The food is absolutely disgusting here. It's like they hire people who have never cooked before. I love chicken Caesar salads and you'd think it's not that hard to make. It's absolutely awful here. My boyfriend ordered the garlic chicken wings and they were brought out covered with garlic chunks, I at first thought it was rice! Super gross. We couldn't even finish wings or the salad. I'd say the only decent thing here are the chicken tenders and the loaded tater tots. Aside from the bad food here, it is ridiculously overpriced along with most of the games. One of the photo booths cost $5. Choose somewhere else to stop and eat before you come here if you do."}
{"text":"Met friends down here on Saturday night for adults night out. We decided to eat dinner and then play some games for the evening. We set the bar area occupying some of the high tops And there were 7 of us. We ordered our drink , appetizers and dinner. We all went with the special that provided us $20.00 game cards for later.  When the food arrived all the steaks were cooked wrong, they promptly took them back to replace them. Well.... they remade all the steaks but two were still wrong. This happened two more times, finally after what seemed like hours which was probably it actually was, we finished dinner.  When our check arrived the manager completely compted all the food for our group and gave us  each an additional $20.00 game cards. They did what was right and made a bad situation better. The rest of the night was uneventful, other than adult game time. I will definitely come back due to the how the management recovered the evening."}
{"text":"Overall it was a fun night, beware of the fine print. All you can bowl and unlimited bowl are extremely different. But if you want to have a great time with laser tag, Nate was the man. He made it awesome. Will go play again as long as he is running it."}
{"text":"The establishment is clean, plenty of parking. The food is good, the beer is fresh however... Some of the staff are not fully trained well with advising customers on where to go for certain things. 

We ordered food at the bowling alley and the service was.ok.... The nachos we ordered were prepared wrong and sent back to the kitchen. The correct order was brought out fairly quickly. I asked our server for another beer. It took the bar or the server awhile for them to bring the beer out. The overall experience is ok but 3 stars is all I'm giving for today's experience at least."}
{"text":"This place was ridiculous. 4 hr wait for a lane for bowling. Could not even get a pager cus the wait was so long. You just had to go up and check if one is open. Next up the restaurant. We wanted a table for 6. They put your name down on some paper then don't ever call anyone or keep track. They told us to sit and wait not sure for what if they had 5 tables completely free and open. I got up to complain 10 minutes after after seeing a bunch of people being seated right away the girl had no clue what to even say to me. She knew it was one hot mess. We finally get sat down and not waitress til 10 minutes later. Drinks and food took forever. Every single thing was underrated and over priced. Took 30 minutes to even get bill and for them to close it out. Terrible. To top it off we went to claim our prizes for the tickets and they denied my son who is 5 a 5 ticket worth Swedish fish! After offering them a dollar to just sell us one, they still refused! We told the manager and he stated it was the rules. Wow. We got our money back after waiting for 3 hrs for a bowling lane that never happened. A whole Saturday afternoon/evening wasted."}
{"text":"Such a fun place I loved it! Can't wait to go back!
We went there as a team building event told my kids about it and they have to check it out! So worth the money!"}
{"text":"The play pass is a joke!!!!  In the span of 4 hours we could only do the laser tag twice and the ropes course once. Although they try to sell you on that you get \"unlimited\" but it is really not. You have to wait in line to get a time slot to do the activities and then what until that time, which could be an hour or two later. Unfortunately we couldn't even do the bowling because of a 3 hour wait until that was available. In my opinion, this was a waste of time and money. I don't ever plan on returning."}
{"text":"Wow main event literally has the worst service I have ever experienced. We had to grab our own drinks from the drink well and our own silverware. While the deals are awesome and the experience is fun, the service sucks and I won't ever come hungry! I ordered a side salad... how about some salad with your dish of croutons. I asked for ranch dressing and the salad came dressed with a side of lettuce and not with ranch. This place could be a total hang out.. instead you only experience sub par service!"}
{"text":"Great vibe. Good entertainment for the whole family. I wod recommend anyone to try this place. Not to expensive either!"}
{"text":"Took my sales team here for a group outing. I was looking for a fun, affordable outing so we could do some bonding and have some laughs out of the office. We had a blast! After an epic game of laser tag we hit the gravity ropes, played some pool and shuffle board, had pizza and ended the night with a very competitive round of bowling.  I have done all kinds of team outings, from sporting events to dinners to bar crawls, and this was def my favorite. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Started out okay, games are a Lil expensive but okay on fun. Maybe 6 out of ten on worth playing. Service is shitty, only teen kids serving and never around to take orders. If you do the Monday Funday bracelet it is not as unlimited as you think. You only have the spot for an hour then they kick you off. It's unlimited to a sense that if you want to spend hours in line you can do that for an unlimited time. Overall okay but after the service this place sucks. Maybe if the service wasn't so bad id recommend this place to someone else. If your going for the bar and a few games this place is okay other than that try somewhere else."}
{"text":"We had a large Party of 15. It was awesome, yes it's bit overpriced but overall the food was great.  Games were awesome! I recommend to go in large groups!
We had all day passes. 

The only problem I had was with a male server who served the bowling alley area. He just kept talking to his group of friends, didn't notice we left. (We had unlimited soft drinks until 8:30pm), and went to play Lazer tag. When we came out of Lazer tag,  he was quick to give me the tab. My sister-in-law explained to him that we had unlimited soft drinks until 8:30. 
Instead of him, resolving it by looking at our package deal receipt, he quickly called the manager. He was adamant that we paid.
The manager comes over checks passes and says yeah they're good.
Jerk server respond with \"my bad\" and walks away. What an a-hole. 
And the manager apologized for him."}
{"text":"This is a good place for kids to have fun. Adults can have fun playing pool or bowling too but this is geared more towards kids, in my opinion. I found out that if you show up early your kids can play laser tag, bowl, or use the gravity ropes all day long for pretty cheap. It's worth checking out."}
{"text":"The experience I had here was TERRIBLE! My mother in law paid $180 for our family to do UNLIMITED bowling. We got the wristbands and everything. Then after one hour they kick us off because other people are on a \"waiting list\" to  bowl. The staff did NOT say that would happen if there was a waiting list. I don't care, my mother in law just paid $180 for ONE flipping hour! We tried to speak to one of the  managers, Jim. But he just wrote it off like it was no big deal and got in my cousin's face when he was asking about us being kicked out. He LITERALLY got up in his face. Jim's behavior was very rude and unprofessional. He should be fired in my opinion.  Don't waste your time or money with this place. They'll just screw you over! It was pitiful and not to mention very few lanes, crappy set up!"}
{"text":"Biggest rip off in arcade history never will I go again not only do the employees just stand around with lines the stuff you get for your tickets is just plain garbage!"}
{"text":"First off, we went to Main Event for my son's birthday celebration and he loved it!
Food: we ordered pizza (the largest pizza size runs about 16.99) and salad and waited for about 30 minutes for our order. My 2 year old accidentally knocked over one pizza and our waitress was soo kind! She quickly got us another order of the pizza that had dropped. 
Facility: very spacious and clean. The music is really really loud but it doesn't bother my children. The atmosphere is somewhat dark but there are tons of lights from the arcade and activities. 
Restrooms: There are many stalls and it is always clean when we need to use the facility. There is a diaper changing station but they always run out of the lining, so i just use the paper towels. 
We have yet to try the gravity and bowling, so we will definitely try that next time."}
{"text":"Employees are the rudest I've ever dealt with!!!!! After we spent $150 we found out the daily passes are timed and waiting for bowling, ropes, and laser tag was hours. They fail to tell you there's 1.5hr limit when bowling. When you have a group of 8, that's a game and a half."}
{"text":"The service here really sucks , just like the rest of  the reviews say . It took forever to get a drink at the table . I feel bad that there was only one server working our area on a Friday night . Poor kid looked overwhelmed . What's even more irritating is that the  bar manager walked up to make sure everything was ok , we mentioned it taking a while and instead of taking our order she said your server is on his way , and he was...  about 15 minutes later . I normally wouldn't bother posting a review , but the fact is my girlfriend and I came for a night of fun and entertainment , and to have poor service at a place that is already expensive is disappointing . 

10:23PM . Been here for about an hour , nacho cheese was cold, asked for extra salsa , we were done by the time server came back.  I don't think we're going to go to the gaming area because we've already been here so long . And yea , I actually went back to add more to this poor experience ."}
{"text":"This place is nice but way to expensive.  It's so hard to find fun indoors without it costing an arm and a leg."}
{"text":"The company I work for held a bowling party at Main Event back in March for our local team.

It was a great way to spend a Friday night and get some team building in! 

3 hours of bowling? Hooyah!

Clean lanes, prompt service from the servers and the beers were pretty affordable. Pre-tip, I think I walked out paying $10 and change for two GIANT steins of Blue Moon.

While we had to pay for our own boozy beverages, part of the package deal was a giant spread of their food. 

The food, like Leonor C. mentioned, was basically \"churched up\" fast food. Or staples from your grocery store's freezer aisle. Think Foster Farm's Boneless Buffalo Wings, T.G.I. Friday's heat up in the microwave or oven queso, etc., you get the idea.

Can't comment on the games, laser tag or any other offerings.

I would definitely come back for group events or a party, but think we'll stick to Brunswick or AMF facilities as it's clear from the other reviews that you're paying for atmosphere at Main Event."}
{"text":"I threw up from the natchos. The small pizza was horrifying, the sodas costs what a beer should. The games are over priced, the prizes required too many tickets, the games produced very few tickets, Lazer tag wasn't so bad but my son's gun didn't work. The funnest area in the place is the interactive projection game that's on the ground in front of the bowling area. The bowling wasn't too bad but it doesn't matter because the food was so terrible. I will never go back. Couple nice employees, the rest look like they were hating life and extremely short with answers. If anyone from the establishment even thinks about responding to this for damage control, don't bother. I don't want to hear it."}
{"text":"This was our second visit with our family. We reserved a bowling lane online and check in was really quick. Once we got to the bowling lane, the woman that escorted us asked if we'd like a server. We said yes, my kids were starving. We signed in and took pictures. 15 minutes had gone by, still no server. I went to the employees that were just standing around and asked for a server. Finally someone came. We ordered drinks, time passed, she brought drinks over with literally two ice cubes in them. We ordered food. Food came when our one hour session was almost over, but not together. Everything came out at least 15 minutes apart. We had just received our last item once the hour was over, of course, it was my kids food. The waitress didn't refill drinks, I kept walking over to the pizza place to get refills on our glass cups. If you like to wait on your family and not be able to bowl, this is the place. We will try somewhere else next time."}
{"text":"I like this place.  Things to do for everyone.  Arcade, laser tag, bowling, billiards, shuffleboard, and some type of suspension playground.  Plus food and bar. Only downside of course is the price so purchase the food and game combos.

Sirloin Steak, calamari, and fries.  I ordered the steak medium but it was still tough.  I ate it anyway, I was hungry.  Fries were good too and the calamari was one of the best I ever tasted.

Wife and son got the bacon cheddar burger and it got mopped up.  Daughter got the pizza and she liked it.  A bunch of sausage and pepperoni.

Good family spot.  Reward the kids for being our kids!!!"}
{"text":"If I could do no stars, I would. Terrible food. Terrible staff. Manager did not care about any issues. Almost every member of staff had an attitude. We waited 20+ minutes for drinks and they forgot half of our food. When we could ask for refills after waiting 10+ minutes the server would get an attitude. We had to ask multiple times for anything we needed that they kept forgetting. Never going back. Maddie was the worst. A new server ended up taking over named Eric and he was attentive and nice."}
{"text":"What a great addition to Gilbert!  Bowling, Lazor tag, Ropes course, pool tables and tons of Arcades.  There is something for everyone.  The food is tasty too."}
{"text":"My kids loved Main Event...until today.  Sunday football and bowling WOULD be awesome. Unfortunately, Main Event can't afford the expense of NFL Sunday Ticket. Had to give up on bowling and take the kids to the sports bar to see their team play. Go Broncos, Boo Main Event!"}
{"text":"My other half and I went at 10:15am on a weekday and got the discounted \"enter by 10:30am\" day pass which was good for unlimited bowling, billiards, laser tag, and shuffleboard until 5pm.  We had looked at their website quite a bit and were surprised to have to pay extra for bowling shoe rental (about $4).  I have a disability and cannot wear normal shoes; I didn't think about the bowling shoe issue until I got there.  However, the clerk handled it really well and said that I didn't have to wear bowling shoes since I was physically unable to do so and did not charge me, either.  That was a relief since I was worried that I would be barred from the bowling alley.  I don't know if she was specifically trained to handle this situation, or did some quick thinking on her own, but either way she displayed quick thinking in handling it.  

We started with one hour of bowling upstairs.  We were the only ones up there.  There are computer kiosks at each lane at which you can customize your lane (bumpers or not) and what types of animations they play on your screen (all sorts of weird cartoon characters dance around and announce your score).  One hour was enough to play three games, without any dinking around.  We had fun.  We thought we'd be overwhelmed by the TVs EVERYWHERE but the absolute of people helped counteract that overstimulation.  Also because the TVs were playing different things it was easier to visually mute it (ignore it).  Signs said that a la cart, bowling is $22 per hour.

Next we went downstairs and got billiards stuff from the bartender and played a quick game.  I had a phone meeting scheduled, and we asked if we were allowed to leave and come back, and were told that we could.  I have no idea what the official policy actually is, but it worked well for us.  We went out and I did my call while my husband ran some errands in the area.  We came back an hour later and asked how the laser tag works.  It is in 15 minute units and the bowling clerk prints you a \"boarding pass.\"  She told us to appear at the laser tag entrance 5 minutes prior to our start time, which we did.  And waited.  And waited, waited, waited.  After our start time passed, my other half when back to the bowling clerk, and apparently there was some sort of staffing problem.  She printed us boarding passes for 3 more time slots.  After a while four little kids appeared with boarding passes and a staff member showed up.  The kids also had 3 time slots, we we played 3 games with the kids.  The staff member had us play a free-for-all, then in teams, then another free-for-all.  I was terrible at it, but we got all sweaty from the game, even though you are not allowed to run.  You sure can WALK fast!  And dart behind the various obstacles.  Signs said that a la carte, laser tag is $7 per person per game.  

Then we booked our same upstairs bowling lane for another hour.  Again we were the only players upstairs, although the downstairs family-friendly bowling area was hoppin'.  Pretty quickly we realized that our arms and hands were tired from all the bowling, and our skill was dropping.  This would be the down-side of unlimited bowling!  I convinced my other half that for our sixth and final game of the day to put the bumpers up and we rolled with our left hands!  That was fun!  

We wanted to play shuffleboard, which, for the record, is a table-top version, not the kind you scoot the disks on the floor, but it was mobbed with kids.  We walked around the arcade for awhile, looking but not playing the games.  I know nothing about arcades, but there is some cool stuff in there, like Guitar Hero, a piano-playing game, a Mario sports game, a jumping game, air hockey, basketball, football, skeeball, and an Asian version of DDR (dance dance revolution).  I am all about low-impact movement, and it looks like an enticing play to play.  We saw a sign that said they have unlimited arcade games on Monday nights for $10.95.  We asked about this and were told that it's true, but it doesn't include the grabber machines and you don't get points to earn the prizes.  Nevertheless, it still sounds like it would be a good value and a fun way to try out a lot of different games.

Shuffleboard was still mobbed with kids and we decided to leave around 4pm, not having the burning desire to suck every last penny and minute out of our passes.  We both had a lot of fun and felt great, having been mildly active for much of the day, using our bodies and brains in ways that are different from our normal.  We foresee going back to try the Monday night arcade special.  If we are in town longer than another month, I could see going back for another day time session.  

We did not try any food or beverages inside Main Event.

They did not get the 5th star because of the laser tag hassle (we waited about 20 minutes from the our report time) & having only one shuffleboard table (there is SOoooooo much dining seating they could easily tuck another one or two in somewhere)."}
{"text":"Good times. I went here with my work for a holiday party. There was almost no one there which is nice when you want to do whatever you want without a wait.  The bowling alley is the highlight of this place. There are many lanes.  They have the newest arcade games on the market and they were pretty cool. The games were cool , but too damn expensive. It was about $1.25 on average for every game there which is pretty ridiculous. I can see paying that on the newer games, but even the timeless classics like basketball were that price.  The food is shit. A friend got the pizza and it was terrible.  Hamburgers were gross. I got a salad. Wait, actually I got dressing with a side of lettuce. Nasty. Everyone I was with tried something different and not one person liked anything they got practically. This place is a cool concept, but I wouldn't come back. Dave and Buster's is way better if I wanted to go to a place like this again."}
{"text":"I was here for a birthday party. We all wandered off, but a group of us sat on the tables in the dining area, and 30 minutes passed by. During this whole time, the bartender looked at us multiple times but did not choose to ask someone to serve us. We finally decided to ask someone for help.. Like a messenger, she went to the bartender and came back and stated, \"Sorry, our kitchen closes at 11.\" Please keep in mind that she said this at 10:40, after sitting there since 10:10 with absolutely no one helping us. Awesome music and overall fun.. the downside was the subpar dining service."}
{"text":"Super fun! But sooooo expensive! 
I love the concept though. It's hours of entertainment & food under one roof! Be prepared big bucks for bowling but it's the coolest I've seen & so interactive-- my kids LOVED the selfies on the screen! The games are about 1.65/ 1.95 EACH! Laser tag, obstacle course... so fun! But due to cost it's an annual (every couple of years) place to visit!"}
{"text":"This is a review of when I visited Main Event towards the end of May. First, it's a nice place, no doubt, clean, as it should be as it's a new place. But be prepared to bring a bunch of money, you'll need it. My son and I bowled for an hour, with 2 shoe rentals, $31.80 for the hour. It was fun, the lanes are great, with great animations. 
After bowling we hit the arcade side. I bought a card for $20, thought it would be enough for a little while for both of us, but mostly him. I was so wrong! Every game is over $1 each, even for a video game that ends quickly. In total, $66 for games. And this was gone in a little over an hour. If you have a couple kids, and want to stay more than an hour, bring at least $100. It's a nice place, but expensive. If you want games, go to Castles and Coasters, it'll be cheaper."}
{"text":"New, fun, exciting, and very over-priced.  We came to bowl but there was an hour long wait to get a lane (this was noon on Friday, which seemed an odd time to be so busy, but it is summer time....).   So, we decided to do the arcade instead.  That was an expensive decision.  We bought the $25 dollar card, which came with an $8 bonus credit, but the card itself costs $1, so it was $26 for $33.  I thought that would last a while for myself and my six year old, but it was shocked to see that each and every game costs at least $1.65.  This includes games that I have played at another nearby entertainment center for $0.50.  

I don't plan to come back."}
{"text":"We decided to take advantage of one of the summer specials on Monday night. All you can play laser tag, bowling, billboards and ropes for 9.95 from 4-12. We experienced very little wait time, most times no wait at all. Our 5 teenagers loved it and our 3year old got a card for 9.95 all the video games she could play. Of course you don't get tickets but since she is so young she didn't even realize. We also ate pizza at the pizza place. I would rate it good. Better than Peter Piper. I liked the atmosphere here on a Monday, not too many loud adults like you get at Dave and Busters.  Would go back on a weekday for sure!!"}
{"text":"My family has so much fun every time we go to main event. A variety of games, laser tag, bowling etc. we just came from a birthday party and our server Mario was the life of our party. Speedy service with great humor. He made our experience exceptional."}
{"text":"Ok, so truthfully I was not really excited to go here. I thought it was going to be like all the other \"kid entertainment places.\" But I was so wrong! I loved the atmosphere. The employees make sure you are doing ok throughout your visit. We bowled, which was amazing. We also played some arcade games. I also won, not one, but two, beanie baby boos for my little girl. (The real ones, not some cheap stuffed animals. They were the big ones $$$) My family is already planning our next trip here  Definitely worth every penny we spent."}
{"text":"We paid for bowling and the arcade. We bowled first and ordered food. The employee that was supposed to be taking orders ignored us the entire hour we were there. We had to walk back and forth to the bar and to order our food which was very cold. This is my third time here and all other experiences were ok but we won't be back after this horrible experience."}
{"text":"Where do I begin. Granted this facility is still working out its bugs. With that being said, our two and a half hour wait turned into only 45 minutes! After getting our place on the bowling list we naturally went to grab a drink. After 15 minutes of waiting for a server we finally got our drinks. We've been asked a team member how do we get a card to play in the Arcade, he advised that we would need to stand in the same line to reserve a bowling lane. The bowling Lane reservation line was to the door. So we walked around and found out that there is a card machine behind the bowling reservation desk where you can purchase a card and load it to play games. Like I said the wait was only 45 minutes before we got our lane. It took us over a half an hour to get a server after asking numerous team members. After placing our order another 20 minutes went by and we got our drinks and our food at the same time. I ordered their veggie stack with the bread on the side. My first bite felt like I bit into a salt ball. Thinking it was just the first bite I mixed everything around but that didn't help. I brought it back to our server letting her know what had happened and she had asked if I wanted them to remake it but having worked for a restaurant in the past I said no. Getting our bill I noticed that the veggie stack was still on there after our server told me that she would get it take it off. We had issues with our frames not resetting but they did credit us extra time. Overall this was a horrible experience with extremely unorganized team members. I doubt we will be returning in the near future if at all."}
{"text":"Why? Why would you put this in front of someone? I am trying to remember what I did to offend you, but I am coming up blank. Maybe that's because we never met. 
So you made this \"food\" for a stranger. This behavior fits the current psychiatric diagnosis of sociopathic.
I have no further words for something this bad."}
{"text":"This is the third year now we have had our office Christmas party at the Main Event. We reserved three lanes for bowling and had them cater our lunch. Decent food, attentive service, with pleasant, accommodating personnel. They let us stay for our white elephant gift exchange. I expect my employees will again vote next year to return for our 2017 party.
It cost us about $400 for 12 people, which I thought was reasonable."}
{"text":"Horrible, terrible service.   Reserved and prepaid for 4 lanes for a bday get together.   Did not see a server for an hour despite six different  members of the party asking employees if we could order drinks and food.   The staff kept saying they would send some one right over.   Never happened.   Never going there again."}
{"text":"I had a lot of fun here.  I only did the bowling but there is a lot more to do here.  The bowling had a nice and fun touch where it takes a few pictures of your face and then uses it to make funny clips after each frame. A great place to have fun with the family."}
{"text":"Came here with nieces for spring break fun..boy is this place overpriced. 
It was relatively slow, so there was plenty of open lanes and the wait time for laser tag was short. 
We did not try any of the food offerings, we had plans after. The weird thing is they let you bowl for an hour at a time and when you finish your first game, you get into a second game, but don't have a chance to finish it. 
My advice, save your money and go to Peter Piper Pizza, it's cheaper and just as fun for the kids."}
{"text":"Full of entertainment.  Not cheap though , especially when hosting a party of four. Children always look forward to the great selection of video games and the quickly loadable gaming cards is a big plus for the kids."}
{"text":"It's tough finding things to do with a nine and eleven year old, but we can all agree on bowling.  Main Event has always proven to be a good time but last weekend, we walked in to a four hour wait just to BOWL.  We figured they were busy and it was a fluke so today, we called to try to make a reservation.  Apparently, you can only reserve a lane 48 hours in advance.  They said there might be a wait but it shouldn't be very long.  When we arrived, we were told we'd have to wait an HOUR AND A HALF for a lane even though there were at least six lanes open that we were told had been reserved for parties that weren't even there.  Screw that.  We will not be back."}
{"text":"Awful. Read the bad reviews because it's the truth. Horrible customer service. Who hired all these people? They don't care about you, they ignore you, unfriendly atmosphere. The way they treat you makes the whole experience terrible. Not worth going. Such a shame for a nice place. If the employees don't change their awful ways i don't see why anyone would ever go back! Read all your reviews and change! People pay to have fun, not to have a bad time."}
{"text":"Horrible food and the entire place is extremely overpriced. I would not recommend.  Save your money."}
{"text":"My son celebrated his birthday here last week. It was a FABULOUS experience. The party planner kept all 14 of our party happy, fed and onto their next activity. There are choices of party packages with several options for food and activities. This was the best party place we have been to in the last 10 years. Food was delicious not at all cardboard pizza that you typically get. Worth every penny!"}
{"text":"The first impression I got when I walked in was that it was very different and neat and kind of like a smaller Dave and Busters. My family and I ordered food that was really tasty and priced reasonably, but waited quite a while for. While we waited we went and tried out the arcade games. They were really over priced and one of the card collectors for a certain game didn't even work. It wasn't a real biggy as one of the employees was fast to help and fix it. Another thing I was not impressed with at all was when we went to get prizes with our tickets and the employees were messing around with each other playing a game or something like that while we waited for them to help us. I guess you could say there was definitely more negatives than positives, but I didn't have a terrible time and might go back and try the sky walk and laser tag!"}
{"text":"Let's see where do we start? How about with the absolute horrible service at the bar. Check that - the entire place had horrible service. It was a chore to be acknowledged at the bar, our server never came after repeated requests, and there were bar glasses and food all over the pool table area. No one picked up after any of the tables when people left. The pole tables and pool sticks were disgusting and greasy everything was a mess. Everything was expensive as hell too. Also while the bar was getting \"slammed\" the manager is just standing around in the kitchen not doing shit. Don't come here. Horrible service and not worth the money or the wait."}
{"text":"We went here yesterday for the first, and last time. The customer service is absolutely inexcusable. When you first walk in there's a kind gentleman to greet you and that's where the courtesy ends. I have never seen such a disinterested staff. It was as if they were all there against their will. They were poorly trained, they had no customer service skills, and they all just.. Sucked. But that is what confuses me. How can every single one of them be so horrible? Is it the training, the manager, the person who hires them? Looking back, I think maybe it is just the fact that this place is so poorly organized and they feel the stress of the confusion just as we customers did. You see, first we went to one counter to buy a pass.  Then we took that over to an intriguing looking rope course. We get in line for the ropes course and when we get to the front the kid working tells us that we first have to check in at the counter in the room where the kids redeem their prize tickets. So after we waited 20 minutes for all these kids to decide what they wanted to get with their tickets, it's finally our turn to say hey we bought this pass and we're going to go on this ride now is that okay with you? And the girl says sure I can get you on in about 40 minutes. What the hell? There was no one on the course. You buy these passes in blocks of time so if there's a 40 minute wait, I'm only gonna get on once anyway. Side note re: paying in blocks of time- prepay for 3 hours, 5 hours, I'll do that, but to just say you can only pay for up until 4:00 and yet charge me the full price when I come in at 3:00, makes your already high prices highway robbery. Video games look great, they really do they have some brand new state-of-the-art fun looking game but here's the kicker- one game costs $1.63 to play. Another is $1.88. Why not make them one price? And why so expensive??? It was infuriating. I don't know how the food was because my drink was $3.19 and I was done giving them my money. 
Overall, the rope course looked kind of neat but this place had not one other redeeming quality and I see no reason to return."}
{"text":"The location is great and the place is clean and beautiful, however they are expensive and the service isn't great.  Very very slow and the managers have attitude.  There are other places in the area to bowl and have fun that I'd rather spend my money at."}
{"text":"No complaints. My friends and little nephews had a blast! We did arcades, laser tag ($7 per person) and gravity ropes ($7 per person). If you're going to come to main event, definitely try the gravity ropes! Super fun!

Also, the staff is friendly. They let us have a few laser tag games for free!"}
{"text":"First off I've read most of the reviews I would say their accurate reviews. I took my family to this establishment to enjoy some pizza & bowling on a Thursday (2/25). We took their $5 Super Bowling promo which allows you to play multiple games up to midnight on valid day of purchase only. Lane time limitations for one hour was in effect & it was ridiculous. We started to play, ordered food & drinks by the time our food arrived as we were getting ready to eat our 1 hr was already up, we got told to move because of bowling lane availability was full & busy. So we had to move all our food, drinks to another area away from the bowling area & finish eating our food. If you have family that likes to enjoy pizza/wings & drinks while bowling this place is not for you during lane time limitations. No consistency on their 1 hr limitations, I've noticed some lanes played beyond 1 hour limit putting in multiple games which I wish ours was like that. The wait list was backed up for hrs afterwards so we only got 1 game out of that promo."}
{"text":"Great place! For four people we spent under $100 that got us all bowling, laser tag, gravity rope course, loaded fries, and some arcade games. We were there at least 3 hours so was a great value. We had to wait a long time for a bowling lane to open but we kept busy with laser tag and games so it wasn't a big deal even though we mostly wanted to bowl. It's nice that they give you a buzzer that goes off when your bowling lane is ready. Customer service is lacking though. Employees seem inattentive especially in the bowling area. Arcade games are pricey in my opinion. Despite that will definitely be back to have some fun!"}
{"text":"I always pass by this place and finally walked in to check it out. I got a 35$ game card which came with an extra ten bucks. That lasted my friend and I two hours of play time. My favorite was the 3d shooting zombies game. It's pretty intense. The game comes with 3d glasses but one of the glasses were broken and cracked. I hope that gets fixed soon. 

Another game that's pretty cool was the battle royale pacman game! It gets pretty intense with four players.

I also love the esthetic of this place. The bowling balls were all color coordinated ad gives the place a really nice contemporary feel."}
{"text":"I was a first time customer at this establishment on Sunday, April 8. It was my nieces 19th birthday celebration and she wanted to go bowling. So we came to this location. Initially, the place looked great. It was clean and a nice facility. It was when I had to interact with staff from getting my shoes, to requesting a server to come to our lane where we were bowling numerous numerous times and being IGNORED that I was immediately turned off. Even the bartenders at the bar were rude and behaved as through they didn't want to be there. We had 1 server who was actually professional, friendly, helpful and attentive. Not sure how this business trains their employees or what the environment is here but there appeared to be a lot of unhappy employees who had no interest in tending to customers. At least this is how I felt. But rather than complain I let it be as we were there celebrating a great occasion. I told my family and friends to not ever go to this place unless you want to be ignored and not tended too. Personally, it's ridiculous considering the amount of money they charge for their bowling lanes, food and drink. I'd expect better customer service. But lesson learned, I will never go back to this place again. I'll stick to bowling alleys where the prices are more reasonable and staff are better equipped to tend to its patrons. I may go ahead and submit a letter of concern to the district manager of this place as it's not right to be treated as such. So should you patronize this location and establishment - BEWARE!"}
{"text":"I'm giving them a four star rating for how fun and clean this place was.  We had a birthday party here last week and the bowling for the kids was so much fun ... add on the arcade games (a little too pricey) and even more fun!! Pricing of the birthday party was very reasonable and priced lower than most places around the valley.  Food was delicious and included in the price of the party.  I don't understand what the point of a party host is when she really only served drinks and handed out food ... not really any interaction with the kids other than that.  I was quite bothered that when I paid for the party I was told by an employee that the service charge (which was just under $25) was not a tip, because they split it with cooks and dishwashers, and that I would need to head over to the ATM to tip!! Excuse me, but I have done many birthday parties for my kids all over the valley and have never been charged a service charge, let alone still expected and told, to tip cash on top of that. Disappointing and probably won't have a party there again but will be back to have some bowling and arcade fun with family and friends!!"}
{"text":"I think the Main Event has a lot of potential. It just recently opened so I didn't expect it to be crazy packed, but there was a decent amount of people there. I love the bowling here! It has a classy Lucky Strike kind of feel with a full menu and bar. The system allows you to take a selfie for your name and score and its very interactive giving interesting player stats throughout the game. Our server was incredibly nice and friendly, apparently she had been working a double shift, but she was so upbeat- you would never be able to tell. We ordered the chicken quesadilla, 2 orderes of garlic fries and onion rings. It was all yummy. The onion rings were more like onion straws - which I prefer and the fries had just the right amount of garlic. We each paid for the all you can play bowling, laser tag, climbing etc wristband which was around $17 and worth it. I was dying laughing from playing laser tag with my friends and a bunch of strangers. I found out later that all of my team was hiding out upstairs, which explains why I was getting crazy shot up by the other team downstairs. They have an interesting harness system that allows you to do tightrope walking and other crazy obstacles over the arcade. The arcade could definitely use more games and I didn;t get to play billiards but I will try next time! Overall, it was a fun night! I hope this place can compete with Dave and Buster's, I would say it's location is limiting since it randomly placed next to the IKEA deep in Tempe."}
{"text":"We were sitting in the food area for 25 minutes before we were able to finally get someone's attention (despite multiple attempts to flag someone down). He said he had to go run a card and then he'd be back. When he came back around he went and helped two other tables that JUST sat down. Got our food, ate, and waited 15 minutes to ask for our check. Took another 10 minutes before he brought it. Then my friend spent $10 playing a game that wound up not loading the credits to her card despite multiple wins and also once took money without spitting out the coins to play. She told a guy who offered to comp her a play. When we replied that the tickets didn't load he asked, \"How do you know?\" with an attitude. Yeah, we'd checked the balance, so we knew. When we asked what the point of comping a play was if those tickets didn't load, he said, \"I don't know,\" and walked away. He should have given her another card or maybe told someone the machine needed a repair. And we checked again 20 minutes later and the tickets still weren't added so it wasn't that it took time to  load. There was a two hour wait for bowling. Overall, pretty lackluster experience."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Laser tag, bowling, games, pool. I liked it a lot I wanna go again soon, and the food is really good too"}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever! Jason the manager is a joke! He is rude and unjust! I had a good experience until i was overcharged and the manager did nothing about it. DO NOT GO HERE!"}
{"text":"Very expensive on Saturdays. $8 per half hour for pool. $34 for bowling, $4 for each shoe, arcade games are from $1 and up. It was shiny but for the price we can get this stuff elsewhere."}
{"text":"Update 12/18/17

Lowered my stars to one because of a bad return experience. 

1. Bar staff is well trained to ignore you or give you the bare minimum in attention. Rudest bartenders I've encountered in a long time. Total turn off.
2. Playing pool - don't expect a server to check up on you to see if you'd like more drinks or food. Go stand at the bar and hope one of the bartenders graces you with their time.
3. Appetizers were terrible. Pretzel came with \"cheese dip\" that was more like yellow water. French fries were tasteless and cold.
4. After visiting multiple times and playing free pool (see review below) I was hit with $15 for pool on my tab. When I questioned this, the nitwit bartender argued with me telling me that I was \"wrong.\" 
5. Talked to the manager who told me they had \"problems\" with previous bar staff letting people play pool and that I was \"lucky\" I wasn't charged and those employees were gone. WTH? He offered some \"video game tokens\" to compensate me. I declined. 

Over all ... I won't go back. It's loud and over priced and the food is below average.

This place is a giant leech on your wallet and gives very little in return. For video games, go to Dave n Busters. For pool, go to Avondale lanes.
 

Background: Adult, no children but have come here twice with a friend and her 11 year old. We haven't bowled, so no info on that. Looks like a nice area - not old school bowling like the one in Avondale.

Pros:
Not so large you can't let an older child go explore safely.
Lounge area with free pool tables and some decent beer selections
Get on their email list for specials
Monday night all you can play for $10 is the best option
Varied menu in the lounge but food is average at best
Pork tacos on appetizers is pretty good. Avoid the tater tot pile of grease.
Did I mention free pool for adults while the kids are off playing? Nice touch considering a tab with 4 beers, 3 appetizers and sliders for the kid was about $70.
Pre-teen boy loved laser tag.
Several air hockey tables
Nice mix of music for everyone
Servers in the bar area have been nice and helpful.

Cons:
Overpriced on everything not on special. Night time pricing for a SINGLE game of laser tag is nearly $7. WTH?
Gravity ropes might be fun for younger kids, but seems stupid to me.
First visit music was soo soo loud. Second they might have turned it down a bit. Employees must go deaf quickly.
Video games were okay and pushing $2 a play on most. 
Staff at counter could be a bit more helpful. I stood around while 4 of them chatted and two made eye contact with me and then continued to ignore me. 
Food is not the greatest. It's more like something you get because you're there for other reasons. For all the glitzy menus, they should spend more time making good food. I'd put this on par with mid-level hotel food."}
{"text":"Worst night out ever! Waited for lanes more than we bowled. Waited an hour and a half for a lane when there were 6-8 lanes open. You're allowed one hour bowling at a time and it doesn't allow you to finish your game. Manager yelled at me when I asked him why there was such a long waiting time when there were 6-8 lanes open. Manager also put bowling balls away, including the one I was using, while we were still bowling. We will never go back to this place!"}
{"text":"Been here three times and keep hoping for better, but alas they are consistently bad service in every area.  And everything is over-priced!  Be prepared to spend a fortune for a night out with the family."}
{"text":"As a last minute birthday celebration for a good friend's daughter (23 years old) 2 lanes were reserved to accommodate family and friends. Our party size was going to grow in numbers at some point as the night went on but the staff and crew were all about making sure we had a good time. It was an all age event and you know kids can't wait to play games and bowl. 

Bowling was 1st on deck and I have to point out that our server at the lanes was the reason I'm giving Main Event 5 + 1 stars!! We had about 5 kids (all under 9) show up at different times and he went out of his way to get the kids signed up on the bowling lane and helped to take pictures. If you've ever been, the great thing about the TV's is that they take 3 pictures of you to incorporate into the monitors with videos regarding your results when you bowl. While we as adults were trying to get situated and organized, our server Mario had a great connect with the kids that went beyond any of our expectations. In addition to the kids, he was great with getting orders, remembering the little details and recommending items and purchases that better suited us as a group. 

Plenty of bowling and games throughout the evening and even the birthday girl and her friends had a good time. Sure Snapchat was in full effect, but they had a blast hanging out and playing games. When we needed to extend our lane usage for another 1 hour (or 2), each time we approached the staff they would work to make our experience memorable and that was fantastic. Even one of the managers, Roccio,  really stood out and I want to thank her as well for making the experience such a great one my kids. 

Food was good from the chicken tenders, burgers, sample platters and surprisingly, the kids mac and cheese. If you have a card from a previous visit make sure to bring it and consolidate it with any of your other cards you pick up. Check out the menu specials where you can get a $20/40 fun card in addition to ordering certain items on the menu at a discount. Laser Tag was great (managed to get in 2 games myself) with only a short wait. Just prepare yourself to be slightly overwhelmed with the prize room as they have tons of items. If you got a kid, plan for 15 mins as they become indecisive thanx to all the goodies they have in the store. 

Been here for team builders, but I have to admit, I had more fun with family and friends and will consider returning again in the near future."}
{"text":"Rocking start!

Here for the opening event for Main Event in Avondale. Excellent place for family fun. 

Options for fun:
-Bowling
-Gravity ropes course
-Laser Tag
-Arcade
-Pool

Super friendly staff and the food is actually top-level."}
{"text":"My company had a team-building event here. The service, food, and drinks were great. 

We had a great time bowling and playing laser tag. The bowling area is very clean, and we liked the option to have our pictures on the screen for each person's turn. 

The laser tag area was larger than I expected. We probably looked ridiculous to the kids playing in there, but we loved it."}
{"text":"I will have to say my i was not exactly pleased when i came in here. I went to the bar and unfortunately we had quite a bit of a wait on numerous things. Kia and Renea ( not sure if i spelled right) were great servers and the negativity that i have is in no response to them. Even with the negative experiance i spoke with the manager jon and he welcomly took care of everything. Because things were handled with respect and honesty is why im giving high stars. Its hard to find any business nowadays that will be honest about how things turn out. Thank you to all 3 of you that turned a negative response into a very happy one. You 3 are truely amazing."}
{"text":"Paid for an all day pass. Can only bowl for an hour at a time. Decided to play some arcaded games and eat. We went to resign up for some more bowling but we can't get on until after 10pm. What's the sense of paying for an all day unlimited pass if you can only get one game of bowling per every 4 hours. They shouldn't sell unlimited passes if the day is booked up."}
{"text":"Would not recommend for a kids birthday party. The gift brought for a birthday party was not given to the intended recipient as it went to the wrong birthday party. Main event did not reimburse for the lost gift and even indicated that this type of mixup has happened before."}
{"text":"What a cool place. Great food games are a lil pricey but it is very kid friendly and clean. Great service good looking staff friendly most definitely will be going back."}
{"text":"Rating is for restaurant.  Party of four, and three orders came out wrong - including my son, whose birthday we are celebrating and now he's watching the rest of us eat while we wait for his corrected order to be delivered!  Service is slow and while we'll be back for games, it's not likely we'll be eating here again!"}
{"text":"My kids love this place. We like to go during the weekday when it's not so packed. Sometimes they run deals that sweetens up the visit (: Oh yeah if you haven't you might want to sign up to be on their email list. Every so often they will offer this deal where if you buy/load a $20 game card you get $20 free. Trust me it is all worth it."}
{"text":"New location looks awesome. Had a great time playing bowling and shuffleboard. I like that you can take your picture for the bowling scorecard. Funny cartoons proceed after each bowl. He actual shuffleboard was very long and slippery. A lot of fun though. Food and drink options are vast. There's also an arcade, laser tag and some sort of zip line. There's also a prize redemption center. I'll definitely come back!"}
{"text":"love taken my kid here. she always has so much fun there. and so do i . got some amazing food last time we went there."}
{"text":"Was surprised to see this place in Arizona, I believe they are new here, but since I am familiar with the ones in San Antonio and around Texas I came expecting the same experience and was not disappointed.  It is a bit pricey, but then again arcades of this type always are.  Overall, the wife and I had fun on my birthday and I'll be back when I'm in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"Fun place but very pricey D&B is a cheaper place to go. Only thing I had a problem with was it took forever to get a drink. At these prices you shouldn't have to wit long."}
{"text":"Sorry to say the customer service was awful.  A few friends and I went to have a good time first we stopped at the bar where set sat for a good 15 mins before someone took our order then waited another 10 to get out drinks and it wasn't busy.  Then we paid 17.95 for unlimited bowl and laser tag.  The waiter/waitresses we had were not up to par by a long shot.  No one ever came to us we had to go to them.  The first waiter we had asked for a drink brought it out in a timely manner, after that it went down hill he never came back we had to talk to another \"waitress\" who took for ever to bring two beers then when she finally decided to bring them to is we asked for a lemonade and another beverage she brought one not in a timely manner and \"forgot\" the lemonade.  Had to go add more time to bowl where we told the lady helping us that that the service was not up to par then a manager came over tried to make it right I applaud her effort right after that our lane broke and I asked them to fix it no one came waited like 10 mins then we were all over it  all in all fun place but don't expect any type of customer service."}
{"text":"My son and i went here for a birthday party and we have never been here before. We absolutely Loved it! We spent almost 3.5hrs there. My son now loves bowling and a ton of fun games for the whole family and the food was delicious! I ordered and cobb salad and it was out quickly and the taste was phenomenal! We will definitely be back to experience more! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Two dollar signs is right, it will cost you about $25 per person for video games and attractions. One \"ride\" is $9 so might as well buy unlimited pass. Kid heaven! Lots of cool arcade games, bowling, the lazer tag is 2 stories tall, and the Gravity ropes are fun too. Kids can get their energy out rather than passively sitting on a ride like at Amazing Jakes or Golfland. The place is also super clean and new looking. You can either sit down and order from a server or visit la bella's Pizza cafe inside. Good place to spend the day!"}
{"text":"Was looking forward to some fun with our two children. Purchased 2 fun passes and had to wait for a bowling lane when at least 8 to 10 of the 30 were empty.  Told us it would be a 10 minute wait & it was 20.   Kids had a really long wait to go on gravity ropes but they had fun.  Finally got a lane and then it wouldn't work after the kids entered their names and took their pics.  Called on the intercom and waited 15 minutes.  Called again and was told a tech was coming.  Had to wait another 5 minutes and told the waiter before it was fixed.   The whole time, there were other open lanes that we could have been moved to.  
After bowling went to buy a soda and there was no line.  Cashier told me it would be a minute and then she took about five to fix the register receipt.  No apology or any other communication so I gave up on the soda.
The bright side was the cashier who sold us our passes was friendly & helpful.  Experience this time was a bummer and we have had good times before.  We will be going to FlipSide or Fat Cats next time though after this poor customer service today."}
{"text":"This place is a sad excuse for family fun. Poorly managed and front desk personnel that's could care less your here to spend money. We're at $300 plus for wrist bands/food for six people. Bowling is one hour and if you don't finish in that hour..computer shuts down and says you are. Having to grab a time slot and pursue other activities leads to overlap and confusion. West side needs desperately more family fun venues as this place is a bust. Management needs to hire FRIENDLY\" may I help you\" considerate humans. Never again. Hit the zoo daytime or another bowling /arcade place. Devaunte needs a different job..not a customer service bone in his body. Games are 1.65!! Your loaded card will never zero out. Beware. **Main Event..Chris M. Your automatic reply is lacking in actual problem solving solutions."}
{"text":"We came here with family for my son's birthday. We got the $5 fun pass for everyone, but it was pretty annoying that we waited 2.5 hours to bowl to begin with, and then didn't even make it through one game before the bowling lane shut off and we had to get back on a list. By the time we could bowl again, most of our party had left. However, I understand it was busy and everyone needed a chance to bowl, so I wasn't too upset about that, though everyone else was. What was more upsetting was the customer service. The first time we bowled, no server came to our lane. We had like 8 people wanting to order food and drinks, and even though we asked for a server, no one ever came so we had to go to the bar for service. The second time we bowled, a server came by immediately, brought us one drink, and then disappeared for the whole hour, even though we had said we wanted to order more in a minute. We didn't see her again at all until we were done and needed to pay. I gave up on the idea of ordering dinner there, as did most of our group, so we just got food somewhere else afterward. It's like they didn't even want our money! We won't be back for any parties or group events. I gave two stars only because we still had some fun in spite of the awful food service. The only helpful person we encountered was the girl giving out the bowling shoes at the counter. It's too bad we couldn't order drinks from her!"}
{"text":"Had a good time.  Dinner and play combo very reasonable.  Food was good.  Would love to try out the bowling sometime.  I will be returning."}
{"text":"Brought my three kids here for an afternoon of games and fun. Overall was very disappointed.Had a hard time finishing a single bowling game before we were kicked off our lane. We tried twice. If you purchase a unlimited wrist band, they limit your time. We had 6 people, 3 kids, and they would not allow us to be on 2 lanes, even though there were multiple lanes open 85% of the time. Our games were always stopped before we could finish.
The Lazer Tag was fun, but the equipment was very dirty. The Video Games are expensive if you don't buy an unlimited video game deal. They start at $1.65 per game. 
The ambiance is very similar to Dave and Busters or Peter Piper Pizza, but leans heavily more toward a Peter Piper Pizza with a couple more adult friendly attractions."}
{"text":"This place is pretty chill.

My gf and I decided to check this place out a little while back when we were in the area.  We had heard good things so we figured, why not?

We went in and walked around to get familiar with the place.  There is a fair sized arcade, bowling, laser tag, pool, etc.  We did not go bowling or do laser tag but we did go to the bar for a beer.  Eventually, we decided to play some pool for a while and after that, we tried out the shuffleboard (I hadn't played shuffleboard in years).  They could use more sand to sprinkle on the board but we were able to make do.

Overall, it was a fun evening.  We were able to relax and have time to ourselves.  I would have no problem coming back and checking out the bowling down the road."}
{"text":"I celebrated my son's 13th birthday recently and the kids had a blast, great place for kids, great staff. I was very unsatisfied with the food, my son got to pick from a couple options for his party and picked sliders, all I can say is DO NOT GET THE SLIDERS, my son is a burger boy, and didn't even eat them, none of the kiddos did, it was the bun, they were so hard the boys were even tapping them on the table, to show me how hard they were. It's upsetting when you pay that price food included, but then have to order food when go home."}
{"text":"Birthday Party Review. 

We had my son's birthday party here today. All seemed fine and great when booking. We did the extreme package with bowling and laser tag for 10 kids. At 19.99 a kid I expected way more. 

First, our host Dana had the worst communication skills and was very slow. Our party was supposed to start at 2 and we were to be there at 145. The kids don't get shoes until after 2, there was still a party on our lane. We don't start bowling until 220. We also paid for an extra lane for adults. Time is cut off exactly at 3, even though we didn't get a full hour! Nothing like paying an additional $36 for 40 minutes of bowling. 

The pizza part went fine and was cleared away. Then our host disappeared and She finally shows up with the cake almost 5-10 minutes later! Leaving a group of 10 kids alone is like turning your back on the ocean! All craziness is let loose. 

Now for laser tag... the kids are taken in and let loose for 10 minutes before the game even begins! No communication that game hasn't started, scores aren't counted.. zip, zero, nada. 

Afterwards, the host gives the kids the game cards and sets them loose, even though I requested that I hand out the cards (a mom has rules to go over). 

To put the cherry on top, I was not informed of the service charge and tipped on top of that! Way to go Main Event. You are a terrible business. I will not be back"}
{"text":"Service:  Glacial.  Food:  Cold.  On a Friday at noon?   Give me a break.  The kid loves the place but I won't be hurrying back.  Over priced, over hyped, but now with Magic Disappearing Servers (tm)"}
{"text":"Very cool! Went here with my family, and we loved it. It's a bit far from my house, but definitely worth the drive. For $25/person, you can play unlimited laser tag, bowling, and this harness walk thing. Its a great deal. Way better than lucky strike downtown. They have a full bar, and the food is decent as well. We all had a great time!"}
{"text":"The 1 star rating is mostly for the restaurant.  Went there yesterday with some co-workers and was very disappointed.  They basically messed up 2 of the orders apologized but considering the type of error I felt an apology was not enough.  I had a hambuger as 2 others did and we all thought the fries were way too salty.  The hamburger looked nothing like its picture and was completely hidden inside the bun.  Ended up tossing the bun.  Bottom line, not a place I would go for food but the facitlity is impressive.  I'm afraid the individual costs of each game is high and priced weird.  Probably best to get some sort of package deal."}
{"text":"Went for my friends 40th bday, included her family and kids.  Waited 1hr 45 min for bowling lanes.  When others kept jumping ahead of us and we asked about it, the manager told us to \"make a reservation next time\" and that wouldn't happen.   We were in the process of getting refunded when magically a lane popped up.  Waited way too long for our drinks, food came out sporadically and in no order-some waited 20 min for food while others were eating.   Overall, not worth the money or the time."}
{"text":"We are from California but we came to visit family in Arizona. We wanted to do something fun for the whole family so we decided to come here! It was extremely fun because they had a lot of arcade games for everyone. We hung out at the bar which was nice while the kids played."}
{"text":"My sweet pea has been wanting to go for a while now so we met Sarah H and Dan H here last night for some fun. I got my sweet pea the $10 bracelet for attractions and the $20 game card for $10. We had a lot of fun playing laser tag and walking on the Sky Trail. My sweet pea even \"won\" a watch and two necklaces with the grabby hand game!  My only complaints would be that the happy hour isn't happy at all, just a couple if drinks and no food specials and the bowling filled up with leagues and there was a long wait list so we couldn't bowl and the attractions bracelet included it so I kind of felt like we couldn't do something we paid for. All in all, pretty good though and we will be back."}
{"text":"I had never been here and I was so happy to have decided to go. I went on a Friday from 12-7. They are doing an amazing deal currently that lets you basically do just about everything for under $20 a person. You can't beat that. And did I mention it runs all day?!! The service up at the front desk especially, is always so great. John, who I believe was the manager, was so helpful and nice. They have pool, bowling, arcade games, laser tag, you name it. They got it. So easy to spend all day here. Really great experience."}
{"text":"I've had some good experiences and bad experiences here. I've been here for work off sites, their bowling league, birthday parties, and just for fun. As you can see, I still keep coming back. The problem I have is their hour bowling limit. I get it when it is extremely busy; however, their have been times that we got kicked off, yet there wasn't really anyone waiting. 

Overall, if you're taking the kids their for a birthday or fun time then they will have a great time."}
{"text":"Although fun, this place is extremely expensive. Bowling lanes are per hour not by the game and run about 29.00 an hour. All of the games are extremely overpriced for the amount of game play that you have. $1.50-$1.75 for most games. (to literally hit a button ONE TIME) When your taking a couple children there, get ready to spend a TON. And none of these prizes are even worth spending the money to get the tickets. My daughter had over 6000 tickets and wanted an instant print camera. They won't even let you pay the difference because they know you'll spend WAY MORE MONEY to play the games to get the tickets. Well we didn't fall for that. This is unfortunate for such a fun place but the only way they can stay open is for it to be overpriced. When you arrive, don't be surprised if you are the only people there! There is a very good reason for no crowds here......"}
{"text":"Came here for a small gathering during dinner. Started off with dinner by the bar. I ordered a strawberry mojito which was really good. Had calamari and southwest chicken for dinner. Both were delicious. I was skeptical with the chicken but ended up impressed. The friends got a lane to bowl. At some point a ball got stuck in the gutter and no one came, so we just took care of it ourselves. The we signed up for laser tag. After check in we were told to stand in front of the door and guessed that we just wait until the door opens (short wait of 10 minutes). There wasn't as much guidance for new visitors but it's also not difficult to figure out. I'd come back again and would recommend to others. Had a great time and isn't it their goal?"}
{"text":"So, my boyfriend had planned our date day and this was our first stop. Some games, laser tag, bowling, sounded fun. We were both really pumped as we don't get to have a date day and act like kids very often. 
We walked in and it smelled and looked very clean so, a positive there (only there). We decided to play some games before laser tag. 36 dollars total on the card, we set off. It was gone in 15 minutes. No big deal. 
We went to sign up for laser tag and the girl behind the counter (name started with an 'S', had brown long brown hair, short) seemed very annoyed she had to stop talking to a coworker to assist us. She told me game time was at 115, we can go in at 110 and gear up and she would be in to explain how it works. Cool. At 110 we went in and did as she said. By 118 I went out to see where she was. She looked at me, but continued to keep talking to another worker. Finally, I said excuse me, we're ready and she rolled her eyes and said next time stand outside the door. I said well, that's not what you said, you said go in and gear up, she cuts me off and says well next time wait outside the door. So I again tried to repeat what she told me to do and she cuts me off again to tell me to wait outside the door next time. At this point I'm annoyed and my mood is ruined. Then, we start playing and she is just standing in the room. I almost ran into her multiple times. Not sure what the point of that is. So we play two more rounds and she tells us we have to leave cuz other people want to come in. So we leave, go get some food, come back to do a couple more rounds and are standing at the counter and again, everyone there just seems to want to talk than work. We finally sign up for our time, we wait and then they bring in three little kids and I'm like well wait, this is our time slot. Apparently because we didn't pay for the whole room we now had to have other people in with us. So we go to speak with a manager about the issues. She asks if we wanna play again and we were like no, not really. So we played some bowling. She gave us a free hour and some cards to play 30 minutes worth of games. As we were at the bowling station my boyfriend got thirsty so he hit the button for assistance and we were completely ignored. We go to the bar area to get some drinks and Adriana who was working wouldn't even acknowledge we existed. I get it, she was running to a table but, show a little hospitality and at least say you'll be right with us and acknowledge you see us. Finally, Kenzie comes over (who was the only nice and helpful person present) and got our drinks for us. 
Needless to say, we won't be back, Dave and Busters is well worth the drive to at least have a welcoming environment."}
{"text":"C was invited to a classmates Birthday party here. I hadn't planned on staying but once we were there to drop C off I realized that I could have sat in the large dining area. Next time.

C loved it. When I picked him up 2 1/2 hours later he said he had a blast. They bowled, played laser tag and had birthday cupcakes. He raved and raved about how fun it was.

I can really only comment on the staff that I interacted with. When we were leaving, I grabbed a bunch of literature off the wall near the entrance/exit. As we were leaving a young man approached us and asked if I had any questions. I said I was fine and thanked him for asking. He told us to have a great weekend. Nice.

The bathroom was clean and the facility is really very large. The only other comment I can make is that when we walked in, I didn't realize this place is like a bar on steroids. There were a lot, well over 100, older men and women just sort of hanging around the bar area. I could tell they were in smaller groups so I don't think they were all from the same company. I never would have imagined this place was a \"hang out after work\" kind of place. Whoda thunk it.

That being said, I think the facility was very clean and seemed like a fun place. One of the pamphlets I grabbed was a birthday price list. It does seem rather expensive so be forewarned. 

C had a great time bowling and playing laser tag. 3 Stars."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! They have everything from laser tag to bowling to a bar to an arcade. The staff are super nice and helpful and this place is great for any age. The bowling part is interactive where it takes your picture so you're part of the toons in between frames. It's hilarious! Will definitely be coming back soon."}
{"text":"Nice place for adults but not for kids. Way more expensive than other arcades in the area. They seriously charge you $1 just to have a card so you can play games. Not to mention that all games are oddly priced, $1,63 etc so you always end up with money left on your card that you lose unless you add more. There is a Height requirement for everything so basically any kids under 7, in most cases 48\", can't really do anything. Glorified bowling alley. Go to Fatcats or Brunswick and save your $$"}
{"text":"I had to give this shit hole a 1 star rating but I think it's a shitty ass place to go to. They stole roughly about $500 worth off due to claiming that we had to reserve our spot when we literally paid it in advance. Then they had the audacity to kick us out of our bowling spot when we were there less than an hour. Shifty place & bad service!"}
{"text":"The ONLY reason for the four stars was the laser tag. It was $8 for each 15 minute slot.. But worth it. There was maybe a 30 minute wait.. Which was not a problem because we were playing the arcade games. The unlimited card for arcade games was $9.25. With that.. There are some additional rules. You can't play certain games and you also can't receive any tickets. That was a little disappointing, but I was informed before buying it. I would probably come back just for the laser tag. Arcade part wasn't that impressive."}
{"text":"It appears the corporation that runs Main Event may need some professional help. They have put a ton of money into the business but seem to be operating the business on a straw budget. I participate in a \"fun\" bowling league at the Tempe location. The last two weeks we have had to wait for regular customers to finish bowling. Most places would not put people on league lanes within an hour of the league start time. If you are a regular league bowler, do yourself a favor and don't waste your time, even for fun. The lanes are ALWAYS filthy, they do not oil the lanes, the carpeted areas near the lanes smell horrible, and good luck getting a coaster with the overpriced drinks. The bathrooms are rarely clean or properly stocked. Ladies, bring your own toilet paper! Food is average and drinks are overpriced. There are two weeks left in our league and I can't wait for it to be over. After this league, I will never enter this place again."}
{"text":"We went on a busy Saturday night and tried to find out what the best options of play were.  Front desk was of no help at all, no smiles and complete lack of customer service.  Went to the laser tag desk and got the same type of treatment.  Was told  by desk rep best play days were Monday to Friday.  Clearly they didn't want our business.  Tried again the next day Sunday hoping maybe just the busy Saturday was the issue.  Guess what, same rude and unfriendly workers but we figured out on our own what to do.  Still had 3 kids not happy with their experience.  They got ripped off on games and good luck findings attendant to help.  Other similar game places have been so much better than Main Event.  Poor poor customer service and general employee attitudes!  You need to have people constantly circulating and having presence amongst your patrons."}
{"text":"My niece had a birthday party here. the party host who walks through your party events was great. She smiles and was patient with the children. overall the party experience was excellent staff was helpful and friendly. The food is why it gets 3 stars the menu didn't even look desirable, to cluttered with stuff. the Pizza was burnt even the children didn't eat it. The family that ordered off the menu well the food presentation was not inviting at all. I'm all about a good time with good food and I was very disappointed. I was had to leave because I was hungry... Great for a party not so hot on the food !!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I went to a work function here so I didn't pay for anything -lucky me! Everyone was helpful when we needed drinks and when we had dinner in the banquet room. The banquet food was meh- we had BBQ but the only thing I could eat since being a vegetarian was the cornbread and salad. The salad was limp and sad. Oh well- again it was free to me so I didn't want to complain. 
They have good variety of games but they seemed a tad pricey if I had to pay for it myself. We also had a dedicated bowling lane for 4 hours. Which was little impressive -maybe I'm behind on the bowling alley technology but you take a photo and they use your face in the silly animations on the screen when you get strikes etc. A long way from pencil and paper!
We were able to play laser tag as a group which was a lot of fun. I never had the desire to play ever but since it was free why not?! Surprisingly! I had a great time! It's two levels so you can pick off people below. A few of my co-works said their gun didn't work or wasn't working right - this was a little frustrating for them but I had no problems the two times I played. They also have several pool tables but didn't get the chance to play. 
I wasn't brave enough to do the catwalk thingy but my co-workers said it was fun and scary if you're afraid of heights like me. 
I would like to go back but only when they have specials or during off hours -it seems like this place could get busy on the weekends. No thanks. 
Overall it was a great night out for us."}
{"text":"First time in a Main Event today , took one of my sons there for a birthday party.  When I got home from the party my wife asked what I thought about it, and if we should have our sons birthday party there in October.  

I told her it was a cool concept - food, laser tag, bowling and video games.    BUT. The experience could have been MUCH BETTER.  One thing that is bugging me about the visit and interaction with the manager named Joel.


I dropped of one son with his friends for a birthday party, and my younger son and I went to spend time together on our own.  We ended up playing one of those claw games, and he won a \"Baby-g-shock\" watch.  Him and I were super excited!  We opened it up right away because he was excited to put it on, and when we did it was a pretty pink girls watch.  Now, I am not saying boys can't wear pink, but there were other colored watches in the game (the one he went for was In a white case, and watch wasn't visible) and so I asked the manager if we could swap for another color.  He said he would, so we were excited and I thanked him for his help.  We all walked to the game, and that's when he noticed that the other prizes had a plastic wrap, and since I had remove the wrap from our watch, he said there was nothing he could do.  I explained to him the package was white so we thought it was a white watching inside, and we did not realize it was pink until we opened it up.  We had to remove the plastic to open it to see the color.  Still he said there was nothing He could do.  I know it may not seem like a big deal, and I think that's the point.   It wasn't a big deal, it was An easy fix, and those easy fixes can make a significant impact on the customers visit.  It can take the rating From a 4 star to a 2 star, the poor visit can be shared online, shared with family and friends, and can impact the customers decision to return.  Despite the indifference, and the miss in delivering on the brand image from the manager, My youngest and I had a good time playing games for 2.5 hours while my oldest was at the birthday party.  Not sure if we will return.  Like I said, cool concept, but Miss on customer service, and there are other options."}
{"text":"We loved having our son's 10th birthday party. Great customer service. Everything was on time and it ran smoothly."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to the main entertainment for dinner today. Initially, the experience was good, the man who seated us was very nice and the appetizer was great. However, after that the service really went downhill. They ask for your credit card right when you order. We barely saw our waitress and she forgot my drink (despite me asking for it more than once). However, once the bill came the drink I never received was on the bill. We brought this up to the waitress and she agreed to remove the drink charge. After checking my bank account when I got home I saw that the charge had not been removed. Overall, although the food was good enough you could get better service and have an overall better experience elsewhere."}
{"text":"I went to Main Event Entertainment last night.  I was not not too impressed.  

1) It took me 30 minutes to find a parking slot.  I circled the whole parking lot 4 times to find a slot.  It is not worth it.

2) I walk in, and it is LOUD.  The music is blaring.  I walked out shortly afterwards.  I did not see the reason I should spend me time there.  With music that loud, I will get a headache.  

Moving forward if I want bowling, I will go to the local alley near me.  If I want Lazer Tag, I will go to Stratum Lazer Tag in Mesa."}
{"text":"I've been here several times with mixed results. The place is very new, clean and modern. Service is very spotty. Good sometimes but below average is the norm. My latest visit was the worst. We ordered from the little electronic tablets at the tables and after 46 minutes we flagged down a server only to be told that there was a glitch in the electronics and our order hadn't registered. My advice, always order from the bar. The food is decent, nothing to write home about but ok for such a nice venue. Where our experience really went South was when we went to the bowling lanes. We were initially told lane rental was $18 an hour plus 4.25 for shoes.  The reality was they wanted all 6 bowlers to pay the $18 plus shoes. Ridiculous! Never coming back. Next company outing we're going to Dave & Buster's."}
{"text":"Birthday fun, check! 

My daughter wanted to go bowling for her birthday and this was closest to home. There were 4 of us, 2 adults and 2 children. We walked in and went to pay for bowling and seen they had a Monday special. 3 activities (bowling, laser tag and gravity ropes) were included and we took advantage of bowling and laser tag. The special was $10.95/person and from what I understood, there was no time limit just 1 hour increments. While we waited for a lane we played a game of laser tag, neither my girls or I have ever played before but had a blast. We then bowled a game, had dinner and then wanted to play another game of laser tag. My youngest is 4 and it was fun to watch her with this big ole thing on her lugging around. 

We had dinner there but the food wasn't all that great. My girls pizza was the best thing we ordered. The nachos should've been called a bean nachos because it was loaded with beans and really nothing else. I prefer my wings to be a little more crispy but that's my preference and I should've asked for them naked and just dip it. 

All in all a great experience and my youngest is already planning to go back for her 5th birthday!"}
{"text":"Went here with my work team for a team outing and we had a ton of fun! Just be careful though because this place has potential to be a little bit of a money pit. Some of the arcade games are a little expensive to play and you can blow through $40 in a matter of a few minutes. 

The laser tag was tons of fun even though I got hurt playing it. Hey, at least I won the round. Haha. 

There are lots of things to do here including karaoke, eating, arcade games, laser tag, and suspension lines. It's a lot of fun and great for small-large groups, birthday parties, etc."}
{"text":"Where do I start..  

We came here tonight with a group of 10 ppl.  After checking in for two lane reservations, we were told it would be 1 hr to 1.5 hrs.. as I write this we are at the 2 hr mark. That alone wouldn't be a problem given a Saturday night.. 

The fun started when we went to get a table to eat dinner while waiting for our lane.  We were greeted at the host stand after a few mins (apparently no host on duty) by a gentlemen who looked like the manager or gm etc.  He was polite and checked on table and came back and said a bday party was clearing out and it would be 10mins. We watched as a family of 5 walked in the entrance and proceeded over to the large table( seats 10-20) and we watched as the waiter just proceeded to serve them.. after again getting up and standing up at the host stand the same manager came over and said it appeared out table was stolen, but offered us a large table immediately in the \"party area\".. ok not the end of the world..

We sat, the first waitress came up after 5 mins and asked what the deal was, we had to ask for menus. She left, another waitress came back with 3 menus(for our group of 10) and then left again only to come back with out more menus to ask us if it would be a split check.  I asked for more menus and she came with approx 20. Then back again to clarify if it was a split check.  From there proceeded to take our drink order and try and get our food order when we had our menus for 30 seconds. 

Then after our drinks took 15 mins,  smoothies came with our straws,  beers were spilt on someone in our party, and no waters were offered or brought. Our food showed up in separate groups,  then with the last group, my dish of boneless wings was dropped on the floor!!!!!!!!! At this point I'm thinking we are on a prank tv show to see how far we can be pushed!!! Every one has to ask for cutlery and napkins!

The check close out was ok, but the icing on the cake in all this? 
1.  I asked for blue cheese, and got ranch! 
2. My original blue cheese is still on the floor as we speak
3. 2.5 hrs and this review we still haven't gotten our lane and have already spent $400 at this establishment!!!!!"}
{"text":"Had a great time here on a Sunday late night. It wasn't busy but staff made us feel very welcome and never did we feel like they were just waiting for us to leave. 

We bowled for $5 per hour which is a steal given the quality and cleanliness of the lane.  They have this great digital lane that let's you take pictures of yourself and the lane incorporates cartoons of you and the other players after every round.  Super fun for a group and keeps the game going. Make sure to try it!"}
{"text":"As a first timer, I wasn't sure what to expect. I was a little overwhelmed, but went with it. We came for a 7 y.o bday party. Let the boys join the party, while husband, 3 y.o. daughter and I decided to grab something to eat. We sat up front, next to the entrance, and was quickly seated by the friendly host. Our server joined us fairly quickly. She was awesome and told us how everything worked. She was patient with us and even tried her best to make sure my daughter got what she asked for. Jasmine was fantastic! Next up is the food... Hubs & I decided to order 2 FUN CARDS. There's a deal where you can choose from a menu of 8 items. I was bummed that what I wanted wasn't on that list, but again, we went with it because we wanted the fun cards for the kids. We thought it was a good deal. (I guess its similar to D&B's in this way.) I ordered the Wings Combo (seasoned fries, and I picked garlic lemon pepper wings), hubs ordered the Bacon Cheeseburger Combo. And daughter just wanted the birthday cake SHAKE (which came in a kids cup, so it was perfect). The food came out in about 10-15 minutes....and the portion size was a pleasant surprise. Forgot to count the number of wings I got, but there were fries and carrots & celery with dip to help fill me up. The chicken was crispy & cooked to perfection. Season was perfect. Fries were crisp on the outside & fluffy on the inside. Hubs loved his burger & said the best part was that the part is was crisp around the edges. It looked juicy and the burger was drool-worthy from my point of view. 1st time here was wonderful...though keep in mind, it might be pricy. The kids bands cost about $19, but it includes laser, pool, & bowling. Hope this helps! We had a blast!"}
{"text":"Bad experience.   Took us 58 minutes from the time our server submitted our order of a cheeseburger, onion rings, chicken Primavera,  and chicken fingers for us to receive everything except the chicken fingers.  That took another 10 minutes.   Didnt seem that busy.  Primavera was dry and the burger was lukewarm.  On the plus side, the onion rings were good and the manager ran his butt off.  Don't recommend eating there.

Since then they contacted me two days ago and asked me for my email to attempt to make thing better.   Still haven't heard from them.  But maybe my daughters chicken fingers are done now."}
{"text":"First time here. Family was in town for spring break. LOVED the bowling!!! I will definitely come back again to bowl. We came during the daytime on a weekday so it wasn't busy at all. Staff was friendly. Pricing on games were a bit much. They only reason why we played many games was because of the promotion going on ($10 game card for each entree ordered from their special menu)."}
{"text":"This place is fun for the whole family. The only thing is some of the employees don't seem to know a lot about the place. But I'll give them the benefit of the doubt they probably get a lot of new employees. Other than that it's a good place to go."}
{"text":"It's a shame how disorganized this place is because the facility is so nice! I went with a group of friends (keep in mind we are 24-26 year olds so not really hard to please) we first got to the front desk and paid for unlimited bowling, laser tag and pool. The front desk guy forgot to give us wrist bands so that was the first issue, second issue was no one ever told us we had to schedule a time to do laser tag. So we waited in a long line to find out that we didn't have a time slot. Luckily the man working the laser tag let us go but no direction whatsoever. Two of our friends waited an hour for their food. The facility did end up comping the mess though so that was nice. I had a salad and it was good but they didn't put the feta on it or bring the correct dressing so I waited like 20 minutes to those. 

Overall the place is very disorganized and it's clear the workers don't communicate with each other. I'm in the service industry and am pretty laid back as a person so if this is coming from me you know it was bad service. 

Conclusion: you're better off driving 30 minutes to Dave n' Busters."}
{"text":"Went for the first time this last Monday when they have a $10 dollar deal so the spot was definitely poppin. Seemed like mostly jr high high school kids with a sprinkle of young college kids. Our crew was likely the only 30+ group but maybe that's just because we're kids at heart. The bowling lane is not your mom and pops old AMF lanes. Music videos playing with top 40 sports on other screens lights the whole shebang. Definitely a cosmic bowling vibe. Shoe rental was $5 and they seemed clean and I like that fact that it was an easy slip on velcro. The scoreboard where you enter your names has its own camera so you can all take different pictures then the animations after each person bowls uses those faces. Easy entertainment but nice perk. You get bowling for an hour then have to sign up again for a second slot. About 20 lanes but they weren't allowing them all to be filled at the same time. Not sure why. Food menu was regular bar food options but slightly better. I think I had baja tacos. Beers liquor were fair priced ($5-7 20 oz) Staff was attentive. We also did laser tag and it felt like about 40 people at a time. You sign for the groups in advance so its not a herd of people trying to get in line at once. The equipment in there seemed pretty basic easy to use not too bulky. The kids knew where to hide but even one of the older guys in our group ended up being top 5 scorer.  

As you walk in they have they  pool on one side and traditional arcade game setup on the other side. The place also has a small restaurant bar area so if the kids are off playng and you want to just relax watch sports etc there is a place for that too."}
{"text":"Way overpriced and not as good as Dave and  Busters.  Probably shouldn't rent a warehouse space if you arent going to fill it and then charge your customers outrageous prices to cover your utility bill."}
{"text":"My nieces had been wanting to try this place and after seeing the April/May deal, we decided to go last night about 6:30 pm. It was buzzing with kids, teenagers and families which was exactly what was expected. There was a long line to get to the counter where she was very nice but you can only get a wristband from her. So, in order to bowl, do laser tag or play on the gravity ropes, you have to go across the whole place to get signed up on a list. We were quoted an hour to bowl, laser tag was quoted at 8:45 and the ropes were booked til 10. Great...now what? So, we asked the girl working the winners circle, which is where you go sign up for everything else, how the arcade games work. Alexa told us that for 9.95, we could have unlimited games. We were like...oh neat! So, we went back up and the young man up there said that it was 9.95 for 20$. Totally makes more sense but when she originally gave us our card, it had 40$ on it. Confusing as he'll. They should tell you how long the waits are when you buy your wristband. I had enough money to keep us entertained but if they were there on their own, their allowance would have run out in the 1st 30 min. Every game was at least a dollar to play. Ridiculous. After an hour and a half, I spoke to a manager and said we were quoted an hour to bowl, it's been an hour and a half. Can we just have our money back and lo and behold!! Our name was called next.By now , it was 8:15-8:30   and we bowled 1 game and left. Its a very confusing system, and I think the management should have someone who knows what they're going at the winners circle which is the only register that needs constant attention and multi tasking skills. Nobody looked happy to work there. Also, my niece loves those claw machines and on the bling king one where you could win a watch or bracelet etc...was a total piece of junk. The claw didn't even close, not even a little bit. The other one, wouldn't close all the way. Crappy equipment, under trained staff, long wait times and managers who don't see any of this.....bad business."}
{"text":"We decided to try Main Event for dinner since we had only stopped in for quick games before. My wife was in the mood for pizza so she got a slice with her dinner. The pizza was laughably bad and was seriously worse than little caesars. To make matters worse, we saw the bill we had been charged 5 dollars for a small terrible slice of pizza. We could have bought a whole (better tasting pizza at little caesars) for the cost of this one slice. 

After our disappointing dinner we wanted something sweet. We saw that the pizza place had gelato so being huge gelato fans, we decided to give it a try. When the girl behind the counter had a hard time scooping it....we knew something was wrong. Lo and behold we tasted it and found out it was ice cream and not gelato at all. This is false advertising and they should be ashamed of themselves. 

We will not be returning."}
{"text":"I usually go here once a week, hoping it will get better. But never does it fail for my food to come out wrong, and I am never given plates or utensils. Also I never complained until tonight. I just wanted my refund for my large pizza that was over thirty dollars. The manager didn't seem to want to give me my refund. Eventually I got my refund for the pizza, but not the tax I paid on the pizza or fountain drinks. How cheap and rude I thought. Definitely won't be going here anymore, as I gave it plenty of chances and the one time I confront management I was disappointed even more. Didn't think that was possible."}
{"text":"This place is so trash I don't recommend they as might as spit in your face after charging you 39$ an for fucking bowling not even including the shoes you need to bowl. Save your money and go somewhere else. Literally anywhere else."}
{"text":"Worst service ever, last year I read reviews of their poor service but blamed it on it being a new opening and them still working the bugs out so I've always gone to the one in Tempe, whom by the way has excellent service, wen to the Avondale yesterday- waited 30 minutes at the bar every time to order a drink, then she brings me mojitos when I asked gor Mules.. Then had a bowling game after 1 hour of asking 7x for a server, finished the bowling game  and still no server. Spoke to both managers of the bar and the bowling area and both were very non-apologetic and nonchalant. The Pizza area was the only good area. STAY AWAY FROM THE AVONDALE LOCATION......GO TO TEMPE LOCATION.....oh also...bathrooms are gross and many stalls had no toilet paper."}
{"text":"This place is always fun. Came in for on a work event for the 2nd time. Service at the bowling alley was really fantastic. Our waiter went out of his way to get a cheese for food without beer for a pregnant worker. Also after we all eventually walked away he tracked us down to thank us and make sure we were still set on food and drinks. Great for group events and parties."}
{"text":"Food service was so slow. When the food came out it was all room temperature. Quality was very poor. Eat elsewhere and then come to play. 

Update: I was contacted by Main Event management and they really cared about our negative experience. The communication was genuine and concerned. We will be giving Main Event a second chance for sure!"}
{"text":"Feels like being in a loud warehouse - it's expensive and hard to navigate the different entertainment options - no real comfortable area to relax for a couple hours - not a great customer experience - for the money - I would prefer competitive options in the area -"}
{"text":"This place has so much potential but is very disorganized. I had a totally butchered birthday party and a totally butchered meal here. The customer service is probably the worst I've experienced in quite sometime. So bad it was almost comical. And all for subpar food."}
{"text":"I held a happy hour for my co-workers here last month. 

The appetizers were delicious; we ordered some nachos and a plate of onion strings.  We also got the BIG Lucky Strike Combo appetizer sampler, and that could have easily served eight people.  The platter included Buffalo Wings, mozzarella sticks with marinara sauce, sliders, tortilla chips with salsa, spinach dip and a queso dip.

While we only sat and drank, the activity selection was dazzling.  I saw video games, bowling, laser tag and something they call Gravity Ropes (an elevated roper ladder type of climbing structure).  It was late afternoon so there weren't too many patrons, but everyone looked like they were having a good time.

Overall we had a good visit, my only issue to bring up was that the volume of music blasting overhead was so loud that our group had to shout at each other just to communicate, which doesn't make for a very sociable outing.  Making the music louder doesn't automatically equate to a more fun environment; the two are not directly proportionate.
  
I'd suggest maybe turning down the speaker volume from an 11 to a 8."}
{"text":"We decided to take my son who turned 11 here because he wanted to play Laser Tag. We did a Labor Day Weekend deal where you pay 15.95 for unlimited laser tag, bowling, and gravity rope. Mind you on top of the fee for the pass you have to pay about 3.00 to rent shoes for bowling, they do provide complimentary socks if you forgot to bring a pair. 

Laser Tag- It was two stories and pretty decent to play for 15 minutes. The kids seemed to enjoy it and the adults.

Bowling- This had to been my most favorite experience. They have a electronic guards that come up for whichever player you select it for. So for the kids we had them put up and for the adults we did not. This made it convenient for us all to bowl how we liked.  Another cool concept was you take three photos and it will appear on the point screen and do little cool animations of your face doing something fun.

Gravity Rope- Very similar to whats at Castle and Coaster if you have been there. 

Now for the most terrible part of our trip and reason for the low score.   The food was really good once we got our food and order correct. Granted we did have a large party but I never been to a restaurant and been served so poorly even with a large group. We ordered The Works and they continued to mess our order up. Once they got the toppings correct they still had the size wrong but after waiting over an hour to get my food I did not care I was so hungry. Once the waitress brought the correct pizza she said with a sassy attitude, \"Heres The Works with NO MEATBALLS AND NO OLIVES.\" Then goes to slam down our pizza like we were the worst customers. My fiancee asked for the manager twice and at the end when we were leaving he offered us play cards but we were leaving why would we want to stay after all we went through. They also charge you up front for the food before getting it. I think they do that so once you pay they can treat you like dirt. I never been treated so poorly at an establishment before."}
{"text":"I ahead a great time. I love this place. Reason for 2 stars-we had to ask 4 employees to get us a waiter at the bowling lane. Not only did that cut into our bowling time but the fact that we had to ask MULTIPLE times and when we asked why we hadn't seen a waiter the response was, \"I can't find the waiter that is servicing this area\"
Horrible response. We didn't even have glasses of water yet and it had been about 30min. I work in customer service and hospitality, this was a horrible response and the fact that the people we asked still couldn't find another server for us. It'll take a lot for me to go back there. They should have found a manager if they couldn't find the server to do their job."}
{"text":"We had a great time! Our burgers were really good and you can get a game card with it too for a deal. The Lazer tag maze was a blast even for adults.

Only 4 stars because the service and the middle main counter sucked. They were just talling ignoring us, didn't give full instructions for times and activities. In general, they were almost rude. For an entertainment place like this, the service should be fun lively and cheery. 

Our food waitress was amazing tho!"}
{"text":"This place is new so it's very clean and quite spacious.  It doesn't seem to have as many games as Dave & Busters, but I like it for it's clean atmosphere and hardwood flooring.  There is also a bowling alley there $34/hour plus $3.50 to rent shoes.  So it can get pricey - 6 people max to a lane.  

They also have a slew of tables to host birthday parties and a nice pizza restaurant, too.  The hubs takes our son to Dave & Busters often and said though this place is cleaner, D&B is much cheaper and has more variety for games.  We probably won't go here that often as it is quite a drive for us but were meeting friends there this particular day."}
{"text":"This review is purely for the food. 

First off the service here is atrocious. It took forever for a server to get us drinks. When we finally got served we were recommended several things. I decided to be safe and order the giant pretzel. How can you screw up a pretzel? Well, it was disgusting. The rest of our party was disappointed as well. To be fair, It really was bar food so could I be too disappointed?"}
{"text":"We had my son's 10th birthday party there Sunday.  I was absolutely confused when I realized the entire first hour was sitting at a table with pizza and cake. How many kids do you know that eat pizza and cake for an hour while games are everywhere? That was such a waste of my party time. I paid for the higher package which was $24.95 per child and that just is outrageously expensive for what I feel I got out of it all. The gravity ropes and laser tag were fun, but we only got 15 minutes for each. I definitely would not recommend a party here.  If you want to come with your family and spend the day here, that's up to you, but don't have a party here."}
{"text":"Absolutely no organization! Came here to celebrate a friends birthday and was immensely disappointed when people from our group were left out during a game of laser tag, because they let in too many people in that round. The young lady in charge of the game that evening was rude and not in any way helpful. They got 2 stars because of great bartender who was courteous and kept tabs on us throughout the night. Overall i would say it's a really great idea of a place but it needs some staff training asap!"}
