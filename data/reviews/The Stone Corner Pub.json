{"text":"New pub night. more like new pub not!  

My husband and I wanted to mix things up and try a new pub, I wish we used Yelp instead of google maps to choose the location. The Stone Corner Pub, from the website and menu (they advertise gluten free and veg friendly items) appeared to be a great choice. Situated in the corner of a strip mall the exterior was nothing to write home about, but the interior was comfortable enough.  Save the extra low booth seats/high tables (you might want to request a phone book to sit on) and the oddly positioned televisions (they all face the door). 

The food, however was something to write about. 

It was Tapas night at the pub, so you can try a variety of app items for only 5.99.  Mistakenly, we ordered the mussels in a coconut curry sauce. If you like extremely fishy and off tasting seafood, this ones for you.  Dinner was not much better.  My husband ordered the Jerk Chicken Sandwich which was supposed to include chicken, but was just a sloppy pile of extra creamy coleslaw and avocado on a brioche bun. After looking closely, we did find one scrap of chicken about the size of a quarter.  I ordered the vegetarian burger. Housemade patty (i'm guessing) that was overly abundant with sage and thyme and squishier than the bun. Both our plates went back to the kitchen full, but out server didn't bother to ask if the food was ok or even if we wanted to take it home.  We guessed that he already knew the answer to that question.

One plus, the Guinness was good!"}
{"text":"We were pleasantly surprised and only saw the previous reviews after we went.  The service was incredible and the food was very nicely prepared.  We first went in the summer (June) returned for the same great food and service in August and are heading back tonight as they have live entertainment and wanted to check it out."}
{"text":"I had been to this place around 3 times and was never really impressed with the service. I do however really enjoy the jerk wings with Caesar dressing. I convinced one of my best friends to join me one night for the wings. We were greeted promptly at the door, seated, and our drink order taken. It was not very busy that night. Our drinks came right away and menus were presented to us. We knew what we wanted so it didn't take us very long to decide. We placed the menus on the other side of the table hoping that the server would realize we were ready to order. We had to ask someone to send our server over. This took a while. My buddy ordered first, his order was the jerk wings with Caesar dressing, an order of fries with gravy. When the sever turned to me, I said \"I will have exactly the same\".

We enjoyed our drinks and awaited our food. My friend's order arrived soon but mine did not, I figured my food was on its way shortly. I waited and finished my beer. I had to flag the waitress down to ask about my food. She had the nerve to ask me if I had ordered anything, I told her that I had specifically said I would have the exact same thing as my friend. Her response was \"I must have not heard you, I will place a rush on your order\" and quickly went into the kitchen. My beer was empty and I tried to flag someone down to get another one, you would figure the the server would have noticed this and asked if I wanted another one while I waited for my food. This was another process that took a while. My drink came with my wings. As I am a little OCD, I have my food in sections. I waited for my fries to arrive as I eat them first. After a short while, I had to flag the server down again and asked about my fries.. Her response was \"I didn't know you had ordered fries, I will get a rush order in\". The fries arrived shortly without the gravy, again her comment was \"I didn't know you had ordered gravy, I will get you some\" not sure what part of \"I will have exactly the same\" she didn't understand throughout this visit.

The manager came over and apologized for the \"misunderstanding\" and comp'd my meal. 

It has been several months since this visit and I have not been back."}
{"text":"This is my favourite go-to local pub. Friendly & quick service, plenty of TVs, live bands, and really good food! In house fresh cut fries are a must order! Great macaroni and cheese too. I will continue coming back here!"}
{"text":"Abysmal. Server (Kim) was awful.  Food was overpriced for Costco quality ingredients. The website is highly misleading. Avoid especially if you have any specific food allergies or prefer to remove/substitute ingredients."}
{"text":"I've been here about 3 times with my boyfriend, the last was what made me not want to go back again. The first two were decent, it's just a restaurant that sells regular pub food, nothing special ..they USED to have amazing chicken fingers & fries that didn't seem to taste frozen at all (we found out yesterday they were). So yesterday, we decided to get the chicken fingers & fries again ..this time I remembered them tasting a lot better, they didn't seem to taste like what I remembered. The first time I got the ranch chicken wrap which was good but tasted a little too charred. With our 2 orders of chicken fingers and fries we also ordered an order of Mac & cheese to share ..it was pretty good but they forgot the Panko crumbs when the menu specifically said it was topped with that. The waitress came and sent it back to the kitchen to get it remade. She came back about 10-15 minutes later with a new dish & this time instead of Panko crumbs there was COCONUT! Who in the world puts coconut on Mac & cheese! What if I was allergic to coconut? So at this point I was highly annoyed, not only were they messing up our food our waitress was no where to be found so my boyfriend had to get up & get her. We explained to her how there was coconut in our mac & cheese & she immediately said she would take it off our bill so that was good. Since this experience I don't think I'll be going back. The service we got the first other times was a lot better! This particular time we could barely find our server & the other servers were way too focused on the customers at the bar."}
{"text":"Stopped in for drinks. Busy place, but they have a large, free parking lot. Your typical pub: high top, regular table, booth seating and lots of TVs. Pricing on all of the food and drink is very reasonable and they have daily specials as well as live entertainment. Service was friendly and quick, but they had a terrible beer selection. I see a lot of complaints about service, but our server was very attentive."}
{"text":"This is not a pub with good food - waited 20 mins for a menu , no water brought or asked if we even wanted anything to drink 

We ordered surf and turf and some wings.

After 20 mins my surf and turf came out - it was a beefsteak patty with 3 tiger shrimps.  

We waited on the wings but they never came , waited another 5 mins and asked the waitress about the order of wings , she looked at us puzzled and replied \" you wanted wings \" ... 

I don't even bother finishing my lovely meal , asked for the bill which took another 20 mins to calculate one item.

This establishment will not see me nor my money again"}
{"text":"This place is what you would expect your local pub to be, nothing special, simple food, quickly seated as it's often fairly empty, little pub atmosphere. It's our local watering hole and we never had high expectations for the food, it's more like a place to grab a cold beer and if you want food they have it. Nachos are pretty good just ask for the chilli or sauce on the side or they will get soggy. They have great daily specials. Monday's they have a $5 burger and fresh cut fries combo and usually a $5 pint of Guinness $10 for a big burger, fresh fries and beer... That's better than McDonalds!  Tuesday's they have cheap wings and they are pretty good as far as pubs go. Get them dusted. My fav is the mild or honey BBQ and add a side of fresh cut fries for $3. We usually get their Cajun Caesar wrap or BBQ chicken wrap, those have yet to disappoint. 
As for the weekend breakfast, super cheap and actually really good. The eggs Benny is better than some breakfast joints I've been to. 
Give it a try just don't expect high quality dining, expect cheap pub food, good drinks and often good live bands on Fridays. 

One last note, they are often under staffed which sucks so it can be slow service at times but we've come to expect that, it's just nice and cheap and so close to home we don't seem to mind anymore haha."}
{"text":"Everyone is right.  Service is terrible.  Might as well shut this place down.  Worst neighborhood pub anywhere."}
{"text":"Yikes!!!!  I don't take one star reviews lightly, but I can honesty say this place was the worst.  We left in a huff which was not even noticed by the staff as they were too busy with their own personal issues it seems.  My hubby was mad a me for dragging him to this place!!  Would not go again."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere on Thursday good vibe it was karaoke night moderate crowd... however I put down my drink to go out for some fresh air for literally 5 mins when I returned my drink was removed by the waitress and I was not made a new one especially as it was almost full"}
{"text":"I'm shocked to see that the reviews are so low. I discovered this place via Stone Cottage, the much more run down sister pub in Scarborough. I've been here about ten times and each time try something new on the menu and it's always great. The Monday special is $3 cocktails which is great. The staff is a hit or miss and sometimes it can feel you're not getting the best service you could if you were spending more. It's not a big place but I would recommend stopping in to give their food a try before trusting all of the 1 stars reviews."}
