{"text":"We have been dining at the Patio at Las Sendas for 5 years and have always enjoyed the food, atmosphere and Serivce .  Tonight changed our minds, we went for HH and received not so HH results.  My  fish and Chips was more like something out of a frozen fish stick box from your local supermarket. My wife inquired about the hamburger on the HH menu and was told it was very small, so she ordered the $14 burger. Guess what? It was the same size as the HH  burger. To say the least it was a very disappointing meal. We patronage this establishment 30-40 times per year, but tonight is probably the last time we will visit, until the management changes. They have been going down hill for several years now. They change the menu every week, they can't seem to keep the same chefs or servers. The food is less inferior to even the most basic restaurants in the area. We love some of the people there and even they will tell you that management does not listen to the people that keep their doors open. Good bye Las Sendas and we will certainly not be planning our daughters wedding there any more as well.   We asked for a manger but there was not one on duty. Very disappointing!!!  You all should know that we dine out on a regular basis and this is the first time we have complained and posted on yelp. It just takes a lot to push me to this.  Good night!!"}

{"text":"Food was great, dinning room is to small and located next very loud bar.  The bar and dinning room are separated by a thin sliding door and there are no views this is a golf course not a strip mall restaurant."}
{"text":"This used to be good. They changed their menu last year, for the worse. Very few veggie or fish options. Really poor selection for happy hour. Service the last 3 times has been dreadful, slow, unhappy servers. Unlikely we'll go back unless we hear of great changes. It was like eating in Scottsdale - very unfriendly, over priced and mediocre."}
{"text":"After a fun round of golf, hubby and I were STARVING!    Wanting something quick, we ordered four appetizers from happy hour menu, spicy chicken wrap, crispy cauliflower, prime rib sliders and ahi tuna tacos.   A crazy combo, I know, but everything was delicious, especially with each of the sauces.   Food took a little more time than we expected for appetizers, but well worth the wait! Wish more golf courses had as yummy food to enjoy after a fun round of golf!   Service was excellent, even the manager checked with us after the meal to make sure everything was good.   This meal was a great finish to a really fun day!"}
{"text":"Loved the summer special of 3 courses for $30 and for an extra $5 you can pair a wine with salad and another with main course!! The food was very good, service spectacular (ask for Dane!!) and we sat in the very back with high back, comfortable chairs.  But there is no separation between sports bar and restaurant!! We were as far away as possible and the noise from the bar was still disrupting. Wish they had some sort of barrier which could buffer the noise.  After dinner we were surprised with music on the patio. City light view from there is spectacular.  We will visit again."}
