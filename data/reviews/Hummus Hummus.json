{"text":"Food was very good year particularly the chicken shish kebab dark meat was just excellent french fries were good vegetable and the salad was wonderful very large and very tasty thank you"}
{"text":"I wanted a falafel, figured a place with hummus in its title should have falafels and bam! Ended up here lol :P 

They seem to be working out pretty well seeing as they've just re-opened two weeks or so ago, but service is friendly, the seating area looks comfy and has a homely feel to it, and things look promising. 

If you don't like anything else here, you'll like the food. Their hot sauce is delicious (sounds a touch weird for hot sauce, I know) but it had a nice myriad of flavors going on in there that was savory but still spicy. My falafel, though I ate it an hour after I got it (had to go to work) was still delicious, the ingredients obviously fresh and the falafel balls well seasoned. If that's an hour after getting it, I can't imagine how good it'll be if I had eaten it right away! 

Service is good, though I suspect I was talking to the owner, but he takes care of his customers and has a good sense of humor, which is definitely refreshing. 

I'll come back the next time I'm craving a falafel, definitely worth a shot if you're in the area."}
{"text":"What a great find! The food is delicious, fresh, and satisfying! The patio where we sat was so nice, not crowded, and the service was prompt and courteous. I had the chicken kebab and the meat was juicy, tender, and nicely seasoned. The sides were good too. I would definitely be coming back here! We also got take out falafels from here a few times, and they are always delicious! They offer a lot of different salads to choose from to load up your pita which I appreciate. I love that its kosher and very reasonably priced too."}
{"text":"No surprises here. 1 server for the entire room and we've been waiting here for 20 minutes. Apparently it takes 10 minutes just to get a soda. Food is still good but service still sucks. #NoImprovementYet"}
{"text":"I've been here several times and the service is kind of hit and miss. One server asked if our table of 4 was ready to order 5 minutes after we sat down and then told us we could not split the bill at the end. The hours are kind of inconvenient as well (Closing very early Fridays and closed Saturdays).

However the food is really good. If you're craving shwarma this is one of the best in the area. The entrees come with a side of fries and/or house salad, both of which are super delicious. The fries are really crispy and the house salad comes with an amazing vinaigrette dressing. The portions are also fairly large and I always leave feeling stuffed.

Definitely worth the try if you're in the area."}
{"text":"the food here is SO DELISHUZ. I had a fallafel and got to sample some of the many side salads, it is by far the best mediterranean food I have come across in the area. oh and the hummus!! homemade goodness."}
