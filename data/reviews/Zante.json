{"text":"This is a nice little Greek style taverna which tries to give you a sample of Greek cuisine beyond your typical Gyro.  My initial enthusiasm was tempered after seeing all dishes were served with fries and steamed vegetables.  They served toasted bread and olive oil to whet your appetite and you will get a complimentary fresh fruit plate after your meal.  Having been to Greece earlier this year and seeing fries stuffed in the Gyros, I guess I won't criticize meals being served with fries."}
{"text":"Had a reservation, waited an hour and a half. Asked for compensation for the wait because no one offered anything while we were waiting. The owner offered to pay for all our drinks and then when the bill came, charged us for the drinks we ordered. The table sitting next to us called out the owner and expressed that they too, heard that the owner had said he could pay for our drinks given our long wait. 

I have never been spoken to the way in which this owner had spoke to me, especially with a reservation.

While the food was good, I would never want anyone to support such a disrespectful man."}
{"text":"Concierge recommended this place. Got the appetizer special which was really good. More than enough for 2 people. I got the seafood linguine. 1 HUGE shrimp, calamari and 2 big scallops with linguine and tomato sauce. My coworker got the lamb chops. Had a bite and they were really good. Came with veggies. Food was really good. Staff was attentive and very nice.
We both decided this is a hidden gem. I would definitely recommend. Might go back again tomorrow."}
{"text":"not worth the cost of the plate! paid 38$ for a chicken on a plate. no sauce and the vegtables were put on a side plate to share amongst 5 people! i was shocked!. high prices for no reason and waited forever to get served."}
{"text":"Went there for my birthday ! The food was amazing ! So light and fresh . My entire party was very pleased! Would definitely recommend this place :)"}
{"text":"I went here for a friend's birthday. I was hungry when I went and since it is a Greek restaurant I thought I would eat well. I was completely wrong. I ordered a fish plate which was around 35$ and a bottle of wine. First my bottle of wine took 30 minutes to come to the table. The bread on the table ran out because there were maybe 4 pieces of bread in a  basket, the basket was not full. So while we waited I felt comfort in knowing food was coming! Joke was on me! I got a plate with 2  baby carrots 1 baby  piece of broccoli and a piece of fish that was maybe 5 cm long. The best part was when the fries came ( I had already finished my plate of food), since I had a plate I assumed they would come with it. I was wrong, I had to share a small bowl of fries with 2 other girls. How were we supposed to eat fries when our plates where finished? I don't know. I don't suggest this place for food, portions are ridiculous when you look at the price. But I have to say the little food I did have and the few fries were tasty. Just don't go here hungry!"}
{"text":"There for a good time with friends and co-workers we were treated to the best the house had.

We were served with fresh entr√©es including fresh tomatoes, calmare, onions and dips and sauces.

After that the meat came up and included perfectly cooked chicken and lamb.

I must admit I'm not a big fan of lamb but I found myself eating the whole thing and then some. So it was the greatest lamb I ever tasted. This shows the care that put into the pieces, cooking style and preparation.

Finally the meal ended with perfect sugar balls with Greek yogourt and the combination ass exemplary.

Service, speed and cleanliness of the restaurant was flawless.

The only drawback is that this Zante place is far from my place ; )"}
{"text":"We came to Zante where the family rented out the entire restaurant for the evening after their child's baptism. The place is well decorated, very traditional to its Greek culture but with a nice modern touch that feels right. They also have a full bar and a terrace as well. The resto was prepared for the huge party with all the tables in one room and the other wide open for kids to run around and place for adults to access the huge bar. I'm sure this isn't the usual setup but it was nice and roomy.

Our meal consisted of a number of appetizers, I took a few pictures but most of the people didn't want to wait for me to take pictures! I liked their fried eggplant a lot but didn't particularly like their loukaniko (Greek sausage). The tzatziki was very good. Their Greek salad was delicious and tasted very fresh. Their calamari was amazingly good!! My daughter got a plate with chicken and fries and while she didn't eat all of it, my random sampling approved the great taste of their chicken. Very moist and flavorful! We had lamb chops and they were good but somehow I preferred the chicken. For desert we had loukoumades (dough balls with honey) they were OK. I've had much better.

The service was very busy but they still made the magic happen, they were polite and thoughtful.

I really liked my experience at Zante and would recommend others to visit and experience it themselves."}
{"text":"The lamb chops were delicious and so was the swordfish. Not exactly the most exciting place but it has an old fashioned atmosphere, which is nice too. Get there, take your time, and enjoy. The fried vegetables were great as a starter... But I have no idea why they would serve boiled vegetables with our main course. You could at the very least grill them! Mediterranean cuisine should be colorful and exciting! But still, I'll probably be back."}
{"text":"So this restaurant never called back after an online reservation for a group of 10 to tell us they are closed on Sundays. We called in to follow up. The girl who answered the phone pretended they had received the reservation but asked me to spell my name \"again\". A few minutes after we hung up after having confirmed the reservation, we got a call from the same girl saying they are closed on Sundays except for big groups (even though their website and Google says they are open on sundays and closed on mondays). Wasted our time..."}
{"text":"I came here on a double date and it was a good time! We did some shots with the owner and staff. They were all so friendly. There's even a DJ playing! We went on Friday night and it was a pretty empty  but I heard it can get pretty party up in there! This place has a lot of potential. There's a huge dance floor and a terrace outside too. 

We shared the grilled octopus, the fried calamari, the fried zucchini, saganaki, Greek assuages cut up and a salad for entree. Everything was good but my two favorites were the fried zucchini and the calamari. Honestly I've had better grilled octopus elsewhere. 

Then we shared a main of steak cut into pieces and the bass. I enjoyed the steak but I felt the bass was bland. It needed salt for sure. Maybe it was an off night because the couple we went with said usually they love the fish.  I'm not really a fish person though and its rare that I order fish unless it's sushi or tatare or ceviche. We also had a side of potatoes and white asparagus. Damn the white asparagus was so good! I pretty much ate them all myself!! 

For dessert we had the loukoumades which are deep fried balls glazed with honey. It was good but I was so full that I only ate one and didn't even try the other dessert we ordered."}
