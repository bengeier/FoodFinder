{"text":"Drove through for a vanilla cold brew and their almond cherry scone. Both were excellent. The cold brew was bold and smooth with a light sweet cream layer on top. The scone was moist and flavorful. And being a drive through, service was very quick. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Staff is always great and it is the best coffee in town!  I have ordered coffee and scones for a large group (very last minute) and they not only serve me with a smile, the scones are great!"}
{"text":"They have really great coffee here.  Their coffee drinks are almost comparable to Starbucks.  The servers are always friendly and happy to greet you. I like how they also have a drive thru service."}
{"text":"Stopped here because of the Yelp reviews and we were in charge of breakfast for a few of us.  Don't be put off by the fact that they're in a gas station - they have a cute little seating area if you want to stay.  The drive through was busy but there wasn't anyone in line inside. There were several employees bustling around behind the counter but each one was very friendly.  I'm impressed by how they work in such a small space.    They have quite a large menu for being a smaller operation; lots of smoothies and coffee drinks.  We ordered 4 breakfast sandwiches, two scones and a caramel macchiato.  I was really impressed with the drink, it was the perfect amount of sweet.  It take a long time to get the breakfast sandwiches but you could tell they were swamped.  Unfortunately we realized we were shorted two sandwiches when we arrive at our destination so we only got to try the egg white sandwich, blueberry lemon scone and apple crumble scone.  All were delicious, but we agreed that the sandwich wasn't worth the $5.  The meat seemed chewy and there wasn't a lot of flavor.    We returned on our way back through town and before I could even mention that we were shorted two sandwiches, one of the girls at the counter recognized me and offered to rectify the situation.  We were credited our money immediately, which was appreciated.    Will definitely try this place again."}
