{"text":"Two words: super good. I kept passing the signs for sushi and teriyaki and was slightly curious what an old shopping complex in Phoenix could possible have to offer for Japanese food. The teriyaki ( done on the BBQ outside) was tender and moist with a great sauce, and the sushi had great flavor and was definitely fresh ( I know sushi as I have worked in two Japanese restaurants). That being said, I was skeptical when I pulled up, but I realized this is kind of a no-frills, take out kind of place. It definitely lacks any pretentious Asian-style ambiance ( kind of refreshing) but it could be a little nicer if you want to stay for your meal ( they have a few tables) maybe some music? Just a thought.  Anyways, I think this place is great and the service was wonderful. Good people serving good food, what else can you ask for?"}
{"text":"I highly recommend this business. I was skeptical at first, because I have had bad experiences with strip mall sushi places in the past, but this place exceeded my expectations. Very clean environment, super friendly owners and very reasonable prices on great tasting sushi. I'm so glad I gave it a chance!"}
{"text":"Initially, I as others that have reviewed this restaurant were skeptical, understandable as it seems pretty shady as per location and price especially when it comes to raw fish...... But this place is a diamond in the rough and a weekly stop for me. It is  clean, fresh and made to order sushi and meant to go as stated all over his menu and street signs; though if you choose to eat there the owner will accommodate basic needs. Definitely no frills dining but he is still accommodating. He has a ongoing special of 20-30 piece rolls for under $10!!! You can't beat that anywhere and the teriyaki is cooked to order and about $5 with a pile of rice. I definitely recommend calling ahead to pick up your order. As to CAT I ......AND YOUR REVIEW YOU SEEM TO HAVE NOTHING GOOD TO SAY ABOUT ANYWHERE YOU EAT? Oh and FYI ALL FISH HAVE BONES AND THAT IS A RISK REGARDLESS OF EATING ANY ANIMAL. Plus hamachi always has fine bones in it and 99% of the eel is purchased from a vendor so is no fault to the proprietor of the restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is great, it's super close to Joe's restaurant where I work, so it's a great quick meal for when I'm tired of Mexican food. Which happens often. The owner is the one who's working each time I come in, and he's one of the nicest guys I've met. Greets you right away with a smile on your face, and makes the food quick, and always gets exactly what you want. He has some great deals which are worth the money, and the portions are great. It's got a small dining area so it's more of a to-go place, but the best sushi I've had in the valley."}
{"text":"Cheap, tasty - not fancy sushi and they don't seem to have any vegetable dishes,  Take about mostly,  although they have two tables and you can eat there.  Chicken Teriyaki is good - again not fancy but for five bucks it's amazing!  Always fresh.  Friendly, functional staff."}
{"text":"What a huge let down the food is. We ordered four rolls and the chicken teriyaki to go. None of the crab was the real deal, salmon, eel, and tuna all had BONES still in them, and the chicken had no flavor whatsoever.  After reading the great reviews for this place, I was excited to give it a try. Unfortunately, it is the worst sushi Ive had here in the valley."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's good, it's cheap, and the man who owns the restaurant is very friendly and quick. The prices ($10 for a 30 piece California roll) can't be beat!"}
{"text":"The sushi here is fresh and delicious and the prices are great! The owner is really friendly and always seems to be smiling. No frills, no fuss just good food for a good price."}
{"text":"Ok, let's be real. A good sushi restaurant in Phoenix? Hell, even the ones in Ashland aren't that good. So, my family and I are driving back from work and we decide to take the streets through Phoenix and Talent when my daughter notices a sign for sushi special. Thirty pieces of California rolls for $10.00  Well, my first reaction was: \"Can you imagine the kind of sushi that must be if it is only ten bucks?\" We decided it was worth a try and went for it.  Our minds were blown by the quality and freshness of the food, to say nothing of the price. The gentleman running the place was nice, courteous and attentive in a way that the sushi places in Ashland haven't yet figured out. In a matter of 10 minutes he came to our table with a huge plate of California rolls, some wasabi and pickled ginger. It was *delicious.* The old addage about not judging a book by its cover certainly held up at this place.  If that place were a little bit bigger (we were the only ones there, and the place only has one table - it's more of a \"sushi to-go\" place) this guy would make so much money he'd be tripping over it on the way to the kitchen. I hope this restaurant sticks around for a long time."}
{"text":"This is a small, one-man operation (or was when I was there) where the chicken is cooked on a propane grill in front of the store front cafe. Inside the small shop are a couple of tables, a small cooler of drinks and a rack of candies. My guess is that much of his business comes from students are the nearby high school on their lunch break.  The menu includes several types of sushi and teriyaki chicken over rice. I ordered the chicken.  A generous amount of meat was served over lots of rice in a oblong styrofoam container.  Teriyaki is a marinating sauce: the meat should be soaked in it before grilling. At this place, like most such fast food local \"bento\" establishments, the sauce was squirted over the meat and rice before serving. (I don't care for rice saturated with sauce.)"}
{"text":"I love sushi and this place is excellent quality and value.  Great for take out, but I wouldn't want to have a sit down meal here. There are only a few items on the menu, but the specials are awesome. I always go for the 30pc California Roll for $10, and its always been fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"We are new to Phoenix and didn't realize how limited our dining options were. That's how I came across this little place. The  place is tiny inside and ran by the owner. Teriyaki chicken is cooked on the BBQ out front and only $5 so I thought I couldn't go wrong. Also got the \"my roll\" that was on special. The roll was awesome, one of my favorites however the teriyaki chicken could have been better. Chicken itself was yummy but he puts on this glutinous sauce that just looks like teriyaki and cornstarch. The consistency was a major turn off. In a pinch when I'm craving some sushi, yes but I'll get my teriyaki chicken from the grass shack."}
