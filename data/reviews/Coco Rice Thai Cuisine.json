{"text":"After moving out of the delivery zone for Thai Princess (best in the city), my husband and I have been ordering from Coco Rice. It's usually quite alright, a nice pad Thai that doesn't taste too sweet or ketchupy and a decent (albeit not spicy enough) green curry. Lots of shoots in the curry and the coconut beef curry is also delicious.   Tonight however everything was off. The curry sauce had little clumps in it I have no idea what they were but it was very off putting. The pad Thai was incredibly bland.   The price isn't bad but I'd pay more for better quality and consistent food."}
{"text":"My favourite Thai in the city! And luckily for me, it's less than a 2 minute walk from my office. I LOVE their red & green curries.... their spring rolls are also delicious.... you can't go wrong with their lunch specials. SO much food for around 10 bucks."}
{"text":"Watery soup-like curry filled with tough meat. Absolutely no flavour. It was disgusting. We threw it out.   Bland, boring noodles with a small sprinkling of nuts, two shrimp and three cubes of tofu? That's supposed to be Pad Thai?   The springrolls were passable but not enough to even possibly redeem the meal.   On top of it, the restaurant forgot to deliver the rice. When I called I was hung up on four times before I was able to speak to someone who seemed not to care.   She acted like it was our fault - no apology, no promise to make it right. Our two options were to get a restaurant credit for $2.50 or for them to deliver the rice in an hour (we live a five minute drive away). When I asked them to speed up the delivery since it was their fault, the woman I spoke to seemed completely indifferent. Not how you win customers back.   The rice arrived cold, gluey and almost inedible. Coupled with the disgusting curry, it was probably one of the worst things i have ever eaten. I had two bites and threw the rest out.   We will not be back. The combination of terrible food and horrible customer service made this place one of our worst restaurant experiences in Toronto."}
{"text":"Coco rice is a good choice when it comes to Thai cuisine especially if you consider getting bang for your buck.  Essentially you can't go wrong eating here.  Another few things to point out is the amazing red curry sauce they make and I highly recommend getting a side of the coco rice which they usually even put a cute little heart..   GO TRY IT"}
{"text":"The restaurant atmosphere is ok, bit quiet and bland but ok. I've never seen it super busy.   I tend to have takeout and the food is consistently good.  Sometimes it is really, really good. Generally it's fresh tasting, good portion sizes and the right amount of spice (to my tastes anyway!). Delivery is always fast.   The salads aren't that great but I love the mango curry and peanut curry. The Thai beef is also really deelish."}
{"text":"Went here with a friend who had been before - we're staying just down the block.  We went in at an odd time, 1630 on a weekday and it was completely dead. You would think that would mean the server would be able to pay attention to us but not so.  She took our orders and returned very quickly with my mango salad roll (i think it was called the rockin' salad roll) it was 6.95 and came with 4 very small salad rolls that I couldn't really find the mango in.    Our food was next, Panang Curry for me and Pad Thai for my friend.  I rather liked my Panang curry - good depth of flavor and cute presentation - the rice came in a star shaped mound, and my friend enjoyed her Pad Thai.   My water ran out pretty early into the meal but our waitress was nowhere to be found until the very end.   You're probably wondering why the one star for good food and bad service... Well, when my dining companion went to the bathroom, the other server (not our one) was in using the adjacent bathroom stall while on the the phone, and walked out, still on the phone, without washing her hands. My friend walked out to see her handling cutlery and arranging place settings. So, there you go. A bit unappetizing to say the least."}
{"text":"Today we ordered delivery for 10ppl for lunch.  Food was decent and arrived on time.  One thing I find odd - they don't have their hours listed on their website!  The chicken penang was good, dare I say comparable to Salad King?!  Pad thai left much to be desired - didn't have much flavor and pretty skimpy on toppings (ie. the stuff you're paying for - chicken, shrimps, etc.).  Mango salad was good (but I'm always a little miffed when the menu says \"green mango salad\" when the mango was obviously not green!!).  Vegetarian Thai Basil Noodles was bland and boring (I wouldn't order it again).  The coconut sticky rice w/ mango (although it came w/ pineapple instead of mango) was ok....although it tasted a little salty.  Verdict - I'd order it again since its close to the office and they deliver.    I can't give it a great rating since I haven't eaten in the restaurant yet.  So it will have to be 3 stars for now."}
{"text":"Good food and attentive wait staff. Reasonably price. The mango curry is yummy. I'll definitely go back"}
{"text":"This places used to be amazing 3 years ago lately it's been just bad. Bad service and bad food. The last 3 times haven't even finished my meal. They seem to run out of ingredients last night I order curry which should have had snowpeas it had peas and maybe 2 prices of chicken. Also the portion of rice seemed smaller. Time for new management!!   The price grossly outweighs what you get and it's not even that expensive."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery once from here. If you enjoy good Thai food then don't eat here. It's quite basic and had minimal flavour. I prefer spots like Pai, Sukhothai, and Khao San Road. Stick to the best. It's too mediocre here."}
{"text":"The food is well-made and flavorful. Service is quick (especially if you're picking up -- it's usually ready in 10 minutes or less) and friendly.   Orange Cashew Nut Beef is my favorite."}
{"text":"The lunch specials are a good deal: $10 (including tax) for soup, a spring roll, and a large amount of tasty food.  My leftovers from yesterday made up my lunch today, and I'm still replete!  Service is fast, too--we called in our orders and picked them up barely twenty minutes later.  Recommended!"}
{"text":"This place has really gone downhill. Not sure if there has been a change in management but quality has really suffered. Went yesterday night. We found a hair on the plate. The utensils were greasy and one of the forks had rice sticking to them. The waitress was pretty matter of fact about these things as if they were not really important things - no apology for that. We ordered 3 dishes - jungle curry with rice. seafood fried rice and  glass noodles. really tasteless food  with fish/meat having no real flavour as if just thrown in last minute and mixed in. really disappointed as I really enjoyed the food on previous occasions. Not sure if this was because we were the last customer and the whole staff only seemed to be focused on closing and getting out of the restaurant Very disappointed"}
{"text":"Very small portions for how expensive it is and the food made me so sick holy moly. I'd suggest going somewhere else haha"}
{"text":"I used to work in the offices across the street from Coco Rice. It's safe to say that it was our favourite place to call for delicious and affordable Thai cuisine. Anyone who is a fan of Thai food will will not be disappointed with Coco Rice. The lunch specials are especially attractive as they come with a spring roll with dipping sauce and a salad (house salad or pineapple/mango salad) and a very generous helping of the main dish...all for under $10!!  You gotta try the Garlic Chicken with Rice on the Friday lunch special...paired with a pineapple/mango/sweet red pepper salad and you've died and gone to heaven.  Whether you're ordering out or dining in, Coco rice provides fast and friendly service. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Super greasy, tofu was hard (not fully cooked), portions are small (takeout), noodles were all stuck together and hard to eat.   Would not order from here again. The food did not look like the photos posted here.  This might be one of those restaurants that you can dine in only at."}
{"text":"DO NOT ORDER DELIVERY! This was probably the biggest rip off I have ever received while ordering delivery from anywhere in the city. I spent approximately $38 on hot and sour soup, a glass noodle dish, and a beef green curry and the amount of food that arrived was less than you would get for $10 at any bad Thai place. There wasn't enough food for a minnow. Be warned, this is the worst deliver in the city. To top it off, the food was mediocre at best."}
{"text":"Amazing service and food. Coco rice with Thai grilled chicken and Mango curry would come back again"}
{"text":"My go to Friday night take out dinner.  Having traveled to Thailand 8 times I love the food.  My Coco Rice favourites are spring rolls, green mango salad, Thai grilled chicken, and sticky rice.  Also, the curries (golden curry especially) and the mixed vegetables are very good.  The lunch specials are a great deal. My favourite part....on the phone they say 45-1 hour for delivery and it is always here within 10 minutes!"}
{"text":"Whoa! Where do I even start with this place. It's amazing! It's definitely my new favourite Thai restaurant.  The restaurant is clean. Nothing fancy. The only thing I don't like about this place is the giganto ugly fish in the fish tank :-/  On my recent visit here, I had the veggie spring rolls and Coco Green Curry.  The spring rolls were better than at most places - they were packed with veggies and were uber crispy on the outside. The sweet/tangy sauce they serve with the spring rolls is also very good. It tasted like it had hints of orange in it.  Now, the Coco Green Curry - not the regular green curry, which I'm sure is great. But the Coco Green Curry. Where do I even begin? It was amazing. It has chunks of fresh coconut meat, slices of Thai baby eggplant, basil leaves, and other delicious ingredients. Such an amazing compilation of flavours with just the right amount of heat offset by the coconut milk. Just simply amazing.  Most places, I'll order a curry and wish I got noddles instead, but this place, I felt like I was going to explode, I was so full, but I just wanted to finish all the food in my plate - it really was THAT GOOD!  I highly, highly recommend it. It's my new favourite Thai place. What are you waiting for? Go! Eat! :)"}
{"text":"Small but delicious vegan menu plus other vegan/vegetarian options available which I really appreciate. The food is fantastic and the service is memorable/friendly. Been here only three times buy they already remember us and our orders, which was pretty nice."}
{"text":"Excellent lunch specials, affordable, good quality. Friendly fish is there to greet you at the entrance. Tea comes in an elephant shaped pot. Can order online and pay when you pick up."}
{"text":"It was my first time visiting this restaurant and I ordered food for take out since I was in the neighbourhood.  For a Friday night it was not busy at all, only one table of two that were dining and a couple of people there for pickup orders.  I've passed by this restaurant occasionally throughout the week and never seen it busy, so am surprised they're still in business.  Usually for first time visit, I like to order standard food which represents the cuisine because it tells a lot if the restaurant can make a simple dish or not.  I ordered the tom yum soup and pad thai which were both very disappointing in presentation and taste.  The tom yum soup was basically cooked vegetables and tofu in hot water with some bit of spices for flavouring.  I couldn't taste the lemongrass at all and usually the broth would be flavourful.    The pad thai looked very unappetizing with only two shrimps, a wedge of lime, and a slice of orange for colouring. The dish just looked like a bunch of noodles with a somewhat healthy display of tofu and chicken, hardly any green onions or coriander with sparse amounts of peanuts and bean sprouts in the corner of the container. I wished I had taken a photo, but I was just so displeased with the appearance that it wasn't worth a picture as it looked so blah.  I hardly managed to even make a small dent to the pad thai dish as I just couldn't continue eating because it was very bland and noodles were all clumped together.  I hate wasting food and the pad thai was not even worth passing along to anybody, so it was $10.95 that was definitely wasted.  Overall, it was a very disappointing experience and I probably would have had better food if ordered from Thai Express instead.  Perhaps I should have ordered a rice dish because of the name Coco Rice, maybe that's their specialty, but not sure if I even want to attempt any other dish from here.  One star for convenient location, and second star for friendly service upon entering the restaurant with quick and efficient ordering time."}
{"text":"Very disappointed.  I ordered the green chicken curry and it was watery, flavourless and barely had any vegetables (or chicken for that matter). Since I ordered delivery and had to meet the 20$ minimum, I added the shrimp rolls which were just fine but definitely overpriced. In the end (after tax, tip etc), I ended up spending $33 on garbage food. What a waste."}
{"text":"Love this place. Ive been several times, the food is always great and the service very friendly and fast. Mango Salad is a great starter and a really good portion for 2-3 people to share. The lamb skewers and the Tom Yom soup are delicious. For entrees, the Pad See Ew and the Basil Pad Thai are a must try."}
{"text":"I get the lunch special on thursdays, garlic pork is my favorite, and great service :)"}
{"text":"Dropped by Coco Rice for a late night dinner with my date last night.  I have heard good things about Coco Rice based on my sister's and now my date's recommendation.  My date and I were not super hungry so we decide to share one of their dinner specials.  We ordered Dinner Remarkable which included 1) Pad Thai 2) Spring Roll 3) 3 Chicken Won-tons 4) Mango Salad  all for $12.95!  My date was craving some Tom Yum soup and ordered a bowl to share.  The food was fresh and delicious.  I really liked the pad thai, it was fully of texture and flavour.  The Tom Yum soup hit the spot, it was warm and comforting.  Service was quick, right after we ordered, our salad was on our table.  It was like they read our minds!  I will definitely be back at this location or order take-out!"}
{"text":"When I need some comfort food I go with Coco Rice. Delivery is fast, 40 minutes max.   If you are vegan, get the vegetable 'n' tofu golden curry with jasmine rice!!!!! The spring rolls are good too but i'm not 100% sure what they are deep-fried in so get the garden/salad rolls if you want to be sure it's 100% vegan. i've never had their pad thai but they have a vegetable option.   i've only ever had delivery so i can't comment on the atmosphere.  WARNING: If you get any of the curry dishes, be careful when you open the containers, sometimes they are too full and spill over when you try to open it. only reason why they don't get 5 stars!"}
{"text":"This was a quick and authentic meal. Green Curry was delicious. Very small portions in comparison to other Thai restaurants. Service was friendly."}
{"text":"Get delivery- food is always good n reliable. I love the coconut curry and the thin noodles best."}
{"text":"I love ordering for delivery from here.  I like to try new things when I'm on unfamiliar territory but I cannot help but to order their grilled meats.  Their grilled beef and pork are always the first items to be finished when I order this (eaten by 3-4 people).  The meat is marinated well and always cooked nicely (even if it takes 10 minutes to reach me, it's not over done).  The red curry duck is flavorful but I do not recommend ordering this unless you're not really craving duck as it's hard to find in the dish.  My family loves their Special House Fried Rice with Pineapple, where you do not find weird leftovers thrown in as sometimes done with Fried Rice.  Lamb skewers are good enough that you might shove the skewer in by accident when trying to hog one of them.  I strongly recommend trying this place.  I wouldn't know authentic Thai food if it hit me in the face but if I've been fooled, then I don't mind wearing the clown shoes!"}
{"text":"Very beautiful place. I love the décor. It has that authentic feel to it. The food was delicious. The veggie summer rolls were the best. I loved how they put big chucks of tofu in it and basil. My green curry veggie was so good. It tasted fresh and the vegetables were nice and crunchy, just the way it should be. Next time I go, I want to try more items. I am definitely curious about the mango sticky rice. It is worth the trip. The service was very attentive too."}
{"text":"I arrived to Toronto late on a weeknight and STARVING. This lovely spot was only a block away from my condo and was a welcome respite. The menu is expansive. The staff was lovely. The food was delicious!  I ordered a delicious veggie rice dish and some veggie rolls thinking I might have some left over. Nope gobbled everything down. Loved that my rice was presented having been turned out of a star shaped mold.   There were lots of takeout orders, but those dining in weren't neglected. Definitely tasty. Plus they were offering a 10% discount for cash the night I was there."}
{"text":"Ordered off skip the dishes recently and was disappointed. Portions were tiny!! Pad Thai sauce was somehow too sour with not much chicken, and curry was tasty but the size was so small compared to most Thai restaurants with big portions for cheap.   Many better Thai options around with bigger portions."}
{"text":"When I actually saw this place I thought it was new until I saw that there are reviews going back earlier this year.  So it seems no matter how often I walk past a place I only notice things at night when the lights are on so here is where me and a friend from Vancouver went for dinner.  Inside it is nice enough, very casual dining but a decent enough menu with the usual options you would come to expect in a Thai restaurant.  I order a Lamb Tamarind curry and my friend a thai red curry. The dishes came out quick enough and presented well but neither had that WOW factor.  The lamb tamarind curries flavour was weak and the actual lamb lacked flavour and the small sample I had of my friend's red curry was also not amazing compared to some of the hole in the wall places I have tried."}
{"text":"Had debated trying this place for about a year before I went in... mainly because 1) figured it would cost more on my lunch hour than the next door fast food joints and 2) wasn't sure if the atmosphere would be the type of place where you just stop in by yourself to grab a cheap sit-down meal.   But I am glad I eventually just went in.  Friendly, standard service.  Greeted immediately the two times I've gone in alone.  Choice of table at front or in back (long narrow design) with a cool fish aquarium, typical Thai decor.  Good spring rolls.   Good veg basil Thai noodle.  Better veg Thai spicy noodles.    Will have to get delivery from this place at work since we've given up our other regular Thai delivery place (after too many wrong orders)."}
{"text":"I love this place, it is close and has a big variety of delicious food! Prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Years ago, I went here for lunch and didn't remember it as being remarkable but middle of the road. I'm like that kid that sticks their finger in the light socket, gets a shock and then forgets and does it again. Now that I'll have a record of my impression of this place, I will remember not to give it another chance. I had take out lunch here with my co-workers. I ordered the cashew tofu and asked to subsitute rice with noodles. It comes with a pumpkin soup and a spring roll. Not a bad deal! I had a feeling the soup broth was probably chicken stock-based but I pretended to be ignorant. The spring roll was probably the best part of the meal though it was weird that they just slopped it on top of my main meal so it got a bit soggy.  The cashew tofu had large chunks of shredded orange with their peels still on embedded in the food. Sure, you can't eat items like bay leaves or for carnivores, bones but I don't really feel like fishing out large chunks of orange peel in my food. I'm lazy, man!  The cashew dish tasted way too fishy for my liking. I know a lot of Thai places use fish sauce in their food (again, I feign ignorance) but I don't want it to be the main flavour of the dish. gross! Must remember not to try this place again! No more shocks to my delicate palate."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Thai restaurant, their phad thai is amazing, their green curry is great, and their spring rolls are best I've ever had. The spring rolls are always so hot and oily, I think it's that extra unhealthyness that adds so much flavor to them.  If you're hungry make sure you get the take out instead of dining in, for some reason their takeout portions are about twice the size as what they serve on their plates if you eat inside the restaurant."}
{"text":"This review is a little late as we ordered delivery a few months ago. But both my boyfriend and I were blown away by the quality of the food. The green curry was amazing, there were tons of delicious thai veggies in every dish and they delivered fast. So much better than ordering from Spring Rolls and cheaper, too. The appetizer platter is great if you can't decide what to start with."}
{"text":"This place is tasty and delicious. I ordered the house green curry, and the flavor was mouth watering. It even had real coconut in it, which i never seen or tasted before. Easily recommend this place to anyone who enjoys Thai food, or even trying Thai for the first time. This place will get you hooked to Thai cuisine. I can't wait to go again and try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Really good pad thai!  Service is sometimes slow, but it is consistently polite.   The prices are much less than most sit down places in the area."}
{"text":"I was keen to try this place for sometime. I decided to pick up food. As I entered the empty restaurant during weekend lunch hours, the hostess was helpful and knowledgable about the extensive menu.   I ordered Spicy Thai Noodles with Vegetables and Pad Chaa, the food was ready in no time.  The Noodles and Vegetables came separately and could be mixed as per your taste. The spice level was low and the vegetables were full of flavor.  Pad Chaa Vegan version had perfectly balanced taste. I had BBQ tofu for the first time and it was very well done.  I will definately try this place again, so much to choose from!"}
{"text":"Just ok Thai, there are much better places like khar San road or Pai. In downtown toronto"}
{"text":"Got takeout from here the other day. Everything we ordered was really good. Pad Thai was good - good flavour, good colour and good quality chicken inside. Ginger beef was also really good and great flavour. Green curry chicken, flavour was amazing but it was just chicken and bamboo strips, no vegetables not even a hint. My only problem is that the portions were the smallest I have ever seen for a takeout restaurant. Usually I get waaaaayy more food for my money so I was a little unhappy with that. We ordered a sticky rice and it was hardly more than like 3 tablespoons of rice!!! But maybe that is what you get if you want the quality of the food to be better as it was."}
{"text":"Great spot for takeout in the King/Bathurst area. Some dishes can be hit or miss (for example - the Jungle soup is way too watery), but there are also some gems, including the papaya salad, glass noodle salad, red/green curries, and the Thai basil noodles. They have a really good vegan menu too."}
{"text":"2.5 stars, really. Happy the vegan menu exists. Everything was quickly and efficiently delivered. Unfortunately everything was really salty and greasy and I didn't feel so great after my dinner here."}
{"text":"Coc-Rice has the best Khao Soi in town. :) My boyfriend and I go there about once a month.  The restaurant has a cute interior decor, service is pretty quick and the staff is nice. Bonus point for the very awkward looking gigantic fish!"}
{"text":"My two friends and I were at their condo at Fort York and Lakeshore on a snowy day when we decided to order delivery. We ordered: Pad Thai, Basil Curry, Spicy Basil Chicken, Chicken Pad Thai, Fresh Shrimp Rolls and sticky rice (at least $50 worth of food). The curry was around $9.95 so we assumed it would come with rice but it didn't! When our order came and we had noticed only our side of rice, I called back to double check that their main curry dish or chicken dish didn't come with rice. The manager was rude and short with me on the phone when he explained that no other Thai restaurant served rice with their curry dish either (that would be a lie). Long story short, the servings are small, the dishes are over priced, the service is terrible, the curry doesn't come with rice and the taste is nothing special at all. Wouldn't come here again."}
{"text":"Had the Tom Yum soup and it was amazing!!!  Also, their egg rolls are so yummy!!!"}
{"text":"Decent is the word of the day.  Restaurant interior? Decent. Food quality? Decent. Pricing? Decent. Location? Decent. Service? Decent.  We dined on both their regular pad thai and the basil pad thai (spoiler alert, the basil pad thai is way better if you like spice) with some bottles of Singha beer to wash it down. It was all, in fact, decent.  Nothing was great, nothing was bad, so yeah. 3 stars for decency."}
{"text":"There are many a Thai restaurant in Toronto. Not all of them make tasty Thai food. Coco RIce does.   I've been here a handful of times for work related functions and I've always been very pleased with the service and the food. Their lunch specials are filling and quite delicious. I stick to my favourite pad Thai and they do a good job - the sauce is rich and sweet and tasty. They don't skimp on the shrimp either! Their spring rolls are also really delicious and served with a sweet and spicy dipping sauce.   This is the real deal. Great Thai food at great prices right in King West. The decore is kitch but authentic and the service is always fast and friendly. For good cheap Thai eats, this is the place to be."}
{"text":"Reliable thai takeout in the kingwest area. The thai curries are quite nice and they will make the dishes as spicy as you like.  The lunch specials are priced right!"}
{"text":"We had satay  chicken, schrimp chips, mango salad for starters and basil pad Thai,  pad Thai,  pineapple fried rice and red currie beef with coconut rice. Authentic taste and excellent service. They really care about you! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Hit this place up early on Friday evening...the place was pretty quiet (with the exception of the screaming, free-range child, but that's another issue entirely).    LM and I ordered a papaya salad, chicken skewers and sticky rice.   The food was flavourful, and the serving sizes were sufficient.  My only issue with this place was the fact that it was pretty dead in there...cue tumbleweeds...and yet, the service was extremely slow.  The menu listed a ton of lunch and dinner specials, combos etc and their prices were reasonable.  I would have to say though that the menu offerings were limited and I had hoped to see more variety.  The decor was alright, but could use some updating. Loved the fish tank at the entrance to the restaurant (and apparently so did the screaming free-range child).  I might go back, but it's not going to be one of my usual haunts."}
{"text":"Hands down one of my fav thai places to order from. Curry pad thai, red curry beef are my fav dishes there. Delivery is always prompt and atmosphere in restaurant is pleasant, I've taken out of towners visiting me and they have enjoyed the feel of the place.   Great lunch specials - portions on dinner and lunch are generous. I think this place is great value for the quality of food you're getting. I can often feed 4 friends generously on $40 worth of food."}
{"text":"This place is so amazingly good you have to eat here! It's very authentic Thai, nothing like spring rolls or the other American-Thai places. Get the green curry or anything with coconut milk the food is 4/5 (for take out) and the price is 6/5 ( so cheap). We live close so I may be bias, but delivery is always less than half hr. They don't speak the best English when you order, but that's a good sign for authenticity. Deal with it. Lol.   I wholly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great food- had mango chicken and dinner combo . Quiet on a Friday night , fair prices."}
{"text":"The delivery was super fast, and the nice lady even called to informed us that we had made a mistake on our online order. So the service is pretty good. But oh the food..... Our 2 curry dishes arrived in appetizer-sized containers which is just embarrassing. On top of that, the food looked like left-overs, with thin sauce and almost no content. The Jungle Chicken Curry is practically just a water down soup with scrape meat...And the Panang Peanut Curry with Tofu and Veggie had 2 mini pieces of broccoli and the tiniest tofu cubes.....  We ordered delivery because there are so many good comments about this place, so i'm really not sure why the quality is so low. Maybe it's just the delivery orders?"}
{"text":"Good option for vegetarians and vegans with an extensive menu. I ordered dinner and noted that they have moderately priced lunch specials but it appears that only one option per day is veggie/vegan so keep that in mind if you're looking for a midday deal.  My favorite dish was the Bangkok Market Tofu'n'Taro appetizer, which as the name indicates features generous portions of fried tofu and taro. I had never tasted fried taro, and it definitely outshone the ho hum tofu as it was perfectly crisp and subtly sweet, pairing well with the light dipping sauce.  I also tried the Pad Chaa, but was not pleased with the bland sauce or the texture of the fake BBQ meat. The accompanying rice tasted off to me, so unfortunately I ended up not eating it. There are so many menu choices, there must be better options for a main course."}
{"text":"Coco Rice has got to be one of the most hit and miss restaurants I've ever been to. I've come here quite a few times given that our office is the next door over and I've had great meals here and I've had some of the worst Thai food in my life here.  They have the standard thai selection (from noodles to curries to soups and grilled selections and spring rolls) but the only time I can convince myself to come is for lunch where $10 will get you a spring roll, main, and a soup or mango salad! The service is fine as well but I just can't get over how inconsistent they are.  I'd much rather take the 10 minute walk over to Khao San Road and get the best thai in the city!   But then again... this IS next door - I guess that's why I'm the duke of this place (for now *sigh*)."}
{"text":"This is the best local Thai. Food served hot and everything is delicious. Crab Rangoon is to die for. Great selection of vegan items on their menu also. What blew me away was the servers honesty when I accidentally tipped 150% on my bill without noticing - she checked with me to see if that was correct and refunded me the extra amount!!"}
{"text":"This place used to be a little hole-in-the-wall diner owned by a Polish (I think) family that served up decent food and had a menu that was so unchallenging you could take your parents there without question.  It has since changed hands and CoCo Rice now stands with some old and new thrown in.  It is a great Thai restaurant with a fantastic tasty menu, and a mish-mash of décor of new Thai influences and old hold-overs from the previous restaurant.  There's good luck cats, a fish tank, and fliers and posters of various Thailand destinations.  There is still the old faux-gold leaf table tops and booth upholstery that has nothing as much to do with Thailand, as much as it would probably cost a bundle to redo all of the seating.  For the food you're getting, you can put up with the furniture.  Sit-in dining is obviously encouraged, but I'm a huge fan of the fly-by take-out on my way home.  Typical order is the Pad Thai and a draft Amsterdam Blonde (the only tap beer they have) while I wait.  I always seem to make that mistake, as I'm usually about four sips in when the food arrives.  And folks, I'm not a slow drinker.  Unless swamped by a full dining room and a large number of delivery orders, you'll not be left waiting long.  If you are, there's tons of Thailand tourism magazines to thumb through.  That or you can make faces at the fish.  The wait staff will just laugh at you...so I'm told."}
{"text":"Oh my - how the mighty have fallen. The prices have gone up and the portion sizes have the stayed the same. HOWEVER most portion is now cheap veggie filler with so little protein even a diligent scan will yield only 6 or 7 pieces of meat / shrimp. This was my go to place but no more. The second star was for the food flavour which has remained good but the value for money if right down the toilet."}
{"text":"The sign doesn't do much to tell you it's a Thai restaurant (if you're not looking carefully. It does say 'Thai Cuisine' on it), but this sometimes forgotten spot offers up some of the only true Thai options in this part of the King West neighborhood.   The interior is well appointed, spacious and comfortable. There's a bar, a TV, and booths to sit in with a glance of the action on the street to be had.   I went with a date, and both is of us ordered the Pad Thai. As an appetizer, we got the feel fried spring rolls. The rolls arrived quickly and were tasty, but not out of this world or really special like ones I've had at Pai or Suko Thai. My date thought the same, although points are awarded for the serving size (4 rolls instead of the customary 2-3). Next up, the Pad Thai. It was surprisingly good, considering the underwhelming nature of the spring rolls. Both were very good save for one thing: underwhelming flavor. At first we commented that the tamarind wasn't too sweet as it often is and that was a good quality, but upon reflection (at least on my part) the flavor was understated and needed a bit more of the customary sweetness commonly found in this sauce. NOT ketchup, but sweetness.   Anyhow, besides this the food was great as was the service. Waitress was friendly, helped with menu selections and the food arrived quickly. As an added bonus, the Pad Thai was only $10.99! You won't find a better deal anywhere else (serving was a bit smaller but generous, still).   I'd definitely say it's worth a visit."}
{"text":"I went here last weekend, thinking that a neighbourhood fixture like this would either be tired and mediocre, or a gem of a place.  Luckily, it seems to be the latter -- the food was so tasty I'm still thinking about it!    We had a vegetable pad see-ew, and a shrimp curry with the eponymous coconut rice.  Fresh ingredients, perfectly balanced flavours, awesome tofu texture and not-too-oily noodles.   Reasonable prices and quick and friendly service to boot."}
{"text":"this place is the best for late night work delivery!  the house spring rolls are durrrty yums, the house pad thai is a winner and super filling, and the thai shrimp chips with peanut sauce are an awesome way to round out a meal.  really can't go wrong with the super affordable prices the deliciousness all around. be forewarned huge portions, you'll be full after."}
{"text":"The food is really great. The pad see ew is nice - not so authentic but definitely hits the spot. The crab rangoon appetizer is to die for.. and the currys are great! Def worth trying. The ambiance is nice too - they have a tatooed fish in the tank ;)"}
{"text":"Service was extremely slow, restaurant wasn't busy. Took forever to ask for drinks order and food order. Red curry chicken was terrible, chicken tasted like stale microwaved leftovers."}
{"text":"Located a block away from where I used to work, I would go to/take out from Coco Rice at least once a week. Their lunch menu offers a variety during the week, but I'd often look forward to Mondays so that I could order my favourite Peanut Curry beef--amazing creamy, peanutty goodness! Included in the lunch specials are a soup or salad, a spring roll and rice. Their Tom Kha soup is my favourite, and their mango salad is fairly decent. When it isn't Monday, a good fall back is any of their other curries (red is my next favourite), as well as their fried rice. Their Pad Thai is average, but their whole menu is pretty good, and fairly priced. So far, my favourite Thai restaurant."}
{"text":"We got the Pad Thai, Chicken Fried Rice, and Jungle Curry. All of it was good. Not the best Thai I've had but quite good, and the prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"I ordered the pad Thai and the vegetable broccoli. The pad Thai was so bland and I paid extra for shrimp. There were two pieces.  And in the vegetable dish, there were two (2)  pieces of broccoli and about 7 mushrooms. It was sad.  Honestly, I am so tired of takeout places who send the smallest pieces and charge 30+ dollars"}
{"text":"Had a Tom Yum soup and grilled chicken. Soup had 4 shrimps and tiny mushrooms and that was it. Nothing like the ones you will see in pictures when you google tom yum soup. Over priced and disappointing. Grilled chicken was all right but rice was extra. For the price, they should include rice since the chicken portion is small."}
{"text":"This place is by far my fav for Thai food!  I've only ordered take out and have yet to eat in the restaurant. The take out protons are a little small however the tastes is well worth it if you love spicy food."}
{"text":"Added an allergy note with my order (online and called to confirm over the phone) and it was still not followed properly. Had an allergic reaction and called the restaurant to clarify - they offered no apology or compensation for their error. Will not be ordering from here again - not the best place to order from if you have any kind of allergy."}
{"text":"This is pretty good Thai restaurant for Toronto area. Not the best but I haven't found anything better (I know that there should be somewhere). Location is great, the prices are decent and the food is good enough. I do have little issue with customer service - the server never smiles, is friendly but seems a bit cold, and the food is very spicy. I mean, there is no chili sign on most curries, but they are prety spicy, not even mild. I prefer Thai or Indian restaurants were they ask \"How spicy would you like your curry?\" Not here, just very spicy curry, no exceptions. Other than that the food is really good, I tried couple of dishes and they were all pretty good: - Red Curry - delicious but very spicy (4/5) - Tom Kha soup - very flavorful and good (5/5) - Mango Sauce Veggies - was just okay (2/5) - Mixed Vegetables - tasty but too much garlic (3/5) - Golden Yellow Curry was too oily and too much turmeric taste/color (1/5) - Coco Rice - heavy rice, cooked in coconut milk (3/5) - Fresh Rolls - pretty small but tasty (with peanut sauce) (4/5) I would prefer if the rice was included in price. The rice portion ($2.00) is a bit too small, have to order another portion for curry dishes. At least for me - because the red curry sauce was too spicy. Also, the last time we went there, the customer service was pretty bad. The waitress forgot to bring napkins, forks, spoons, side plates, she also forgot to bring the bill when we asked and never came up to check if we would like something else, if everything is okay."}
{"text":"Their lunch specials are pretty good.  I've been here multiple times and all of the lunch meals are good.  Service is pretty fast, and their curry is good.  The only thing I'm not too fond about is the pad thai.  I would go there again."}
{"text":"Service is a little slow. Menu looks good and is well done, a little large and takes up plenty of table space. Got the Thai curry fried rice, fresh and good but very salty. No AC was as hot as a sauna. Refilled water often."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, it's always been satisfying,  but never note worthy, until today!   This place is probably a 3.5/5 that I just bumped up to 4, because I just had possibly the best pad see ew ever. (Now granted it might be a fluke because like I said I've eaten here before and never felt compelled to write about it...but today, spot on!) There was enough sauce on the noodles without it being overwhelming, or too little that it's dry. The chicken was cooked well without being rubbery or dry.   The Chicken Pad Thai,  standard, it's not ketchupy, but not amazing.   Portions are decent (about 2 servings a dish).:"}
{"text":"So-so Thai place. I had the green curry chicken and it was alright not too much meat and a bit watery. Service was good and fast if you want a quick bite. Next time I will likely try to pad Thai as it looked quite good."}
{"text":"Online ordering is quick & easy. Food arrived in good time. Only complaint is that the portions are a little small compared to what you're used to seeing at Thai places.  They were excellent with food allergies! I'll definitely order again based on this alone :)"}
{"text":"Ordered the Seafood Coco Platter for delivery, the food came slightly warm.  There were calamari, two shrimp cold rolls, two shrimp spring rolls, and four mussels with some salad.  The calamari was not the normal ring cut but a long curly shape instead.  It was less crispy than expected yet still flavourful.  The shrimp cold rolls tasted fresh and were stuffed with aromatic herbs.  The shrimp rolls were quite interesting take on deep fried shrimps.  Tasty but a bit too much shell near the tails. The mussels were topped with some curry sauce, they were delicious as well.  This meal had made me want to actually dine in the restaurant and taste their food while it is still piping hot, I bet it'll be a even better experience."}
{"text":"This is my absolute favourite takeout Thai in Toronto, hands down. I moved into the area last fall and immediately fell in love with their basil pad thai. While I've only eaten in twice (and it was totally fine!), I love their takeout.  Ordering online is so easy, food is ready quickly. The spring rolls are delicious and crispy, the basil pad Thai is full of flavour and spice and all the bits that make pad Thai real.  Often at other restaurants I get a pad Thai which is just noodles, sauce and the protein of my choice. Here you get green onion, shoots, tofu, spice chili etc etc.  Looking forward to my next order!"}
{"text":"went to this place cuz it's right across from my work plus i was craving rice. the service was speedy - got my meal within 5 minutes! i got the lunch special which was green curry chicken and it came with a spring roll plus a choice of salad or soup. i got the salad and it was salad of the day: pineapple salad. the lunch special cost $10.25 and the portion is moderate. i like the fact that they have multiple options for their daily specials. i didn't dine in but the decor was contemporary and clean. i don't have a lot of bad thing to say about the quality of the food, except that the spring roll was okay. i thoroughly enjoyed my meal.  the pineapple salad was refreshing and the combined flavours of sweet and savoury was perfection. it came with big chunks of pineapple, red onions, red bell peppers, cilantro and sprinkles of chopped peanut.  the green curry chicken was super creamy and flavourful! there were strong hints of coconuts, and lime leaves. a tons of of chicken pieces and bamboo shoots. and the good part is that it came with rice on the side  i didn't have high expectations coming here but obviously i was wrong. would definitely go here again!"}
{"text":"Not bad but nothing special!  Dropped in for a light dinner with LG. We are still on detox from Greece, so we tried to order healthy. Papaya salad, chicken satay skewers and a sticky rice to share.  Everything was OK, pretty standard Canadian-Thai food. Papaya salad should have been more spicy, but I have to remind myself I'm not in Thailand.  Service was adequate - considering we were the only table dining, they could have been a bit more attentive, but it was alright.  Menu was missing some of my favourite Thai items, where was the LAAP/LARB ??? Sigh"}
{"text":"What a bust. Feeling sick and unable to make dinner I'd figure we'd order out. Everything sucked. I got  60. Green Curry Coconut milk, basil leaves, sweet peppers, bamboo shoots & green peas - yeah it was missing the sweet peppers and green peas. It was just bamboo shoot curry with chicken.  20. Hot 'n Sour Soup Hot 'n sour broth with tofu, bamboo shoots, black mushrooms, black pepper & egg - more like sour and sour soup. Disgusting. There was a microscopic amount of the black mushrooms. 33. Thai Spicy Noodles Rice noodles with Thai sweet basil sauce, onion & sweet peppers Whatever, I give up.  I wouldn't give these people my money again."}
{"text":"I have had the best wings and Thai food of my LIFE here. That's saying a lot since I'm  from Los Angeles.  The service is very fast and polite. The staff work very hard to maintain a high dtandard of preparation and service. The food is so good you don't want to leave. SERIOUSLY.  It's  also very conveniently located downtown on King St."}
{"text":"I have been to quite a few Thai restaurants in Toronto, and for me, I have usually convinced myself that from all the places I've been to, they've been status quo. By that I mean they don't deviate too far from how you expect Thai food to taste. Some are a little worse, some are a little better, but in the end I don't have much of an opinion on Thai places.  But Coco Rice had a little something special to it I can't really explain (because its been a while since I've been back but I recall enjoying it). The staple for my wife is the Pad See Ew and I try to get some different things although I usually stick to some kind of noodle dish. I had the Pad Woon Sen which sometimes can be pretty dry and you're left wanting a little sauce. At Coco Rice I did not have this problem. We also had the shrimp rolls as an appetizer which we both enjoyed.  I find this restaurant to be a nice little place to sit and have a meal. The decor has a modern asian flare. When we go, I don't find the restaurant itself to be busy, but they do a lot of take out/delivery. This could potentially hamper some fast speedy service, so we have not experienced this."}
{"text":"I'll start off by saying that their pad thai is an 11 out of 10.  Although their service is fairly good (makes sure your water is topped up all the times, smiles all around, and 2-3 people check up on your table), if you go in at a hunger level of 5/10, you'll be at 10/10 by the time the food comes out. Their kitchen is quite slow.  I've had their Seafood CoCo Platter, and 90% of it were deep fried. The only thing that wasn't deep fried was their toddler sized handful of salad.  Their curries are mediocre - a little too creamy for my taste, and I love my sauces.  Pineapple fried rice with chicken was pretty good, and their tom yum soup was good too (but don't get it with chicken - makes the entire soup taste funky - get tofu or shrimp instead!).  Best way to eat Coco Rice is to call for take out 15 minutes ahead for their pad thai, pineapple fried rice, and tom yum soup with tofu, and pay in cash to save taxes. Eat straight from the containers with a rerun of Friends on Netflix."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout from Coco Rice one night since a Google query indicated that it was close enough to my condo to pick up and devour quickly. Also, there's the option to order online, which makes things even quicker and easier. I ordered the Red Curry with tofu and vegetables (from the hilariously named \"Curry Potter\" section of the menu), and my boyfriend had the Panang Peanut Curry with chicken. We also had the \"Curry Puffs\", which are almost like empanadas with a curry filling. My first issue with this place is that my \"Tofu and Vegetable\" curry had NO TOFU. There were several huge chunks of broccoli which took up at least half of the curry container, some bamboo, and snow peas. Where's the variety, Coco Rice? Also, my boyfriend found a really disgusting, thick hair in his curry, which was actually too much variety for me to handle. Serving sizes here are also a little bit on the smaller side. The redeeming factor was that the curry puffs were actually really, really good - we ended up going back the next day just to pick up an order of curry puffs. The crust is light and flaky and the inside is savoury and almost sweet at the same time. Final verdict: get the curry puffs here, get curry elsewhere."}
{"text":"Food quality was alright but portions are extremely small for nearly twice the price compared to other good thai places. You're looking at $8 for a small bowl of tom yum with 3 regular shrimp (they call it tiger shrimp but really, no). Pork neck was also too dry."}
{"text":"The best Thai spot in Toronto. No idea why it's not mentioned more. Their lunch specials are always a great deal. Usually get the Pad Thai, I add beef for a couple dollars and get it extra spicy. Whenever they have their Tom yum soup with the special, I make sure to get it. It is probably the best I've had, the perfect amount of sour and savoury. I've come on a regular basis, and all the staff has taken it upon themselves to remember my order. They're all extremely nice and the service is amazing! Always making sure our water is topped, and checking up on us once in a while to make sure the meal is on point. The only place I go for Thai, I've tried the more \"trendy\" spots and they honestly don't compare. The ugly fish at the front is awesome.   Pad Thai lunch special (comes with a spring roll and a choice of soup/salad/extra spring roll) + $2 extra beef...comes to around $13ish. I think normally the special is $10...honestly the best deal for any food in Toronto"}
{"text":"I had take-out from this place a couple times and it was not bad. After a long day in the office I was to tired to cook for myself and decided to stop by here for dinner on the way home. It was a wierd experience as I was the only customer in the restaurant (there were 4 other customers that stop by later but they were there to pick up their take-out). Service was fast, which wasn't surprising as I was the only one there. I had their set dinner menu special which was a good deal. Unfortunately I found the food (Pad Thai) to be very mediocre, lacking in flavour and not as good as the take out I had there before. The wine by the glass was limited to just one choice for red and one choice for white. The white wine wasn't that great but for less than 5 bucks, I could live with it and not really that bad if you having something really spicey with it. I will definitely come again give it another chance."}
{"text":"Today I called Coco Rice to make a takeout order, this is my first time and will be the last time. I ordered two soups, chicken pad Thai, chicken skewer, and spring rolls. First impression on the phone wasn't great, the person answer the phone is very impatient. When I arrive to pick up my order, while waiting to pay, I saw their lunch menu, and this is where I'm kinda of upset! The lunch menu special for Wednesday (today) is Chicken Pad Thai with Soup $9.59 ( something around $9); I paid $12 for the pad Thai and $9 for the soup total of $21!!!!! I totally understand the portion will be different; I felt disgust by this vendor's action! They could of asked if you want full order or you want the lunch special, instead ripping your customer off, very dishonest people!! Will never give my business again!"}
{"text":"Just a quick update - their fried calamari appetizer is awful. The calamari was tough. The batter was too heavy. And there was no taste to it.  When I order a fried calamari appetizer at La Bettola di Terroni, I don't want to share. I want it all to myself. But the calamari at Coco Rice I'm happy to give away.  I would still recommend this spot though for its curries and chicken in basil spicy sauce."}
{"text":"Had the peanut chicken and was not disappointed, can't wait to try out some of the other options! Would definitely recommend to friends. Great price for and fast takeout in the middle of lunchtime."}
