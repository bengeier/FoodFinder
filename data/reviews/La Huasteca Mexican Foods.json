{"text":"Another disappointing experience.  Why can they make good al pastor tacos. Don't even use real corn tortillas. The only good thing was the horchata."}
{"text":"Real Mexican food. The tortas are wonderful and reasonably priced. If you have not had a Mexican sandwich before, let me introduce you to The Torta. Carne asada, lettuce, tomatoes, onions, avocado, on a soft roll. No mustard or mayo. Yummy and a $4.99 a filling lunch."}
{"text":"I found this place by chance one day looking for some where to eat breakfast and specifically Menudo. I don't live down the street from this place however I was completely impressed from the first meal I had here. It is worth my drive even though I'm about 35 minutes away. They serve Menudo every day of the week which is unheard of anywhere else in the valley. Their food is clean very well presented great flavor and they are all very polite. Furthermore which is hard to find these days is there service is very professional polite and courteous. I would highly recommend this place and for anything they have on their menu! I go here every chance I get and I get food including Menudo to go for the next day or two because I can't get enough of it!"}
{"text":"This is a little hole in the wall Mexican eatery. It's a small place and the food is great. Service was excellent and the bathroom was surprisingly super clean. If you need a quick bite to eat at an affordable price come here.  I ordered a huge burrito for only $5.99 and it was the bomb!"}
{"text":"If you want authentic Mexican food, this is the place for you. A hole in the wall place. Out side is deceiving. It is very clean inside and all food is made to order. Really enjoyed it. I asked a Phoenix police officer where to get real Mexican food and this is where he sent me."}
{"text":"Food is good.  Not too salty.  Next to the Chevron Gas Statiin. But they do not share the parking.  I asked for Burrito without beans.  I come to realized that it was missing a rice.   I am not sure this is Phoenix style, but back in LA where I am from,. They out rixe 8nside the burritos.  Good quick bite.   I will make sure I ask for the rice inside next time.    Failry clean, small odd shaoe parking lot."}
{"text":"If you enjoy social injustice, poor business ethics, being completely disrespected, and ripped off, \"La Huas-teca your money and run\" is sure to deliver.

I really thought I'd be a regular here after my first experience.  I even tipped the nice lady that served me 40% on my first trip. 

Today changed that:  after the staff member requested that I pay almost $3 more than the same meal that I got on my first trip, and despite the fact that the real value is clearly stated on the menu, he still demanded the extra money.  I gave it to him, figuring that if he wants to take the money and earn his employer a horrible review, so be it.  

After I gave him his stolen money, he didn't even have the courtesy to thank me in any capacity.  I asked for the name of the 5'3'', 145 bugger and he called himself \"speedy.\"  Speedy he is- at trying to make up crap and take your money.  

So, unless I get some kind of written apology from the owner, I am done with this place and suggest going elsewhere."}
{"text":"Delicious food! We were greeted promptly. The woman at the front is very nice and attentive. I had the menudo. So yummy! For $9 you get a ton of meat and hominy. Would definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"Delicious fresh homemade Mexican food. Service is friendly. Very clean. They made what I wanted even though not on menu."}
{"text":"Hole in the wall kinna joint... Very small place. Greeted once we walked in. Menu is full of delicious options -  I ordered a carne asada torta and (2) Carne asada tacos. The meat was very flavorful. 

Tacos have double medium tortillas
The Torta very well made (see picture)

Overall I was extremely impress with the food as I thought I wouldn't like it. 

Lesson learn Dont judge a book by its cover"}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice and both times I have enjoyed the experience. I had the same thing - combo with tamale, taco, and tostada. The service was friendly, the food was good, and the service was fast. This is a small building next to the Chevron. It is nestled back just a bit from the street and easy to miss in an intersection with two other Mexican restaurants. If you want a small, authentic, and personal touch don't pass building by."}
{"text":"I've kept hearing about this place through recommendation, and I finally decided to try it one day. I ended up eating the bacon, egg, and cheese burrito with potatoes and man did it hit the spot. 

All of the food was fresh and cooked on the spot, the service was quick and courteous, and the place, while I wouldn't say was the most updated, but it worked considering its a hole in the wall. The salsa was also pretty great. I preferred the green myself. It wasn't to hot and it wasn't lacking flavor either.

You don't find good places like this to often, especially when it comes to Mexican food. Not all food is created the same, even though the idea is the same. 

Highly recommended."}
