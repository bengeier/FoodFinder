{"text":"I love this location. A lot smaller than the other ones which gives them a chance to be a little more personable. Very different environment than the other locations.  Love the fact that they FINALLY got their espresso machine in, so I'll be stopping here every time I go to Costco"}
{"text":"Took FOREVER for 2 lattes - like 20 minutes as there were 3 ahead of me.  Latte wasn't anything great - not sure I'd give it another try."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE press coffee. Emily is so sweet, every time I come in I am greeted with a beautiful smile & a delicious smell of roasted coffee beans. I 100% recommend everyone to come in and try it out. I LOVE the blueberry muffins with a caramel late. 
They have very healthy alternatives like fruity oatmeal and organic protein bars with no preservatives. 

Press coffee is absolutely DELICIOUS!"}
{"text":"Love this place, way better then starbucks! Awesome customer service and delicious coffee"}
{"text":"Apparently you have to be a 20 something hipster to come to this place... I was the only person over 30 when I arrived this day for coffee.

Driving up to Costco and saw a new coffee spot and thought, perfect, grab a latte and then I can shop!

They have a lot of seating and 75%of it was 20yr old punk hipsters... On their phones, loudly conversing with their fellow friends.. Not even sure i saw coffee in their hands. Hmmmm...

The guy at the counter was slow and kind of out of place with customer service, no eye contact, no hello, no smile. The gal at least was nice and I think had to compensate for his lack of CS skills.

The latte was amazing... So I guess that's all that matters.
But I doubt I'd come in to hang out with the crowd that was there, too immature and loud."}
{"text":"We ordered a cold brew and a custom drink. My mom complained about the small print on the menu (classic) but it worked out well because the barista made her a custom drink. Mocha with some spices and mint, was d-e-l-i-c-i-o-u-s. 

Would definitely come back, once my mom got over the small font she came around too. Cool concept with like 60 other shops in the same building. 

Worth a stop before you hit up the sample tables over at Costco."}
{"text":"Amazing spot on the east valley! I love that Press is expanding! The location offers so much in such a neat atmosphere. It is inside Palette Collective which has individual suites to rent out. There's a bunch of businesses inside like tattoo artists, hair stylists, and massage therapists! The interior is very clean, it's white with black accents and sleek decorations. It's very inviting too with cute table plants and lots of natural light! Press offers a wide menu of drinks, from single origin pour overs, traditional macchiatos and cortados (my favorite), hot or iced lattes that you can add a flavor to and they also have kombucha and Press cold brew on tap!!! And rotating green and black teas for something new every day! The gal there was very nice and helpful, letting me know all the cool options they have. All the staff is very engaging and really knowledgeable. I always feel like I'm in good hands when I get a coffee at Press. So excited to have a great new location near me!"}
{"text":"I'm so excited to have amazing coffee while I'm getting my hair done by Brianna. The Baristas are so nice and helpful. And I love that they sell RX bars as a pastry alternative! It's so nice that Costco is so close too."}
{"text":"Love this coffee and love this location! Today, my barista was Bailey. Not only very knowledgeable about coffee and Press specifically but what a hoot! 

Being that it was late in the afternoon, she recommended a decaf sugar free vanilla with non-fat over ice and oooo it went down way too fast!

So much fun, can't wait to come back again! Xoxoxo"}
{"text":"Like all Press Coffee locations- spot on cappuccino and even the hot chocolate my significant other got was good. Perfect temperature to drink right away and creamy. 

Very nice location for a quick pick up and run or for local people who are working and need a coffee stop. Seating is in middle of a bunch of hair salons and stuff so to some it's \"quiet\" but I find the seating more open and active. Could just be me though. 

As always press coffee amazes me with their cappuccinos and I WILL be back as always"}
{"text":"My wife and I live close by and decided to give this place a try. Some of the best cappuccinos we've had in a long time. This place is legit!"}
{"text":"A coffee shop in the same parking lot as Costco?!  Count me in!  Their cold brew is fantastic, with or without cream.  It's on draft so it's perfectly blended.    It's in a very cool location with many other small businesses.  We are always served promptly and with a smile."}
{"text":"I've been to various Press Coffee locations and this has made my list of favorites. The quality coffee that is provided is exquisite. The surrounds are quaint, yet, energetic seeing as how there are different salons, beauty parlors, massage therapy and small business within the building. The atmosphere is brilliant and vibrant. The employees know their coffee and love it even more. They do their best to provide their customers with the very best choice."}
{"text":"Updates: still really good. Smells like cat urine...but in a good way. Great Latte. They have the decaf now. One thing that they still need is their \"sign\" put up somewhere visuable to the public... so that more people can know about this place."}
{"text":"Caffeine is a requirement to deal with Costco. 

Mainly for dealing with the *people* at Costco but that's another story.

Press has got you covered. 

I haven't ventured much beyond their incredibly potent and smooth cold brew, but damn ... With a boost of caffeine that could rival cocaine itself, it's the perfect pre (or post) bulk shopping battle fuel. 

It doesn't need cream and sugar or other additives. 

Slightly hipster vibe, but don't let that deter you - Every barista I've encountered has been friendly enough."}
{"text":"Poor service. Never got a coffee after waiting at least 5 minutes. We were first in line, actually the only customers in the shop. The person behind the counter felt it was more important for her to work on her inventory than help us."}
{"text":"What a cool concept! I love that I can grab a cup of coffee while I wait to get my hair done. 
It's a bright open space and the best coffee in town. Definitely check it out."}
{"text":"Very helpful staff! Super excited that there's something besides Starbucks in a mall setting! I ended up getting a Cortado, it was delicious! Very cozy setting cause it's not as busy as the other locations. The gentleman behind the counter suggested that I get a pour over the next time, so I will be back to try that!"}
{"text":"Came on national coffee day and was disappointed. No espresso drinks because barista said it was a new machine and he wasn't sure how to run it. Also didnt have ANY decaf options. So now I'm going home with a cold brew for myself (delish and only reason didnt give a 1 star btw) and nothing to drink for my gf who cant drink a ton of caffeine right now."}
