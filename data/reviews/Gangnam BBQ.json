{"text":"Really good - reasonably authentic atmosphere, good prices, a great menu selection.  Personally I would prefer a bit more aggressive flavoring/spicing, but it's a minor quibble (and the dipping sauces they offer make up for the more traditionally prepared meats).  Wait staff was attentive; place could be a tad cleaner, it still looks like they are \"moving in\" a bit.  Overall, though, one of the better genuine Korean BBQ places in the Valley and definitely worth the visit!"}
{"text":"The place opened 2 months ago.   At a minimum 2 people are expected.  If you come alone for lunch your Fee will be $14.99 + $7.50 due to food servings is good for 2 people.  The restaurant manager waived the extra fee because of my ignorance.  I thought that was very nice.  The place is clean, waitress and waiters are very friendly.  They will explain to you the menu.  Keep in mind if you order meat you don't finish you will be charged extra amount of $12.50.  Now if there's a party of 3 in your group they will include 18% gratuity.

Overall I love the place.  This place welcomes everyone who's not wasteful with food."}
{"text":"this place was great!!i recomend to all. the food is great and the staff is friendly . and this is place is safe and clean."}
{"text":"After our second meal I have to say that this place has a lot of things they need to straighten out. With how long they've been open at this point there shouldn't be so many issues. I was more forgiving the first time we tried Gangnam but after today, I think I won't be back for a while. Here's our feedback- 

-At our first visit they were out of chicken and pork bulgogi. Really limits your option at the all you can eat, especially when there's only one chicken dish to choose. Since this is an all you can eat one would imagine that they are fully stocked on meat.

-visited about 2 weeks apart and the beef bulgogi changed at my second visit- I found it tasted a bit funky and was a different cut of meat than the first time. Whatever beef you used before was tastier! 

-Today we had quite a bit of wait time for our meats. Maybe consider prepping your meats to avoid customer wait time.. our rice was going cold by the time the meat went on the grill. 

- We came one hour before closing last night and was turned away because of \"last call\" and \"kitchen is closed.\" Your kitchen is full of raw meat dude, you don't have to cook a thing! Advertise that somewhere with your hours! So that we don't have to drive 20 minutes to be turned away. So disappointing when you're hungry and it feels more like the servers don't want to deal with another table. Came back today because of cravings and wished the situation was handled better. 

I wouldn't bring a group here because of 18% auto gratuity for parties of only 4 or more....at a restaurant where you cook your own food and only need a server for refills. Nice. 

Honestly.. just had such high hopes hearing about this place but found it so unorganized, their staff is all over the place and I hope they figure out a system that runs smoothly because it's quite hectic."}
{"text":"Very fresh meat and great service! The only problem is there is too much smoke in the air."}
{"text":"Awesome place to eat great food great service!!! Happy to have a place like this here! I love the brisket and the bulgogi is my favorite!"}
{"text":"Our 1st time here. From California staying a week in Phoenix craving korean BBQ. I found this place online. So happy my husband and I had a great dinner wide range of choices. The server was amazing (young lady with tatoo @left forearm). She gave us the whole run down on all the different dishes they give you & she even helped us cook/cut our food. Very well ventilated, they use a unique grill & run AC.  Thank you."}
{"text":"I think this place charge way over price. We paid $160 for 4 ppl total. This included 1 or 2 beers also. And the meat is not that good. All we had was meats and squids. There is no shrimp or chicken to grill or something different to grill. The squid looked like they just took it out from the package that they bought in oriental market place and dump the sauce on top of it. The server was nice and helpful and great but the foods and the price that make me doesn't want to come back. Sorry Because i found a better place with better price and better foods."}
{"text":"Korean Bbq in Phoenix?  Count me in. One of the best. Love the food the service.  Price is acceptable."}
{"text":"The food is great and our server Laura is very friendly and nice. There's two courses available on Fridays and weekends. The side dishes are fresh and delicious. I recommand the Gangnam course. There's beef tongue and LA rib. The soft pork belly becomes crispy after cooking on the grill and every one of us likes that."}
{"text":"If you want a quick and tasty weekday lunch for AYCE for $15 (limit 2 hours), this is the place to try Korean BBQ. Our server was LAURA who was attentive and considerate, always checking to see if we needed more ban chan (side salad dishes of which you get 4 kinds - fish cake, marinated bean sprouts, kim chee and shredded daikon - all good). First you order your choice of meat, one choice for each person from a selection of 7 - 9 meats:  brisket, thick pork belly, marinated thinly sliced pork belly or beef, octopus, etc. The grill is a large solid metal \"lid\" which provides plenty of cooking space for several people, more like a mini-Mongolian grill. You also get shredded green onion (great grilled) and romaine leaves. I took off one star for bathrooms that could have been cleaner."}
{"text":"This place is ridiculous! They don't accept one
Person even u can afford to pay $30 or more for your meals. I believe in KARMA! I will never ever try this place. The Korean usher  lady said that I can eat because I by myself. Wow! First time in my life hear that food restaurant policy here in USA. It's ok there New coming soon Korean All U Can Eat in Dobson/Guadalupe, Mesa ,Az. Better , clean , new & huge place."}
{"text":"Good food! Definitely worth the price. I tried all their different meats for their lunch special and everything was delicious. I will be going back with friends for dinner soon."}
{"text":"First, they marinate the meat right before you order, for like 2 minutes. Chicken breast is just chicken taste, no additional flavors.

Second, they don't have good ventilation, so as a result we all smelt like BBQ when we finished eating. Almost got chocked on smoke

The intestines were not cleaned, tasted awful. The server gave our eggs to the wrong table. Kimchi and they banchans were just not done eight, not Korean at all. Do not recommend if you want authentic Korean BBQ."}
{"text":"Sadly I'd love to give this restaurant a real review but apparently they will not seat a person eating by themselves so be warned.  The story changed to no seating a solo person on the weekend.  The restaurant wasn't even remotely full, perhaps 20% and it was 6:40pm on a Friday!  Ironically I've eaten in many fine Korean BBQ restaurants before........in Korea.  Was certainly made to feel more welcome there than here.  Very sad performance for a relatively new restaurant trying to grow a business in Mesa.  Doesn't really encourage someone to visit again.   I certainly would have difficulty promoting their business."}
{"text":"My husband and I had lunch last Sunday,  the waitress was very kind and explained us how to order and grill the meet. It was a great experience, the quality of the food is really good, I hope they keep it  like that. Maybe because the restaurant had opened just 2 days ago they need to figure out how to serve more efficiently when they are crowded.  Next time I will order something from the lunch special."}
{"text":"This is the best Korean BBQ you're gonna find in Arizona. There are some better places in LA but this is really good. 

I think most people in this state have no idea how to eat Korean BBQ. Put the meat, garlic, jalape√±o, and sauce together wrapped up in the lettuce. Put that whole thing in your mouth and eat it. Repeat until full. You're welcome."}
{"text":"It's so good and the price is affordable, hella good services and real good taste!!! Def coming back again!!!"}
{"text":"Three words: Laura, Laura, Laura

Laura was our server and she KILLED it. While the tables are equipped with the buzzer to call your server, she was there checking on our party of 4 regularly without being annoying. Her service was top notch and she provided honest feedback about menu items. 

We all went with the 2nd tier AYCE option and we were not disappointed. I mean, come on, this wasn't LA and anyone judging the place by those standards is asking for a let down. Despite having that LA experience, I still enjoyed Gangnam BBQ's selection. Plenty of side dishes-- I loved the green onion salad-- tasty meat, and a great selection of flavored soju. 

We went on a Saturday night while the joint was full and we still enjoyed great food and better service. If you need a Korean BBQ fix and LA isn't in your budget or travel plans, swing by. I hope you enjoy it as much as we did."}
{"text":"Good price for all you can eat Korean bbq. Meat is nice. Sides are good. Service is fast and keep the orders coming."}
{"text":"The food is really good. I love the fresh squid. The music is good, gangnam style... :). Spacious and service is good."}
{"text":"This gotta be the first AYCE in the Phoenix area that isn't based on certain days and time. The food was great and had a good amount of options! I'm pretty excited that they had pork cheek and other meats. The sides are pretty awesome and I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"For my birthday dinner I've been wanting AYCE Korean BBQ but there are not many if at all here in AZ. But it just so happened that Gangnam BBQ just opened. Now having K-BBQ in LA I didn't have too high hopes about this Phoenix spot BUT! Gangnam exceeded all of my expectations. The sides were great and the meat was awesome! The venue is so spacious and open. Pricing was on point and didn't break the bank. The menu was easy to follow and has pictures of the variety of meats they offered. I was impressed. Now as far as the service all I gotta say is Laura, Laura, LAURA! Girl I wanna have your babies! She was so amazing and excited to serve our party and she couldn't have been more attentive to us. But what blew me away was her honesty and knowledge of the cuisine she was serving. If you want some amazing Korean BBQ but don't wanna fly out LA you gotta hit up Gangnam BBQ. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Very mediocre for all you can eat. I have been to plenty of AYCE in Los Angeles and was disappointed in this place. Not bad price, but couldn't even finish our first round. Left half of it uneaten on the grill."}
{"text":"The food was great, the service is ok.  But charging 18% tips for party of 4!94 more is not right."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Reasonable price! The boss offered additional steak for free."}
{"text":"This place is really good food and my waiter kin are really nice and professional. I'm glad I'm come . If you going to come to this place make sure to bring two people or more ."}
{"text":"This is our second visit and it was just as good as the first! Andrew was our server and he was awesome! He made the delicious food even more enjoyable with his vibe and energy. We would love to go back and have him as our server again!"}
{"text":"Got a great service by Arron. Beef bulkogi was so good. Reasonable price for lunch special. They might have to create some more sauces to dip in it.This place is clean and the was serving so  fast."}
{"text":"Probably one of the worst dining experiences I have ever experienced. Maybe because it was their opening weekend?? But there was not a single redeeming quality about this restaurant. 

Service was inattentive (our server forgot what we ordered multiple times) and slow (it took us 30 minutes to get utensils/plates/napkins....and AFTER we received our meats!) 

Food was bland and tasted of low quality. The ban chan was limited, never refilled and tasteless. 

Also, the vents were not turned on...so expect to smell like kbbq for the rest of the day. 

I hope that tonight was an anomaly and that they will be able to correct their issues soon."}
{"text":"This place was AWESOME! Friendly staff, we had at least 3 people come by and ask how everything was and if they could get us anything, we got one of the all you can eat options which was amazing and they kept it coming! Kimchi and the other banchan were so good! The price was a little high, so not a place to go everyday unless you have some money haha but once in awhile would be great! Each table has their own burner to cook the meat on yourself, and of course they were playing kpop which was cool! We will definitely come back!!"}
{"text":"This Korean BBQ joint has good food and the atmosphere is great. The first couple of times I came here were amazing but then stopped coming her due to a couple of reasons. One, you must have a reservation or you'll have to wait for hour or two, I had the feeling that if you don't know any servers there, you won't get attention from them for 30 min to an hr. Took my family there twice and both time we waited for about 1.5 hrs to get seated when there were many open seats and didn't get menus or a sever for another 30. Im disappointed because I loved this place when they opened but now not so much."}
{"text":"Awesome authentic Korean grill! Loved every minute of it.

Definitely get the $24.99 buffet on the weekend.

One wish I would hope is that they would provide more sauces on the side. Would be great if you could baste your meats while they cook."}
{"text":"This korean BBQ place was really good, the service was great and our waiter was also really nice too. I would definitely recommend this place if your looking for a good Korean BBQ restaurant."}
{"text":"Definitely different from what I'm used to, but in a good way! 

I think this is the first AYCE KBBQ in Arizona BUT don't quote me on that. I came here not knowing what to really expect because the yelp reviews are all over the place. It seems like people either really really like this place or hate it. I wanted to know the in between. 

This place has tier so depending on what kind of meat/varieties you are in the mood for then you pick your choice. It ranges from $19.95 to $29.95. 

We went with the cheapest one because I really only like beef brisket so anything else besides that is a bonus already. 

Pros:
+ fast and good service 
+ they give you whole lettuce to wrap your meat in!!! 
+ LOVE LOVE the shredded green onion 
+soup was flavored pretty good

Cons:
- they do not have rice paper
- they do not have radish paper 
- pork belly was not fatty enough and cut way thick so it end up being dry 
- one plate of our beef brisket looked a little grey 

With that being said, I might be back. There's a couple more ACYE KBBQ opening up so I want to see how those are compared to here."}
{"text":"I was SUPER excited to find an all you can eat Korean BBQ spot in the east valley! This spot is great! The food is good and the service is excellent! Aaron helped us out and was super attentive to our needs (5 stars for service!), he was even thoughtful about seating our kids away from the hot grills. 

I love that there is a lunch special $14.99 Monday-Friday from 11:30AM - 4:00PM. They offer a large variety of different meats and their banchan is good. This place could be a really fun happy hour dinner hangout if they make a few tweaks to their decor and close up the open back kitchen area. I'll definitely be back, with friends! Good job guys!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Reading some of the previous reviews, I was braced for sub-par service but I was happy overall with everything that evening. 

Pros: 
1. The meat here is AMAZING. Everything was delicious that we ate and there wasn't anything left at the end.
2. Good drinks and nice atmosphere
3. Fun service and the manager is a great guy.

Potential Cons:
1. If you are used to typical restaurants where you order once from the waiter/waitress and expect everything to be perfect, then this WILL be different. Throughout the hour and a half we were there, we placed probably 8-10 different orders, asked for recommendations, and our waitress surprisingly got nearly everything right without us having to ask a second time.

I can see how some very high maintenance people eating here would give lower star reviews if the place was packed and orders might be getting mixed up. But my friends and I came here for my birthday celebration dinner on a not so busy night and we're pretty low maintenance overall and had a blast with our server. She even brought me some free Korean dessert at the end!

Overall: I would highly recommend this place, keep your expectations down with getting every little detail of your order right. Just sit back, enjoy the food, and don't rush the experience. I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"This is probably one of the worst place to eat in Mesa. My first time to eat at this place, they didn't go by who's first on the waitlist. The people that works here just started sitting people randomly. The service is really poor. When you order something, it takes at least twenty minutes before they get it to you and that's after being seated. The owner came in and everyone started working faster. I felt bad for our server then because the manager was yelling at her in front of everyone. Very unprofessional. I decided to give it another try. We came in at 7:00PM today and the moment we walked in, we were told that they stop serving food at 9PM (it states that they close at 10PM) on Sundays. They were a lot of people waiting in line and they have a lot of tables open but not clean. We got seated around 8:40PM and we didn't get to order til 8:55PM. All the servers were in the back and most people are just waiting to order more food. The service is really poor. So much for the $25 per person fee that they're charging. The food is okay. I would still say that KBBQ in San Diego, Ca is the best. I won't be coming back here. I can't wait for GEN KBBQ to open in Tempe Marketplace!!"}
{"text":"I've had a lot of Korean BBQ Buffets around LA and this comes pretty close. Since it seems to be the only all you can eat Korean BBQ around the area, it has done a decent job. The $24.99 prime buffet is a must. The LA marinated beef ribs is totally worth the extra couple dollars. The bulgolgi could have had more flavor, seems like it wasn't marinated long enough but it was still good. Shannon was our waiter and the service was really fast for a Friday night. Took maybe 5 minutes for us to get our meat each time we ordered. The only downside was that the beef brisket was super fatty. Good find, will try the place again."}
{"text":"This place is so good! The new management is doing a great job with the place. The kimchi pancake is to die for! We also had the Wang Jumuluck and Saenggalbi, oh my stars so good! The staff so kind and nice, the food came fast and I had a wonderful time with my friends. Can't wait to eat here again!"}
{"text":"Not the best meat quality but keep in mind this is an AYCE restaurant. To sustain profitability, well u get it. Super friendly staff."}
{"text":"I like this place, fast and great customer service. Very attentive. Marisol was our waitress and she was hilarious. The 4-star though, is for the food. There isn't that many options to choose from when compared to Gen KBBQ in Tempe. The quality of meat is a tad lower when compared to Gen as well for the exact same price. With that being said, I would definitely come back here on occasions where I don't feel like driving 35 minutes to get Korean BBQ."}
{"text":"Food is sooooooo good. Recommend anyone to come here and try it out. Marisol, the waitress there is also awesome. Joking with us as we eat."}
{"text":"I already know how weak sauce Arizona's Korean BBQ game is, but given a literal lack of other options I think Gangnam BBQ has to do.  AYCE meat at affordable pricing that you can cook yourself.

The decor fits exactly what I expect. Giant grills at each table, smoke everywhere, buttons for service, and even blasting K-Pop MVs over the speakers. 

Side dishes and sauces were okay, nothing special. I agree with the other reviewers about the lack of gojuchang. We went with the second tier menu as a party of 2. Normally I think one meat item per person is okay, but the portions are so tiny we can finish eating each item in 30 seconds. Plus the service is sooooooo goddamn slow, even with the button. It's actually weird how they make us wait to finish our round before we order the next - ordering after receiving the first is usually the norm.

And that wait is what kills star 4 for me. The meat quality is variable from a dope brisket to an underwhelming galbi, but there's so much time wasted from mediocre service. Everyone we've had was super nice, but somehow the place was super understaffed. From refills to orders to anything else the response time was just not there. The novelty of the place made it forgiving at the time, but if that's the norm I can't see myself becoming a regular.

Ugh, I would love to bash on this place like a lot of people have recently been doing. But if you can't point me in a better direction outside the smack talk, the KBBQ scene here isn't going to grow anytime soon."}
{"text":"Great Korean bbq experience. Everything is modern and clean. The meats are well marinated. Went for the 2hr all you can eat for $25 and definitely filling. Coming back for more in the future. The plaza is definitely up and coming!"}
{"text":"My first time having Korean BBQ and it was a life changing experience. Everything was so delicious, especially the Buldogi Beef which I will definitely be stopping by the super market next door to purchase. The service was so attentive, every server made sure we had our drinks full and our food was cooking at the right temperature. Can't wait to go back for another wonderful evening :)"}
{"text":"We went in on Sunday and it was starting to get busy. Walked in and quickly noticed that all the tables that weren't occupied were siting dirty from previous customers. 

We stood there and no one acknowledged us even though several employees walked passed us. Few minutes later, Cherry, who became our server ran on over and sat us down. We sat down and she said she would be right over in a few. We sat there with no menus and so I stood up and went to the front and grabbed them myself. 

We placed our drink orders and looked at the menu. On the weekends they only offer two out of the three unlimited entree courses. We went with the second one which is $25 a person and we waited for our drinks and meat to arrive. 

The meats tasted pretty good. We had the beef bulgogi, spicy pork bulgogi, beef ribs, thin pork meat, and the pork neck. This came with unlimited rice, soup of choice, and my favorite steamed egg!! 

Service was unfortunately HORRIBLE and it got worse once more people started walking in. All the employees were running around like chickens without heads and no one seemed to know what they were supposed to be doing. Tables were dirty and no one bothered to clean them up even though there was a line of people waiting to be seated. 

Our drinks took forever to be refilled and the waitress was running around everywhere. We sat there and waited to order more and it would take forever for her to make it over to us. It is clear that this place needs help and they definitely need to work together."}
{"text":"For being a new BBQ place it was pretty good. The meat quality is a lot better than some other places in Phx. People commenting about the service, give them a break jeez. New place new business be patient. Our server Han, was awesome and very attentive. There was not a time we had nothing to eat, meat was rolling in . 

Things I would order, beef tongue, finger meat, non marinated prime rib beef, steamed egg and pork cheek. Also get the green onion salad and lettuce to wrap your meat. (Not that meat you perv) 

Things I would stay away from is anything marinated, I'm not a fan of places that do that since it can be super sweet. Also the super thin pork belly tasted too dry and like chicken so skip that. 

There was 4 of us and we left with all smiles and a full belly. We came here at 4pm on Friday so it wasn't busy at all. So that might be a reason why service was good but again it's a new business so it's going to happen. 

Will come back again for sure."}
{"text":"Went there on a Thursday evening around 7:00 PM and there was no wait. I tried the \"happy course\" ayce and literally ordered almost every option. Each portion was big so I didn't have to constantly ask the waiter for more. Everything was fresh, especially the lettuce, salad and side dishes. Service was fast and everyone was friendly. I appreciated how they worked as a team when it got super busy and constantly checked up on our table. I will come back again soon!"}
{"text":"Food was okay. Service was slow on a slow day so food took forever. Server lied to us about them having rice paper and took another server to tell us there was none. Food cooks super slow on the grill."}
{"text":"Seriously this place is good and more authentic than the big chain places. Our server Lara was probably the best server there. Not that the servers were bad, but probably the best. I recommend to everyone. Great for people that have never tried kbb. 

Someone has told me that this place was bland but row I'm just thinking they didn't know how to eat kbb. Seriously go there."}
{"text":"The only all you can eat in my area that is so worth it. Your eyes will be bigger than your stomach... No lie, go for the 2nd tier because you also get to eat the first tier as well. I thought you only got to choose one! The beef is great! The staff are so friendly and are very responsive. I'll come back."}
{"text":"It's a good place to hangout with family and friends where you get the good deals of food and friendly service from the waiters. Definitely a recommendation if you want to try something new and good"}
{"text":"Just dined here for the second time and it has been a great experiences both times! We were lucky enough to get the same waitress again. Her name is Yimi and She is super sweet and nice and doesn't get mad/annoyed when you repeatedly ask for things. Overall, prices here are reasonable and food is pretty good - some better than others - but that's understandable. It's cheaper to eat on Mon-Thurs because you get the option is choosing \"All you can eat choice\" which has a limited list of meat but still has great variety. This place actually has a large variety of meat but I usually stick to my pork belly and beef brisket. The environment and table set up reminds me so much of Korean restaurants back in Cali. For the most part, this place is spacious, has great customer service, and has good food. Whenever I am around the area and have a big appetite, I'll come back here for sure!"}
{"text":"This is a brand new establishment.  It looks like the servers are still very out of sync with their customers and orders.  I see a lot of people working hard while others just standing around, really not doing anything.  As far as the food goes, it was tasty.  All the meat was well seasoned.  The side dishes were very minimal, only around 4 types.  I would definitely go here again the next time i'm in the area."}
{"text":"Authentic style kkq! Spent a great lunch here trying their 2nd tier CHOICE option with friends. Was happy with the amount of options to throw on the grill but wish there more sides options. Enjoyed the beef entree options and the SERVICE  with our waitress was great.

Great restaurant choice for all you can eat kkq in the valley, we'll be going back again soon.

Note; we did not enjoy the spicy seasoned pork bulgogi, it was very oil and never really reduced on the grill. First bite after a long while on the grill  had \"mushy\" oily taste. We could taste more oil and sauce than pork. Not the favorite, BUT it was 1 bad dish out of 10!"}
{"text":"You know it's good when a Korean- born and raised in Queens- feels compelled to write a review mid-dinner. The food is AMAZING. But I'll never forget the unbelievably friendly service/knowledgeable staff. They have a great 24oz beer with Soju combo you cannot beat, and I highly recommend the LA marinated beef, soft pork belly and cold buckwheat noodles. Did I mention it was ALL YOU CAN EAT?? Already making plans to come back."}
{"text":"I was here the other day and I had the opportunity of having Aaron serve us. He was energetic and very welcoming. He informed us that he was training others so that he might seem a bit distracted. In our case, this was a great 'heads up'. I would say the food was OK. I wished Aaron was there to cut the meet for us but i understand why he couldn't be super tentative to us. I would say I didn't enjoy laying down the food myself as well as only being able to order 2 items at a time. I would say up to 3 is a good number. I've been a food manager for over 3 years and I would say that they should place some emphasis on cleaning the bathrooms. From my experience, the bathrooms is a good representation of how they are maintaining their kitchen. I saw a help needed sign so maybe their looking for people to clean up the place, I don't know. I have high hopes for this place but it's a 50/50 chance. They can either tidy up and provide their customers with the best experience or the can slack and have everything fall off. I hope this place succeeds. I'll be sure to inform my friends and family about this place and have them critique it as well."}
{"text":"This place was amazing! Was pretty awesome to find something that reminds me of the Korean BBQ back home. The workers were really kind and attentive to all of their customers. Great food, great service, will return!"}
{"text":"This place is so cool. Very crowded. That would already tell you the food is good.

Probably the best Korean BBQ in AZ.

I really like our waitress. She is supper friendly.

Good place. Good food. Good service."}
{"text":"The server was excellent and friendly. The restaurant should staff more people because I feel bad that everyone runs around and it takes a long time for them to deliver food. There are only 4 ban chan: vegetables, radish, kimchi, and bean sprouts. 

Three stars because there was one rude male staff who we asked if we can get some dipping sauce and he said: go ask your server. Each time you order, you can only order one food which I think makes sense because we would waste food if we order too much."}
{"text":"This is my second time at Gangnam BBQ .. unfortunately to say I'm still very disappointed. The food quality went down since the last time I went .. I just don't think I would want to pay for those quality of meat for the price .. service definitely hasn't really been improved either but this time we definitely had a better server ! Maybe they need to train more experienced servers /food runner .. it took them almost 30 mins just to give us water .. I wouldn't mind to have 18% of gratuity if they had better service ... needless to say don't think I'll be going back since there will be plenty of choices to choose from now"}
{"text":"Moving from SoCal and reading previous reviews I didn't have very high expectations for the place. My husband and I visited for lunch and there were a few tables in there... we were tended to quickly and the customer service was good. You can't compare it to SoCal KBBQ because you only get like 3 plates of banchan. So you get regular cabbage kimchi, a radish kimchi and spinach (I think?) and you do get a bowl of lightly dressed salad. They also don't give the option of changing the grill once you have charred meat stuck to it and it's gets really smokey... and the grills are on top of the table so you really have the oil and juices get all over the table and on you.... usually the grills have been in, or lowered in the center of the table to prevent that. Meat choices are good, and the brisket seems fresh and not frozen like other places. If you go for lunch Mon-Fri it's only $15 which is well worth it. Steamed egg side was good too.
What really brought down this place was the bathrooms. They are something out of a scary movie. They clearly didn't clean or re-do them when they renovated his place from an old grocery store... I would recommend not even going in them if you don't want to completely ruin your appetite.
Overall lunch price on a weekday makes the place worth it. Good customer service too. Could use more sides and new bathrooms!"}
{"text":"Not bad for the lunch special. I would totally come back. The downside is that their ban-chan was very limited. Service was pretty good- she was attentive and checked back on us frequently."}
{"text":"Awesome service provided by Marisol! Food is tasty and unique. I recommend finger beef, LA marinated beef, seasoned shrimp, kimchi pancake...I could go on :D"}
{"text":"Being that it was the first real AYCE Korean BBQ in town, I've been here 5+ times.  Initial reaction was \"not the best but decent and hey better than none!\" So we came frequently since its opening.  While I saw many complaints of bad service, I've never experienced such.  Perhaps I lucked out.  

Pros:
- Largest grill of all places so you can cook a lot at once.
- They're great about giving you extra large portions of kimchi once they've figured you asked for refills many times.
- only AYCE to have lettuce wraps (not chopped in salad)
- Non-marinated meat is decent.  Beef brisket and pork belly mainly my go-to.

Cons:
- marinated meat not flavorful especially kalbi
- it doesn't matter if you order 1 vs 4 orders of one kind of meat, the portion that comes out will be the same. 
- very poor ventilation so it's a giant smokehouse. Anything you bring in there (purse, etc) will reek for days. 
- I'm pretty sure the place used to be a gym. It doesn't look very clean, floors filthy, and bathrooms are old and still have gym showers. 
- no radish wraps or rice paper 
- if I want beef tongue I have to pay the highest tier price.  I like that Gen is just one price for all meat."}
{"text":"This was the worst Korean BBQ place in the valley for me.  

Went w/ my two sons who are big fans of Kalbi and Bulgogi.    We decided on the most expensive options since we wanted to try everything.  Kalbi had a strange taste and Bulgogi was just ok.  Nothing special.  Tried pork belly and octopus as well.  Not so good either.  Side dishes were just ok.

Service was chaotic because there is no clear system for who is doing what.  Took 10mins to get water or rice or re-order.  Takes 10-15mins to get the check.

All-you-can-eat Korean BBQ is rare in the valley but this is rather expensive and not very good."}
{"text":"I hate to give 1 star. I really do but,  I don't want others to waste their money.  This review is on the smaller non all you can eat side sheets a singled serving with hardly any sides is served. Well start waiting in line behind s clearly upset man telling in korean I stood there 5 minutes as he ranted and raved I walked next door they said it's the same owner did I walk back over. He's still ranting so I say are you going to order,  he says oh order let me see...really this is your restaurant as confirmed by adv employee ... there's more but,  then  with the sides,  ever had a pickle that didn't taste like a pickle... didn't even Taste like a cucumber, weak Kimchi well from what I could taste from the 3 leaf/piecez of cabbage I got and zucchini that was terrible   now on to the spicy pork bulgogi... my favorite...USUALLY. flavorless watered down mushy meat and mediocre at best  this is honestly the first time I've not eaten my whole plate ever. I eat Korean 3 to 4 times a month. I really wanted to gobs a new spot.  This isn't it."}
{"text":"This Korean Barbeque restaurant looks professional with commercial exhaust fans above all tables, however, the fans are off at all time during cooking. I needed to ask 3-4 times before the fan was turned on, then for only 5 mins, it was off. Our hair, clothes, purses, everything smelled like food when home. Although this restaurant is grand opening, the tile floors are gross, actually their grouts are dirty, also the bathroom is dated (acquired from a previous business?) The good part is the food and service. All You Can Eat means I can order as many times as I am pleased, but limited to one item per person per round. That worked out fine as long as the waiter placed another order right after the meat was placed on the grill. Since the portion was not large each round, I needed to order around 6-8 rounds before started feeling full. Meats were not marinated long enough like typical Korean restaurants, therefore more meat taste than seasoning taste. Side dishes, condiments, lettuce, seasoned green onion shreds, and water are included. There is a party room for large group, too. Would come again, but afraid to bring visiting friends or family due to dirty floors and after smell."}
{"text":"The food was awesome and people are super nice. All you can eat lunch special is really good as well. We had beef bulgogi, baby octopus, pork bulgogi, brisket and short ribs alll very good"}
{"text":"Probably the best Korean BBQ in the valley. It's better than the competition. The meat was tender especially the pork belly. If you like chewy go with the marinated pork neck otherwise steer clear. In regards to drinks, the pomegranate soju is enjoyable as well as Cass, Korea's No. 1 beer."}
{"text":"Once we got the hang of how to order meat and pace our eating we became Pros! The meat was fresh and the atmosphere was fun and inviting. Both times we came our servers were great."}
{"text":"I used to like this place..... yesterday was my fourth times and was the worst out of all my visits. It would be a four stars prior to yesterday.

First I have to applause that they have upgraded their side dishes! The potato salad side dish was outstanding and tastes better than Gen's!!! Plus they offer steam egg and fish cake side dishes! Yay! 

Meat quality... unless you are on prime or Gangnam level... skip this place!!! The meat on \"choice\" option is meh! And my squid yesterday tastes like it s close to going bad... \"choice\" option has same price as Gen's lunch but the quality is subpar. 

Lastly, this is the first time I ever saw 18% tip included for a party of 4. And they are not even as attentive as Gen's"}
{"text":"This a \"All you can eat\" restaurant, so please don't expect the meat is something memorable, but definitely good for college kids, specially for lunch from Monday to Friday when you pay $15.
It is not a place if you are craving for a good korean BBQ, 
They recently opened, (but the restrooms looked outdated and dirty) this is an old development, so I hope they can invest and offer a better service.
The waitress was nice but apparently not coordinated with the kitchen."}
{"text":"I just moved to Tempe. This my far holds up to Korean bbq in Phoenix. The best part is the all you can eat. I was so stuffed from eating for 1.5 hours with my entire family. The service is a little slow but it could be from the fact that they are so new. I would recommend this establishment. The meat is high quality and so tender. The marinade is just right. There is an assortment of different cuts too."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, good food, and friendly servers. It's a must go. The menu is all you can eat with a decent price. One sad thing is they do not serve the kimchi soup, but everything else was great."}
{"text":"So I normally wouldn't write a bad review for any establishment, as I know everyone works hard to be successful... 

However, I am very disappointed. I am sitting here as of right now writing this review.

Upon walking in, we were greeted and seated. The menu looked promising as they had different \"All You Can Eat\" combos. We decided to go with the PRIME which is $29.95. There were 4 of us. 

The establishment just opened approximately 2 weeks. It is VERY disorganized as we had 4 different servers who came by our table to ask us for orders. We had to literally repeat to those 4 different people what our orders were just for nothing to show up. Still missing a steamed egg and a lot of different meats. When we finally got someone to complain, he called our \"actual server\" and said \"you handle this. I can't.\" And walked away. We had told the server that we were looking for a few of our orders and he apologized.... well, we pretty much ate all of the side dishes while waiting.. and after another 10 minutes, we decided we couldn't wait anymore. 

The food. The meat was hardly marinated. We don't even know what was ordered because they just handed it to us and it was just red slices of meat. Only way we knew what was ordered was because the receipt was still stuck on them. Gross. I should have taken a photo.

When we complained to management. Our server came and apologized that he forgot our orders. Remember, there were 4 servers who came by, so I guess all 4 forgot? Then another server came to our table and explained to us that they were only open for 2 weeks and to give them another chance. For over $120: we paid for 8 slices of beef brisket, a ice cream scoop of bulgogi, 2 strips of LA kalbi, 1 steamed egg, and an instant naengmyeon. I don't think another chance is going to happen again buddy. I really do wish them luck and that they get everything straightened out."}
{"text":"Best all you can eat BBQ in town. If you are like me, don't get the marinated meet. Get the unflavored meat and flavor it yourself. 

Brisket is top notch!"}
{"text":"Here have different prices for the all you eat, and it's unlimited order in 2 hrs. The services is quickly too. We went here at 12pm on Monday, so there still a lots empty tables. We order the 19.95 per person one, and after I finished that...I just can say this is the paradise for the meat lover, lol! There also have soups and other dishes, so if you don't want to order the BBQ, you still have a lot of choices!"}
{"text":"The staff was very friendly and welcoming. The service was great and we were never left wanting for anything. The all you can eat meal was well worth the price. We will definitely be coming back when we are in town. If you've never tried Korean food then this is a great place to start."}
{"text":"This is my second time in Gangnam Bbq, we choose the prime course because I really wanted to have some marinated Yangnyum galbi. Taste wanst that good, it was tasteless.
Overall the quality of the meat wasnt very good and the serving size seems to be small. Kimchi was not good, they dont know how to cook steamed egg, and two sauces are too boring. I didnt see any speciality of this restaurant.
Marinated meat are not marinated enough, they should have some radish paper to cover up the poor quality.
We were the only customer so the service was fast and the server was nice. Btw there will be a new korean bbq place in tempe market place with cheaper price and better quality, cuz it is a franchise restaurant from California, so i wish Gangnam improves n do a better job"}
{"text":"Wow. I'm a big fan. Next I'm bring my full blooded, traditional korean mother to enjoy their magic"}
{"text":"Had dinner at Gangnam BBQ with friends 

We had the $30 package but I think I will stick with the $20 package going forward. 

Guys if you are in Mesa and craving for All You Can Eat Korean BBQ, check out this place. 

For $30 you get couple of Prime meats, however, you are LIMITED to only ONE order per two person. I do not think I will get the $30 package again

The wait staff was friendly enough. 

I was amazed by the amount of food my very tiny friend Sokuntheary was able to put away. I think she ate more then me  

They also charge an automatic 18% tip if you have a party of four"}
{"text":"Love this place now it's under new management! The service was awesome, Aaron is awesome and funny had excellent suggestions for us! Dad's secret recipe on the Suwon Wang Short Ribs is spectacular! Michelle was extremely attentive and very professional! One of my favorite Korean BBQ places to go to! Sorry no Pic's it was eaten to fast!"}
{"text":"I'm of Korean descent so I know good Korean BBQ.  This place from what I understand just recently opened up.  The food quality is excellent.  I love that the \"all you can eat\" Korean BBQ restaurant concept has finally made it here from California.  These restaurants are all over LA. 

I would suggest going when you're very hungry to get the most bang for your buck.  The price can be steep (esp on the weekends) but it's supply & demand.  As I mentioned, the quality of the food is top notch and it's all you can eat.  Service is very good too.  Although when they get busy... they are busy!  If you're just wanting to try it out... they have cheaper prices during the week (Mon-Thur) and then they also have even cheaper prices during a weekday lunch special that I think runs only until 2pm.  That would be a good way to try it out without spending a fortune."}
{"text":"This place is legit! The prices are reasonable, and the service is lightning quick. IMO the service and meat quality is way better than Oh Ya.

The surface area of the grill is larger than most KBBQ's, so you can definitely pile the meat on. 

I'm glad that a good AYCE KBBQ finally came to AZ. Hope this place sticks around for a long time!"}
{"text":"GangnamBBQ was amazing. The service was great, food came out fast and the servers were very friendly. The food here is very authentic and it is definitely a hole in the wall."}
{"text":"Came in here with an open mind and low expectations after looking at the reviews, but it was not so bad. I've been waiting for an AYCE KBBQ in AZ for a while and was just happy to try one.

Service was on point, fast and attentive. However, I didn't like that they had to shut down early at 10 (as I was told) for maintenance, since I came in after 8pm - I felt a little rushed. 

We had the second tier choice for $24.99. Sides were pretty good - typical sides. Rice paper and sliced radish was not prepared until I asked, but when the rice paper came out it was stiff, and they had no way to heat it up at the time. 

The meats we ordered were la ribs, boneless beef meat, beef bulgogi, spicy chicken bulgogi, spicy pork bulgogi, and beef brisket. Most were good but nothing amazing. The beef bulgogi, however, were below par - definitely needs some more marinade.

Overall... not bad, but it doesn't make me crave KBBQ like I usually do. Definitely need to step up with big competition coming in."}
{"text":"It's ok. Language barrier with staff.  Atmosphere needs help.  Felt like I was in the den of predators, music videos of scantily clad teenage girls, weird how a number of male diners were watching them intently, just felt gross.  Meat was ok, most packed flavor. Not my vote to return.  Spend that kind of money you can get a fantastic meal with ambience."}
{"text":"Food is good, price is ok. Service, unfortunately is lacking, also the table is way to small. If service improves this would easily be 4 to 5 stars"}
{"text":"Love this place! All you can eat at a decent price. Our waitress, Marisol is the BEST! She made sure we well taken care of."}
{"text":"Really excited that there is an expanding ayce scene in az. When We got there, we had about a 20-30m wait. Some customers waiting ahead of us were a bit displeased, but after experiencing the hour-3hour waits in California, 20-30m was nothing. Service was a bit slow but nothing worth complaining about. As far as the quality of the meat, the meat was great. The beef was very tender and the marinated bulgolgis were a perfect balance of sweet, spicy, and savory. My only complaint is that the staff was a bit slow on keeping up with orders and that they ran out of lettuce but again, not worth complaining. Overall, great atmosphere, friendly staff, great food, and great experience. Will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place but i kept getting disappointed. First off was the limited side dishes (Ban Chan) that we're available. I asked for some potato salad/mash potatoes but I was told it was out of rotation. Secondly I asked for some egg omelette surprisingly that was also out of the rotation. I was beginning to lose hope since I did the top tier all you can eat option Gangnam which is there premium meat option. The meats did not taste fresh. It had a weird taste to it like it's been frozen and unfrozen so many times. The kimchi pancake was drenched in oil. Horrible! 

2 stars for the service. 

Honest review. I won't be returning. If only Sizzle was closer I would've gladly paid an extra $20 for real premium quality meats. What a bummer!"}
{"text":"I think my expectations were too high when I here. I have been to several Korean BBQ places and I figured this was gonna be the best considering it's in the middle if a shopping center full of Korean businesses including a Korean grocery store.

Overall the service was good, there was a bit of a wait when we first got there but after we were seated everything was fine. Some of the things I liked were that there was an all-you-can-eat option for the BBQ and I also liked the amount of meat options. Also, I felt like the price was right, which isn't always the case especially with Korean BBQ.

Some of the things I noted that I wasn't blown away by was that the beef brisket sucked and the sides weren't awesome either. I did find it to be a little ridiculous that they were out of some of the sides I really like when the building literally is attached to a Korean grocery store with everything they were out of. The sides that did come out were just okay.

I don't see myself returning but for anyone who hasn't been here I would say to stop in and give it a shot."}
{"text":"The best Korean BBQ in mase and tempe. 

Most importantly, their prices are very cheap. all you can eat just $19.98. There are six of seven different kinds of meat and two kinds of traditional Korean soup can choose. 


Friday and Saturday nutrition to 1:00am in midnight. This is very good for me."}
{"text":"Service is horrible. Came with my two daughter and had to wait over 20mins to get a table when clearly there were tables ready for us to sit down. No apologies or nothing. I was holding a car seat and the two managers or whatever was standing in the back holding hands and kissing while I was waiting when the table was already set up. Doesn't even deserve 1 star"}
{"text":"This is probably the best place for a weekend dinner with family. The food is delicious, and cooking on the large grill at the center of the table is super fun! All the meat is fresh and flavorful, the kids love it! Highly recommend beef bolgogi, the very nice waitress yimi recommended it and it's hands down my favorite on the menu!"}
{"text":"Finally an AYCE Korean BBQ in AZ.  I've been to several in Korea Town and around in LA and GENs in both LA and Las Vegas.  I made my first visit on a Saturday afternoon.  It wasn't too busy when we got there, but by the time we left, it was starting to get crowded.

Pros:  It's KBBQ in AZ.  The Beef Fingerlings and Short Ribs (Galbi) is  better than most of the other places I've had it.  Whatever they marinade the Galbi in is the best I've ever had.  The offer a ton of sides and most are quite good.  The service was very attentive.  They checked on the grill for us, adjusted the temperature accordingly and food was prompt.  

Cons:  Really only two AYCE options on weekends.  Floors were slick and bathrooms could have been kept better.  We actually told the manager about the bathroom and he apologized and said it was supposed to be taken care of and they would take care of it.  They were out of some items, specifically radish paper is what I recall.  I think they are still trying to figure out vendors, timing, etc.  

Overall, I would go back, but if the AYCE KBBQ trend makes it's way out to the valley, they have some areas to improve on to stay competitive.  I will say thanks to the owners of this place on taking a chance and being as far as I know the first to bringing the Korean BBQ AYCE option out in AZ."}
{"text":"Pretty good experience the past couple of times. I like that there are 3 packages to choose from that determine how much your bill will be. The downfall is that the cheaper one is not available on the weekend. So Friday- Sunday you can only choose from the mid package or the most expensive. 
I enjoyed the service. Customers are always greeted and welcomed well. I've gotten the same server everytime named Laura. She really lit up the place with her enthusiasm. 
The food was good but not great but for a eat all you can restaurant it's not bad! The beef finger, brisket, and thin pork belly are my favorite. Definitely worth a try though!"}
{"text":"Service decent but depends on the waiter. Food amazing AYCE deals, but the wait is long depending on what time you go."}
{"text":"I gave this place a 4 star because their food was decent. I know they have only been open for 2 months now and I think they can improve as they continue their service. Speaking about their service, it was decent. They are pretty short staffed it seems, which they should probably get that fixed before they lose customers. They have time to improve. Food is fine, if you crave Korean BBQ, this is the place to go. Their price on the weekday is different in the weekends, so you'll save more if you go during the weekday (just saying). Also, they can get very packed during the weekend so be prepared to wait."}
{"text":"Where do I even begin? First off, it's rare for me to give a straight out one star & I don't do it lightly since I'm a Korean living in AZ so of course I'm going to be excited about a new Korean BBQ place. I get that they just opened, but it was a complete mess. Technically this place had been open the day before we came to eat here for dinner so at least the major kinks should have been worked out, but that was NOT the case. 

We arrived here at 6:30pm with a total group of 9 people. We ended up sitting down for such a long time that we got up to grab our own menus (only 2 for the 9 of us). We kept trying to flag down someone once we decided what we wanted, but no one would pay us any attention. We decided to all go with the second tier (there's 3 tiers of All-You-Can-Eat options, although the first one, which is the cheapest, is only available M-Th). 

So here's when things really start to go downhill & why we were here for 2.5 hours against our will...
- After ordering, two plates of meat came decently quickly. BUT that's literally all we had on our table for the longest time. They did not come back with tongs, scissors, plates, or even UTENSILS. No one came to turn on our grill. We sat there with two plates of raw meat waiting. 
- If you're familiar with Korean restaurants some of them have a button on your table to press to call over your server. COMPLETELY USELESS. Apparently they wear something on their wrists to inform them when tables need service, but they were so flustered/untrained that they didn't even bother. We never had anyone come by pressing the button. 
- We had to ask for basic items MULTIPLE times. We would only be able to ask for things one thing at a time or otherwise they would completely forget about it. When we made our first order I asked for soybean paste soup along with our orders of meat. Guess what? Never got it. We asked for rice for everyone TWICE about half an hour in, NEVER GOT IT. Although a different server decided to come over after the second request to tell us that rice was a $1 each...We decided to then half our rice order since things were going SO SLOW that we were getting full at this point despite the fact that we all had barely ate. And yep you guessed it, we ended up not getting our rice at all. 
- The service was so terrible that we wanted to tell incoming patrons to leave. One table straight up left after drinking one bottle of beer because no one would come help them. A few parties waiting to be seated just turned around & left as well. You would think a restaurant would OVERSTAFF during their grand opening. Near the last half hour of our stay a couple other people were on the floor helping out (who we thought was the manager/owner/etc), but at this point it was a mess. One of them was frantically telling one of the servers what to do & which tables to serve...obviously no one had a clue what they were doing. Cherry on top? We saw a server taking PHOTOS on his dSLR camera during the busiest time.
- At this point for me even if the food was amazing I wouldn't have left happy. But the food itself was not great. We all agreed that the meat was flavorless for the most part; even the ones that were supposed to be marinated. It probably didn't help that they would NOT change the grill for us! What kind of Korean BBQ place does that??? They use these clunky grills, which at first does look cool/unique, but is just not practical. There's a hole in one end that is supposed to drain the oil as you grill but it just ends up pooling all around the edges because the grill isn't slanted. On top of that the tiny hole gets clogged & stops draining after a certain point. Even though there were empty tables that had clean grills, they refused to change it out. We asked two servers about it before one of them told us all they could do was come clean it with oil. We said okay, but AGAIN they never came back to do it for us. We had to scrape off the grill ourselves with chopsticks/napkins/a bone...trust me it was sadly funny. 
- The side dishes were sad as well. They only give you four & they consist of kimchi, eggplant, bean sprouts & radishes. Guess it worked out that they weren't great since we probably wouldn't have been able to get them refilled. Someone ordered intestines & they were not cleaned properly. The lettuce was wilted. 
- They have these huge vents above the tables but apparently did not want to turn on because \"they are loud.\" I expect to smell after Korean BBQ but this was on another level. Plus it starts to get smoky & because they don't change the grill it starts smelling like burnt meat all around.
- We didn't even want to pay at this point, but we decided to show them their Instagram deal which was supposed to be 20% off for following them & they messed that up too. 

Hands down the worst dining experience I've ever had. You could tell the ENTIRE restaurant was unhappy & angry. Unless they do a complete 180...DO NOT waste your time & money here."}
{"text":"finally a good quality Ayce Korean BBQ in Arizona, the only problem is the service, if they can put out the food faster n make everything more organized, it will be a great Hangout spot for friends n family. Not everybody wanna stay in the restaurant for more than 2 hours right? Got the 29.95 all you can eat, the first round comes really fast but we waited 30mins for the second order, waitress are all clueless running around. Will be bk next month and hopefully they can organize everything better."}
{"text":"OMG! I am stuffed! The food was amazing! Get the Choice Meals its the way to go! Unlimited everything! We ran out of table space because we had so much food. You cook your meat, super fun. Justin was great and directed us in the right direction on everything. Must experience!!"}
{"text":"Note from the Lyrical Foodie.....

(I know what you're thinking; you can use that Gangnam song by Psy!  I get it and so do you. So I'll let your imagination flourish while I review this time --- wink!)

My first Korean BBQ All-You-Can-Eat experience in PHX!  I was quite excited to see a Korean strip mall popping up somewhere close by finally!

I came to Gangnam BBQ with my family on a weekday and it was popping busy!  It stirred my interest; how good is this place?  First off, there are 3 different price points; $29.95, the Gangnam, gets you all the choice of ingredients, $24.95 is they called Prime because you don't get all the premium ingredients, and lastly the Choice, which why waste your time?  We went for the Beef Brisket, Pork Belly, Bulgogi, Squid, Marinated Beef, Marinated Pork Ribs.  The cooking part was fun, but for me can get boring at times; having to adjust the flames to get the right temperature blah!  We were offered 2 dipping sauces; the meat sauce and sesame seed sauce.  Needless to say, I felt I kept my dipping sauce close by since the meats we started off was pretty bland.  The marinated meats definitely needed some more time to marinate!  I didn't really get that salty and sweet bulgogi bite from any of the beef; just a hint of it.  However, I think my favorite bite of the night was probably the pork bulgogi.  That definitely had a good marinate to it and not sure maybe people didn't order the pork as much since it tasted like it had time to marinate.  

In the end, the service was okay.  They seemed overwhelmed and busy, but being one of the first All You Can Eat BBQ; I get it.  The place is diving like any Korean BBQ place with large hoods placed over the tables.  Large flat screens playing K-Pop was fun in the background.   They do serve alcohol but not much of a selection of Korean beers; I think they only had 3. - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"For what it's worth, the food is decent. The meat is a bit sour to taste and doesn't really taste fresh. They had no rice paper, and the service was just okay. I think the layout for seating is a bit awkward. It's a typical Korean bbq setting. Nothing amazing. Kpop is being played very loudly in the background with TVs also showing kpop. The food needs to be a bit more fresh to get us to come back. And rice paper please :)"}
{"text":"This place is ok if you are in the area. Having went to Gen KBBQ at Tempe Marketplace like 4 times since it's been open for 2 months, it really spoils you. We decided to come here because we were attending an event at another business in the plaza, so instead, we opted to eat here and not worry about rushing to the event next door.

First off, the grill seemed to grill unevenly. It took FOREVER to cook some of the meat. Eventually, we used one side of the grill to cook the meat and the other side as a waiting area for cooked meat. I believe the quality of the meat was decent. Not the best but decent based on the Prime Selection I chose. The marinade and sauces for the meats were not amazing. It was ok. And at the end, I realized that they didn't change our grill once. It was getting so dirty and crusted.

As for the service, you can order as much meat as you want. At least our waitress let us order a lot. The only problem was that the meats took forever to come out. I was told that the people in the back has to prepare the raw meat. Well, it took like 10-15 minutes for each small plate of meat order to come out. It was ridiculous! Service was just slow.

Go to Gen KBBQ for a lot more choice of meat selection, amazing flavors, faster service, cleaner environment, and better experience."}
{"text":"This place is adequate for an all you can eat(within 2 hours) Korean BBQ, Like others have said, the service can be spotty and is highly dependent on which server you get. I came here when they first opened and the place seemed very disorganized, fast forward 2 months and it's still the same. I feel as though this is because the owners may be new to the restaurant industry. The three stars is for their meat selection and the server who did his best to be prompt and courteous even though the back of the house was in disarray."}
{"text":"So first off I've been coming here often with friends and the food is always Amazing the server Laura was super friendly and attentive to our every need their is no wait time and they have a new spice you can dip your meat in they also Carry Soju which I love a lot plus the meat and sides are authentic and remind me of my aunties cooking."}
{"text":"Went here off of a suggestion from a friend. Nice environment. Quiet. Server was very friendly and offered up suggestions. Will definitely go back. Food was excellent."}
{"text":"I came here on a Sunday night. The wait was about 45-60 minutes. They text us when our table was ready, which was in the expected time frame. Their menu and rules are pretty standard. Just read them and acquaint yourself to it before ordering. It is AYCE. Service was excellent. Our waitress was attentive and quick. She adjusted our grill constantly, and made sure we were satisfied at all times. I particularly liked this place because they gave us salad. When I am eating a bunch of meat, it's nice to counter balance that with a bunch of lettuce. I felt their meat was more lean/less fatty compared to another K BBQ place I recently visited. I was a fan of that. Additionally, they offered this amazing drink to close out or dinner. It tasted like horchata, but it wasn't horchata. Their pricing was less than another place I had visited, so that was another bonus.

The interior has a steel, industrial design. It's pretty neat to see these large hoods over the tables. Some parts were weird, like a random sink in the middle of the side dining area...? The tables themselves were kind of small, factoring in all the plate and grill. The grill was raised on the table and had an interesting design that relied on gravity to drain all the excess juices. I was not a fan of the grill because at the top, there is this handle-type thing that is quite intrusive to accessing the opposite side of the grill. They don't really change the grill during the dining experience so after a while, it gets pretty crusty. Crustiness isn't really an issue for me. It's more an FYI for you. I felt that ventilation in this place was slightly lacking. I definitely felt a strong heat and smell wave when I was there."}
{"text":"This place just opened and it's not too bad. Everyone was extremely nice/friendly and treated us with respect. I like the inside, very clean. I'd come back"}
{"text":"Full disclosure: this is my first Korean bbq. That said, the meat was really high quality and all the marinades were delicious. The servers are busy but attentive, and seem to enjoy their time here. 
in case you don't know, at a Korean bbq, you're cooking the meat yourself, so if you don't know how to tell when it's done bring a friend who does!"}
{"text":"Hey this place is pretty good! I went on a weekend and there was no line. Meat was good and there's quite a bit of variety. Our server, Jen, was super nice! She kept on checking up on us to see if we needed anything. Overall I think the meat quality is a 4 but customer service is a 5 so 5 stars it is!"}
{"text":"The place and service are really awesome. She will help cut and place the meat on the plate. The meat tastes good. Will go there next time."}
{"text":"So excited to find an all you can eat Korean spot in the valley! The service was very attentive the entire time and always were quick to our needs. The bulgogi  is pretty good, but could have a bit more marinade to bring out that Korean flavoring. The side dishes were good and the sauces were a nice touch to bring out more flavoring to the meat. All around for the entry level $20 all you can eat, its a solid choice to go with and I will for sure come back"}
{"text":"The food was great, the atmosphere was equally awesome. I am new to Korean BBQ, I will certainly be back."}
{"text":"First time going to a Korean BBQ and I must say, it was the best choice to make on a Saturday night. Great service and great food. All you can eat for a reasonable price. Friendly staff and the Fish Cakes are everything."}
{"text":"Korean BBQ place that opened up recently, and I was super excited. Had their lunch special all you can eat with my wife. We tried a standard assortment like beef bulgogi, pork etc. I truly did enjoy their beef bulgogi and their pork bulgogi. We also had their squid and octopus which I will say tasted ok, but sadly will probably not order again. They do give you decent assortment of side dishes including mixed greens to make yourself some lettuce wraps with your freshly grilled meet (delicious by the way).

While their customer service was good, they only get 3 stars from me due to a few things. First off they did not allow us to swap out the grill grate when it got too much char on it. They said they \"couldn't do this,\" but gave no reason. So after the first or second grill round of meet, we were left to use a grate that imparted char/burnt taste onto the grilled meat.

Secondly, some of the meet they gave us was too thick to really grill quickly on the grate. I'm used to very thinly cut meat to grill and it wasn't really working for me that the meat was close to a half an inch thick in some cases.

Overall, I will definitely give this place another try in the future, but they really need to think about some of the things I've mentioned if they truly want to give a customer a great experience."}
{"text":"First time here and I was pleasantly surprised! This place is amazing. Friendly staff and the service was as good! Lunch happy hour is for a long time, the korean bbq was perfect great prices, definitely recommend will come back!! I really enjoyed our lunch."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing, for what you pay you get vast amounts of amazing meats to bbq right in front of you! Just remember to eat all your meat or you'll get charged. You must order anything bulgogi and the pork belly! This place is a absolute returner for my family and hopefully yours!"}
{"text":"Food was very good.  They had a decent selection  of meats and all of the accompaniments.  The flavor was spot on and the pricing was as well.  

Would recommend this place.  I will be back..."}
{"text":"We were looking for a Korean BBQ that ended up being closed on Sundays. I found Gangnam BBQ on Yelp, and thought we would try it out.

The restaurant is in a small retail center,  now named The Korean Center or something similar. The interior is open and modern, with stainless lining the walls, retro art and an industrial feel. The Korean pop was way loud. And I was blissfully unaware that so many versions of Gangnam Style existed.

The menu is straightforward, with three tiers of course selections to choose from. However,  you can add a higher tier item at an additional $1.95 fee, so to get the basics and add some shrimp to the $19.95 package,  it was worth it. The grill wasn't what we were used to...it looked like an iron cauldron lid. Out heat got very low about midway through, but you have the ability to control it yourself, which was nice. The water service is in a neat little plastic bottle, and you get lined metal cups. The side dishes were plentiful.

Our server was interesting. The staff had a card game or something going on the side. They argued about who was getting up to help us. We ended up with a kid who, had he been older, I would have sworn that he watched Valley Girl or Fast Times at Ridgemont High a few too many times. Channeling Penn...totally. He was nice enough though, and checked on us to make sure we enjoyed the experience. Forgot the rice and sodas, but quickly remedied it.

The meats: The bulgogi chicken was WAY fatty. I couldn't eat it. The five flavor pork belly my husband got was just five pieces of pork belly, each dripping with a different sauce. He didn't like that, and felt kind of icky after eating it. The vegetables and mushrooms were disappointing. There was a slice of onion, a few slices of yam and some mushroom slices. The Gangnam spiced shrimp were great. I also really, really loved the squid. Just know, if you don't eat all of your meat, you can be assessed a $12 waste fee. We ate it all, but it could happen. For $39 and change for two people with some premium add-ons and sodas, it was well worth the price. We may come again, or try another."}
{"text":"So, I just came back from experiencing the AYCE Lunch Special ($14.95) and I have to say overall I was pretty happy. The options are more limited than the higher tiers but you honestly get your money's worth and my table really enjoyed the beef and spicy pork bulgogi (both are offered on all tiers of AYCE). We ended up getting multiple orders of that and to put this into perspective, at many of the Korean restaurants in the Tempe & Mesa area I've had to pay upwards of $18 for an entree of spicy pork. In addition at a lot of the restaurants the flavor of said pork can be tasteless. This pork was definitely not as spicy as I ideally prefer, but the flavor was great. Factor in the banchan, the lettuce, salad, and rice $14.95 for all you can eat of it that's pretty fantastic. 

Additionally, I have to say the service was much better than some of the reviews that were initially posted, and that's expected with any new restaurant, I always expect it to be a hot mess when they first open. My server was attentive asking if we were ready for the next round of meat. Food came quickly. I do have gripes about the soybean paste (doenjang jjigae) soup, it was overly salty and I've had plenty of this stuff in my lifetime, it is not meant to be that salty. I wouldn't order that again even though it's part of the AYCE. But that's the beauty of it, order something, try it and if you don't like it, don't order it again! And then focus on what you do like. My second issue was with the mulnaengmyun which is the cold buckwheat noodles, it's not offered on my tier of the AYCE but for 3.99 and the triple digit hell we call summer, I was just craving some. Not worth it to be honest, and I'd skip it to save room for more meat. 

The last reason I didn't give this place a 5 star, the bathrooms. Sweet Jesus. You can tell it was an older bathroom, there's this corner that looks like it used to be a shower, they removed parts of the shower but certain things remain (there's a built in soap rack still tiled into the wall). The sinks and toilets were not replaced and could use a good cleaning, bleaching and use of a pumice stone. I get that low flush toilets are expensive to replace, but a couple of sinks in the grand scheme would have been like a couple hundred bucks. You guys spring for fancy tile on the restaurant wall, brand new automatic soap dispensers and you can't be bothered to at least change the toilet seats? Ugh, that was like gas station gross. 


Two last things, the smell of gas was strong when we walked in. And I don't mean the smell of BBQ, I mean the smell of straight up gas which needs to be addressed whether it be better ventilation and/or please check regularly to make sure there are no leaks in the future. The smell did go away with time but it could have just been I had been smelling it for so long that I was desensitized. Lastly, the music, especially during the day, I have nothing against K-pop, I recognized most of the music, I was jamming out, but as far as conversing with your table, you had to compete with the music. Turn it down a couple notches, everyone will thank you for it. 


I don't know if I can see myself spending $30 plus for the prime tier of AYCE meat, but I might try the mid grade tier at another point in the future, I would like to try their ribs and other choice cuts of meat. If you find yourself hesitant, the $14.95 is the safest choice to try this restaurant for the first time."}
{"text":"Really cool atmosphere, love the korean music videos playing around the dining area. Lunch special for all you can eat BBQ is really fairly priced. I wish they had a more variety of the sides like some other Korean BBQ places. We had pork belly, beef bulgogi, brisket and brisket and brisket(because it was so good lol).The bean paste soup was also really tasty with a kick. I liked cooking right at the table that is pretty awesome. We will visit again soon."}
{"text":"First time coming to this Kbbq and we're not disappointed! We absolutely love every aspect of it from the helpful staff to the delicious meats. Judy was very attentive to us  and gave us recommendations to make the best of our experience. The food was delicious, I recommend the beef bulgogi and the beef brisket. Hands down one of the best kbbq!"}
{"text":"Ivan's talents; hospitality toward the 
customers; gangnam BBQ, Han's impression; Han's sophisticated marketing strategies were
unforgettable..."}
{"text":"Updating my review based on the second time I went to eat here, which was shortly after the first.

The second time I came here I was with two friends, one is a vegetarian who wasn't going to grill bbq and planned on getting something else off of the menu, however, we were informed that not a single one of the vegetarian items on the menu was available. She told the waitress she just wasn't going to eat anything then and we decided to stay - this is when the waitress started to look really concerned and said we all couldn't eat there if she didn't also pay. To be told that she wasn't even allowed to sit at the table even though she wasn't going to eat anything was really upsetting (especially since she couldn't get anything off of the menu) so we ended up speaking to the manager. He made it clear that she was not allowed to eat anything (which she wouldn't have anyway, since she is a vegetarian!!!) but could sit at the table. 

We brushed it off and still decided to stay, however, a while into our stay we wanted to order some more beef brisket (we had had two or three orders of it at this point) and were told they could only bring us one more order because that was all the beef brisket they had left. This was annoying, but would have been understandable if I had not seen another waiter bring our beef brisket to another table 10 minutes later!!! They essentially cut us off from ordering what we really wanted even though this is an all you can eat kbbq place. 

Besides that, the service was not great the second time around and things seemed disorganized. The meat also sticks really badly to the grill and doesn't heat evenly making it difficult to enjoy your food. 

Not sure how things are running now as I decided then not to come back, but really hope they've made some improvements."}
{"text":"I would not recommend this place to anyone and will not go to this place again.  There table a so small and not enough room for the side dishes, seasoning, plates.  There is a 2 hours limit for each table which I am ok with, however, the portion for each order is so small and the servers are always too busy to take our order.  While we were there, most of the time were spend waiting for meat to come.  The quality of meat is subpar and i would expect higher quality of meat for the price.  The exposed gas pipe is a safety hazard.  The owner told us that we need to have rice to go with the meat because that is the traditional Korean way.  Why would any one want to eat rice when they are here for all you can eat BBQ?"}
{"text":"Disappointing.  For the price you pay, go to GEN instead.  Not many options for all you can eat.  Meat quality was bad and tasted horrible, the kim chi and sides tasted horrible, soups were tasteless so we didn't even bother.  We came for dinner and was the only family there, no wonder."}
{"text":"Best Korean BBQ in the valley. Food and service was good. Would definitely recommend to anyone that wants Korean BBQ."}
{"text":"Great place to eat, there's many Korean BBQ in Arizona but by far this one is the best. All you can eat Korean BBQ is great, they'll give you the maximum food but don't order more then what you can't eat cuZ there's a $12.99 fee for all the food left over. The waitress (Judy) was really friendly and always checked up on us if we needed anything such a great service. Yes I would come back here again."}
{"text":"Very good place. But still needs improvement. Like more meat on each order and more waiter because 1 person can't handle 7 or 8 tables. Still a good place for korean bbq."}
{"text":"Not bad but not good. 
To be honest the only thing i liked about this place was the fact that its a small business. 

We went as a party of 4 adults and 3 kids.
Their tables were only 4 people seating so we had to sit separately... not a great arrangement for families bigger than 4! 

Also, they dont bring you more than 2 serving of meat at a time, even with a big party. They said its so you dont over order... really? 
2 hr limit and only 2 servings at a time for 7 people... 
Dont you charge for left over meat anyway?? 

Also the meat... everything that is marinated is poorly executed since i can still taste and smell the blood.(korean bbq usually requires the meat to be washed and soaked in water for a period of time to get the blood out, so the marinate gets embedded) 
 
To top off the horrible experience they have the nerves to add 18% gratuity. Really? Dont get me wrong, ive worked in the restaurant business. I believe in giving 18%+ tip anywhere I go. But with the lack of service and ridiculous rules for ayce?! 

We will not be returning for sure!"}
{"text":"I'm upset, I'm a really big fan of Korean barbecue because I'm Korean.
 I had beefbrisket, pork belly, beef bulgogi, soy bean paste stew. 
 Everything, literally, everything were terrible. Especially, beef bulgogi was the worst. Can't even feel the taste. Seriously, there was no taste existing. 
 I's so shamed that this restaurant has name of Gangnam. 
 I feel like threw my money in the trash can. 
Totally waste of money, the only pros with this restaurant is that servers were kind and friendly."}
{"text":"Yummy Korean BBQ! Finally an all you can eat k BBQ in Arizona! Service was amazing, staff was very friendly. However, I feel that there's something missing in their bulgogi sauce and the marinade sauce. Overall, pretty good for a new k BBQ place! Hoping to see more improvements in the future, we will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I was on business travel alone and felt like Korean food. So I looked this place up on Yelp and drive here...They didn't serve me and asked me to leave because I was alone, saying it was their policy not to serve party of one. I think there's something wrong with that policy. Don't go there if you are alone...They won't serve you"}
{"text":"Service is not that great, could have been better.  Waitress was not paying attention to her guests.  The food was good."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best AYCE KBBQ in the Phoenix area. The price is very good, the quality of the meats is insane. The service is always outstanding. Try the kimchi pancake and the Five color pork belly. Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm"}
{"text":"I am ecstatic that we finally have an AYCE KBBQ in AZ!! We went during happy hour when the price is $15 per person. Fortunately we arrived after the lunch rush. The server was very friendly and attentive. My only complaint would be that they don't have brisket sauce!! Coming from CA, all the KBBQ there has brisket sauce so I was disappointed. I would recommend having a container of brisket sauce and hot chilli sauce at every table. I'm sure the other KBBQ spots opening here soon will have them! Gotta get on top of it!"}
{"text":"Really good food and reasonably price. The people here were really nice and accommodating of me being a 'stranger from afar!' The staff is very personable but not intrusive. Definitely adding to my list for good KBBQ when I'm visiting!!"}
{"text":"Gangnam BBQ is well known for their all you can eat Korean BBQ. But they are now serving Shabu-Shabu, a Japanese dish where one cooks meats and vegetables in a boiling broth. We  ordered the Shabu-Shabu. We had the beef bone broth for our broth. For our meats and vegetables, we had beef brisket, crab stick, mushroom, tofu and cabbage. We enjoyed the meats and vegetables. The Shabu-Shabu had several sauces to dip the meats and vegetables in as well. The soy sauce was our favorite sauce. All in all, the Shabu Shabu was a nice change of pace."}
{"text":"I went with my 11 year old, It was pretty good, but I didn't know what to order for her, I picked one, and it turned out she liked the other one. so i had to eat all the one i didn't like as much.

but next time i plan to know what to order, the Kimchee was so fresh and delish! I could have eaten that all night, My kid liked the potato salad. (so did I) 

It was an odd atmosphere for a Korean restaraunt, but hey that's okay the food is good, service okay, so what is there to complain about? just not knowing what to order, next time, I w ill be covered loved the brisket, the Bulgogi was a bit too sweet for my taste, and my kids as well, I thought she would like it, the Galbi was YUMMY! I had to ask her not to  cut off the fat from the bone! (my favorite part) LOL"}
{"text":"The East Valley FINALLY has a delicious and traditional AYCE Korean BBQ spot!! Not overpriced  and they have tons of choices, I HIGHLY recommend the rib finger meat (rib meat) and their side dishes are spot on. 

I always order 2 steamed eggs... for myself haha. The cold noodles is my favorite, definitely try one on a hot summer day in AZ. It's offered in the AYCE menu too. 

I honestly love that that they serve everything in smaller portions so that the food doesn't go to waste. 
I love the servers here! They're all so attentive and fast.

When anyone asks me where to get Korean BBQ in AZ, I tell them Gangnam BBQ"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! If you're looking for something similar to California places this place is it! $20 for delicious food very satisfying !! Must try!! We will definitely be coming back often! If you don't know what to order get try their brisket, beef bulgogi, and marinated beef rib!!"}
{"text":"This place is on point. The food was amazing.  Our server Judy was great. By far one of my favorite restaurants in Az."}
{"text":"Yassss!! This is the best Korean BBQ place so far in Arizona. The service was good, she even cooked for us. but the only thing I didn't like is they would charge you if you didn't finish your food."}
{"text":"Heard about this place from a friend and decided to  try it out with so friends. I didn't know anything about this place before we came except that it was new but I was pretty happy about my experience here. We went during lunch time so it wasn't that busy. There was no wait time, we were seated right away, ordered the all-you-can-eat HAPPY tier, food came out fast. Our server was super nice, always making sure we had everything we needed, if we were ready to order more or if we needed any refills on our bancha. Meat quality was good and the portions they gave was great and the price for everything was so cheap.This place is definitely gonna be my new go to place KBBQ."}
{"text":"Food was good, service wasn't the greatest. Had reservations for 15 at 5pm. When we arrived at 4:55 they didn't know where the \"reservation binder\" was so it took 30 mins to set up 3 tables in the side room. No ventilation in the side room so it was extremely smoky. Understaffed."}
{"text":"I'm going to break this down into a simple, but detailed review.

Pros:
- Relatively inexpensive. $20 for AYCE KBBQ isn't super cheap, but its not extremely expensive either.

- The quality of meat is pretty good. I'm no food connoisseur, but everything on the menu that I've tried tastes pretty good.

- Side dishes are tasty. The kimchi sings to my taste buds.

- The dining area is very roomy. Lot's of open space with a few TV's and music.



Cons:
**All my criticism is purely constructive, and I hope the servers can use this to improve!**

- Service can get quite slow when they're busy. When I needed something I would look around to see if I can catch anybody's attention and raise my hand, but the servers are all over the place. Often times I see all 3 or 4 servers cleaning tables. That really shouldn't be the case. Assign 1-2 servers to turn over tables while the rest make sure the customers are happy!

- The bell system isn't working(?). We pressed the bell on the side of the table, but no one came to our table to help us until I either got up to ask or waved my hands in their direct line of sight. There is no audible sound when you press the bell like most places, but I think they all wear some sort of watch that gives them alerts?

- The giant silver ventilation fans on the top do not seem to be working. When I walked in it was as if someone was vaping all over the place. (lol)

- There were pockets of time ~5-7 minutes between each order so we're not able to continuously eat food. Although I suppose this could be avoided by letting them know what you want next as soon as you get your food.

- Our side dishes were never refilled, but we never asked so there's that. I'm sure they would have happily refilled it if we had asked, but it would have been nice if they asked us if we wanted more. (I'm being nitpicky here. Not a huge issue) 

- We didn't get any silverware besides chopsticks and had to ask 3 times for spoons to eat our soup and rice.
_________________________

Overall, I left feeling full and pleased. There were quite a bit of things that I would like to see changed next time I come, but it is a new business, and no one becomes a professional server overnight. I will definitely come back every once in a while to satisfy my KBBQ cravings. If the staff is reading this I hope you really take my advice to consideration! I'll update my review accordingly.


Edit: I came back to give this place another try. One of the servers nearly spilled hot soup on my moms lap. The marinated boneless gal I was NOT marinated at all. I was eating flavorless beef steak! Sorry, but I will be going to Gen now that it is open."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. I really did. But there were too many things that went wrong. For one, it's a bad value. Portions are so small. Meat didn't look or taste fresh. Side dishes looked as if they have been sitting unrefridgerated for hours. 

I can overlook that if management wasn't such an asshole, though. Seems as if management only cared for large parties, AKA more tip money. My friend and I were largely ignored by everyone for the first 30 minutes, coming in 15 minutes before a larger walk-in family. Management threw on that fake smile while approaching them, and gave them food before us... while looking at us sometimes and just brushing us off. And at that time, the restaurant wasn't even busy. We were one of like six parties. 

Anyways, after sitting and waiting hungry, the BUS BOY (or some back kitchen worker) approached us and took our orders. Funny how someone underpaid cares more about customers than overpaid management. Our assigned waitress finally came like 10 minutes after the busboy and took care of us. 

If it weren't for the kind low level worker, I would give this horrible place zero or less stars, and if Yelp allowed it. 

If you have a small party, and look young AKA having less money than a family, count on getting blatantly ignored by management. If not, enjoy the fact that the owner is trying to capitalize on the fact that Korean food is exotic and rising in popularity by giving the cheapest cuts of meat possible. 

Also, I hope the shitty manager didn't take the personal tip that gave to the only guy who gave a fuck about us."}
{"text":"The food was excellent! It's too bad the other reviewers didn't receive the same customer service we had. Our lady was amazing and on top of it. We chose the CHOICE ayce and it was worth it. The marinated meats were delicious."}
{"text":"The meat was fatty, old, and in tiny portions. 
Vegetables werent as fresh. The side dishes were a bit salty. 
Customer service was good for the first 30 mins and then had to reorder the same thing three times and ask for it within a span of 15 -20 mins."}
{"text":"Place had improved greatly! Service is quick and amazing! Loved my experience here, the vibe this place gives is awesome! The servers are still undergoing training and doing their best to become better at what they do which is fine with me because if you were in their position you would be trying your best to learn everything quickly! Some of the servers are other ethnicities besides Korean and that is pretty cool! This place just opened up so give it time to become the best it can be! Everyone is hardworking and trying their best to make the place perfect with a good flow. They also play k-pop and it is very interesting, all servers have a great bond with each other and it's smiles all around! Favorite Korean bbq place EVER!!"}
{"text":"This is the best place to go for Korean BBQ.  The food was fantastic, bbq gluttons paradise, and Marisol our server was phenomenal.  This place is a must go."}
{"text":"Really was looking forward to this place cause it's all you can eat! The meat was alright, not bad quality for Arizona, not the same par with California but hey, it'll get satisfy your craving!

The main issue with this place was service! This place is a complete mess with the 12 people that are doing stuff other than actually helping the customer. Our one server, forgot our orders multiple times, and theeeee WORST thing you can ever do at an all you can eat Korean BBQ place is make the customers wait for their food! We literally waited a good 15 minutes to get our next order, meanwhile we see 4 people at the front register figuring something, 2 people already mopping the area when that should saved for closing time, and 2 people where their only job is to refill your water. 

The building definitely needs some proper ventilation for a Korean BBQ place. It seems the moment you walk in, you're in a huge cloud of smoke! Every time we asked for more sesame oil, our steamed egg, or a bowl of rice we had to constantly ask them to remind them and the guy kept apologizing. 

Also the tables are SOOOO small and the grill took up at least 70% of the area that whenever our meat arrived, they literally just handed us the plates. Also with all the staff, you would expect them to remove the dirty dishes right away, but nope, we literally had to take our dirty dishes and put them somewhere else!

Please don't hate me for this review, it was just our experience there and I had to be honest, but judging from the other reviews I see, the service needs to be worked on a lot."}
{"text":"So we heard Gangnam had a set menu, and since we were craving BBQ but not necessarily AYCE, we thought it would perfect. First of all, the pork set menu is a DEAL! $22 for like 4 or 5 different types of pork plus steamed egg and soybean paste stew. Luckily, they don't skimp around with the meat, especially the bulgogi! We appreciated that, because we did have a worry it would be a small amount. Honestly, though, I don't think the beef set menu is worth it for the price alone. It's, like, $35? With just $5 more you can get 2 AYCE and get everything included in the set menu and more! So just keep that in mind.

Now for the food. I've seen some people on yelp complain about the meat quality, but personally I found no problem with the quality. In fact, I found it to be much better quality than Gen (but still not as good as Manna). So that's a plus! But I had some other issues... first of all, the side dishes were just plain bad lol. Their \"ssamjang\" was not good either. Soybean paste soup was just ok taste-wise, although I appreciated the amount of ingredients in it. Also, the pork bulgogi tasted good, but it didn't feel homemade- it felt like the jar of sauce you get at the Asian market.

Overall, we would come back for the set menu if we want BBQ but are feeling cheap. It's a good deal and the meat quality is good. Service is also really good (we liked our server a lot, she was attentive but not overbearing)! I just have to knock it for these other aspects. I don't know if I'd come back here for regular AYCE, as Manna definitely beats it in every other aspect."}
{"text":"3.5 stars out of 5.. our waiter was pretty good he was on top of it.. he checked on us often.. couple things I would only suggest to help improve is their marinade on the meats can be a little better and I wish that they give each person their own sauces to dip their meats in, instead of having people share.. their prices for a lunch all u can eat was great 14.99 a person.."}
{"text":"Came here last night, was very excited when I saw this place. Walking in I knew it wasn't going to be a great experience. It seems like there was a lot of confusion trying to seat everyone. The staff was friendly and sides were good. The meat came out lacking a lot of flavor...slightly disappointed."}
{"text":"Let me describe this restaurant in 1 word: SUBPAR.
First of all, quality of their meet is subpar. Second of all, their wait staff is subpar. After trying out their $25 AYCE option, I'm feeling cheated. I want my money back. Their wait staff needs further training. They don't even offer to cook your bbq. On top of that, if you go with 4 or more people, they automatically add 18% gratuity. I don't mind tipping 20% at kbbq if the service is great. But they don't cook your meat. You have to do all your cooking and they still charge you 18% gratuity. This is what I call highway robbery. We need better kbbq in AZ. Can't wait till Gen KBBQ comes to Tempe. Don't waste your money here."}
{"text":"Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink):
1 star:  Never again.
2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back.
3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad.
4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return.
5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.

Don't come here expecting LA or NYC.  Or even DC or Atlanta.  Maybe not even Denver.  If I'm really going to make an apples to apples comparison to other all you can eat Korean BBQ places, this place is astoundingly average.

The following is a list of things and observations from bad to great that, in general, justify my 3-star review.

Grill that never got hot enough
Only 4 types of banchan
The noo roong ji
The LA-style kalbi
The steamed egg
Over-dressed green onion salad
The daengjang jigae (great broth, with almost nothing in it)
The taste of the banchan
Chadol baegi
Marinated pork neck
Service
Pork cheek

It's a bad sign when the kalbi is the 4th worst thing on the list.  Overly sweet without being tender.  As opposed to the pork cheek, which was perfect.  Service (a la K-Town with a buzzer and everything) is great.  Friendly and attentive whenever the button was pressed.

The grill they use still annoys me when I think about it, but if we're ever really craving Korean BBQ, at least we have an option that's better than the Korean BBQ down the road (also in Mesa, you know, the one off Guadalupe).

Wait for Gen BBQ to open up in Tempe y'all."}
{"text":"Some of the reasons this place got such a low review was they turned on the vents twice for only 10 seconds. We where in side room and the room was filling with smoke from the grill. When we asked to turn the vents on they said we don't keep them on long because they are loud. Also it took quite a bit time to get our food. I also did not how the grill sat above the table causing splattering on people sitting around the table. Also the seasoning on the meats were a little bland"}
{"text":"The kbbq was good but the sides were lacking, actually had to beg to get kimchi.. I think the wait staff has not been properly trained on cooking techniques, I've been to many similar restaurants in LA and Atlanta where the servers are on point with cooking. Our server last night basically was telling me last night that I should cook it myself.. this is very unkorean"}
{"text":"My first Korean BBQ, and it was great! I loved the Pork Belly!! The service was great, and I only had to wait about 5-10 minutes for the meat to arrive! It was very fun to cook the meat, but you can also request them to cook the food you ordered yourself. The waiter that served me food was super friendly and helped me right away. The food is a bit pricy, but it is all worth it! Went with my aunt and my mom, they were so full!"}
{"text":"My first time coming here, we sat in a table that clearly had grease on the placemat. I went with a big group and our orders were getting mixed up even though we were sitting in different tables. As for the service, I'd have to say that it was pretty slow but despite all of this, their food is pretty good. I recommend the pork neck meat and jowl!"}
{"text":"??????????????All can eat ??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Really good! People are super nice here. All you can eat BBQ too. Just wish there was more room in my table to put more food ;)"}
{"text":"My first experience at all you can eat Korean BBQ and definitely was worth it. The food was delicious and yummy. The staff was welcoming and attentive. I'm definitely coming back here again."}
{"text":"Valiant effort! While all the components are there, they missed the mark. The grill is functional. The sides are adequate. The staff is friendly but lacking in actually waiting tables. They had a great variety of meat to choose from but it isn't seasoned and the table didn't offer soy sauce or salt. I would love to see a veggie option on the list next time. They just opened so we are giving them they benefit of the doubt and will try again in a few months..."}
{"text":"Let's give it a try! We love Korean BBQ and my friend said this place just opened up and is pretty good.

Ok love the thin pork belly and yes everything else was good. The disk looking pan that the meat cooks on is a pretty big so you can cook fast and lots on it. Pretty busy since everyone is learning about this place. It's bright and loud in here and apparently their prices has changed from last week but it's still decent. Our server was Justin and he took good care of us. 

We usually go to LA and Vegas for Korean BBQ but this is the place for Phoenix. You absolutely need to make a stop here and yes expect a wait. We waited 30mins, we had a party of 8 though. There is a Korean market next door and a boba place so you can explore a little while you wait."}
{"text":"Being from Queens, NY and having been to Korea more than 10 times I like to think I know what good Korean BBQ is. Any body complaining about the service is a fool. Not only does this place have great service, but even if it had the worst service I've ever experienced it would still be worth it for how good the food is. I'm going to recommend this place to everyone I know so they don't miss out on this authentic Korean BBQ experience."}
{"text":"This place was delicious!!! Our server Justin was AWESOME!!! Great vibe and atmosphere!!!"}
{"text":"Honestly one of the best Korean BBQ restaurants I've ever had in my life. Growing up eating Korean BBQ, I have high standards and the quality food is 5 star. The waiting staff was very attentive even when they were swamped. We had everything from the cold noodle to the soft pork belly and it was amazing. I totally recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a great food and beverage experience!!! Best birthday dinner ever + out server Aaron was awesome!!!"}
{"text":"Sounds like a good place, but it's disappointing how they have a policy of not serving party below 2. You know know it would be nice just to eat by yourself sometimes, especially all you can eat Korean BBQ.

From a business standpoint, any revenue is good. I believe refusing service just because you're solo is not a good policy. Also,telling me that most Korean restaurants does that, well this is the first time. There are many Korean eat all you can restaurants that will serve a party of one. ie. Hawaii, Los Angeles has many restaurants that does that.
I would say if in a party of one, more food might be wasted but having their policy of just ordering one meat at a time, that would give them a lower probability of having more wasted food."}
{"text":"I'm literally so stuffed happy and content with this place it's one of the only all you can eat Korean BBQs spots in Arizona the managers constantly asked how we were doing the service was impeccable and this place has been open for only one week! I recommend this place to anyone who's looking for a good time!"}
{"text":"I'm half Korean, so I've had a lot of Korean food in my lifetime and I have to say, this place is pretty terrible. Very Americanized Korean food. It's an all you can eat BBQ, and the meats are cooked at your table as you order it. We came during the Sunday lunch time and or server was very clearly busy. Things were forgotten, like our rice. We had to remind her of things that we ordered. Unfortunately the subpar service extends to the other servers we tried to track down because our waitress wasn't very attentive. We asked to place another order and the gentleman was very dismissive. 

The food itself is bad. Tasteless, bland, and not very good. My bulgogi was particularly fatty, to the point where I could barely eat the serving that I was given. I've never had bulgogi with so much hard and chewy fat. They also don't have gochujang (spicy red bean paste) and only that generic chili garlic sauce. Seriously - what kind of Korean restaurant doesn't have gochujang? Either that, or our server had no idea what we were talking about. 

I'm honestly very surprised with the high ratings of this place. The service was terrible and the food wasn't any better. If you live in the Phoenix area, there are much better options."}
{"text":"Been on a mission. To try all these new Korean bbq places that have been opening. This place was okay. Service was great and I loved our waitress. But compared to others I feel this one didn't have as many options and side dishes as others. It was more open which helps with the air flow and the music was fun with Korean pop videos."}
{"text":"Wait is long if you don't have reservations. Service is inconsistent and depends on the waiter you get. If you like all you can eat then this is the place. If you prefer to eat more authentic Korean cuisine then there better restaurants in the area. Be prepare to smell like a BBQ pit as ventilation is not very good."}
{"text":"Went here a couple of times when I am craving kbbq and want to do AYCE/cook with good peeps. When served four or more tip is included with the bill. The different types of meat they serve is good. They have pork, beef, chicken, etc. I feel that they don't have a variety of seafood. They only have octopus and squid which I am not really a big fan of. If they had shrimp this place would be a hit. Also, everytime I come here I feel that the service is too slow compared to other kbbq places. I always have to press the service button twice. They do apologize for taking too long. Also for forgetting my orders sometimes. So I guess that is okay. Honestly, I think I will have to stick to Gens due to service and having more variety of meat/seafood in their menu."}
{"text":"This place has a nice atmosphere. Many of the servers are friendly and easygoing. It felt like family eating here. Maybe the service will be bad, but overall, the servers make it feel like home. It was hilarious eating here and even if I didn't eat anything, I would've been full off of laughter. I really do recommend this place (:"}
{"text":"I am from New York and I know good Korean food. This place has great quality meat and the owner Mr. Kim is so gracious. 

Win!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend took me to this place for my birthday and we're going back today. Its probably the closest thing to all those SoCal AYCE korean bbq joints. I usually eat wayyy too much to order kbbq at a normal place, so the price here is very fair. Their meats here are pretty good, even tho we just stuck to beef brisket and bulgogi. They make you cool on top of a lid instead of a grill, but the heat qas good and the oil drains pretty well. Our waiter was also very friendly and made small talk with us while we waited for the food. The atmosphere inside is pretty chill too, with good vents and korean pop videos everywhere. It didnt feel too crammed and the food came out fast."}
{"text":"This place is a non-organized restaurant. The first time I went there early so we got an chance to enjoy the food. The food was good, except the service. There were only couple tables but they acted like serving 100 tables, they only gave us couple pieces of meat and needed to wait for 10-15 minutes for another small plate. The second time I came here, the night before Labor Day. We arrived there around 7:20pm and waited for the table regularly. They lady told us it would be 1 hour wait, and we were ok with that since we thought they would be closed at 10pm like regular. However, around 8:01pm, they messaged us that their kitchen would be close at 9pm, so we went inside and asked how long do we need to wait again, they told us it would be 1 hour wait again! (Then what we should to eat) Isn't they should let customers knows their closing time before letting customers wait for the tables!!!??? When they called, we told they they should had say something to customers if they changed closing time, however, they didn't apologized and just told us they have already cancelled the table!!! Wow, I guess it was our fault for not knowing their kitchen closing time and wasted almost 40 minutes there before they told us about the info.. Oops, my bad!!"}
{"text":"This is a place for Korean BBQ.  Go here with an appetite.  You need to like Korean BBQ.  If you go expecting anything else, you will be disappointed.  

Overall the menu us pretty standard.  The service was good.  Due to the heavy nature of BBQ, I do not know if my wife and I would go back.  Things like this sometimes are a bit heavy for us to eat."}
{"text":"Thought I try this place.
All you can eat with 2 hour limit.
I'm ok with it, but when you get 2 pieces at a time for 6 people & reorder takes 10 minutes, I'll starve before the 2 hour is up. 
There's 3 tier of all you can eat.
It was on a Monday & there were 4 servers & 3 tables when we walked in at 5:00 ish. 
The quality of meat definitely lacks huge!!! Because it takes forever to get the meat, we tried ordering 5 orders at a time but only could get 2-3 orders at a time. We ended up ordering roughly 15 orders of brisket. Kalbi was very tough & chewy, pork belly takes forever to cook & 2 pieces at a time, pork jaw was ok. 4 side dishes were served, table too small to place salad, drink, side dishes, lettuce, rice, sauces & etc.
I gave 3 star because the server. She was attentative & made sure we got everything even though it took some time."}
{"text":"It was okay. Our server didn't come give our drinks and reminder her 3 times that we asked for another server to do it. 

Food was great but would be better with the pricing.."}
{"text":"I'm always sketch about trying out any \"All-You-Can-Eat\" Korean BBQ places in Arizona because it's either the meat is horrible, doesn't meet an adequate serving per order, or there's some sort of catch that scams customers. Then came along this heavenly place. Service is amazing as long as they're not too busy, which is understandable. The meat portions/serving per order is great and comes out fast! It also tastes amazing as well. I love this place!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was terrible. We had reservations two weeks ago for a party of 11 and when we got there they said they didn't have a reservation for us. We were able to sit in their separate party room and it got so smoky in there and when they tried to ventilate the smoke out the air that came out was like the heater so it was either smoky air or hot air. The meats were not good, they were chewy but tough and the quality was not good. The marinade on the marinated meats were not good. We ordered the noorongji and they literally gave us a bowl of rice with hot water in it. Their bathrooms were dirty and disgusting and there was no toilet paper in any of the stalls or paper towels.  I will not come back ever."}
{"text":"Incredible food, and our server was hilarious. Will be back.

The meat was high quality, and the the service was spot on"}
{"text":"Gangnam BBQ is a new restaurant in Mesa,  couple days open, but the food is between good to excellent,  of course costumer services needs to improve, waiting time is a little longer that one expect in a Koreab BBQ place but nothing crazy. They have three levels of BBQ, ranging from 19.00 to 30.00 USD,  and you can eat all you can  (for a maximum of two hours) side dishes are good and tasty, maybe they can get fountain sodas in the future, but now only can sodas.  Tables are intended for four persons, if you party is larger (but less than 8) you will have a small gap between tables, more than 8 and you will have complete separate positions, need to plan accordingly"}
{"text":"I eat a lot of Korean cuisine and definitely love this place (50% of my diet actually lol). For $30, you get to eat top notch beef. I agree that the portion is not big and they only limit it to 1 serving for the top notch beef. However, it is big enough to fill up the party of two. I came here twice (Thursday and then again on Saturday). The service was definitely much better during the weekdays. It is understandable since they were much busier. My only complain is their ventilation system. It is extremely hard not to walk out completely covered with BBQ smell & the A/C isn't high enough. Other than that, I will say you definitely get enough food for the amount of money you will spend."}
{"text":"This is the best Korean BBQ restaurant I have ever been to. I typically do not like going out to eat because I work in the restaurant industry and I have high standards. This place was so incredible I had to write about it. Highly recommend Justin as he is very professional and carries great vibes."}
