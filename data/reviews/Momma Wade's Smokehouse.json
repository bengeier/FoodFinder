{"text":"Ran across the Momma Wade's Smokehouse food cart outside of McArthur's Brew House at the corner of Bailey Rd. & Rte. 59 in the Falls. Perfect timing as I was thinking about dinner and had BBQ on my mind.

The owner went over the menu with me and let me sample all the sauces. I decided on a brisket sandwich ($7) and a side of mac-n-cheese ($4). He loaded up the brisket and let me sauce it myself. I went with the \"Mike's Butt Sauce\", a vinegar/pepper sauce that was both tangy and spicy. He also loaded up a generous helping of the mac-n-cheese.

The brisket was tender and delicious, especially with the sauce which was excellent. The mac-n-cheese also tasted very good. I really like that they use full sized penne pasta instead of the standard elbow macaroni. The owner told me that he and his partner both have full time jobs so this is mostly a weekend gig for them at this point. They plan to be in this same spot 6x during the month of October and can be found every Sunday at Madcap Brewing in Kent.

They have a website but their FB page seems to be the place to find out where they are going to be and when. They are worth seeking out, this is some good BBQ!"}

{"text":"I've been to some of the venues but was fortunate to sample most if not all of Momma Wade's Smoke House meats, sauces, and sides (the Mac-n-Cheese is the bomb), as well as the cookies. Mike (the Owner) says the cookies are an old family recipe which is an oatmeal crisp and delightful.  

It's not often I find a meal from a cart that can transform basic components into a memorable culinary experience but I suggest that you try it, sample the ribs or brisket, and form your own opinion...it's all good and you can't go wrong.  

It's reasonably priced, the portions are generous and the food fresh and tasty. I enjoy the ribs, the pink tint to the meat with some nice bark and a tender interior is delicious."}
