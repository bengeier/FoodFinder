{"text":"I used to eat here 40 years ago with my parents and sisters. Today, I order from here on a regular basis. The food is just as good as it was when I was a kid. My wife & kids love it as well, the original authentic Canadian Chinese food that we grew up with. It's delicious and you won't regret it. Remember, when ordering, always order for less people since they put a lot of food...we are 4 adults now and always order for 3 and have leftovers for all 4 lunches the next day. ENJOY!!"}
{"text":"We ordered delivery this week. The food came promptly and the broccoli in our beef broccoli was tender-crisp. A solid 3- to 3 1/2 stars.  On Rock Garden has been replaced by another Chinese buffet called Restaurant Xing Long. Same location, same phone number. Not sure whether the menu is the same but they have the standard Chinese-Canadian fare. It's a bit more than I expected to pay ($9-$12 for most main dishes) but the free delivery kind of balances that out.  We'll order from here again."}
{"text":"Old school chinese take out. and Buffet. How old school? My mother was going there when she was a teenager. They haven't changed anything. Good gooey sweet Canadian Chinese grub. Eat up."}
