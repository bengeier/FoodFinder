{"text":"Tried this place with a friend (on November 11th) because of celebrity chef Mark McEwan. Came for a late lunch around 2:30. There was only us and another table of 2. Waitress took and brought our drink orders and then never returned to take our food orders. So after 20 minutes, I actually got up to find her - she was too busy socializing with her colleague behind the bar. I ordered the parpadelle with braised beef, my friend ordered the funghi pizza, and we shared the truffle fries. Another waitress then brought us bread, but with no spread/butter?? I decided not to say anything, as I could tell my friend was uncomfortable as she's not the sort of person who ever says anything when she receives bad service. The parpadelle was delicious, but the truffle fries were only ok - couldn't really taste any truffle. Total for lunch, including 3 ice teas - by the way, they charged us for an ice tea refill - was over $80. I don't mind paying for good food and service, but thought this price was a little steep. Will not be returning. I expected more from a Mark McEwan restaurant."}
{"text":"The pizza offered at Fabbricca is AMAZING. It's the best pizza I've had in Toronto. Italian-style, thin crust, cheesy, and fresh high-quality toppings. It was so delicious! The service was excellent and I was stunned to see the restaurant received below 4 stars. I heard the pasta dishes were to die for so that is what I'm having next time I visit :-)"}
{"text":"Came here for an early dinner with a friend. Was impressed by the ambience and friendly service.

The menu was standard. I found the selection of salads was limited. I ended up getting the kale and mushroom pizza, which was quite nice.

For dessert, i shared the tiramisu bombolone. It was deep-fried dough with chocolate and espresso sauce. It was not what I was expecting when I ordered this, so was slightly disappointed from this front.

Overall, the kale/mushroom pizza was the highlight of the dinner. I would come back if there was a change in the menu that piqued my interest again in this place."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time last night.  I've been to the Shops at Don Mills many times and have eaten at both Glow and Joeys so thought I should try Fabbrica after reading the revews about the pasta with crab and soft boiled egg.

We walked in and sat in the lounge area which I quite liked.  I took a peak into the restaurant section, but I prefer the bar.  We split the Margherita pizza and the pasta.  I really liked the pasta a lot.  There was a decent amount of crab in it and the soft egg was a really nice touch.  The pizza was good but extremely thin - I think I like my pizza a bit crispier, but it was decent.  I had the Dolomiti beer which went down nicely with the meal."}
{"text":"Visited in 2012/13 - Amazing, 5/5 stars
Visited in 2015 - Boy, what a let down

I made reservations 1-2 weeks in advance. We were seated in a corner of the bar area. I requested to be seated in the nicer part of the restaurant but apparently no seats were available. By the time I walked out and made a phone call to reserve seats at Nodo, a booth had magically opened up. I wanted to leave as there was no urgency in satisfying their customers but Nodo's in the west end and I didn't think we'd make it in time - so we stayed. Oh and 5 minutes after we were seated, they seated a family of 3 next to us in the area of the restaurant they were no longer seating to... BS!

The food certainly did not live up to Mark McEwan's standards.

2012/13:
Chicken - made to perfection, I finally understood why the judges on Master Chef, Cutthroat Kitchen, etc. were so hard on those chefs
Gnocchi - flavorful, the sauce complimented the texture and overall taste

2015:
Chicken - burnt and bland
Gnocchi - the gnocchi and sauce was just there, on the plate, it just didn't work
Ham pizza - the only reason for 2/5 rating, not bad

I don't think I'll ever return. I have high expectations for an establishment such as Fabbrica and once it's tainted, it's difficult to go back."}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times. It's the only sit down italian restaurant close to where I live. Service is always efficient and friendly. The restaurant is always spotless. The food is average and I believe below average for what they charge. Pizza looks perfect, but the dough is chewy, which is a slight blessing because my mouth gets a much needed work out. Wine is also too pricey in my opinion. I have no problem shelling out for wine and I do several times a week, but much better restaurants charge far less. Grazie, Terroni and Libretto to name 3. All with much better food. No doubt the rent is horrific in The Shops of Don Mills, but that's not my problem. 
 Please fix your pizza dough. I'm confident that is something you could sort out. I can live with the high price wine for the convenience of a great pizza close to home."}
{"text":"Okay, so clearly I cheat on my gluten free 'lifestyle' now and again.  I'm not Celiac and I feel for those who are; thankfully I can just throw back the digestive enzymes and let the fun begin, and on these rare occasions it's usually worth it ;)

Let's start with the best part, and quite frankly the only thing to bother reviewing when you hold yourself to the standards of the Associazione Vera Pizza Napoletana; the pizza, we shared two...

First the Margherita with tomatoes that tasted like they were plucked straight from the vines in Roma Italy, fresh aromatic whole leaf basil, oozy mozzarella and olive oil.  Second the Funghi; mushrooms, that lovely mozzarella, and truffle crema, although a little light on the truffle Marky Mark.  Both with excellent crispy, bubbly and ever so slightly charred thin crust.  This is true Italian style pizza served molto rapidamente!

The tiramisu is deconstructed, delicious and just the right portion size.  It is served with a shot glass of espresso granita, not bad, but I could have done without it.

Our bill was $85 before tax and tip, so for a couple 'zaas, one desert and two glasses of wine it's not exactly budget friendly if you're so inclined.  The pizza was quite good and we may go back, however we've yet to try Queen Margherita.

We sat in the casual front bar section on a lovely night with the windows open and I have to say those white chairs are extremely comfortable!  If the scenery were better (not at Don Mills Rd) I could sit out on this patio just sharing a bottle of wine and lounge very Italian style for hours.

I give 3 stars because I think the location really leaves much to be desired, the prices are fairly steep (I abhor when restaurants charge as much for a glass of wine as the entire bottle costs), and when there are only three ingredients on a pizza, one being truffle crema I should bloody well taste it!"}
{"text":"The service really made the meal extra special. 
I was here for lunch on a weekday and my friend and I shared the buffalo cheese app. and we both got a salad. 

Mine was with trout; which was seared perfectly crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. The vinaigrette on the salad had just the right amount of acidity. However next time I will remember to ask them to omit the olives as I'm not a big fan. 

We weren't very hungry and there was no pushiness to get us to order more food whilst our water kept getting refilled. 

The only nuisance was that our main arrived before I finished the appetizer. But I didn't mind since there was a whole lunch crew that came in and I would have needed to wait longer for the main to come. 

The decor was rustic yet contemporary. The greeter offered me a choice of tables when I was seated. 

This was an experience worth a 20% tip"}
{"text":"VERY DISAPPOINTED.  Fabbrica calls itself an Italian restaurant yet it took the kitchen over 45 minutes to cook a pasta dish?!  Food was fine, not spectacular, portions were all different for similar dishes.

The service was poor too. If our server wasn't hiding behind a wall talking to coworkers he would be telling us that the pasta station was backed up. He never came by to refill our glasses or offer us bread to keep us satisfied. This restaurant needs to spend more time training the staff. I do not expect this from a McEwan restaurant, North 44 is still pretty excellent.

Edit: server added that because it's a Saturday and there is only four chefs in the kitchen, we should expect a slow service."}
{"text":"Fabbrica has been getting a lot of flak from foodies regarding its prices. While not the cheapest card on the block, it is, however, one of the few Italian restaurants of note in the area. Though the decor tries a little too hard to be rustic-yet-cool, it's still a nice space to loiter in. Just get someone else to foot the bill.

Stracciatella alla romana is a classic with chicken broth, egg, and reggiano. This is the first time I've had this dish, and though quite nice, it's not as transcendent as others have made it to be. Or maybe I was expecting too much.

Cherry peppers, anchovy, olives, capers, and bocconcini. Peperoni della nonna was both tasty and beautiful.

The linguine. Clams, white wine, and garlic. Really quite good. I didn't order this, but I would consider it for next time!

Pappardelle with crab, guanciale, cream, and soft-poached egg. Delicious, but expensive at $27. Also, to nit-pick, the egg white was a bit tasteless, especially in contrast with the delicious yolk mixed in with the pasta.

The bistecca was a small and anemic portion of skirt steak that tasted okay. The salad of wild arugula, smoked tomato, pickled onion, reggiano, and balsamic vinegar was good, if a tad over-dressed, but that's down to personal taste.

The canolo is well-priced and decent. It's no Mike's Modern Pastry in Boston, but it's also not 800+ kilometres away. I also enjoyed their sorbets. The pear was especially nice.

All in all, Fabbrica isn't somewhere I would go often, but I would still return. I found the pastas to be better than at Scarpetta, and to me, the prices are pretty equivalent. You just don't get the same fancy wrapper as you do at Scarpetta, which is a blessing sometimes. If Fabbrica could tweak and lower their prices, it would certainly make it on to my roster of regular restaurants.

{"text":"Great restaurant. It is nice to have a good restaurant in the area. Have eaten there many times great place when I have out of town guest from work and there place to go to without going down town also have been there many times with my family kid friendly."}
{"text":"Went here for an after-work dinner.  Place was quite slow for a Thursday nite.  I guess I was expecting it to be really happening since it's in the same plaza as Glow.

Food: I thought it was ridiculously over-prized.  Aside from the pizzas that we had, our other dishes were pretty bland in taste.  I had the short rib papperdelle, and literally it was pasta smothered in tons on oil and a few dusting of meat on top.  It had absolutely very little flavour.  Our servers never even came around to ask if we wanted freshly grated peppers or cheese for that matter.  That was quite disappointing.

Funny thing; as we were heading in, I mentioned to my colleagues that it would be really hilarious to see waiters running across the street with food from the grocery store to be served in the resto.  During the evening, a colleague had ordered a drink and a couple minutes later the server came back to our table to let us know that it will take a few minutes to bring her drink because they had ran out of the juice she ordered and someone has to run across the street to get some more at the grocery store!

At least our company paid for the dinner and the valet parking was free.  I won't be going back here any time soon I think.  It was really a shame since I've been so impressed with North 44 and Bymark that I had really high expectations."}
{"text":"Felt the food was good but over priced. The waiter didn't ask if we wanted water and filled our glass with bottled water as soon as we sat down. He kept filling it all night (even if a small amount had been drunk) and we had a charge for each time he time he filled it."}
{"text":"Food:   6/10  to order the pasta in the picture posted on Yelp - it was for dinner only.  I ordered Fettuccine Carbonara from the lunch menu.  My husband believe they cheated by putting cream instead of just egg and chees for the sauce.  But I like it!!  the other 2 dishs my hubby and firend order weren't as great.  Too much salt in Short rib hash; and not enough seaoning in my friend's dish:  sloppy Joe's. 

Service:  8/10; they actually give my friend a coat check ticket when she asked to pack up her left overs, impressive! 

We notice the wood burning stone oven - we want to try the pizza next time!"}
{"text":"All the brunch items that came out for our group looked divine! 

I ordered the Shortrib Hash N'eggs. As soon as the plate was delivered, aromas of garlic wafted off the plate. The shortrib was tender and the overall dish was a delight.

I was also very impressed by their in house baked bread, perfectly paired with olive oil and balsamic. I just could not stop munching on it."}
{"text":"I had lunch there on Dec 15. The food was absolutely amazing as always. I had the grilled chicken salad and it was one of the best salads I ever had. The chicken was moist and flavourful and the salad dressing was just perfect! The table shared a plate of fries and they were covered in parmesan and equally as amazing as everything else. You will not regret eating there!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars!

Since my boyfriend and I were shopping at Don Mills, we decided to drop by Fabbrica for an early dinner. The atmosphere here is a lot more casual than Mark McEwan's other restaursnts such as Bymark and North 44. 

We ordered the following:

Prosciutto (La Torre) for $13. Other options include Berkshire prosciutto, cacciatorino,  capicollo, calabrese and lardo which range from $10 to $13 for a serving. If you're with a few other people or want more variety, you can choose four types for $27. The single order came with a good portion of meat, crostinis and pickled vegetables. The prosciutto was tasty - not too salty. My only complaint was that it didn't come with enough crostinis.

Crostini - mushrooms and gorgonzola torta ($10): This came with 5 pieces of tasty crostini. I loved the mixture of mushrooms and liked that they didn't toast the crostini to a crisp as they were still a little soft in the middle. Overall, I thought they tasted great but they were literally sautéed mushrooms with melted gorgonzola on pieces of toast, which we could have easily made at home.  

Fettucine - crab, guanciale, cream and soft poached egg ($26): This dish was delicious! The mixture of the garlic, cream and guanciale (aka bacon) was incredibly tasty. The soft poached egg which topped the entire dish was a welcome addition and gave the sauce a nice consistency. As for the pasta itself, it was perfectly cooked and had a nice bit of bite to it. My only complaint was the amount of shells I found in the crab. I didn't think too much about the first piece of shell I found in the dish. However, when I started adding more pieces to the pile, I realized this wasn't a one-off. 

Linguine - clams, shrimp, white wine, garlic and chilli ($22). The linguine came served in a light white wine and garlic broth. Although the broth was decent, it was quite light and didn't have the same flavour punch as my fettucine. I tried one of the clams and found it to be overcooked and chewy. Just an okay dish for me.

Tiramisu di Fabbrica - white chocolate sponge, espresso mousse, amaretto mousse and frappucino ($10). A deconstructed tiramisu. The espresso mousse was sandwiched between two layers of crisp sugar, reminiscent of the tops of crème brulee. The mousse was light and the sponge cake had a nice espresso flavour. I thought the tiramisu was decent, but similar to the linguine, I didn't think it was anything special.

Overall, a solid experience. But given that there are so many other great italian restaurants in the city, I don't think I'd be back."}
{"text":"I have been to Fabricca at least three times now. One of their successful factors is location. Donmills and Lawrence is a great center location for group gatherings when you have friends that live in downtown and uptown. Also, most of my friends drive, parking is one of the things we need to consider when we pick a restaurant.

Fabricca is not just an alternative to all other restaurants in the plaza, but they also have great food. I love their salad and pasta. I'd say their pizza is just so so. I love their Ricotta Gnocchi. And I always get their beer Dolomiti, its addictive

One thing I'm kind of disappointed is the attitude of the hosts at the door. One of them was not too friendly with us, also it was clear that a couple group of people came after us got seated first (I'm talking about same group size too 3-4 people) She kept saying the customer had paid, but just haven't left yet. The excuse was like multiple tables were paying at the same time, but just happened that the table that they were planning to give us have not left yet...and we ended up waited for a total of 30 minutes, and that's with reservation."}
{"text":"best margarita pizza in town,reminds me of napoli"}
{"text":"We ventured to this place for a business lunch and were seated right away although we had no reservations.

After we put our order through, they brought us some fresh bread and olive oil/balsamic vinegrette. The bread was fresh and tasted ok. Nothing too memorable.

They have a very varied menu but you can't go wrong with pizza or pasta. I ordered the prociutto and arugula pizza while my colleagues ordered the fungy pizza. Our business associates both ordered the ravioli.

The pizza was delicious, a decent size that left me full. I had to ask for chili flakes and chili in oil. The crust was thin and the tomatoe sauce/cheese taste very fresh. The prosciutto was a very generous portion. The pizzas were around $20-24.

Overall it was good food and price although not cheap, is somewhat reasonable. 

The ceilings were high and the place was uniquely decorated and trendy. They even had a small flatscreen tv behind the bar.

Service was good. Although halfway through my meal they came to refill water but did not fill my glass and never came"}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere, great service.  All I can say is wow!  The pizza had the perfect amount of sauce, basil, and cheese (Margherita).  It will have a lasting impact on the way I eat pizza."}
{"text":"Came here on a Thursday night, with reservations. I'm still not too sure what to say about the Shops on Don Mills area yet.. is it a good concept? Sure. Is it that successful though? It probably doesn't belong in this neighbourhood, but oh well, I'm glad it's more uptown and an alternative to downtown :) 

Anyway, my companion ordered some white wine for us. It was light and delicious, but I really do not know wine so my comments stop there. 

The menu was more updated than the one on the website right now so just keep that in mind. 

We ordered: 
1) Appetizer: roasted bone marrow 
- enjoy scooping out the marrow onto the crostini and letting the fat melt on your tongue.. definitely a treat! 

2) Main: Ippoglosso (roasted halibut) 
- didn't get to try his dish but he seemed to really enjoy it, and the fish came with tail and skin still intact (meaning it was very fresh!) and looked gorgeous 

3) Main: Casserace (casarecci-shaped pasta with pork sausage and rapini) 
- my dining partner said he'd ordered it before, and that it was kind of spicy (which I like), but was a little disappointed when it wasn't! However, it was still very nicely flavoured from the pork sausage, and the natural bitterness of rapini was toned down well. The portion was surprisingly a bit big and ended up having a lot of pasta left over. 

4) Side: roasted brussel sprouts 
- these were amazing! I think brussel sprouts are an underappreciated veggie--but when you roast them, as Fabbrica did, they become smoky and sweet!  I didn't taste the pancetta as described on the menu, but still good nonetheless.

Our server was great, she was so attentive and seemed very knowledgeable. The starter bread was also very yummy, and I kind of preferred spending my carbs on that rather than the big portion of pasta! Overall, I like the atmosphere, and no complaints about the food, but nothing super special."}
{"text":"This restaurant is good, but it isn't great. If you want to go to an Italian restaurant that has that wow factor and truly amazing flavours, then go to a place like Buca, Blu Ristorante, or Enoteca Sociale, or a number of other better places. 
I'm not hating on Fabbrica, the food is tasty with very good service. The thing is, it's a Mcewan restaurant, and so it's fair to expect a higher standard. However, it seems to me that Mcewan is no longer the standard in Toronto. The Mcewan name sells itself as a premier name in the toronto restaurant scene, especially when you always see Mark Mcewan on shows like Top chef Canada, at times scolding aspiring chefs for not meeting his standards, lol. But after eating at Fabbrica, I'm wondering what that standard really is?!
It's certainly isn't high end anymore, not at Fabbrica, but quite honestly I feel that other Mcewan restaurants like North 44 are no longer what they used to be either. You're not going to find inspired and creative excellence at a Mcewan restaurant, but you will get reliable quality food. And that's what Fabbrica was, it was reliable and we enjoyed the food. 
One more drawback I would mention is the crowded spacing of the tables. They pack people in a little too close to the next table, which makes it very uncomfortable for people. One shouldn't have to struggle to get in and out of their seat. 
Overall, decent food in a nice, albeit cramped, atmosphere. I'd go back for pizza and some pasta, but wouldn't take anyone there if I wanted them to enjoy a truly fantastic dining experience. Something you used to be able to get at a Mcewan restaurant."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I love Mark McEwan.  I love Bymark and love McEwan Foods.  I even love his cook books.

I didn't love Fabbrica.  I liked it...  And I really wanted to love it.

The decor and service are both top notch. When I went for lunch on a Tuesday the place wasn't terribly busy but the it still had a bit of a buzz to it and our server was just excellent.

The food was good.  Not really great.  I tried a Polpetta pizza and the Shrimp salad.  Both were good (the salad was bordering on great) but given the price I was expecting a little more.  I suspect that if we had some wine that would have improved things but alas it was a business lunch. 

Still - up in North Toronto there isn't really any place like this so to my mind it is worth maybe an incremental 5 or 10 bucks more for lunch.  If you want to sit down and have a nice leisurely lunch in a great atmosphere then I'd recommend Fabbrica.  If you are just in it for the food then I'd say grab a quick bite at McEwan's across the street (which I would rank a 5 if I wasn't too lazy to write a review!)"}
{"text":"I went into Fabbrica with pretty high expectations given that it's Mark McEwan's restaurant and the pretty high price tags on most of its dishes. My first dining experience didn't live up to those expectations at all.

I ordered the veal as my entree. For $28 you get six bites of veal, with two tiny pieces of bacon and mushrooms. I thought the serving would be a little more generous than that. The meat was tough and the dish didn't blend well together. 

I also tried their pepperoni pizza. It was a decent size, which was understandable given that it cost $19 for one person. It tasted like a regular homemade pizza though. There was nothing spectacular about it; nothing stood out about the dish at all. 

Fabbrica is not great, value-wise. I'm sure if I tried some of their other dishes I will find something that I like, but for a $40+ meal it's not a risk I'm willing to take."}
{"text":"A good fine dining experience, but for a fine restaurant I was shocked at the state of the urine soaked floor in the men's room. I went twice on the course of an hour and no one had mopped the sticky mess up."}
{"text":"As a fan of Mark McEwan's restaurants our dining experience can only be summarized as a significant disappointment.  It is not that the food was terrible (with the exception of the calamari which should be revamped or taken off the menu).  Just that if you are going out to eat at a restaurant under a McEwan umbrella shouldn't it provide a better experience than you can make at home?  

The room is ok - noise control is very good and you can hear what your dining partners are saying.  Service is just ok by McEwan standards - our waitress was pleasant but seemed very flustered and after taking our wine order brought the glass or red ordered by my companion but forgot the bottle of white ordered by the 3 remaining diners at our table for a significant time.  

All can be forgiven if the food is good.  The calamari appetizer should be given a decent burial.  It comes attractively presented on a large wooden platter but here is where any attractiveness ends.  You are left with HEAVILY breaded (cornmeal?) calamari rings which are luke warm at best, rubbery and 'old' greasy flavored.  Our collective table assessment was that they were pretty gross.  Comments included 'Memories of President's Choice' (which is actually unkind to President's Choice) and 'tasted like they were cooked a few days ago and flash fried to warm them up' give you some idea of how bad they were.  Also tried as appetizers - mushroom crostinis and meatball and both were pretty pedestrian.  For mains we had scallops, linguine with crab, pappardelle with short rib ragu and baked pasta with meatballs.  Didn't try the scallops but the only dish of the other three which had any punch was the crab linguine.  The short rib ragu tasted old and tired, and the meatball pasta was good but nothing I couldn't make as well or better.  After these disappointments we all passed on dessert.  Bill with wine, tax and tip topped out at $200/couple.  It might be a good idea if Mark spent less time on TV judging others and more time paying attention to his restaurants.  My recommendation is to give this restaurant a pass."}
{"text":"We went here for lunch. I had a steak salad and my wife had the ravioli. The ravioli was great and the steak salad was AMAZING! Perfect heat on the steak and great flavours over all!

The restaurant had a comfortable atmosphere and the service was  perfect. 

A must try!"}
{"text":"We went for summerlicious lunch just before noon. As we saw other tables getting bread before meals but we did not. We were busy catching up and ended up asking server if we were supposed to get bread while we were paying. The server's reponse was because we came around brunch time it is \"complicated and hard to say\". What kind of answer/service was that? Wish he could have just said he forgot!"}
{"text":"Me thinks that Fabbrica has missed it's 'Mark'... so I wanted to treat my mom on mommy's day to a nice dining experience and what better way to do that than to take her to Fabbrica, Mr. Top Chef Canada's newest restaurant at the shops at Don Mills.  She lives in the area already and so I thought we could spend the day browsing through the promenade of shops and then when hungry, we could feast at this new north of Bloor hot spot.  
The decadent fettuccine with crab and poached egg and the panna cotta which was beautifully presented  For a main that was $27, the portion was reasonable.  The dish itself was very bland and tasteless. The panchetta added some flavour as did the yolk of the poached egg, but really there wasn't anything outstanding about this. The pasta was cooked just right, the creamy sauce wasn't too heavy, aside from the presentation, the dish wasn't too memorable.
I ordered one of my favourite pizzas which was the prosciutto and arugula pizza.  I enjoyed it as the perfectly shaved prosciutto mixes really well with the crispiness and bitterness of the arugula creating a good balance.  Is this pizza better than the one at Libretto or QMP?no but it's a good alternative especially when you're in the area and they also take reservations here!!

Our highlight of the meal was our dessert.  We ordered the tiramisu and the genius pastry chef Sabine Gradauer makes a deconstructed tiramisu ($9).  The presentation is innovative and the taste is just delicious.  My mom especially loved the crystallized caramel thin layers on top of the frothy whipped cream and the shot of \"frappucino\" alongside. It's a surprise as the shot glass has whipped cream on top and as you dig deeper you're surprised by the cold coffee granita . It's innovative and so much fun to eat!"}
{"text":"Buyer beware 
Meatball is actually meatloaf, pancetta (cured/dry meat) pizza is actually ham. Overall it was good, just was not impressed with the toppings and false marketing."}
{"text":"My friends and I have done brunch, lunch and dinners at this place. We have also done a few B-day parties with 12 or more. All I can say is they never disappoint. Good food, great wine ;) I was amazed at how fast that ceramic oven can cook an amazingly flavoured pizza."}
{"text":"It was my first time there and it was just OK. I had the Halibut and so did my friend and we had to both send it back as it was way way over cooked. They re did the dish for us and it was fine the second time but nothing to write home about. However, we both had sides - hers was squash and mine rappini and they were both deee-lish! I would go back there to give it another chance."}
{"text":"Tried this place with another couple. It's easy and convenient to get to for us given we live in the east end. The valet parking is a nice touch, even though there is parking-a-plenty.

The ambiance is very inviting - very modern looking with high ceilings and open concept. The service was very friendly. The manager poured our water when our server was not around and recommended a nice wine from a fairly good wine list.

The food was great. Our friends shared a plate of prosciutto, capicollo, calabrese and one other I don't remember. The meat was tasy and not too salty. I guessing it came from Italy. My wife had the calamari which was crispy and had a delcious aioli drizzled on it. I had the arugula salad which was also good.

For mains I had the bacon chop, which was basically a pork chop smoked and then seared on the grill. It was delicious - juicy, tasty and prepared just right. The cris-crossed grill marks were perfect. I forgot to order a side but didn't need to having had so many appetizers.

My wife and our friends all got pasta dishes. i usually don't like ordering pasta in a restaurant because its so easy to make at home, but this was worthwhile. My wife got the Fettucine which had crab, a garlic cream sauce and a poached egg. The homemade pasta really made the dish. We didn't have dessert, opting to go to the gelato place around the corner (it was ok - not much selection).

We will definitely come back, probably to try the thin crust pizza in the giant oven from Naples. McEwan has a winner here."}
{"text":"Meant to write this review a long time ago...came here for a lunch meeting in the summer.  Service was excellent and the food was great.  We shared a salumi board to start which was quite nice and I had the chicken salad which was also very good.  The greens were fresh (nothing more annoying than ordering an entree salad and finding bits of brown salad or wilted salad - seems like a basic thing, but you would be surprised at how many restaurants just can't seem to get this right).  My co-workers also got different salads and they all looked really good as well.

I would definitely come back for lunch..."}
{"text":"My friends and I came here for dinner one night. The decor and the service itself was quite pleasant (although getting the bill was a little slow). 

The bread that we got was warm and when we asked for butter to go along with it, the waiter was more than willing to get us some. The butter was very creamy and really melts onto the bread. 

My friends and I like to try each others dishes so I did get to try the fettucine, the risotto and the bianca pizza. The fettucine was very creamy and absolutely delicious (definitely something to try). The risotto was a little undercook and the bianca pizza had the right spices from the chilli.

I got the beet salad and honestly was not worth it. It was small and just very unappealing. The venentian sunset tasted like orange juice with very little alcohol. 

Overall I liked the place but it's not worth the price they charge. I think you can get better italian food for a better price somewhere else"}
{"text":"Brunch here was amazing!  Not inexpensive, but the quality of ingredients is obvious. The braised beef hash was really flavourful.  The fabbrica benny was also very good. The decor here is really nice too. No issues with service."}
{"text":"Food was good. Atmosphere was warm and rustic. Meats were cooked nicely but probably not a place I would specifically have a craving for."}
{"text":"Overpriced pretencious food that doesn't even taste that great. The service is not what you would expect when you are paying $25 for a burger (no sides)."}
{"text":"Basically it's a boutique-y Italian bistro place and the menu is similar to Terroni's.  It was pretty busy Friday night with lots of families with young kids.  

Here's the story:

*Drinks-nice and stiff. 

*Prosciutto-served with some crostini bread, a teaspoon of mustard and some pickled veg.  A decent portion, a bigger serving than I've had at Libretto or Terroni's.  

*Pizza Funghi-Delish.  Lots of 'shrooms, sliced nice and thick, truffle oil (only a waft of it present), crust is nice and chewy, although crust is a bit too thick for my liking.  

*Seafood pasta-was a major two thumbs down.  They served parm on it (which I thought was a no-no), and there was a major clump of pasta that looked about the size of hard boiled egg.  We decided to remove the tumor to the bread plate to enjoy the rest of the meal.  

*Tumor turned us off on dessert.  Pass.  

So for the two of us, we had 2 drinks, 1 app, 2 entrees = $125.00 plus tip.  Not cheap in my eyes.  If I were in the area again, I'd rather Joey's or even Congeen Queen (just behind the Murale store).  Way cheaper and way more food. But if I were having a jonesing for pizza, I'd head back to Fabbrica."}
{"text":"Had a chance to go on Monday night and the restaurant was packed.  Disappointing compared to Bucca and Terroni.  Pizza and pasta is better at both restaurants.  It's priced similar to Bucca but the food at Bucca is fresher, better prepared and the servers are more knowledgeable.

If you do go, the meat dishes are very good.  We had the Berkshire Pork and the Lamb and the meat was cooked to perfection and the sauces were fantastic.  

Be forewarned, you pay for bread which is lame given the prices you pay.

For dessert we had the tiramisu and the gelato which were well presented and tasted great.

Would not hurry back."}
{"text":"Walked in on a Friday night with my boyfriend. We were seated right away and received excellent service both from the hostess and waiter. We ordered the fungi truffle pizza and duck risotto, it was delicious! We will be back again!"}
{"text":"Pricey!!    But the entire Mark Mcuwen franchise is. This place is a bit more casual dining. They have a huge wine cellar and presentation was fantastic. I recommend the different salami selection."}
{"text":"Their beef carpaccio was on point . Everything was yummy. We ordered a pizza and pasta. Beef carpaccio was still my favourite!"}
{"text":"I think this place is a rip off. I went there with my husband for our anniversary and was soarly disappointed. The food was very salty, the waiter couldn't wait to get us out and he got upset when we only ordered one appetizer instead of two. The wine was of such low quality that we couldn't finish it. Over all the food was bland, the service was bad and the wine terrible. I think we need to understand that pretending to be a high quality restaurant is not achievable with just a hip interior and furnishing. If you are used to quality food (and I am not talking 5 star restaurants, just decent food) like we are, you would not enjoy this place. I would not go back there."}
{"text":"Booked my birthday dinner here for a table of 14 people. We had to choose a fixed menu for larger groups., I was able to make some substitutes in the menu which was good.

The area we were put in was nice, more secluded away from the crowd. We choose the $45 set menu, which included one appetizer and one main. 

For the price of $45 and 18% gratuities,  I would be expecting high quality dishes, but I was disappointed. The food was average, and not worth it for the price. 

Service throughout the dinner was good. But at the end when I asked for the bill,  they took their time. I had to ask 2 times for the bill,  and they said 'they were working on it.' We ended up waiting over half an hour for the bill. 

Overall,  average food marked way too high, mediocre service and probably won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Authentic Italian food.  I am a big fan of Mark McEwan.  It is classy, but not too expensive.  The best deal is the free filtered water which is always cold and delicious.  My only complaint is that is can get very noisy and hard to have a conversation."}
{"text":"We loved this place! Staff were lovely and the decor here is very modern and sophisticated. 

We had the funghi pizza and the seafood pasta to share....we opted for regular pasta over  the squid ink...as much as we love seafood we are not quite that adventurous haha.

The funghi pizza has a creamy base sauce that was delicious!

The seafood pasta also based on a really delicious sauce, not spicy but does have a really nice kick to it! The seafood was incredibly fresh!

Overall wonderful evening here! Will definitely go back and check out more of their menu!"}
{"text":"I've been to Fabbrica for lunch a couple times now and had an excellent experience on both occasions! From the start, you know that you're in for something good. Yes, you may take my coat. I don't think there's a time of day where you won't find people spending some time at Fabbrica. Even during the off-peak hours there's still a bustle. 

Bread. Bread. Bread. There is amazing, warm and crusty bread to start. Dipped in a splash of Mark McEwan's own olive oil is the way to go. My bread exploration did not stop there! The crostini with mushroom and gorgonzola was perfection. Expertly toasted, fresh bread with just right amount of the powerful cheese with a stunning variety of mushrooms on top. This would've been great to share, but I ate it all. 

First, I tried the classic margharita pizza. Once you see the wood fired oven, it's just too hard to resist. The pizza is huge and I found myself satisfied with half. You can see it come fresh from the fire and land on your plate. Spare mozzarella and basil on a thin, yet doughy crust takes me right back to Italy.

One my second trip I had a panini that was very much like chicken parmesan in a crisp and cute bun. I added the onions and there were a mighty fine addition that definitely took the sandwich up a notch. The tuscan bean salad on the side was a light, fresh and most welcome side dish. They really balanced each other out and it's nice to get a couple different things on the plate. 

Dessert was a delectable warm pumpkin cake with candied pumpkin seeds. The stand out for me was the hazelnut gelato. YUM, gimme more. 

They check your leftovers throughout the course of the meal! So you can grab your coat and your takeaway at the same time. A very beautiful restaurant with great food."}
{"text":"Fabbrica has a fun upbeat ambiance.  The serving staff is helpful and attentive, but enough with the atmosphere and down to business. We were a table of 4 so we had a few dishes that would give us a spectrum of the restaurants overall menu. The table is greeted with delicious bread, olive oil and balsamic vinegar. This was enjoyed during our wait time for dinner. We ordered the house wine by the glass. I thought that McEwan would of put more thought into the wine choice, the wine was really understated and weak bodied.  The Insalata di Fabbrica is really a green salad with some panchetta and reggiano cheese  and garlic croutons through in. The achovy dressing was tasty but the salad was so salty that I call this a miss. We also tried the Pappardelle  with Short Rib. This dish was flavourful and the pasta was cooked perfectly  but the meat portion on the pasta was skimpy, so I call this a miss for the money.  The Casarecce Nero, seafood pasta with squid ink pasta was beautiful to look at.  The pasta was cooked perfectly, seafood was a very generous portion and  the broth was spicy as promised but  a little too salty.  An order of the Roasted Eggplant Parmesan, listed as an appetizer, was generous enough to be a dinner dish.  The roasted trout was beautifully presented and cooked to perfection.  There were beautiful pizzas passing by our table, but we didn't try them. Over all the food was delicious, avoid the salad and the experience will be a satisfying one."}
{"text":"For a place like this, especially being a part of the mcewan chain and all, the level of expectation going in will be a key factor in the level of satisfaction you will have. 

With no expectations, the place was chic while still being comfortably casual. Food was tasty and flavorful. Note, appetizers (particularly the salad and beef narrow) were large enough to share. 

Would recommend and would come again."}
{"text":"Came here for birthday brunch.
Service was great! ... Can't complain. 
Had the short rib hash. It was good! ... Can't complain.
Had the ciabatta French toast.  It was good! ... Can't complain.
Had some of my friend's pizza. Delicious! ...Can't complain.
Had the cannoli for dessert.  Good! ... Can't complain.
Friends paid for the bill!  :D ...Can't complain! 
Actually... Let me change my response... Compliment! My friends are Awesome!

If I had to pay for all the food myself... I might've had a complaint!"}
{"text":"Mothers Day2016. Ordered a bunch of dishes.  Appetizers were all good. Especially the duck bruschetta. Mains included pizza, braised short rib pasta, lamb porchetta and duck.  Flavours all on point but clearly there was a timing issue in the kitchen. Everything was cold. Considering the tab should have sent it all back."}
{"text":"Easy-to-get online reservations for Saturday brunch over Mother's Day weekend.  Spacious and comfortable seating, friendly and attentive waitstaff that followed up often, and they were happy to make a bit of a menu adjustment to poach my eggs more on the medium side for my tasty Fabbrica benny.  Hollandaise was deliciously buttery, with the perfect amount of lemon to cut through it which made it all the easier to lick every last drop of sauce - including my requested extra hollandaise, which came at no additional cost.  The rest of our group seemed to enjoy their dishes as well, with the exception of the pizzas, which they deemed to be acceptable but nothing spectacular.

The one thing that bothered me about our experience was that I got a call from the restaurant at 10:25am, as a \"reminder\" (aka asking where I was) for my 10:30am reservation.  We were in the middle of parking, and I'd understand if I were late, but it wasn't even my reservation time yet!  The restaurant was also more than half empty, so not sure why they felt the need to rush us in..."}
{"text":"For so long, we've wanted to go Fabbrica but either it was out of the way or never could get reservations.  Today we went for brunch. I had the french toast with carmelized bananas served with some mixture of syrup, butter and some white stuff.  I also had maple sausages on the side. Very tasty!  GF had the Eggs Benny.  Different than a normal order because it had prosciutto instead of the usual back bacon.  I had tried some and was very yummy as well.  

Our server was very friendly.  We took a brief look around the establishment and it looks very good, especially for dinner, which we will return for one day in the future.  

Why four stars?  1/2 a star less for not trying out the dinner experience and another 1/2 star for Mark McEwan for supporting the Toronto casino bid."}
{"text":"Family Day Monday was packed at Fabbrica and I think that was the downfall to my experience that night. I made reservations for 3 at 6:30 and I knew I would get the awkward table for 3 that looks like a weird diamond shape. It was so busy.

I was waiting for the host to finish giving coats back to exiting guests and I was expecting her to offer me coat check. That did not happen and I didn't say anything. We were seated in the inside of the restaurant.

Food was very good as always but the service was just awful. We had to wait long periods of time for everything and our waitress was hardly there because she was either serving 10 other tables. When we waited almost 30 minutes for our desert menu, she did ask if we were in a rush as she was \"dealing with some issues.\" I couldn't care less what you're dealing with but at least check up on us and not make us wait almost an hour before asking if we wanted dessert only for us to say no because we wanted to get the heck out of there.

I am sad to say that this wasn't what I expected. However, I am confident this was a one-off experience but comeon guys - don't tell me you didn't realize the restaurant was going to be that busy. Poor planning."}

{"text":"I was excited when I heard Fabbrica was open and made dinner reservations for 5 people. It was very busy for a weeknight but the servers were friendly. I love many of the cooked dishes that McEwan has across the street so I was expecting something as wonderful. My overall impression of the food was mixed. A couple of great dishes and the rest were so-so. I'm a huge fan of Terroni and rarely have I had something mediocre there. One thing I did notice was the prices on the menu posted on their website is different than the prices we were charged or should I say overcharged. I've put the web prices in brackets.

We started with:
Brushette mushrooms and gorgonzola torta $10 which was very good, not overly greasy and very flavourful. The bread was toasted nicely.

Selezione di salumi, Berkshire prosciutto, Genoa Salami, Capicollo, Guanciale $27 ($26) Not outstanding - just average. I'm not a fan of Guanciale, it's just too fatty.

Mozzarella di buffala $16 ($14) The tomatoes were sweet and juicy and how can you go wrong with buffala?

Pizza Margherita $17 ($16) Bland and soggy.
Pizza Funghi $20 Had more flavour than the Margherita but again very soggy. The actual pizza dough was nice not too salty but needed to be cooked longer.

Ricotta Gnocchi $18 ($16) The texture of the Gnocchi was light and fluffy and the hint of lemon was very nice. The sauce was ok. My sister thought that the tomatoes tasted canned. The Gnocchi at Terroni is much fluffier but Fabbrica's was better than most I've tried.

Maiale pork belly $14 I really enjoyed the pork belly - it was subtle and delicate if pork can be delicate. I like that the natural flavours come through not saltiness. Great sauce but would have been better with some bread.

Agnello braised lamb neck $28 The flavour was quite intense and delicious. 

Barbabietale organic beets $11 ($10) These beets were fabulous and flavourful I think I ate at least half of this dish.

Cavalo nero black kale $10 ($8) I found the kale a bit tough but edible because it took on the flavour of the speck.

For dessert we had Tiramisu $11 ($9) and Sorbetto $8 ($6). I can't comment on the Tiramisu but I had three different flavours of sorbetto: cherry, lemoncello, pear & prosecco. My favourite is usually lemoncello but it wasn't as tart as I would have liked it. Cherry was ok but the pear was fantastic. I wish I had gotten 3 scoops of that instead.

I agree with the others that the bread should be complementary. We didn't ask for bread but with some of the saucy dishes it would have been a very nice addition. I give it a solid 3 stars as all the food was quite edible. They just need to do some fine tuning with seasoning on some of the dishes and definitely the cooking times for the pizza. I would go back but not right away. I'm hoping the next visit everything will be refined and service more polished."}
{"text":"came by for brunch with two friends, we ordered funghi pizza, eggs all inferno and eggs benny. food was alright at it's best but overall, super underwhelming. I mean, it wasn't terrible but not memorable.

the pizza is very generic probably my favourite. the eggs benny was different, it was on a polenta patty but the eggs all inferno was pretty much a mush of meat and beans on a ciabatta bun that was burnt underneath and got soggy way too quickly and it's not like we left it sitting before eating it.

service is good. not much interaction between us and the servers but they were available when we needed something.

honestly, I had higher expectations for this restaurant knowing it's part of the McEwan group but guess I was wrong or maybe we ordered the wrong things. will not be returning and do not recommend."}
{"text":"Took my mother here for her 80th birthday. 

The staff gave us a great table  for 8 right at the front if the restaurant. 

Our server was very accommodating and patient with the group.  

Service was great, food was very good. We had the pappardelle pasta with braised beef, squid ink pasta with seafood, the salmon the grilled squid and the veal meatballs. 

I would highly recommend going and then take a nice after dinner stroll through the beautiful out door mall."}
{"text":"came here because the lineup at Joey's was way too long that we didn't have the patience to wait 50 mins!

The location is kind of hidden that I didn't even know this restaurant was there.

I appreciated being seated right away - however the service wasn't great.

I guess they hadn't anticipated the rush and were understaffed but the customer suffered in return.

We ordered the lamb bacon pizza, risotto and veggie pasta.

The bacon pizza was slamming, definitely the reason this review gets 3 stars. the pasta wasn't great, it was really oily and the artichokes were really soggy. 

What I didn't like was that we had to ask for everything, from water refills to fresh ground pepper and cheese.

We weren't the only people unhappy the table beside us cancelled their order and left. I was starving and didn't want to wait!"}
{"text":"***I emailed them this review a day after I went there to see if they at least would apologize and they complete ignored it***


Horrible service and the fact that I sent them an email a day after I ate and provided my feedback and they did not even get back to me speaks a lot!

I had steak and considering the price of it, I expected something good. It was probably one of the worst steaks I ever had. It was extremely chewy and the cut was really bad. Probably 70% of that steak ended up back on the plate as I could not chew it.

They also do not give you anything.If you order steak, this is all you get! No salads/vegies, no side dishes of any kind - NOTHING. I've never seen it before.
Presentation of the dish was of a pub,but their prices are around of a fine dining restaurant!!
Taste wise, steak lacked of real taste, was dry and had some weird sauce that did not compliment it in any way.

Service from a waiter wasn't that good either. He never went to see how I am doing with my dish so I could not provide my feedback on the food. Later, a bus boy came up to take my plate and then waiter showed up for billing.

Not that it matters much,but when we arrive for our reservation there was a large party in one of the rooms and we asked to be moved to another room where it was much quieter. They declined so we had to eat while \"enjoying\" all the noise from a cocktail party. It wasn't a big deal,but when you add everything together it means a bad experience.

Would not go back and would not recommend."}
{"text":"Great ambience, good food, always something new on the menu every time we go.

Great wine selections and a beautiful wine cellar.

If you like Italian, check this place out."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch and really enjoyed it! Had the Fabricca benny and my SO had the shortrib hash. Would highly recommend the benny :) Also, you can ask for bread even if its brunch. The bread is really good!"}
{"text":"Came here with a friend for diner. Food/drinks were decent, service was superb, price was reasonable, and the ambiance was average - kind if reminded me a little of being in a boston pizza."}
{"text":"I was excited about trying this restaurant. I've read positive things about it. It was disappointing from the moment we entered. We had an early reservation so the restaurant was basically very empty. They tried to seat us at the worst table I think they have. I asked for a booth and was told only if we could be out in less than an hour. They then proceeded to put a different couple in that same booth with the booth beside it empty. They were not out by the hour and the restaurant had only 4 tables in the dining area at that time. The salad was very good and the fish was swimming in oil so it tasted good but was not fun to eat.  The service was ok."}
{"text":"Great place for a business lunch. Service could not have been better.  Attentive but not intrusive.  Food arrived quickly and recommendations were spot on.  All were very happy. Classy but not super fancy.  Rustic Italian with modern touches."}
{"text":"- i dont know what i was expecting, but this place caps out at 3 stars - perhaps when i think about great places to eat, i dont always need to have white glove service.
- decent pizza, good ambiance (not too douchy), and really great service
- try the carpaccio appitzer - very very tasty!
- p.s when you dont have to pay, everything tastes better (read: went on a work sponsered lunch)"}
{"text":"Came here last weekend with Miss P and another couple.  Was really expecting good things from the famous and renowned Mark McEwan, but the food just didn't live up to the hype.

We did enjoy ourselves but it was only because of good company and 2 bottles of wine.  

We started off with the Arancini balls and beef carpaccio.  This was my first go at carpaccio - maybe I just dont have the palate for it, but I just didn't find anything special at all about it.  The arancini came in multiple small balls- nice crispy texture, mild in flavoring - good, not special.  The white sauce it came with didn't really do anything.  I would've preferred a tomato sauce instead.

For my main, I was thinking between the ravioli or the seafood linguine, so I asked our server...and she recommended the linguine.  She said it's Mark's favourite - he orders it every time he's here for lunch.  Sold!

What a disappointment.  The pasta was dry, stuck together, and pretty much flavorless except for the chilli.  The worst was the watery mess left on my plate underneath the pasta.  This plate alone would give Fabbrica zero stars.

Miss P ordered veggie pizza.  Wood-burned ofcourse.  Again, not bad...but then again, nothing special at all.  I like the wood-burned pizza, but its the same as the other 50+ restaurants in Toronto.  I expect more from this supposed \"Top Chef\".

For dessert we had the Budino al Caramello.  Very nice presentation sticky toffee, topped with espresso ice cream and some caramel brittle.  Good stuff - loved the espresso ice cream.

Our service was really good, except for recommending such a weak dish.  

I could proabably give Fabbrica 3 stars if it was just another restaurant...but I expect more from a Top Chef who expects more from my wallet."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants that I have ever been to and I travel a lot.  Having gone here for lunch or dinner almost every week while I am in the city I have always been pleased and will always go back . I have had pretty much everything on the menu and always go back to the Ricotta Gnocchi as I feel that they are absolutely pillows of heaven in an amazing sauce. 
The customer service we always receive is unbelievable and something to be valued as good help is hard to find and Mark McEwan must be really good at finding it as he has built an amazing team at Fabricca."}
{"text":"Ate here with family for a get-together. The place is decorated nicely and tables aren't too close to each other. Our waiter was attentive and friendly without being overbearing, we were served with water quickly. After ordering, she also brought out some fresh warm bread and olive oil, which was definitely appreciated.

I had the stracciatella which was good - not overly salty, and the eggs weren't rubbery from being overcooked in the soup for too long. We also shared the fritti, which was very  good as well, the batter was light and crispy, and came with a tasty tartar sauce for dipping, along with a roasted half-lemon.

I had the fettucine w/ crab, guanciale, cream, and a poached egg. It was really good but given the portion size and how the egg yolk and cream mixed together, also really rich. (I also came back a second time and tried the funghi pizza which was delicious as well, nice thin crust and the truffle oil made for a nice touch). 

The fettucine filled me up so I decided to skip dessert, but the second time around I decided to try their tiramisu. It was more of the \"deconstructed\"-type dish that seems to be getting popular these days, it was definitely tasty and presented nicely and came with a nice coffee frappe on the side (kind of like a Starbucks frappucino), but I was expecting a more traditional tiramisu. It wasn't particularly mind-blowing either.

Overall, the ambience, service, and food were great. I wouldn't go so far as to say it's overpriced, but Fabbrica is definitely on the pricey side of things, although understandable given the upscale location and intended clientele. I'll definitely be returning, it's one of the better places for good Italian food in the GTA in my opinion."}
{"text":"Salty food, and a rushed service made for a horrible experience. I would never go back there again"}
{"text":"Unique in it's decor...casual...somewhat rustic...yet eclectic...very pleasant atmosphere...food is good...wood over pizza is excellent...tastes like in Italy...25% more expensive than it should be."}
{"text":"I forgot to post this awhile ago! Oops! Winterlicious was upon us and I couldn't miss out! On the second last day, my Chef Aunt and I headed to Fabbrica. She said that as a chef, Winter/Summerlicious is the only time when food professionals really get to see what everyone else is up to. She looks forward to it! 

We had scoped out the menu ahead of time, so we were ready. She selected the Beef Carpaccio and I went with the Sicilian Garlic Soup. She said she didn't like radish until that dish. She could tell the meat was made in house; what a treat! I was worried that I would reek of garlic after having the soup, but my Aunt said it was roasted garlic. I had no idea that roasted garlic didn't give you garlic breath! Win! I was definitely worried about wilting plants. The garlic wasn't over-powering and the texture was fantastic.  

Time for the main course! Chef Aunt chose the Parpardelle and I went with the Grilled Shrimp. Now THAT is a ragu! The parpardelle ragu perfectly balanced the acidity of the tomatoes and the savoury flavours of the spices. Again, that homemade feel makes it even better.  And the freshly shaved parmigiano reggiano brought it full circle. I'm a sucker for polenta, so when I saw the Grilled Shrimp came with polenta, I was sold. The shrimp in the sweet pepper/chili sauce with sausage was a fantastic mix. The warm, creamy polenta was like a warm blanket on a cold day. Made in-house, it mellowed the pepper and chili nicely. Two perfect dishes for a cold, snowy night. 

But...there's always room for dessert! Being a chocoholic, I chose the Chocolate Torta. My Chef Aunt, sticking with the theme of food I can't pronounce, went with the Pavlova di Fabbrica. The torta was heavy and rich. It really needed the berry compote to soften the richness. Now to the pavlova. I've never heard of it before and my Aunt insisted I try a bite. It was like tasting sunshine. The softness of the merengue, the sweet and citrus of the grapefruit and blood orange, the tartness of the blackberries....just wow. As a chocoholic, I would choose this over chocolate. It was that good. So refreshing! A must have! 

Was the food good? Yes. Was the service good? No, it was great! Our server was fantastic. He was attentive, kept the water classes full and didn't make us wait forever between courses. He claimed he made a mean cappuccino....he was right! All of the staff there were polite and seemed happy to be there; they were quick, but not in a hurry. 

The table beside is sounded like regulars; they were telling their friends about their favourite dishes, so this place is not a one trick pony. From the food to the service; this was a solid performance."}
{"text":"We had our work holiday party here in December and I was blown away by the incredible service we received from the manager. The section by the bar accommodated our party of 30 comfortably. They were very accommodating of our staff who have dietary restrictions. My coworkers were satisfied with the food and the venue.  The washrooms are clean and there's two sinks outside the washrooms (one for men and one for women) which is pretty interesting. I would definitely consider having another staff party or large gathering here.

My meal was delicious, the Orata (capers, mint and toasted focaccia) was so tasty and the Fabbrica meatballs were great.  For the price, it would have been nice if the main dish came with at least a side salad."}
{"text":"This place has been here for six years now and I'm hearing about it now ??? 

Right by shops by Don mills. Parking near by. 

Ambiance: romantic and trendy

Drinks: best part were the drinks. I sat by the bar and watched Robin make the most exotic cocktails: old fashion, and I even got to sample the Mona Lisa drink. It was light fresh and sweet ! They have a great selection of wines too ! 

Food: I wish I could try everything. I did have the fungi pizza and it was delicious !! Mushrooms plus truffles is a great combo!!  

Service: close to perfection or actual perfection. Robin the bartender and Tracy our server were friendly and quick and informative on the menu.  

Price:  I know it can be pricy but not yet that much. Because the food and service are both tasteful the price is well worth it.  

What else ?  They take reservations. 

Bathroom: separate men and women stalls. Shared sink area. To turn sink put the petal to the metal. This confused me a bit but I'm a smart cookie and I  figured it out. 

I always love the open kitchen concept and they have a cool pizza oven too!! 

Will def return one day :)"}
{"text":"Ranked in TorontoLife's top 10 new restaurants in 2011 made this place an enticing lunch option for a meet up with my girlfriends. We arrived at noon after making reservations on OpenTable, but apparently the place was almost empty so there were plenty of tables to choose from. It did get busy around 1230 to 1ish though.

Fabbrica is fantastic. The service is great, the food is amazing, and the prices are reasonable. We ordered the papardelle, the linguine and the fettucine. We also got a side of squash and the flourless chocolate tort for dessert afterwards. They never rushed us out, and were quick with water refills.

Overall, we had a great meal there, and would certainly love to go back to try their pizzas. It's in a pretty convenient area complete with lots of shopping and parking."}
{"text":"Delicious food , prompt service and strong mixed drinks .serivce was great .Been here 3 times. Ambiance , decor was pretty great for date night or group dinners."}
{"text":"I just want to comment that the atmosphere is very romantic and classic. If you need a first date location, pick this place. However, the waiters are very good-looking so your girl (or guy) may be very busy looking at other guys (cough).

[Food]
Awesome food. I just need to comment that their special ravioli is to die for. First of all, it's super soft and the meat is well seasoned inside. You only get like 5-6 pieces for the $20 that you pay, so DON'T SHARE lols. My friend was very nice and gave me 1 piece, so generous lols. Some restaurants make that ravioli too thick, to the point where you can't taste the content inside. This ravioli combines the right texture, thickness, and temperature so it's a sure win. The funghi pizza that I ordered is very light and it's great for those who love cheese. The mushroom taste is very subtle and I find this to be a good contrast to the normal pizzas that we eat (e.g. Canadian, meat lovers, vegetarian, etc.). The meatball wasn't bad, we really liked the sauce but one can engulf that dish in less than 1 minute.

[Cost]
I put this section up because this is not a cheap restaurant. Honestly I would come back to try other foods but considering its price I definitely need to save up a bit. I personally don't think the quality REALLY justifies the price they are serving their dishes at, but all in all it's a pretty solid restaurant."}
{"text":"Ok for drinks and snack. Dinner experience could have been better."}
{"text":"Overall: had a great time in the atmosphere and the food was very good!

* Atmosphere - nicely decorated restaurant with patio (outdoor) seating as well. I went during the summer and sat outside which was very nice and more \"exclusive\".

* Price - for the brunch menu which ranges from around $15-22. I ordered the \"lemon ricotta pancakes\" for $18. Also tried the \"margherita pizza\" for the same price. 

* Taste - (pancakes) They were so good, very light and fluffy. The lemon was a hint with blueberry sauce. Came with a good portion. (Pizza) thin crust and baked well. Thought the flavour was just a little over average. 

* Experience - we had the seat outside which was less busy, and great for an afternoon chat. They had umbrellas too to block the sun. 

* Service - our waiter was extremely nice and friendly. Came to check on us frequently.

* Recommendations - I would get the pancakes or other brunch items over the pizza! 

* Other - shops at don mills area is a great place to walk around/ shop in afterwards!"}
{"text":"We came to Fabricca for lunch. 

Summary:
- Crab, guanciale, cream and soft poached egg on Fettucine: 
Very rich but yummy. It was a substantial portion- no complaints but I'm still stuffed from lunch. The creamy yolky egg, mixed with the pasta in a creamy sauce was almost too rich...but bearable. 

- Ricotta Gnocchi: 
My friend had this and it was soft, pillowy and light. Yummy

- Zeppoles:
Very yummy. Light, crusty, filled with a light orange cream. 

- Lemon Cheesecake with Pistachio Graham Cracker Crust drizzled with Basil sauce:
Sounds much better than it tastes. It was frankly, quite disgusting. soggy, gross, mushy. Definitely skip this nastiness. 
The server asked if we liked it and we were both like...NO. Honestly, he should have taken it off our check. We barely touched it and it was gross

- We had lattes to go with our dessert and it was a nice, pleasant lunch

Service was pretty good; it wasn't busy at all. The only thing I'd have said was...for such an expensive meal, knowing that we didn't enjoy our cheesecake, they should have taken it off our check. We both dropped $100 (total) on lunch. 

Expensive and not the best value for $$$"}
{"text":"$22 for  Nonna McEwan's ravioli. $20 for FUNGHI pizza.  I guess I'm not used to the price to quality or serving portion of some Toronto restaurants.

PROS - very good pizza but only good quality ravioli.  bread was nice.
prompt friendly wait staff
CONS - for the price, food was not excellent and lacking in portion size.
pizza was medium sized. overpriced 6 med sized ravioli for $22. not filing.
I hope the veal pork and beef in the ravioli was organic for this price.  
Sauce was nothing special.  Not worth the $22.  Could have been some generically named ravioli and wouldn't have known the difference.
Maybe I wasnt their target diner/clientele - No salmon on the menu? No Kale salad?

They also offer questionable red tagged sustainable seafood menu items like swordfish and octopus

Left still hungry.

Nothing else on the menu to have me or my girlfriend come back."}
{"text":"Great food and great service, what more can I say!  I came here for a birthday brunch with friends and we all had a fantastic time.  I had the ricotta gnocchi which was scrape your plate delicious.  All of our food was actually thoroughly finished, not a single plate went back with anything more than a hint of the sauce it was served with.  The espresso based cocktail for dessert was also amazing, you could really taste the quality of the beans in this drink.  This is definitely a must visit/revisit restaurant!"}
{"text":"Finally got around to trying Fabricca. I went there with my 2 1/2 year old and my husband on a Sunday night and I was impressed. Not wowed but definitely a place I would return to. The food and service was great. Even though we arrived quite late, the restaurant still kept our reservation for us. 

It is more of family oriented place than McEwan's other restaurants. Several other tables also had young children. Our server was really nice. A little bit of a hipster but we won't fault him for that. Har har. We ordered two of the Julius Caesar cocktails and they were probably the best caesars we have ever had. My husband orders caesars everywhere we go and he really enjoyed this one. It was smooth, flavourful, yet it packed a decent punch. It wasn't too strong, which was perfect, because when I'm at dinner I don't want to get drunk! 

We ordered the salami platter with the three artisanal cheeses. They forgot the cheese and then ended up bringing it about 20 minutes later which was unfortunate. I had the Orata with the creamed kale on the side and my husband had the Linguine nero. My toddler had a kid favorite--buttered penne with parmesan cheese. They were very quick to bring out her pasta and very accommodating to her. She likes her parmesan on the side, and at least three bowls of it (LOL) and he was more than happy to indulge her. My fish was absolutely fabulous. Perfectly cooked, beautiful flavours. I could eat it daily. The creamed kale, not so much. WAY too much of it and way too heavy. Not so good. Hubby really enjoyed his pasta. My daughter ate her entire bowl of pasta which was pretty big. Delicious food with an obvious high standard.

For dessert, my daughter wanted 'ice cream' from that gelato place at the Don Mills Shops that had already closed. So our lovely waiter pretended to put on his 'cape' and turn into a superhero with his secret key to fly to the ice cream place and get her ice cream. He was awesome and my kid totally bought it. He asked what ice cream she wanted and she said \"pink and white\". A few minutes later, he returned with pink and white gelato for her. The kitchen completely indulged her and it was amazing. Then they let her take a peek in the kitchen and everyone treated her like a tiny queen. Great staff and other than the cheese plate bobble, great service. 

All in all, I would return. The food is fantastic, atmosphere is warm and inviting, and service has a high standard. However, I think this place is WAY overpriced. You are paying a premium for the McEwan name when, quite frankly, you can get the same dishes at any nice Italian place for half the price. We paid $200 for our meal which was overblown for what we had. Not crazy unreasonable but $30-something for a simple piece of fish at a family oriented non-fancy restaurant is a bit much. Anyway, regardless, I give this place 4 stars with a star taken off for service mistakes and high price. Also, I like that you can pick up your packed up food at the coat check when you leave. Nice little touch."}
{"text":"Took client in for lunch on Sunday around 1. Service was slow despite not too many people. The food was ok. I expected better presentation. Very average. There are better places on the block."}
{"text":"I love coming to this place.

Went here for lunch today and as usual it was delicious.  You always get top notch friendly service at this place.   Didnt have pizza this time although the funghi pizza is one of my favourite.

We were a party of 10 today and everyone really enjoyed their meals.

I had the ravioli which was tasty and fresh.  Wish there was a bit more, but its mainly because the meat sauce was really good.   Also had some of someones pappardelle (bc they couldnt finish), which is another favourite of mine.   

This place is a bit on the more pricier side for everyday eating, but definately worth a visit.   I continue to get cravings that keep sending me back here.   Peobably the best food in the shops on don mills plaza."}
{"text":"Good food, service & ambiance. Enjoy the overall atmosphere of this restaurant at shops at don mills. Overall high quality italian food. Good for night outs for a fancier meal. Would come back to try their brunch!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, food, and of course, service. Everyone was so friendly and made sure you were comfortable. Right when you walk in you could check your coat too. 

Overall the food I would say is pretty good, it definitely looks pretty (and free bread!). And the drinks are yummy too - I got a drink with gin and blackberry (forgot the name) but it was delicious I would've had another if I didn't have to go back to the office. 

I think it's a tad bit on the higher end of the price points but you are at a Mark McEwan resto after all... I personally would wait for winterlicious/summerlicious to come again and try more things at a better price."}
{"text":"***1/2 stars

I wanted so much to be able to say that fine dining and good restaurants do reside outside of the downtown core - but alas I cannot.

Chef McEwan's fourth restaurant to join the likes of One, Bymark and North 44 resides at the Shops at Don Mills.  

With perks such as complimentary valet parking, we were expecting to have a stellar time.

I can't help but feel skeptical whenever I eat at a restaurant that is owned by a celebrity chef - the same sentiment I feel towards celebrity endorsements for products.  With 3 restaurants, a grocery store, a book and television schedule - one could not possibly expect the chef to be hands on let alone manning the kitchen.  

Fabbrica is Italian for factory, and if this were indeed a factory, our server would've been the kink that brought down the whole assembly line.  It blows me away that while you offer such great hospitality in the form of valet parking, something that is above and beyond the call of duty, that you could fail to fine-tune the details inside with such lack-lustre service.  

The food was pretty good, although for the prices you're paying, you would expect nothing less.  $10 for a plate of 5 crostinis is a bit over the top if you ask me.  

The highlights of the evening were definitely the Beef Carpaccio, the Pacific Halibut and the Smoked Bacon Chop.  And you must save some room for the Budino di Ciocolatta and an espresso/cappuccino... even if its just to try the deliciously marbled chocolate biscotti that comes with your java.

The decor was nothing to Yelp about and was supposed to keep to an industrial look with vertical 2 x 4s and a wood-fired oven in the mix. Equally confusing are the bathrooms.  The word toilettes in a restaurant that boasts Italian cuisine baffles me.  To make you think you had one too many to drink is a communal sink that splits off into its respective male/female washrooms and a sink that requires seamstress intuition as it is operated via a foot pedal.  

At the end of the day, with 3 starters, 3 entrees, 2 desserts, an overly priced pitcher of White Sangria ($32) that was nothing but a jar of diluted brandy, wine and fruits and 3 coffee beverages - the damage was $200 net of tips.  

Would I come here again?  Possibly, but it would not be on my top 10 for places to eat."}
{"text":"I used to love this place. My favorite was the Basil Pasta hmmmm! But too bad I don't see it on the menu anymore. My husband took me here to celebrate our 6 month anniversary as a married couple. The service was excellent, although I can't say the same about the food. The quality has really gone down, we ordered the appetizer octopus with chickpeas. It's alright nothing to rave about, I had the pepperoni pizza and my husband got the beef pasta. They were both good, but for the price we're paying - I expect it to be better. 

I don't think I would come back here, the food is alright, but for the price we're paying there's better options out there."}
{"text":"An excellent choice up at the Shops of Don Mills and one of the few finer dining restaurants in the area.  I was looking for something that would appeal to my parents, but something unique, modern and with enough character to actually make me want to eat there. 
My aunt loved it so much, she came back again a few days later!

They were able to accmodate our early dinner at 4:30 (i know absurd) and the place was just filling up at 5pm. We ordered the sharing platter of Bone Marrow (it wasn't as good or as flavourful as I've had in other places, but great to share).

My dad got the Lobster Carbonara which comes with a raw egg to be mixed in. If you like creamy pasta ,this was an excellent choice.  My mom and aunt shared the porterhouse for two. It's a huge portion, and I think it could be shared with three or four. I actually preferred my sirlion, it's a thinner cut and much more flavourful. This doesn't come with sides, so you'll have to order the chilli rapini and sauteed mushrooms, and potatoes seperately. 

The food wasn't anything I haven't had before, but it was tasty and at a good value. We were in a hurry so didn't get to try dessert, but will be back again one day if in the area."}
{"text":"Overrated! Pasta verde needs some flavour... it comes with shrimps... Hey chef pass me the Microscope to find the U150 size shrimps.... and the salt and the garlic, and the flavour, and the stove because it is cold.... Gnocchi? I would call them Mashed potatoes with lemon zest... 

Pizza: it is an insult to my ancestors, I asked for a margherita, Tomatoes sauce is obviuosly San Marzano, Basil is fresh, dough has good flavour but the texture is just terrible, it was mushy and extra soft, there was no difference between a wrap and the pizza dough... really want my money back, I hate dominos pizza and most of the franchise but even the thin pizza from Dominos would be better.... 

Servers never offered coffee or dessert, which was one of the \"ehh\"... the presentation is nice but the flavour is not impressive at all... 

My fault I shoulded notice It would be terrible when the wine list is sorted by price, rather than any other 100 options for a \"high end restaurant\" 

not recommended for a fooddie or even any person with taste buds..."}
{"text":"Really not worth the money. Tried the pizzas personally and it barely tasted anything different than the bread. Looking at the table I couldn't justify the money at all."}
{"text":"Over-priced 'old skool' italian that really disappointed.
Nothing on the menu grabbed me, so I ended up with Margherita pizza. 
Girlfriends ate pasta, salad and chicken, none of them loved their meal. 

Just another grab for McEwan to add another name to line-up of restaurants."}
{"text":"Really nothing special and very over-priced, the best thing about this restaraunt was the service and the decor, the food came out quick, but pretentious and bland, we had a vegetarian pasta and a braised beef pasta which was ok, we also ordered a basic Pizza which I can make better with my eyes closed, Im happy we didnt do dessert there at $8 for gelato not knowing how big the portion will be. This restaurant can use a few more lessons on cooking Italian food. I am dissapointed as I live in the area and now know that there are really few decent options in the Shops.  One last thing, an Italian restaraunt should also have a bigger Italian wine list."}
{"text":"Very disappointing experience - the food wasn't worth the price and the service was awful.

I ordered a beet salad and baked meatball pasta, with a side of roasted brussel sprouts. My beet salad had too much vinegar and I had a couple very salty bites of brussel sprouts.
The meatball pasta was nothing special.... just a few cut up meatballs in a casserole dish with some bland tomato sauce, cheese and pasta.
My girlfriend seemed to enjoy her crab pasta, though, and our guys didn't seem to have any complaints about their pizzas.

Our server was unattentive and the service was slow. We waited at least half an hour for our appetizers (after waiting half an hour just to put in our orders and get our drinks) and then another hour until our mains arrived. We couldn't have dessert because it took too long for our server to bring dessert menus. We had to walk up to the bar to cash out since our server didn't come back after dropping off our bill.

We took our leftovers home, but even that took a long time, as they had to package it all up and give us little pick-up tickets that we had to present to the hostess on the way out. That seemed really unnecessary. And why do we need entire pizza boxes to bring home two pieces of leftover pizza?

Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Personal favourite on my first visit was the meatball appetizer. However, I would have preferred the cheese been on the side. (I'm not allergic to dairy, it's just a personal preference than I rather not have cheese on certain food.)

The portions are very generous, to the point I wasn't able to finish my entree. I was mildly disappointed that the squid ink weren't spaghetti like noodles.  

Very laid back atmosphere. Friendly staff and overall decent food."}
{"text":"if you happen to be shopping at the Shops at Don Mills, why would you want to eat chain garbage at Joey (which is just Jack Astors with waitresses dressed like hookers)?  If you want Joey you might as well go to Hooters.  But if you're more mature than that and have finer tastes, make your way around the corner to Fabbrica, probably the most affordable outpost of Mark McEwan's empire.  Authentic Italian in a casual atmosphere.    And yes there's the big wood-fired pizza oven, so there's no need to endure the rude arrogant jerks over at Terroni.

For our appetizer we ordered the crostini which is served with whipped lardo and quince jam.  Quite good... when foodies say \"fat is flavour\" they mean this!  The crostini is already soaked with olive oil before lightly toasted on the grill, then you're spreading pork fat on that!  Heavenly stuff.  

Main course we shared the Pesce per due which definitely was big enough for 2!  Order this only if you're hungry!  Lots of mussels, giant prawns, clams, scallops, some lobster meat...

Dessert we had the sundae for 2 which has two halves of a banana breaded and fried, flanking rich vanilla gelato and topped with toffee, hazelnuts, and hot fudge.  Nice ending to an amazing dinner.  

Highly recommend this place, would definitely return."}
{"text":"3.5 for me! 

I was really excited when this place opened since there isn't a place like this in the path yet. So far I have tried the pizza, pasta and antipasto bar. My fav would def be the antipasto bar - many unique options here and the salads are delicious. I especially like the chickpea salad, arancini balls, and mushroom artichoke salad. 

The pizza is ok, crust is kinda too thick and hard for me. I tried the paparadalle pasta as well but it was so so and for $18 it was not worth it.

They don't accept cash - card only. I feel like overall it's pretty pricey unless you get only a slice of pizza or small box of antipasto but that doesn't fill you up. I wouldn't come here everyday, but more as a splurge."}
{"text":"Always delicious.  It's not the cheapest spot in the area. But it's the best value.  The food is always prepared very well and the ingredients are great.  

Highly recommend the grass fed strip loin and the duck beast. 

Right across the street is the mccewan grocery store. Which is also great and offers some of the same dishes.

Service is top notch. This has been My favourite spot in shops of don mills for 2 years now."}
{"text":"Overpriced and overly salted. We went here for lunch and ordered the meat ravioli, octopus salad and the margarita pizza. Pizza was burnt and the sauce was not very good. The octopus salad was too salty to enjoy. When we mentioned it they didn't even bother doing anything. The meat ravioli was good. The bill was over a hundred dollars. Not worth the price!"}
{"text":"Was passing by this morning to see this has opened on The Path in the Financial District. 

Doesn't seem have any vegan options available. Some pasta dishes on the menu as well as pizza. Not sure if the pastas are egg free and if one can not add cheese/dairy to it. 

Will try one of these and update the review"}
{"text":"So it's not just hype! 

This year's BFF birthday dinner brought us to Fabbrica at the Shops on Don Mills. 
I came totally prepared for okish food and service at outrageous prices. (I read most of the reviews)
However, I must say it was not what I expected in the least. 

We started with the fritti. A medley of battered seafood served with a cream aoli dip. This was probably the course with the least wow factor, but paired with a great wine recommendation turned out just swell. 
For mains, I had to try the fettuccine that everyone was talking about while my date had the pappardelle. Yelpers did not disappoint!
The fettuccine with crab, guanicale and cream sauce topped with a perfect soft poached egg was amazing! Creamy and covered in sauce, but not to much that it masked the taste of the crab and amazing cured meat. 
The pappardelle was smothered with a succulent braised short rib, basil and tomatoes. Again enough meat but not over kill. 
After another glass of wine, we ventured on to dessert. 
Boy o boy was this the highlight of my night or perhaps it was the wine! ;)
We ordered the gelati and sticky toffee pudding. 
The house prepared gelati was a trio of chocolate, pistachio and espresso. The pistachio was one of the best I have had since Italy! 
When the pudding arrived we assumed it would be crazy sweet. Thinking we may have made a mistake, we dug in. 
Were we ever wrong!! Doused in a coffee liqueur, covered in a salted toffee sauce and topped with a scoop of coffee gelati, it was soooooo...orgasmic! 

The prices are reasonable. I mean it's not fast food, so I don't expect fast food prices, but at the same time it wasn't outlandish. 

The staff were really nice. Knew their products and made some really great recommendations. 

I will definitely have to go back!
Chef McEwen, kudos to you sir!"}
{"text":"Writing a review here, because Fabricca has tried to remove my review twice from Trip Advisor. I've been writing reviews for hundreds of restaurants, sights all over the world, and I've NEVER had this issue, and am not an outrageously rude or critical reviewer. So let me restate my review.

Came here on a weekday with two of my friends, came for dinner during the holidays, and it was not too busy. The service, was absolutely terrible. Probably the worst service I've had in a while. At the beginning I thought, possibly our server has few tables maybe, or even because she was obviously pregnant. Then I noticed she was visiting other tables far far more frequently than ours. We had to flag her down to get water, and took about 20 minutes to even order a bottle of wine. 

Now to the food. Simply not worth the amount you pay for Italian food, when there are far better Italian restaurants with much better quality and service in the city, at about half the cost. You don't pay $20 for a pizza in Yorkville, why are prices this high at Shops on Don Mills? The pizza was good, however the other dishes such as the calamari was awful. The calamari was completely over battered, overdone, over fried, but the calamari itself was not cooked, so I was having trouble understanding how that even happened. 

Overall, would never return, and would not recommend this place to anyone!! Trust me, there are FAR better Italian restaurants, or even the local FRANCHISE in an area like Shops on Don Mills, that is worth the value."}
{"text":"Excellent Pizza,  try the mushroom.  The wood burning pizza oven is imported straight from Italy.   Wonderful coffee!  Found the lights in the main dining area a bit too bright.  I moved to the bar area which has an interesting and colourful decor.  Pauliner german wheat beer on tap.  Yum.  Fabbrica is very pricey though."}
{"text":"Was here on Saturday for my Dad's 89th Birthday celebration, during Summerlicious. First of all the restaurant called twice to ask we would show up within 5 minutes of each call, despite my OpenTable reservation and the fact that I told them we were going on the first call. About the food I can only say that it was average, but the service as absolutely atrocious. Things went ok for the appetizer and the entree, but the waiter then disappeared for over 30 minutes between that and the desert, and then again there was a 15 minute wait for the bill, despite asking for him on a few occasions. 
I should add that we asked for some type of a cake for my father's 89th upon arrival. One would expect a McEwan restaurant with its high end prepared food store across the street to be prepared for this type of a request, but apparently they are not. After the 30 minute wait for desert they presented my Dad with what looked like Tim Horton Timmies on a plate with some chocolate sauce and a candle in one of the donuts. How disappointing!"}
{"text":"Came back here last night to try the pizza.
We ordered the funghi pizza and it was a-ok. I was expecting something better.

Service was still great.
The tiramisu was still awesome."}
{"text":"I had lunch here after walking around shops at don mills. For the appetizer I had the meatballs and the mains i tried the fungi pizza and burger. I found the meat ball quite bland and lacks seasoning. As for the fungi pizza, it was cooked in a stone oven just like the traditional Italian pizzas. When i received the pizza, the crust was burnt and so was the bottom of the pizza. I'm surprised it was even severed. The middle of the pizza tasted fine however when I got to the corners you could taste the burntness. The burger on the other hand, I didn't find it much special, it was really messy to eat as a lot of juices were coming out. I also ordered the truffle fries on the side which I found to be great. I would definitely order that again."}
{"text":"This past summer, I had the pleasure to visit a few of the great cities in Italy for the first time. One of my passions is seeking out authentic culinary treasures native to every place I visit. After experiencing Italian food the way it is meant to be eaten, I felt like our local Italian scene was a bit lacklustre. If only we had one of Mario Batali's \"Eataly\" restaurants here! For now, one of our next best options is Mark McEwan's Fabbrica, located at The Shops at Don Mills. I realize it isn't downtown, but it was certainly worth the trek uptown!

Although not a new restaurant, I recently dined there when craving Italian food thanks to a travel-refined palate and I was pleasantly surprised at the great quality of food and nearly authentic taste. On this occassion, I had the Funghi pizza, a mixed-mushroom pizza with mozzarella and a truffle oil that was impossible to miss from the moment it passed by me on its way to another table. After that, I enjoyed a breaded chicken scallopine topped with a simple tomato sauce, virgin mozzarella and reggiano. The cutlet was the size of the plate! The only thing better than the portion size was the great taste. I will definitely be heading back and I suggest you give this one a try, too."}
{"text":"We only had dessert here.  Tried Cannoli and a chocolate dessert.  Both were pretty good.  What's outstanding was the service.  The Asian server was extremely attentive and polite.  The service made the whole experience even better."}
{"text":"I came here for their Winterlicious lunch menu this past week with a colleague. We were about 15 mins late to our reservation at 11:45am but they still seated us promptly as it wasn't busy at all (yet). 

To start I got the beef carpaccio. It was delicious and the highlight of the entire meal! You can tell the ingredients were fresh and it had the perfect balance of tastes. The grated grano padano cheese added a nice salty touch. I was hesitant about the mustard sauce as I despise mustard but it was surprisingly very subtle and arguably made the dish even better! My friend got the garlic soup, which I had a taste of. Overall it was quite bland for my taste - and she agreed and wished she got the carpaccio instead haha. 

Next I had the Ravioli and my friend got the Strozzapreti (lamb red meat sauce with chick peas). Both our mains were bland and we had to add salt. We both have salty palattes so that could have been the reason why as I see many people enjoyed the ravioli. Despite the blandness it was put together very well and you can tell the ravioli was made fresh.

To finish we both got the tiramisu. It was good but not great.

Overall I enjoyed my meal here and probably would come back for the normal menu as I've heard good things from friends. Winterlicious is always hit or miss and doesn't necessarily allow a restaurant to show its potential so I'll give Fabricca another shot."}
{"text":"Mark McEwan's Fabbrica had pretty good food but it felt manufactured to me like a chain restaurant. I went during Summerlicious for the $20 prix fixe lunch menu which was a great deal.

We were seated immediately for our reservation at a nice, cozy table. This restaurant is huge and I was a bit jealous of those who were seated in the open air dining room. I would have asked for it but I didn't see until we were leaving. Our waiter switched halfway through dinner and our service was lackluster at best, leaving quite a bit to be desired.

My meal started switch the Stracciatella alla romana. I absolutely loved this soup of chicken broth, egg and reggiano. It was simple yet delightful. It kind of looked like eggdrop soup from a Chinese restaurant and to a degree was...but had cheese and more flavor layers to it.

Casarecce was my main entree, a good pasta with prosciutto, sweet peas, cream and pana gratta. I thought this pasta more than adequate but was nothing overly special. 

A homemade gelato, mixed berries I'm thinking although I can't remember it clearly. it was good but clearly forgetful and didn't leave me craving more.

This restaurant has much potential, especially being from Mark McEwan...they need to step it up a bit! $54 including tax & tip for two...a bit pricey for mediocrity."}
{"text":"Went today for Winterlicious, had a great meal of Caesar salad, punch, ravioli, and sorbet, they even made me a fancy hot chocolate.  Service was almost as good as the food.  Will definitely return as the regular menu looks great."}
{"text":"On a freezing cold Saturday Night after the movies this was a pleasant spot to eat.  Decor was very nice.  

We all had their pizzas.  All different.  All very good and tasty.  Five of us.  

The waiter was attentive but not overly friendly.  Barely said much to us.  The Hostess / Coat Check girl said more."}
{"text":"First time I encountered Fabbrica was at the end of a long bicycle ride. So of course I was starving. We got the meat and cheese platter and then a conundrum. Did I want the braised rabbit or the braised short rib pastas. No problem they said you can have a bit of both. Lovely staff, great service and I love the environment. 
My friends and I have been back loads of times since and tried many of the menu items. 
I love Fabbrica, Missy and the kitchen crew do a fabulous job. I get fabbrica cravings, check out the funghi pizza, the meatballs are insane, the ricotta donuts are a great light option with your coffee. The fritti is my fave fish, yellow perch. I find at many places you get barely there filling in your ravioli. At Fabbrica you get Nonna's ravioli big plump over stuffed and a lovely sauce, I'm always stuffed  when I leave and I loooooooove the braised short rib pappardelle. The pasta is fresh and perfect and it's not over sauced.  Will always be a favourite go to place. Love you guys."}
{"text":"Yummmmmers.

Absolutely ZERO complaints. Just stellar!

Went to lunch with a friend to catch up - ended up spending two hours there! (And, side note - never once felt like anyone wanted us to vacate even though we had finished our meal... nice!)

Service was impeccable. Attentive, masterful, love it. I enjoy the luxury of having a skilled team working to make my dining experience one I'd write home (a.k.a. Yelp) about. 

Bread on the table was gorgeous, rustic, divine.

We both had pizzas - me margherita, he pepperoni. Both ended up taking more than half home with us. Gotta love that! More filling than your average, run-of-the-mill Napoli-style pizza in the GTA. 

Note about doggy bags here: they take your plate away, and bring you back a ticket (à la coat check). You keep that ticket and PICK UP YOUR FOOD FROM THE HOSTESS AT THE FRONT who has been keeping it in the FRONT fridge for you. Whaaaaat? Beautiful.

Attention to detail at this place is one of the things that makes it 5 stars for me. The salt and pepper dispensers on the table, the cheese graters, the coffee accessories, etc. - all noteworthy, DIFFERENT than anywhere else I've seen. The coffee, btw, is also great.

The design of the space is really interesting and somehow manages to feel cozy/rustic and clean/modern at the same time. Well done, FAB-brica. Ahhhh, Vivek-worthy puns."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon here for a Summerlicious offer in the Don't Mills hinterlands, almost forgot Fabbrica is part of the restaurant empire of a celebrity chef. What was the name again... Mark McEwan? Oh yeah, that's right... what's he big for?...

Yeah, I'm just here for the food. Unlike some of his more notable downtown eateries, Fabbrica is focused on casual-level upscale Italian familiar classics. A lot of attention was placed on interior design; this ain't your nonna's dining room.

They have a feature wood-burning oven, from which I'm sure my prosciutto pizza came out of. I love the thick flavourful, fresh slathering of tomato sauce, because that's how I like my pizza. Even their non-alcoholic drinks are refreshing and sublime.

The service from what I have witnessed is generally welcoming and accommodating, but needs work in the attention department. I don't know what your definition of \"busy\" is, but I doubt it takes the form of waiting a quarter-hour in a barely half filled restaurant for someone to stop at our table to say hello. I wouldn't mind eating here again if the chance arises nonetheless.

{"text":"Came here for the first time the other night with a party of six. For a high-end restaurant, I expected a little more. 

Service felt like the equivalent of a dead fish handshake. We were served bread to start, which is always nice. We all ordered various pasta entrees and drinks, they were alright. After we finished our entrees, we noticed other tables having butter for their bread and freshly grated cheese and cracked pepper for their pasta entrees. Not sure why these were not offered to us but it felt like an incomplete experience. 

\"But Jason, why didn't you just ask for some?,\" you ask in a whiny voice.  Well, it was my first time there and we've been drinking so I didn't think of it. We also shouldn't have to ask such things at a fine-dining restaurant. 

The saving grace was the sundae. It's delicious!  

I'll assume that this was just a bad day so go ahead and give Fabricca a try. Other people seem to love it. I don't think I'll be visiting again, though."}
{"text":"My rating my be low because I excepted more from this place. The menu looked awesome. However the food was OK. It was over priced for the food. If it was averaged priced it would have got a 3 star.  The price was not worth the taste of the food. 

I got the bone marrow. I was expecting something exotic. Just tasted like bland. Then I was recommend the short rib pasta. The sauce for the pasta was the juice from the short ribs. Nothing to write home about. 

However the staff was great. Very friendly and accommodating. They did a great job making the dining experience memorable."}
{"text":"Came here for a Winterlicious lunch on January 31st.  The first thing that happened when I told the hostess my name was that I was late -- for some reason Fabbrica's system had indicated my reservation was for 12:30pm when I booked it for 1:00pm via OpenTable (which I showed on my phone).  It was extremely odd... never had that happen before with any restaurants that use OpenTable.

Anyway, we got seated near the pizza oven/kitchen and were asked about what menu we wanted and made our selections.  The wait between courses was incredibly, incredibly slow.  It took about 30 minutes between the appetizer and the main, and by that point the waiter who was looking after my table kept looking over... only to see my super bored face looking back at him.  I think they had grouped tables together before informing the kitchen staff to prep the dishes, but it was quite a while to wait for the food...

Overall, the food was fine... the wait for the food, however, could be improved upon...  More of a 4/5 for food and a 3/5 for service."}
{"text":"If you want to feel full after eating then you should try other places. This place has extremely small portions for the price. The staff were all nice and the decor and ambiance looks nice as well but you can't ignore that the prices you pay to eat here is ridiculous. I literally had two main courses with appetizers and was still hungry. The food was tasty and good though but nothing amazing."}
{"text":"I love Fabbrica. I love the location at Shops at Don Mills. When I found out about the location in the path I was so excited. 

It's a really neat place. They have a hot table, antipasto table and a few things for sale to take home. The Pizza's caught my eye so my friend and I ordered that to try. 

I had the fungi truffle pizza and she had the eggplant and roasted red pepper pizza. I can't speak on her behalf but I loved my slice - sometimes mushroom pizzas get too overwhelming but this was perfect. The perfect amount of truffle and mushrooms and it had loads of flavour. 

It'll be hard to not come back as they have a few of my favourite pastas here including the braised beef pasta. 


Keep Eating,

{"text":"Mediocre food, but brownie points given for attention to detail! Firstly, reservations were a breeze to make with open table. Secondly, there was a security guard that opened the door for us as we entered the restaurant. Thirdly, there was coat check at the door and when you have take aways, they give you a ticket and store the food in the fridge for pick up when you leave the restaurant. So if you have dessert or drinks after dinner, your food is not sitting out! This is a unique feature that I haven't seen at any other restaurants!  Fourthly, the wood oven was exported from Italy and uses real wood to make the pizza and bread! The food is supplied by mark mcewan's  Grocery store across the street and the reason why the food is so expensive there is because lots of the food is shipped from Italy!!!! This is what the waiter told me, which btw, provided excellent service! Our water was never empty! Fifthly, they have a unique washroom setup. Separate toilet area for men and women, but coed sink area. The sink is not sensor! Lots of people, including me was waiting like an idiot for the tap to turn on by itself, but lo and behold, there was a pedal at the bottom of the sink that you need to step on! 

The food didn't really stand out except for the potatoes. They were amazing! The ravioli was so-so and the prosciutto pizza wasn't bad. My friends had the margherita and funghi pizza, which were good, but nothing special. 

Cost of food is on the higher end - we paid $70 for 2 mains and 1 side, per couple. I think you can get same quality and cheaper elsewhere, but if you want a nice dining experience, fabbrica is the place to go at the don mills shops!"}
{"text":"Nice decor food was good. Loved the fungi pizza. The sundae was nice though beware of the biscuit under it. Too much baking soda. They gave bread twice for free . Server was helpful."}
{"text":"Always a fan of all things McEwan. Our party of six had a wonderful time here. The service was efficient and the food was delicious all around. Just a couple of minor glitches with one of the 3 after dinner cocktails was not available, nor was our first wine selection. Also, even though we called ahead to say we were celebrating our daughter's birthday and requested a little sparkle on her dessert, that message was apparently not passed on even though the lady who my husband spoke to said it would be no problem. No big deal. In the end the evening was lovely. I would go back."}
{"text":"Dropped in for lunch and had pizza.  The pizza itself was OK. My friend had a salad which was pretty good. I don't think it's as good as it could've been. Seems very anticlimactic for a Mark McEwan restaurant. The service was extremely slow, the waiter didn't check in with us very much, we had to flag him down several times, it was frustrating which is why I can't even give this place 4 stars."}
{"text":"Solid choice for an Italian dinner choice in the area. We liked the burrata appetizer, truffle pizza, squid ink seafood pasta, beef papardelle pasta. Sundae for 2 was just ok, We enjoyed the small donut with cremes and steak salad during our prior visits. Service was ok. The pricing is above average/high side."}
{"text":"I booked for a table of four using the open table app. I made a special request to have the older woman at our table treated with a \"happy birthday\" sauce scripture on her dessert of choice, and the restaurant complied and with no reminder needed. It was a small gesture but she felt special, and I'm so glad I didn't have to pull the waitress aside. They took our reservation and made sure we were getting what we kindly asked for. 

Our waitress and hostess were very kind and very attentive. 

The food was great! We had the 3/$18 salumi appetizer to start and it was so good! Loved the prosciutto. I then ordered the fettuccine with shrimp and chorizo and that was divine. To finish, a coffee and cannoli. 

It was a great meal, and dining experience. Highly recommended. It was a Tuesday night and was completely full of customers! 

A must try for sure."}
{"text":"With Summerlicious 2016 winding down, my friend and I decided to try Mark McEwan's Fabbrica Italian restaurant for lunch. It was our first time there.

We were greeted and seated promptly. The decor seemed nice, kinda what I would describe as Warehouse Chic - low-back chairs, high-backed banquette seats, open kitchen, wood-burning oven, concrete floors, wood on some of the walls, high ceiling. Nice but not necessarily upscale.

Their Summerlicious menu offered three choices each of appetizer, entree, and dessert for only $23. It seemed like a good deal.

We started with an Arugula Salad and the Cured Branzino. The salad was okay, nothing special. There isn't much you can do with Arugula. The Branzino wasn't what we expected. The plate was colourful but it was hard to see where the fish was on the plate. It was sliced so thin and really has no colour of its own. The flavour, even though it was cured, was so subtle, it was overpowered by the citrus on the plate, both visually and on the palate.

For our entrees, we had the Capicollo Steak and Perch Fritti. Our server brought two steaks to the table and it took a few minutes to correct the order and bring the fish. The (pork) steak was about 5 or 6 ounces by my guess. It was very tender and could have been eaten without a knife. The plating of the fish was very attractive. Both dishes, however, could have used a little more seasoning, especially the fish.

For dessert, we had the Neapolitan Gelato and Lemon Mousse. The gelato (pistachio, vanilla, cherry) was good. It was served in a paper cup. Really? Paper cup? The lemon mousse probably had the most flavour of anything we had. It was a good finish to the meal.

Overall impression? Meh. We found the entire experience quite underwhelming. The portions were small. The flavours were subtle. The service could have been better. There were times we wondered where our server was. With a total bill of almost $80 (with a glass of wine, a cappuccino, tax, and tip), we kinda expected more."}
{"text":"I have been here on several occassions and find the food and service consistently good. Mostly come for lunch but been here for dinner a few times. They have a simple menu with not too many options. Some of ky faves are the octopus salad, steak salad, orata, burger, and funghi pizza. Nice option at Shops On Don Mills. Also, I believe they have a small private dining area."}
{"text":"Fabbrica! I came here with friends for Sunday brunch, we were the first ones in the place when they opened at 11:30. The girl that seated us wasn't the friendliest, but whatever. I ordered the Fabbrica benny with smoked salmon (poached egg, shallot and fontina crumpet, and hollandaise) and the Fabbrica punch (blood orange, mango, peach nectar, white cranberry, citrus). The punch was delicious and flavourful. The ice cubes had pieces of lime and orange frozen inside of them, which was a nice touch, but the glass was full of ice which left little room for the drink itself. For $7, I was hoping for more beverage. As for the benny, I have several gripes. Really skimpy on the salmon and my eggs were, how should I say it.. OVER-poached? They were literally almost cooked all the way through. The irony of it all is that one of my friends got the steak and eggs and commented that she doesn't order bennys because she doesn't like runny, under-cooked egg. Meanwhile, her fried eggs were exploding all over her plate as I'm cutting into these hard, over-cooked balls of egg-y sadness. Huh. The crumpets on which the bennys were built were tough and crunchy, really difficult to cut through and obviously over-done. Little heavy-handed on the salt, too. Even the potatoes couldn't save it. Cut too large and heavy/stodgy texture. Not a fan. Luckily, the dessert saved this meal. Their panna cotta (banana, salted Nutella, whisky) is to die for! I was originally going to order another dessert, but I'm so glad I got this one. So creamy and flavourful.. the banana and whisky match perfectly, and while there is a chocolate component to the dessert, there isn't TOO much to overpower the fruit flavour. Lovely. Had it with a cup of coffee and it made everything better. Our server (I don't know what his name was, Asian fellow with his hair in a bun) was super nice and attentive. Big love to him. Will most likely be back to try some other things."}
{"text":"Although most of the reviews here sing the praises of this restaurant.  I would have to say that I was underwhelmed.  My expectations were high and I had hoped that I would be delighted with Fabbrica.  Unfortunately, I found the mushroom pizza to be nothing more than average and certainly not the best pizza in Toronto.  The price is definitely on the high side for what it was.  We paid $80 for two people with no alcohol, coffee or dessert."}
{"text":"Actually I would give this place zero stars since I have been in here twice but never eaten here. First time was a couple of years ago with a colleague. Fabbrica jsut opened and we left a very busy JOEY to grab a quiet drink and maybe a bite to try Fabbrica. At the time, the place was empty. We went to the bar only to be told that sorry, since we were not that busy the kitchen was closed. We had a drink with a very impersonal bartender who made us feel like we where an inconvenience to her. Needless to say we had out drink and headed straight back to the good-times at JOEY. The second time was recently were I took my wife for brunch. We were seated, wait for awhile for a server who apologized for us waiting. We order our meals along with coffee. We sat there for over 15 mins while this poor server who seemed to be working alone was running around from table-to-table with very little to not help. There were a ton of Busboys and even a few managers who couldn't bother to step up to the plate by taking over some tables. The server must of passed directly by our table at least a half a times, ignoring us each time. Needless to say we did not get coffee and we walked out. No one even noticed or asked why? I wanted to state my complaint with the Manager but my wife made a good point. This is a Mark McEwan restaurant and if he cannot even provide basic services who cares how about his menu or his name. We will never know because after a second time is there really a point to go back a third time? We did end up going to South Side Burger which was GREAT!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Fabbrica was the first stop of my Summerlicious 2013, and it certainly kicked things off with a bang! I wasn't too sure what to expect, after reading many mixed reviews, but Fabbrica really rose above and beyond my expectations.

We came promptly as the restaurant opened, at 11:30am. We were greeted and seated very quickly, and all through-out our experience here, the service was friendly & fantastic.

Fabbrica has a really nice, clean, modern décor. It's deceptively larger on the inside than it looks from the outside, and there is lots of areas and rooms for seating.

Onto the good stuff: FOOD! For my 'licious menu I had:

App: Insalata di Fabbrica - their yummy verison of Caesar salad. The dressing was a delicious garlic anchovy and it was dressed perfectly (nothing worse than a Caeser with too much or too little dressing!), sprinkled with pancetta and focaccia, it was a good start to my meal.

My dining companions had the Buffalo Mozzarella with fresh tomato, balsamic, basil and extra virgin olive oil, and the plates were completely clean by the time the server came to grab them. Always a good sign ;)

Main: ricotta ravioli, with roasted peas, mushrooms, reggiano and scallion pesto. Honestly, this is the best ravioli I have ever had the pleasure to consume. The pasta was delicious and fresh, and the scallion pesto was incredible. I'm usually not a big pasta person but I quickly fell in love with this dish. I WILL be back for it.

Dessert: I sampled a bit of everything which was:

Dark chocolate gelato: Simple, but fantastic.
Tiramisu: Decent tiramisu, but I found it a bit dry.
Pavlova di Fabbrica: This was a giant egg-like meringue shell, the insides oozing with lemon curd, served on a bed of strawberries. My DCs loved this dish, but I found the lemon curd too much and too overpowering - but maybe that's just my preference =). The meringue was very yummy.

Overall a surprisingly great experience, and, in my opinion, the best restaurant option at Shops @ Don Mills. There was a party beside us feasting on some delicious looking items from the brunch menu, so I am excited to come back and scope the brunch out!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times after my first review and it's never been as good as the first time.

Service each time has been great, however - both times I went the restaurant wasn't even close to full and it still took forever to get our food. The food is also hit and miss - some dishes are okay, some dishes are excellent. To their credit, there's never been anything bad.

The squid ink pasta isn't cavatelli anymore - I forget what it is now but it's much starchier and there isn't enough sauce. The regular risotto isn't anything to write home about. I find it a little odd that their charcuterie set doesn't include cheese and that you order it separately. We've tried a few of the meats now and while good, it was never anything outstanding. The winner every time has been the truffle pizza. Delicious and will probably be my go to whenever I come back."}
{"text":"This was my second time to go to Fabbrica but my first for their winterlicious menu. The food was merely ok. Nothing exciting and nothing that I would recommend. We had the octopus, beef tongue carpaccio, kale salad, Rabbit sugo, Ravioli, and their cheesecake. 

The only brag worthy of all those dishes was the octopus and it was the smallest plate. It was a beautiful looking plate and the octopus itself was sweet and grilled to perfection. 

The beef tongue was ok, the dressing that came with it was a bit too acidic for my taste, but that could be a personal preference. 

The biggest complaint that we had from the rabbit sugo was that we couldn't taste the rabbit and the sauce was too watery. The squash in my plate was a bit under cooked to a point of crunchy. I'm not a big fan of crunchy things in a plate of pasta. 

The kale salad and cheesecake were just ok. nothing good, nothing bad. But I guess if you're at a Mark Mcewan restaurant, you're expecting amazing. 

We had a bunch of cocktails between the group. I had their Ceasar and I have to say for $14 it was a very unimpressive drink. I should have had their rail drinks instead. 

The service was good but really slow.  However the one high note was that they were really cool to our group especially since we had a baby in our midst. The server was very accommodating. 

Fabbrica overall was just ok, but for its reputation and the price, I was expecting something a lot better."}
{"text":"I had brunch today with the family and it was fantastic.

- short rib hash was not what I expected... It had the flavour profile more consistent with a stew... The poached egg went sooo well with this

- lemon ricotta pancakes were light and the candied lemons paired perfectly with the blueberry

- fritta had a super light batter ... Seafood mix included shrimp, sardines and muscles

The wait staff was professional and super friendly, kitchen could have been a little faster for 230 in the afternoon with only 3 tables... But they weren't terribly long...

Definitely worth a visit"}
{"text":"McEwan is really disappointing me with their cheap table setting and ghetto dinner cloth. Me and 4 colleagues went there for their winterlicious lunch. There are bits of loose lint on their dinner cloth goes ALL over our clothes. We were all happen to wear black tops which makes those white fluffs even more visible. When I mentioned it to the waitress at the end, she was fully aware of the problem and she didn't think it's a problem. She didn't even offer a lint remover or whatever method to help us get rid off those white fluffs. I'll never go back."}
{"text":"Grilled steak salad $20 - overall pretty good. The steak was nice and tender and the salad had a nice mixture of ingredients to keep things interesting (beets, arugula, pistachio, goat cheese)

Ravioli $19 - Good at first but got boring fast

meal comes with complementary bread

service was slow in the beginning but was much better throughout the meal

definitely pricy on the pricy side but it is comparative to other Italian restaurants

good food but nothing stood out for me"}
{"text":"One of the worse food experience. Poor service. I ordered the octopus as appetizer and casarecce Nero with squid ink pasta, salad extremely salty and pasta was not well cook. Seat is not comfortable. What's matter with Mark? You have got a reputation! Won't go back. Sorry."}
{"text":"I dined here on a Sunday for my birthday dinner with my family. I thought I would try something different and this place seemed to have a different ambiance.

I ordered the Funghi Pizza with a Mill Street Beer (Organic), I felt there was nothing unique about what I ordered and was not very impressed. Other dishes that were ordered were: Risotto, Fettucine and the Tagliolini. The comments for the dishes were average and nothing extremely outstanding that we would dine here again. 

However despite the food being average, the service was excellent and very attentive to our needs through our meal. Based on service I would give this place a 4/5 but due to the food lacking an impression on us, this is the reason for my rating.

On the side note, the bar and overall restaurant is quite eye appealing but besides that I'm not sure if I am that inclined to return."}
{"text":"Took my kid here for lunch today. We started with the salumi board with cheese followed by the ricotta gnocchi and marguerita pizza. There was warm bread to start and our server offered without asking to bring extra crostini to go with the salumi board. Everything was delicious with the gnocchi as perfect as ever. We had no room for dessert.

Service was excellent and we enjoyed our seats close to the park but still inside the restaurant. Washrooms were spotless.

This place is as good for a business lunch as it is for a casual lunch. Relaxed vibe."}
{"text":"Good rustic italian food. However kind of pricy for what it is. The restaurant is also very nicely decorated."}
{"text":"It's been several years since I have been to Fabbrica.

I remember the excellent food and food varieties and the pricing wasn't too bad.  That was probably 7-8 years ago.

I came today and saw a smaller menu.  The gluten free options were less than what I had I the past.  The prices had definitely gone up, but that didn't matter as much to me as the limitations of options that I used to have.

I had the meat tray with 3 meats.  The meat was okay.  The presentation was a little bland.  The meat was okay but pretty dry.

I would of liked a few more options and to be offered half dishes like previous visits.

The decor was nice, and the staff provided good service.  The restaurant was clean.

I drove out of my way to come here, and was disappointed compared to my previous visits.  I don't know if I would return."}
{"text":"So glad I was able to grab a last minute Winterlicious reservation for Saturday lunch at Fabbrica.  Would've gone for its neighbouring competitor Linda Modern Thai but my last experience at a Mark McEwan resto was too good for me to pass this up.

I was right :)

We started off with ordering the Fabbrica punch.  There was blood orange, mango, peach nectar, white cranberry, and citrus.  If you're not a fan of overly sweet drinks, this won't be for you.  But I LOVED it.  The peach nectar hit the spot for me and combined with all the other citrusy goodness I could've probably finished the drink within a minute if I didn't stop myself.  The lemon was actually frozen inside ice cubes - such a unique thing to do that I never saw at other places before.  This made sure the sour citrus flavour wouldn't overpower the nectar.. I loved this drink!

The app was not bad; I had the fennel salad.  The flavouring was not very strong but the salami was great.  My girlfriend's garlic soup was extremely flavourful, however, and we enjoyed dipping our bread in that.

For the main, we both got the parpardelle, with pork ragout, fresh basil and parmesan.
..the waiting time between our app and main was a little long b/c the servers weren't sure that we had finished our app, I think.. but this resulted in two hungry Asian girls inhaling this dish in less than 5min.  

To be fair, we would've probably finished in 1min if we wanted to.  It was deliciously light, the fat pasta noodles had a perfect texture and the sauce was made with a reduction of pork ragout.  The manager dropped by to talk to us presumably b/c she saw how quickly we devoured our main and suggested that we take a look at the regular menu.  What a great dish though, maybe the quantity was a little small but it definitely left us waiting more.  We contemplated sharing a pizza afterwards -_-

For dessert, we both got the pavlova di fabbrica and this is a soft meringue puff pastry with a marshmallow/cream filling inside and mango puree and blackberries on the side. The puff shell was a little too sweet but it was a light dish that was a good ending to our meal.  At this point we were still contemplating that pizza -_-

In the end, the four stars is mainly given towards the excellent service and main, and well-deservedly so :)

On another note, the Winterlicious dinner menu here is the same as the lunch one with the addition of a risotto.  I'd suggest coming here for lunch because it would suffice for the experience while being less pricey :)  Worth trying for foodies, I'd come here for its regular menu next time I'm shopping near the area!"}
{"text":"I made reservations at Fabbrica because my mother enjoys Italian cuisine. The vibe was nice and casual, which conflicted with the attitude I received  right when I walked through the front door. The hostess was very nice, but another woman (perhaps she was the Manager) was cold and rude. I had made reservations online a month prior (as it was for Mother's day) and requested a table by the window. She brought us to a table in the worst possible location  -- mind you there were at least 10 tables available. She refused to seat us by the side at a 4-person table (in which case there were plenty of such tables available) because clearly we we are only 2 people. She then refused to sit us at the front  because she was expecting a party of 20? The area at the front could only fit maybe 10 more people max aside from those already there so that didn't make any sense.  She then spent 10 mins telling us that we can either sit at the table she wants or wait at the bar for 30 mins because again we don't have enough people in our party, we decided to sit in the bar area. So the table we were seated at in the bar was dirty and this same rude lady assisting us from the start, spent about 5 mins explaining to us that the table is in fact not dirty rather the design of the table (mind you we simply wanted the table wiped as the table was sticky of something) . Two minutes later, she she told us there was a \"sudden\" cancellation and another table was open. So finally after 20 minutes from arriving and being rudely treated, shifting around from tables, and spoken to all the while in a condescending tone, we were finally able to eat our lunch. Yes, we should have left immediately after this woman's initial comments, but considering it was Mother's day and most of the restaurants were full, we reluctantly stayed. Overall, the food was okay, but the service was absolutely horrible!!! There are too many other worthy places to dine at, and I will never return here."}
{"text":"The restaurant is very clean and cozy, and the pizza  was very tasty, but service is okay"}
{"text":"I have continued to come to Fabbrica, and recently I became very disappointed because 2 of my favourite items are no longer on the menu:
Baked tortiglioni - was at first replaced with a baked macaroni and lobster, and now they have no more baked dishes. However, I was told that if the chef happens to have the right pasta (tortiglioni), it can still be made.
Tiramisu - They still have a tiramisu, but, it's not their unique version anymore. It used to be an original take on the tiramisu which included a Frappuccino type pudding, and now it's been replaced with a mediocre tasting regular tiramisu. This is all because their pastry chef left.
The rest of the menu is still good, but I don't know if I will be coming back. :("}
{"text":"McEwan Restaurants never disappoint. I came here for brunch with a large group. I was hesitating to order the Lemon Ricotta Pancakes on the brunch menu because I was afraid it would get too heavy at the end. But I am glad I ordered it. The pancakes were light and refreshing with lemon-y flavour. I didn't need to use the syrup they provided because it tasted great on its own with the blueberry purée and some whip cream. It almost felt like I was eating a super light Japanese version of a blueberry cheesecake. It didn't feel heavy or repetitive. They give you 3 pancakes but I was only able to finish 2, so I would recommend sharing this if possible or be prepared to take some home! Also ordered the Fabbrica punch and really appreciated that the ice cubes had lemon/ orange bits in it, so it doesn't totally dilute your drink as it melts."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Mark McEwan. He's a culinary genius & a true asset to Toronto. I've dined at One & Bymark in the past, both were amazing. My boyfriend & I often shop at McEwan's because it's way better than Pusateri's & Whole Foods combined.

So why only 3 stars? The service. Despite a half empty restaurant & a timed reservation- it took the 3 hostesses a few minutes to seat us. Luckily we \"scored\" a table by the window. To top it off they gave us the brunch menu during our dinner service. This didn't both me as much, as I've been here for brunch as well & it's fantastic. To be completely honest, I would've preferred brunch instead.

Our waiter was great. He corrected their mistake & was super friendly. I felt kinda bad for him because it seemed he was the only one serving the majority of the tables. Took a while for us to get our bill but we were understanding. 

The meal itself was delicious. We had the meatballs to start, ravioli as the main & the panna cotta for dessert. My boyfriend had the fettuccine which was perfect & the gelato for desert. We were both very satisfied with our meals.

Overall, I would probably return based on the food itself. I really hope the service here improves (ie, more servers & less hostesses)."}
{"text":"Fabbrica has been a stellar performer for me and my wife over the past couple of years. The interior is warm and inviting, the service consistently genuine, the vibe always interesting and the food is reliably very good. Oh, did I mention the pizza oven? I will go to my grave envious of such a beautiful thing.

The bread...if there is in fact a charge for it (as others have noted) I have never noticed as it, along with the oil, is exceptional. Don't whine about having to actually pay for something so good.

The pizza...some of the best this city has to offer. Others have noted that it is not as good as _____________, and it may not be, but make no mistake, this is GOOD pizza. 

The salumi (charcuterie)...second only to mine.

Octopus Diavolo...exceptional. Yes, one of the best I've eaten. 

Coffee...they know what a macchiato is and come close enough to knowing how to make one.

Polenta and beet salad are also worth mention. 

Fabbrica is a good all round performer. Not cheap, but we have yet to have a meal there that was anything but very good."}
{"text":"It's my favorite Italian place. The atmosphere is warm, its rustic and retro and the meals are typical Italian mixed with modern cuisine. 
The owner - Mark McEwan - is the reason I visited the place for the first time and I still like to come back. 
Although the service could be more friendly I can't complain about their promptness.
I like any kind of pizza, carpaccio and delicious mushrooms with truffle crema. 
They make delicious coffee and the selection of drinks is really good! Go for Pinot Grigio or Chardonnay if you love wine."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to go to this restaurant for a while but for the longest time I didn't because I read so many bad reviews. I actually don't understand why people didn't like this restaurant because I think it's quite good! Granted this is not my favourite Italian restaurant but I'm a picky girl. However, I would definitely come back here.

I came here for lunch with a friend before I headed to Europe so I can compare Toronto's Italian food with Italy's food. (Turns out the Italian food in Toronto is not bad at all!)

My friend got a pasta. I don't remember which one but I remember it being a tomato based sauce and it was delicious.

I got risotto and a side of polenta. The risotto was okay but the dish is too Asian tasting for my liking. I think risotto is just not for me because I rather go to a Chinese restaurant and order rice. The polenta was good. I've never had polenta before and I think my first experience with it went well. It's definitely not something to eat on your own because it's so filling.

I came here during the summer time and I really wanted a sangria but they only had it in a pitcher. So I guess my only complaint is that they should offer it by the glass because a girl can't and shouldn't finish a whole pitcher on her own!"}
{"text":"I love the décor here.  I guess I would describe it as hipster...modern yet rustic. We were a group of 12 which included two babies (one that's 11 months and the other 22 months. The waiter was very accommodating to all of our needs (e.g., bringing extra plates, napkins, etc. for the children without us even asking). One of the couples wanted to share their dishes and the waiter took it upon himself to get the pasta dish split up into two separate portions.  He also regularly came back to check on our meals and to refill our water. So in terms of service, I think they were great! My husband and I ordered the pappardelle with braised beef and the beef, veal and pork ravioli.  Right away, you can tell that their pasta is made in house...and it's delicious!  Their sauces are flavourful and do not overpower the other ingredients.  We also ordered the frites with chives and truffle oil accompanied by a garlic aioli.  Then frites were delicious, but I would've liked them to be a little crispier.  Other than that, I would definitely come back here again to try one of their other dishes."}
{"text":"I sort of avoided going to Fabbrica for awhile (seemed a bit pretentious and likely overpriced since it's a \"McEwan\" restaurant) but I've been here a handful of times and always enjoyed it

I work right near here and it's a great spot to take a client or for a professional lunch if you're around the Shops at Don Mills area
The atmosphere is upscale casual for lunch

I've had the margerita pizza - very yummy; came out a bit burnt once but the crust is nice and thin and crisy
And I love the steak salad - this is presented in a great way (on a large wooden slab) and all the ingredients go well together
Also tried the farro salad - it looks like a small portion but it's quite filling

The butino (?) (sticky toffee pudding) is also SO good here! I have it each time I come 

I prices aren't cheap but it is in a pricey area and the food is quite good"}
{"text":"Went there for dinner on a weekday. The place is not busy. The setting is really nice. I got the seafood squid ink pasta which is amazing. It's not a super fancy dish but all the ingredients are fresh and done right. The only down side is that the place is a quite expensive partially because of the celebrity chef."}
{"text":"The food was absolutely amazing and the service was on point, had an awesome birthday dinner here!

We had the 32 oz rib eye that was perfectly made, seasoned well and was incredibly filling. The pork cheek was to die for, salty and savory and literally melts in your mouth. The squid ink seafood pasta was really good, had a small kick to it, which just made it even more delicious!"}
{"text":"Due to the location and parking, my former coworkers and I like to meetup at Shops at Don Mills for gathering. Fabbrica has a nice friendly environment for 4 of us to catch up.  We ordered 3 pizza on the last Friday -  Prosciutto e arugula, Funghi and Salciccia. We love it and surely will go back for our next  gathering."}
{"text":"I came here for a Winterlicious Lunch, and it matched and exceeded my expectations.

To start, I had the Beef Carpaccio. It tasted so fresh, and was nice and cool. All of the ingredients on the plate were top notch, which was the common theme throughout the meal. It was a pleasant start to the meal. I also tasted some of the garlic soup, and it was garlicy and not overwhelming. Dipping some of the fresh bread that they kept bringing to the table was a wonderful bite.

For my main, I chose the Ricotta Ravioli with Roasted Mushrooms. The raviolis are big and fat, and definitely taste freshly made. The restaurant supplied as much Parmigiano-Reggiano as I wanted, which is always a good sign of a good Italian restaurant, along with an endless supply of fresh bread. The ravioli was delicious, and the most surprising part of the meal for me was the sauce. The sauce was buttery and infused with a lot of mushroom goodness. I tasted some of the eggplant pizza and the pizza was expertly crafted. The dough was so soft and chewy. The tomato sauce was so fresh and zingy. Though the best part of the pizza might be the little pickled chili relish they had on the side. Way tastier than a chili oil if you ask me.

For dessert I had the Pavlova. It was bright and lemony. The texture of the Pavlova was divine. And everyone who ordered it did not regret their choice. My girlfriend might be making Pavlova in the oven right now... as one Pavlova was not enough.

Overall, the food at Fabbrica echos freshness and top quality ingredients. Even on my way to the washroom, I passed the large wood fired stove and saw many fresh breads sitting outside of it. The same breads that they were serving at the table. Afterwards we admired and purchased some of the fine ingredients found across the street at McEwan's to top off the afternoon."}
{"text":"This upscale-ish restaurant is conveniently located at the Shops at Don Mills; I was very impressed by the noise-cancelling panels covered in fabric and extending from the ceiling. This is smart design that lends itself to quality conversation and far less echo. The red and white theme is decidedly borrowed from classic American-Italian conventions, but fortunately it's fresh enough here that it doesn't seem overly kitsch. 

Perhaps I've been spoiled elsewhere, but the beef carpaccio here could benefit with a hint of sweetness - pear perhaps? I ordered a side of broccolini but it was drenched in oil so I didn't finish it. 

Fortunately, one of my group graciously offered me a sample of the skirt steak salad and I quickly realized I had made a mistake ordering the beef carpaccio. The salad was delicious and I'd heartily recommend trying it. 

Everyone else I was with seemed satisfied by their choices, and the service was quite good. The lemon tart I had for dessert was okay, but a bit too much like cheesecake for my liking. I was warned against ordering the mini doughnuts, which sound appealing but apparently are also quite mediocre.

There is room for potential here, but I don't think I'd chance it again unless someone else wants to treat me."}
{"text":"Where does one start with this terrible experience.
First of - there was a definite feeling of a \"two tier\" service. The three of  us came in from a weekend work appointment which required casual clothing and next to us was a couple that clearly \"dressed to impress\". They basically got personalised service and a girl fluttering aroudn them pretty much 24/7. Us on the other hand - had to waive down the waiter for pretty much everything.
On top of that - you know that there are some people who should just NOT work with people? Well, our waiter was one of those people. So awkward... Stiff. Couldn't smile for the life of him. And on top of everything -- messes up my salad order. Like, actually?! It was an absolute disaster. That whole experience was so negative that I have absolutely no wish to return to that restaurant. The food was ok, but left a sour taste in my mouth due to the crappy service and the fact that I had to eat something I didn't order (when I told him I asked for something else, he said \"Oh sorry\" and just left -- the heck?!). Avoid by all means."}
{"text":"Such a delicious restaurant hidden in the shops of don mills. Upon arrival I was greeted by a friendly hostess who coat checked my jacket for me ( free of charge ) . 

Our table was ready for us and right away was brought water and bread/oil/balsamic vinegar. I didn't have the bread as it didn't look like it was worth the calories. 

I started with Cesar Salad which tasted much better then it looked. To be honest the greens were totally wilted,   the dressing was good and the fresh parmesan cheese was super. My friend got the caprese salad , the cheese was a great size. 

The menu is not too intense; pizza, pasta , meats and fish. Something for everyone. I got the squid and my friend got the funghi pizza. 

My squid was INCREDIBLE... so much flavour , large pieces of squid and super filling. The pizza was SO GOOD too... it's great for sharing if you're not tooooo hungry, or great as an appetizer. The pizza is thin with lots of flavour. 

Honestly everything that walked by looked great, portions are a nice size. The staff were super attentive and personable! 

I think the coolest thing is that if you take home food you're given a ticket to give to the hostess at the front and they have your food waiting for you!!!!

I will return!!!!"}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times, I'd call it slightly upscale but not too snobby Italian. Prices are on the high side (probably the priciest resto in the Shoppes at Don Mills, but not extremely expensive. 

Food on its own would definitely rate a 4.5, maybe even a 5. Pizzas are quite good, they're made in the oven in the back of the restaurant. Most dishes are solid in terms of flavor and quantity. We ordered the following for dinner, everything was very good.

Pappardelle with beef short ribs -- best pasta dish they have, very rich, flavourful;
Gnocchi -- another good dish, super fluffy and soft gnocchi
Caesar salad -- using crispy thin Pancetta instead of bacon was a very nice touch

Waiter was friendly quick and attentive, couldn't ask for better service.

Here's the one reason they did not score a five. We called for a reservation -- and arrived on time, to a mostly empty restaurant. We were given a booth off to the side of the bar area. I wasn't thrilled about that table and asked for one in the dining room instead (away from the bar and TVs showing the baseball game) but we were told that all those tables were taken. Since there were only 2 or 3 occupied tables in the dining room when I looked I assumed that they were taken by other reservations. Fair enough. But towards the end of our dinner, I took another look. Now, there were ZERO occupied tables in the dining room -- the 3 tables had since cleared out, and NOBODY else came in! So who were they saving the dining room tables for? Why did they lie to me? I can only guess. Not a huge thing, but enough to make me question their motives, and also question whether I want to go there again, even though the food is good.

I was going to call them out on their bald-faced lie on my way out, but I couldn't be bothered. Had I been in a fouler mood, I would have made a big stink about it. Instead, I decided to just take away a star."}
{"text":"Thursday wad my 3rd time hslere and it's still pretty great in my books!  

Love love love the fettuchini with crab and poached egg and the panna cotta!  Their bread is also delicious esp with the balsamic vinegar and olive oil!  Says a lot as I'm usually a butter gal.

Have had the pizza, tiramisu, pork shoulder, rabbit pasta - all yummy but not nearly as memorable as those stated above.

Only disappointment was that they don't have Italian coffee!  Price isn't really surprising, it's Mark McEwan!

Beware of the restrooms - women, go right :)

Mommies will also be pleased to know they have a changing table in the family washroom~!

They had complimentary valet parking once (happened to be one of the coldest nights of the year) but the next time we were there it was only available at McEwan's supermarket...

Reservations can also be made on OpenTable :)"}
{"text":"I give a three given my high expectations as a member of the McEwan empire.  Had a simple salad and rice pudding which were fresh and tasty (I particularly enjoyed the aged balsamic on the pudding) but the pasta was a little too oily.

Great people watching place as you can expect the full gamut..from the snooty trophy wives of the shops on Don Mills to the celebrity chef seeking/food network fan foodies. 

Ciao!"}
{"text":"The problem with Fabbrica is that you expect a little more.

It's american italian food at the end of the day and i think that's the downfall. Otherwise, you have all the ingredients need for success - excellent service, great interior, a wood oven, a brand name chef.......and that's sort of where it ends. American Italian is just too old a trick. 

The Neapolitan pizza is good, but there are others in Toronto who do a better job - so they don't win there. The pasta's are good, but more places have that nailed down now. Theoretically, there's nothing really left to boast or draw me to Fabbrica from all the others who do the same. I guess it's just location advantage at this point."}
{"text":"this restaurant was soooo good! probably the best italian restaurant i've tried and the best pasta i've had. this is a really nice, romantic and quiet restaurant. its so quiet most probably because its at the far side of shops on don mills where people wont pass by unless they are going to the restaurant because its at the very end. its a beautiful restaurant to just relax, enjoy your dinner and company cuz its so quiet! but i like it. a classy place.

my bf and i shared the polpetta pizza with cured tomato, fabbrica meatball, mozarella , onion and pickled chili. IT WAS BOMBBBBB! so tasty but not too salty. the crust was thin yet crunchy. and because the crust was thin, you don't feel uncomfortably stuffed with carbs after.

i had the clam, shrimp linguine with garlic white wine sauce and chili oil. OMG best pasta ever!! the whole pasta was infused with white wine and garlic flavour! MY FAVE. the shrimp was marinated sooo well, SO MUCH white wine and garlic flavour in it. the clams were a bit chewy though but that didnt bother me. the linguine was al dente. just the way pasta is supposed to be made!

my bf had the pappardelle pasta with braised shortrib, tomato and basil. which was good but not as good as what i got in my opinion.

fabbrica, SEE YOU SOON!"}
{"text":"Two of us were hungry on a Thursday night and were craving a pizza. We didn't feel like having the regular big chain pizza, but rather a nice restaurant style one. So we decided to drop by Fabbrica, as it was conveniently located nearby and their website said they were going to be open for over another hour. I apologize in advance, but this is going to be a lengthy and weird one.

As we got to the restaurant, the doors were closed yet we saw people sitting inside. I was really embarrassed, since I thought I had maybe misread the listed times. So I went back on their website and confirmed that I hadn't been mistaken, but the doors were just closed quite early for some reason. We saw the hostess from outside and caught her attention. As she unlocked the door, we asked if they were closed given the website indicated they should be open. She looked very confused and said, well...we are kind of closed, but you could come in. We would only be able to serve you pizza, salads and dessert. I was very reluctant to go in given all of this weirdness. But, my boyfriend was very hungry and decided we would go in. 

Once we were seated, our waiter asked us if we had any questions about the menu. We wanted to clarify what we were able to order. I saw the ravioli on the menu and wanted to know if it was a possibility, given what we were told at the door. The waiter also looked rather confused and said he would be back to check in the kitchen. He came back and let us know that all the pizzas, pastas and apps were available, but none of the meats or fish, etc. Fine. My bf got the lamb pizza and I got the ravioli. 

While waiting, we were given yummy bread on the house with olive oil and balsamic vinegar to munch on. It was a good start to our meal. However, we received our food and were both quickly disappointed. The food was pretty bland. We asked to get some seasoning or hot sauce of some sort. We were given chilli oil and chilli flakes that we gladly added to our food. The pizza was okay in my opinion to begin with, but the ravioli was very bland. Once I added the chilli oil, I finally began to enjoy my meal. We were going to order dessert initially, but then decided not to in case we were going to be disappointed with that too. Can't add chilli oil to cannolis... 

Overall, they should definitely modify the times on their website if there have been changes so that customers are aware before making a trip there. Or, I would recommend calling them in advance. The way we were greeted was very awkward and I personally would have never gone in had my bf not been starving. The service once inside was pleasant, which is why the second star is given (and the bread). However, all of the confusion and the bland food earned this review 2 stars."}
{"text":"Excellent Summerlicious menu - went for the $20 lunch menu today and if we would have paid regular price, the bill would have been close to $50 - great service and delicious, fresh food."}
{"text":"We've been to Fabbrica a few times specifically for their porterhouse,it is excellent! I I've been to other Mcewan restaurants and have left disappointed. I had called the day prior and had asked for the porterhouse and was told they would place an order. When we had arrived our server took a little longer than usual (it was winterlicious) but he was polite and nice as most of the staff is.  When we had asked for the steak and mentioned it was noted on our reservation, he came back with the manager to advise they did not have the steak. They did their best to accommodate us, offering a different cut. I was unhappy, but their sirloin was certainly an excellent replacement, the rapini was cooked perfectly... And their fries are absolutely delicious. We also ordered the prosciutto and arugula pizza which never disappoints. The manager came by after and brought espresso and ice wine as an apology, which was unexpected and greatly appreciated. As always, Great service and excellent food!"}
{"text":"We had an excellent brunch experience from service by Chia to the delicious food.  
The staff was so accommodating to modify our kids meals to their liking. Our server was prompt & courteous. The food was scrumptious. I highly recommend Fabbrica!"}
{"text":"Mark McEwan, man of the people?

Walking into Fabbrica, Mr. McEwan's (relatively) popularly-priced Italian restaurant in the recently revamped Shops of Don Mills, you feel brand-extension creep. Mr. McEwan's first foray into casual fine dining largely plays it safe, with comfortable Italian the likes of which is popping up all over the city, at slightly premium prices.

We arrive on a Thursday night and are seated immediately according to our reservations. Water is poured and fresh bread sided with a tiny bottle of olive oil is offered. The oil reminds me of the individual maple syrup bottles that come with your Pickle Barrel French Toast. The bread is tasty, though I agree with the restaurant's policy reversal; it's not worth the original $4 charge. 

No wine for us tonight, so we wait...and wait...and wait. 45 minutes later, our appetizers appear. I appreciate that good food takes time, and the place is full, but for a dish that requires quick assembly (it's tossed, not plated, for God's sake), it's a bit much. 

Fabbrica salads are familiar...romaine lettuce... parmesan...if only I could place it...housemade crostini...I know I've tried something like this somewhere...salty pancetta...shoot, give me a second, I'll come up with it...bracing anchovy dressing...I don't know where I've encountered such a combination, but it's crispy and fresh.

Mains vary: Porchetta is all sweet melting porkiness in a dippable jus.  A side of sauteed artichoke hearts is pleasant, and big enough to share, but could use a stronger pepper or acid punch.  House-made pastas with short ribs or sausage are well-composed, but are done better elsewhere for better value. In another environment, they'd be cheap, filling loss-leaders, and would meet expectations. In this case, they disappoint. A meatball pizza arrives crispy and blistered from the industrial chic wood-burning oven. Where I'd hope for generous meatball chunks strewn with abandon, I get restraint. The meatball crumbles taste fine, and are set off by pickled peppers and red onions, good cheese and bright sauce; but this pizza's really about the crust.

Desserts are fun and innovative, though the best part of the tiramisu is the \"frappucino\" alongside. It's barely sweet coffee granita under the thickest layer of whipped cream in the history of time. It could be a dessert on its own; even better if a shot of Kahlua found its way into the mix. 

Coffee is strong, although service is curious. Served out of tiny carafes, it takes 2-3 trips just to pour for three at the table. It's awkward. By the time our server returns the first drinker is ready for a refill, or else we all wait and let our coffee grow cold and grey until the server finishes her rounds.  

Service is funny; management watches over tables carefully, but servers breeze by or depart without taking everybody's orders. After a 45 minute wait for appetizers (salads, at that) and an even longer wait for mains, the Manager comes up to our table; acknowledges the problem and apologizes. The bill comes on time, with no adjustments despite his acknowledgement that this is an ongoing issue. Words are nice, but if he's aware of a concern before we say anything, actions would speak louder."}
{"text":"After a long day at the zoo, I wanted a nice dinner that was family friendly and not filled with more screaming kids.  Fabbrica showed up on my yelp as a potential and had early reservations opening on OpenTable.  I quickly booked my table and off we went.  Parking was super easy in the parkade and wasn't too busy for a Sunday early evening.  Though we arrived before a normal dinner time and the light shown into the whole place, you can tell it would be a nice atmosphere at night with it's trendy woods, modern atmosphere, and comfortable seating.  It would not be out of place to see this restaurant in downtown Toronto... the only difference is that Fabbrica actually has space between the tables!

The hostess was perfectly friendly and accommodated easily a request to be seated near a window.  We ended up getting a cozy 4 top that is secluded and separate from most of the dining area.  It's a nice table as it had leather comfortable chairs and the table top was actually stone.  The sun shone through a filtered screen and was a nice area.

The menu had a lot of variety and what did surprise me a bit was the price point.  It rivaled some of the downtown prices and yet here it was in DVP and Don Mills area.  I guess the Mark McEwan brand is a premium even in the middle of suburbia.  We ended up getting 2 non alcoholic drink (OJ for $5!! and a mint lemonade for $7), one main to split (salmon), 2 sides (fries and rapini), and 2 desserts (seasonal rhubarb pavlova and chocolate torte).  All this came up to nearly $100 ... thats right.  $100 for 1 adult and 1 small child.  Don't get me wrong, nothing was wrong with the food... it was good but for that price, I'm expecting creative food, top shelf ingredients, gorgeous plating, and top end service that I've had recently in Toronto.  It doesn't help I also went to argueably the best restaurant in TO the previous day (Grey Gardens... just mind blowing amazing).  

The service was good but relaxed and perfectly suitable for a low key enjoyable slow paced family meal.  It wasn't attentive and yet cool to fit a price point like this.  I really thought the service was thoughtful though as he did offer the little one to try the punch first before ordering a full sized.  I liked that.    

I did like the food ... salmon was well cooked as it kept the translucent peachy middle.  Fries were generous with the cheese but not as crispy to be great.  The rapini was laughable small as it only maybe had 9 small branches for $10.  The bread offering was nice ... you don't see that too often.  The drinks and side prices are definitely more expensive than places in downtown Toronto.

If the meal came to $80 including tip... I would say it's more fair to be a solid 4 stars but sitting at $100, it just makes me question if it worth it and not try other places first. Overall, not a bad place if you don't care what your bill is at the end of the night."}
{"text":"North 44. Bymark. One Restaurant. What do these all have in common you ask? They all belong to the renowned Canadian chef, Mark McEwan. His legacy continues with his latest restaurant, Fabbrica, which just recently opened on October 1st. Having gone on opening day, I had the honor of meeting the culinary mastermind behind all this as he attended each table with a warm greeting. 

Having gone to North 44 and Bymark before, my assumption of a modern and chic interior was inevitable. Of course, they delivered the goods. An alluring colossal wall of wine bottles immediately grabs hold of your eyes when entering. That being said, that is also where the bar is located. This is also where you'll find many individuals dressed in business casual attire chit-chatting about. Further in is the dining room which was echoing with people, and towards the back is an open kitchen. Beside it, is the stylishly decorated washroom. The usage of Italian and common sink area had me confused at first, but I managed to pick the RIGHT side. But enough about the design, the real stars of the show have yet to be discussed. 

3 dishes: Neck of Lamb, Pappardelle and Orecchiette. 

1. Neck of Lamb ($26) - This dish LOOKED good, but suprisingly the flavours did not come out as I thought it would. Although the meat was tender, the flavours were flat due to under marinating. However, the sausage that accompanied the lamb had fresh italian flavours, but it was not anything new. 

2. Pappardelle ($26) - The description sounded absolutely mouth-watering, but again, the flavours were monotonous. This dish had crab, prosciutto and a poached egg to top it off. It was not a super rich dish, the sauce had a medium-consistency and I found that they did not allow the other ingredients to shine enough. However, the pasta was cooked perfectly. 

3. Orecchiette ($18) - This was also a pasta dish with a promising description. Yet, I was fooled. But, with ingredients such as rabbit and rapini, how could someone not? This was by far the worst dish of all. It was just plain bland and that's all I can say about it. Dissapointment.

My waitress came over and asked how everything was, but seeing as though my dad and sister were too nice to tell the truth, I did them the favour. I told her my two dishes were okay, but my sisters' dish was bland. She said she'd let the kitchen know. Now, I was not asking for a free dessert or free meal, but to my suprise, the Orecchiette was deducted off the bill, which was a plus for me as I was paying for my dad's late birthday gift. It totalled out to be $70 including tax and tips. Keep in mind this was only two dishes. This is definately on the pricey side, but since it was one of Mark McEwans, I just had to give it a try.

(And yes, some of you may think I am harsh when I told her it was bland, but when my food is bad, I am one of those people who will say something and not let it slide, because honestly, if you're paying to eat somewhere, don't you think you should be getting your money's worth? Besides, restaurants WANT feedback. Which restaurant doesn't want to improve?)

OVERALL:  This place was mediocre. His other restaurants are better, but it was worth a try. Although I do wish I had chosen a better place for my dad's birthday dinner as he was disappointed as well.

Sidenote: I got a picture with Mark McEwan. -Super Big Smile-"}
{"text":"I had a pleasant dinner time at this restaurant. There's a coat check at the entrance. The waiters are quite young and energetic and very attentive to the tables. 
We tried Oreto as appetizer and loved it. I had funghi pizza and my friend tried the fish. Would I come here again? Considering the prices I'd say probably not. Also, the main course comes late, so be prepared!"}
{"text":"We have been to this restaurant at least 10 times for brunch and felt it was a nice upscale setting.  

However, we went last night for dinner and had a terrible experience.  Our waiter (with a man bun) was incredibly rude, unfriendly, and short with his responses.  I don't think he smiled once nor said thank you when asking us to pass him our glasses.  He was also not attentive as we looked around for a while waiting to order.  For the price you pay at this restaurant, it is not worth it.  You can get the same quality of food without the attitude somewhere else.

Will never be returning."}
{"text":"I went to Fabbrica for lunch today and I really enjoyed my meal. I got the wood oven roasted chicken salad with mixed greens, tomato, avocado, pancetta, gorgonzola, chopped egg, and toasted foccacia - it was like a much better version of a Cobb salad! 

However my mom and sister were both disappointed. My sister's tomato and mozzarella salad was made with under-ripe tomatoes and my mom's Insalata di Fabbrica had brown pieces of romaine in it. I would expect better from a restaurant charging their prices! Also their pizza's crust was soft in the middle, as if it hadn't been cooked enough. 

However even though the food isn't great, the service is excellent. Our waitress was very attentive to our table and came back to fill our waters 4-5 times. We were really impressed!

If you're just looking for somewhere to have a decent meal while shopping or on your lunch break, this place will do. But if you're looking for an incredible, authentic Italian meal, I recommend Buca down on King St W!"}
{"text":"Wandering around Shops at Don Mills on a Saturday night. I just want to find a place to chill and a quick dinner alone... 

Joey Don Mills? No Way! There's a wait?!! OK is Saturday night... but is like 6:30 pm.. I thought only grandmothers eats that early! 

Jack Astor... Boo... 

Linda's?? $17 for a pad thai?? Maybe not tonight! 

Fabbrica looks promising as there were no lines and I'll be eyeing it for the longest time.. waitresses all seems wearing black mini skirt uniforms?? 

I got a high table at the bar area, or I should have renamed that kids zone..Seems like Fabbrica are seating all the family with kids in the same area... but why I too seated here?? 

Services was attentive and excellent!! My Margherita Pizza ($16) arrived so fast... Even before I log into Fabbrica WIFI network (ask staffs for password!). The pizza itself has really great flavour and enhanced with the fresh basil. The crust itself though was too soggy, too doughy for my taste. I hate my pizza being burnt but this one tasted like it needs to be in the wood burning oven for a few more minutes!! 

After loading on the carbs on the complementary artisan bread and the pizza itself, I couldn't have dessert and anyway they were out of Goat Cheese Souffle for the night, so I just passed on the dessert! 

I don't think I would come back to Fabbrica for their pizza... but I might try other items on the menu... I might be back? or I might not!"}
{"text":"I went there for a Summerlicious lunch. The decor and the atmosphere were wonderful. It doesn't look big from the outside but they have sitting around the open kitchen. 

The washroom is interesting as you have to figure out which side to go to. The sink can be tricky if you don't look down. 

Happy: The presentation of the dishes were great. Service was alright. The food taste was mediocre. Nothing wow. 
(dessert) - I guess this was the best part as it was light and nice. The almond brittle was a nice touch. 

Not happy:  (appetizer) - Nothing special about the arugula salad. 
(main dish) - The perch fish was deep fried and cut up. The thinly sliced potatoes that were roasted was cold and nothing stood out to me. 

Verdict:  I was still a hungry cat. I could eat more!!! So it might be fine dining, but nothing there wasn't any special ingredients that I couldn't get/buy. The regular menu is too pricey. The atmosphere is great, but I would not go back to this restaurant. Unless you pay for it!!"}
{"text":"What a sad example of a place gone drastically downhill. This Mark McEwan joint used to be a staple for my hubby and I. Close by and great food. The service and experience has gotten SO progressively bad that I am compelled to warn people to stay the \"F\" away. 

Tonight was my last visit. Sat at the bar and waited an hour for food that didn't come. Really really annoying. And no one seemed to give a sh*t. Bartender barely looked our way. And our server was nowhere to be found. 

If I was the GM here, I'd be horrified to know how my customers are being treated. If you're wondering why your sales are down, I'm telling you it's because the service really sucks. 

I will never again be back. Eating at Cineplex now and the staff is on the ball. Not the way I planned my night, for sure. 

Shame on you, Fabbrica."}
{"text":"Previously, I enjoyed my lunch experience at Fabbrica quite a lot, so I wanted to take my friends there for dinner one day to try out more dishes.

I remember really enjoying the bread last time, and this time was no different. The bread was warm and spongy in the center. We asked for some butter in addition to the olive oil and balsamic vinegar, and that butter was really really good. However, it was a little hard to flag down our server.

My boyfriend started with an insalata di Fabbrica with romaine hearts, pancetta, toasted focaccia. From the description, I imagined this to be similar to a Caesar salad. I appreciated that the dressing was tangier and lighter, which made the salad more refreshing than the usual heavy Caesar salad. 

The salad was followed by tortiglioni with oven baked Fabbrica meatball, tomato and buffalo mozzarella. This came out as a stunning casserole of cheese-topped baked pasta, and it smelled amazing! The portion was very generous as well. I enjoyed the pasta, but somehow, it just didn't measure up to how good it looked. Perhaps it wasn't as cheesy as I would have liked it to be. I also wanted more of that crunchy baked crust on the top, and somehow there didn't seem to be enough of that. 

I ordered the fettucine again with crab, guanciale, cream and soft poached egg. I really loved it the first time, and it was just as delicious this time around! The cream and egg yolk were quite rich together, so I was more than happy to share my pasta around the table so I could try other items.

My friend Sandy wasn't feeling too hungry and ordered a beet salad with prosciutto, pistachio and balsamic. This salad was a lot smaller than the insalata di Fabbrica and they were around the same price. I certainly wouldn't have been satisfied with this salad as my main course.

My friend Mel opted for the risotto with carnarolli rice, roasted pumpkin and double smoked bacon. I believe she ordered it because we absolutely loved our butternut squash risotto from Mildred Temple's Kitchen. This version was definitely not as good. The rice, for me, was a little underdone, as I prefer them to be mushier in texture. It also wasn't as creamy as Mildred's risotto, and the pumpkin flavours didn't really come through for me. 

Finally, my friend Mona opted for a polpetta pizza with Fabbrica meatball, cured tomato, onion, and pickled chili. I tried a small corner of the slice, and it was really really tasty. From that bite alone, I almost felt compelled to come back to try their pizza! Unfortunately, the pizza was a little too spicy for my friend, but for someone who can take heat, it was super delicious! 

Although I did enjoy my dinner here, the prices are pretty high. Alas, there just aren't many good Italian restaurants around where I live (Scarborough/Markham area), so my options are pretty limited when I'm craving Italian food. I would go back, but perhaps not anytime soon."}

{"text":"Fabricca is an oasis in the Toronto strip mall, chain restaurant burbs.  It's owned by Mark McEwan, celebrity chef and owner of One, downtown Toronto, which is a destination restaurant.  Same level of detail and excellence exists here. 

Been there before for dinner but went for lunch today. Hip, creative industrial, yet inviting decor, large windows, innovative menu with fresh and freshly prepared ingredients, it's well worth the few extra bucks you'll pay here versus Olive Garden, which isn't even on the same planet as this place. 

Hot delicious breads, wonderful soups, even my vanilla mint ice tea was refreshing.  The salads are nice sized and served on a wood chopping block.  The steak salad and Nonna McEwans raviola (beef, pork veal, tomato and heaps of reggiono) were crowd favorite as was the chocolate torta, but just go to the website and look at the pics and you'll see that this is a serious place.

Excellent, polite and friendly servers enhance the overall experience. it's in a upscale outdoor mall area so leave some time for a stroll afterwards."}
{"text":"I don't know that it's \"old skool\" italian, but it does have a little more to offer than your typical Italian joint: antipasti, salumi (homemade salamis, I think) and contortini (sides) areas of the menu offer some really great options. Homemade bread is soft and delicious with a great crust and wonderful airy holes.

But for me, it was all about the pizza. I've had their Funghi pizza (mushrooms, deliciously fresh mozzarella, and truffle cream) twice now and it's officially an addiction. I have to have it again. Right now.

Tip: Pizzas, though ostensibly \"single serving\", are hugely platter-sized. Better bet is to split a 'za with your dining partner, so you still have room to order up some sides, salami or antipasto to share.

Love that the pizza/bread oven is not just visible from everywhere in the main room but is also turned into a focal point. Servers were prompt and pleasant. Would totally visit again."}
{"text":"Came in on a Saturday night for our 8:00pm reservation and grateful for there valet and coat check services on this blistery winter night.

Our hostess kindly greets us and leads us to our end table in the dining room in front of the pizza oven with wonderful views of chefs hard at work.

Within a minute of being seated our waitress comes over to go over the menu with us and takes our drink orders. Right after a delicious basket of freshly sliced warm right out of the oven bread arrives table side. Just like last time its crunchy exterior and soft chewy interior brings back delicious memories.

Next arrives our super bubbly perfectly chilled glasses of Nino Franco - Prosecco. I remember to remain lady like and not chug back the entire glass of this enticing nectar.

For appetizer we order the Fabbrica meatball - veal, pork, beef, tomato sauce and reggiano. It is Hugeeee! However the delicious combination of meats is juicy and flavourful and the rich tomato sauce beautifully soaks into the house bread which our waitress kindly refills.


For mains we continue the carnivorous theme and order the Porterhouse for two.

Beautifully presented on a wooden platter garnished with roasted garlic and lemon my mouth begins to water as the aroma fills my head. I am thankful its already presliced so I don't have to waste anytime digging in.
Perfectly cooked medium rare, juicy, tender, flavourful I can not fault this meat in any way!

To accompany it we order sides of roasted fingerling potatoes w/ rosemary and garlic &  sauteed rapini w/ garlic and preserved chili. Both are delicious and perfectly cooked and seasoned.

As if we weren't stuffed enough after our hearty dinner, I can not resist browsing a dessert menu and lucky me my favourite flavourful of gelato is featured.

Pistachio Gelato - deep rich flavours of roasted pistachios with the perfect balance of sweet and salt spark my appetite once again. I appreciate that they didn't dye the gelato a vibrant green but left it au naturel! I devour my bowl of gelato in no time.

Fabbrica does it once again! Beautiful and equally delicious well prepared food leaves me overly satisfied. I look forward to another wonderful night out here again!"}
