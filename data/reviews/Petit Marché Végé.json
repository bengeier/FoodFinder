{"text":"The service was excellent and after riding 200km on L'Petit Train Du Nord, the food was the best thing I have ever eaten. We even bought some goodies to take home with us! Delicious!"}
{"text":"A great little gem for good, cheap, vegan Vietnamese food. No frills; just a simple eatery (and market). The menu isn't too expansive, but I found myself wanting to order nearly everything on it so it is expansive enough for me. If I lived in the area, I suspect I'd eat lunch here at least a couple days a week."}
{"text":"After spending one month in Vietnam and having very easily eaten amazing vegetarian Vietnamese food everyday, we were so happy to find this place so close to our home in Montreal. The ladies are friendly and their tofu and seitan are delicious. I only wish there were more seating places and a few more options on the menu, but we realize we are already very lucky just to have this place. Hope they stay in business forever!"}
{"text":"For $4.50, you can have the best vegan banh mi in town--

(I recommend the duck/bbq seitan combo, but the curry is super swell too). 

They use a nice creamy spread that you'll have to opt out of at other joints if you're vegan. I'm not sure you can get this sort of deal anywhere else either, but that's just half of the awesomeness--this place is addictive. 

They also have plenty of supplies for your home cooking needs. I usually grab and go, and have hooked several buds as well. I'm getting hungry typing this so I'm going to make my way over shortly."}
{"text":"This is, hands-down, the BEST vegetarian Pho in the city. It is REALLY hard to find a good vegetarian Pho that has flavour, as well as protein, but THIS place has an amazingly impressive version of the classic original! The unique  broth is super flavourful, and it comes with 4 meat substitutes! In addition, they make a killer home-made hot sauce (chilli and lemon grass base)  to go with it!
It also comes with Shredded cabbage , bean sprouts and mint (not basil), which is a refreshing unique touch. 

I have also had their papaya salad, cold rolls and sandwiches, all of which are packed with flavour and value. 
This place is impressive not only to vegetarians; my meat-eater friends love it too!"}
{"text":"Do you know what Vietnamese Pho is? If so -- please hold that orgasm until the end of this review. If not -- look that shit up like in the Encyclopædia Britannica at your local branch of the municipal public library or look in the Yellow Pages for the number for 411 then call 411 and get the switchboard operator to connect you to the Vietnamese Embassy in Ottawa and ask them or something. Or come here and try it for yourself and then have your own Phorgasm (that is a Pho-induced orgasm by the way and not a fancy way to say fake orgasm) preferably outside of the restaurant if you can wait. 

Vegetarians (and non-vegetarians alike) of Montréal! Take notice! Petit Marché Végé is now going to be your favourite spot around town for all things Vietnamese and vegetarian. Get your vegetarian Pho on hard and kick your vegetarian Bánh mì game up a notch to a whole other level. Discover the wonderful world of vegetarian Vietnamese food!

Pho sho, yo, motherfuckin' Pho Pho sho. And it's not just Pho show either! Seriously, please, Mrs. Jackson, I am Pho reals. Phoget all your worries, Phoget all your cares and come down and zone out on some spicy noodle soup and maybe a Vietnamese submarine sandwich as well. Be Phorwarned! This soup is addictive and it'll have you begging Pho more. Hold the Phone ... did you say Pho? I'm gonna have to stop going to this place so frequently lest they decide to Bánh mì Pho life! That is my only Phobia. Okay, I'll stop now. Phoever. Phoeverever?

As Kermit the Frog says \"it's not easy being green.\" 

Actually, it's pretty easy if green means being vegetarian. It's easy on the environment, it's easy on your body, it's easy on your pocketbook and it's probably easy on your karmic scoresheet, if you believe in that sort of stuff. Although when it comes to Vietnamese cuisine it can be pretty hard as there seems to be a dearth of selection ... especially in the Pho (awesome noodle soup) department. But then, hallelujah, I happened upon Petit Marché Végé and this has changed everything! 

This place is part Vietnamese market and part Vietnamese delicatessen and one hundred percent vegetarian. Even vegan - upon request. This is revolution! Vietnamese vegetarian revolution! Hey hey, L.B.J. how many kids (or cows) have you killed today! Nixon wasn't any better either. Go out, burn your brassieres and burn your draft cards and remember that Vietnam won the war fair and square. Yes comrade, it's all the way back to Ho Chí Minh City for us with red stars on our shoulders and vegetarian food in our stomachs. As Brother Mohamed Ali once said \"I ain't got no quarrel with the Viet Cong ... no Viet Cong ever called me (expletive deleted)\". Are you feeling all \"Apocalypse Now\" and hearing that Buffalo Springfield song yet? \"For what it's worth\" ... By 1976 Communist North Vietnamese forces finally united North and South Vietnam and ended more than a century of combined European and American colonial and imperial hegemony and sent the Franks and the Yanks running with their tails between their legs. How do you say \"good riddance\" in Vietnamese? 

Enough politics! Now we eat. Step into a world of sensuous delights! Vegetarian and Vietnamese delights. If you're starving, order up a large bowl of beautiful hot and spicy Pho. Pho bcok (?àng Ngoài) is the Northern Vietnamese style which is more subtle and nuanced than Pho Sài Gòn which is the Southern version that is spicier and a tad more flavourful but both are absolutely delectable! If you've got a penchant for chillies burning a hole through your tastebuds like I have you'll put aside the Sriracha briefly for the time being and ask specially for the special hot sauce. It is a delicious blast into outer space. If you've got sandwiches on your brain you probably should schedule an appointment with a neurologist. These Vietnamese Bánh mì submarine sandwiches are absolutely scrumptious. They have three versions for you to choose from. My favourite is the curried shiitake mushrooms. There is also an excellent bean curd sub as well as a barbecued tofu sub. Try them all as they are each very very special! Have some green bean pudding or grass jelly for dessert. 

Enjoy Vietnam!"}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place given that I'm not a meat eater and love Pho.  On the plus side, you can get a lot for not too much money.  I thought the spring rolls were tasty, but I was a bit disappointed in the soup.  The broth was decent, but the noodles were plain spaghetti.  I would have liked to have had some more veggies instead of the hunks of mock meat.  I would try this again.  The home cooked dishes look tempting, so I would try one of those on my next trip.  I'm always in search of vegetarian Vietnamese and look forward to exploring the menu in the future."}
{"text":"This place is a Hidden Gem. I mean, it really really is. So unless you look it up beforehand or someone tells you about it, chances are you've walked by it and and never even noticed it or maybe even thought that it was an extention to the hairdresser that's right next door. 

You will be pleasantly shocked to find out that it's not just a little market but a little vegetarian/ vegan Vietnamese Pho restaurant. Perfect for a quick bite, or a quick buy, or lunch, or warm afternoon soup.

Upon entering, you will walk by a few tables and notice that there are a few fridges with some cooking essentions, frozen packaged mock meats (gardein products) and fresh packaged food for sale. 

But the best part is that you can order some typical Vietnamese submarines, and the best Pho soups in town right at the counter! The prices are extremely low, while turning it into a vegan experience but keeping the full pho tradition. 

Now don't forget to get there before 6:00pm if you want to order a hot soup, if not you will only be able to get sandwiches and some leftover cold dishes until they close (that's what happened to me).

Also, don't forget to ask for the yummy cold sweet coconut corn dessert."}
{"text":"The main menu is simple, offering 4 soups, and 4 sandwiches (they also offer a variety of other refrigerated foods, and frozen selections).

I ordered the BBQ Gluten sandwich first, upon recommendation from the lovely staff. They were absolutely right in the suggestion, as that ended up being my favourite. It was so delicious though, that I went back for seconds...and then thirds.

In order of my preference (very hard to decipher as all are delicious): the BBQ Gluten, Bean Curd, Mushroom, and Tofu Curry. All on warm, crisp footlong banquets, all vegan. Each $4 FLAT. (My friend also got the pho, which was a large helping, and also well received. He preferred the sandwiches though.)

Pros: Unreal taste; Great price; Quick & friendly service

Cons: Not really a con, but there is not much seating & it's not a fancy place; You'll want to eat it all and never stop"}
{"text":"Updating with love!! Took a friend here for lunch today as we both love Vietnamese food are trying to eat more vegan. She had a dish with vegan crispy Imperial rolls, noodles, delicious dipping sauce, and I had a vegan Bún Hué. This is my dream dish. I love the spicy broth in a traditional Bún bò Hué and this version is just heaven. Delicious textures and flavours from the seitan and tofu, beautiful broth, bright fresh basil, piles of yummy thick rice noodles just so good. It's so hard to find a delicious Vietnamese place with a vegetarian broth, so I often cheat when I have a craving and this place is closed,  but I think I'm going to make a regular lunch date here instead to get my fix!"}
{"text":"This is a lovely and inexpensive vegan Vietnamese sandwich place. The owners are very friendly. Would def go back."}
