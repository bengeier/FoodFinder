{"text":"I come here to pick up a coffee on the way to catch the bus in the morning once in awhile and the lattes are amazing. I wish they stayed open later on some weeknights though so I could come by and grab a coffee while getting late night work done. But the drinks are great and the staff has been very friendly:) Highly recommend if you're looking for a nice cozy place to get work done."}
{"text":"I am extremely excited about this place.  *Great* music, delicious (and reasonably priced) lunch, a killer latte, and extremely friendly staff.  Not too crowded (yet?)  Best of all, it's the one non-chain restaurant I can walk to during lunch.  So, so happy they are established!  Will be back.  Probably too much."}
{"text":"Four months after opening and this place is still great. The breakfast and lunch specials are a bargain and always tasty. The southwestern salad is a real winner too and very filling with well-seasoned chicken, corn, black beans and a chipotle dressing. Coffee drinks are spot on - I'm a big fan of the cortado - and even the brewed coffee is prepared well. Everyone is still as friendly as when they opened. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Love the food and drinks here, and the workers are always very kind. :) So excited to have a coffee shop at this location."}
{"text":"Nice selection of drinks, yummy food, ample seating with nice ambience and good WiFi. What's not to love? Bonus points for having a local coffee shop back in the area."}
{"text":"How awesome to have a coffee shop conveniently located in the Basset Neighborhood district! There are several positive points to mention about this place: plenty of seating, a variety of beverages to choose from, delicious pastries, lots of natural lighting, and a patio. I encourage anyone in the area to visit this coffee shop (and support your local businesses, of course)!"}
{"text":"Nice little shop with good coffee and pastries. I don't believe the pastries are unique to the shop because I have seen their carrot cake available at other coffee shops (which is unfortunate). 

Adequate amount of tables, solid internet connection, and better than half way decent caffeinated beverages make this a wonderful place to work for the day/study in the Bassett District/Neighborhood."}
{"text":"Really excited this place opened up in my neighborhood. Really good coffee and espresso for very reasonable prices. Good atmosphere - less busy that the State street or capital area places. They have some food, but I haven't tried it yet."}
{"text":"Okay place.  Not the biggest but fine. Food about average priced for amount you get. Had a latte here that was about average."}
{"text":"Great, clean little place. The coffee is done well, staff knowledgeable and internet reliable. 

Little hard to find parking but worth the effort."}
