{"text":"For those that miss this great wing spot. They have moved to 1449 E. Main st. They are in the old capt. D's. The menu is the same! Food is just as awesome. Restaurant is much cleaner and they have a galaga machine, can't go wrong with that."}
{"text":"Wings were dry, flavor was not that great compared to the Wings Express on Main st. Wings were also very small. Overall I will not go to this wing place again."}
{"text":"I checked this place out along my 30 mile ride through Mesa today.  If I were just voting for the wings this place would get a 5/5 stars.  But the truth is the place is a bit run down and the cleanliness to me was a cause for concern.  I won't be dining in here again but I will absolutely order wings for takeout from here any time.  They are delicious!  For a more IN DEPTH REVIEW on Wings Express please visit my foodblog at www.azspicycycler.com.

{"text":"Tried this place for the 1st time and all I can say is wow I was  pleasantly surprised with the wings,don't let the hole in the wall facade fool you the mild wings with ranch pack tons of flavor"}
{"text":"I've been going to this place since I was kid!  If you're looking for good wings but don't want to pay an outrageous price you're at the right place.  The Honey Hot and standard Hot are by far the best.  The only reason for a 4 star is that I think they can improve on their service just a bit.  If you place a phone order it doesn't really matter because they won't start cooking it till you get there.  If you get there and there's a line, you guessed it, you have to wait until it's your turn to pay and have your order started :/ kinda defeats the purpose.  Other than that the place is bomb!"}
{"text":"Honey hot is the bomb baby! Service is top notch as well! I go well out of my way to get wings here."}
{"text":"This place has really good wings and carrots ranch is good too. Potatoes   Skins are a hit or miss there either really good or I ordered them in the past and there rock solid. Cheese sticks are ok and fried zucchini are really good. Not bad for frozen products! But there wings are good! 
Restaurant: Never ate there.  I always get take out. The deco is corny really strong wing sauce smell. It's a wing place what expect!!!! 
Staff: It's a hit or miss!"}
{"text":"Soooo good:) all their sauces are yummy! The wings are excellent, wings express had always been my go to when that wings craving takes hold!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic wings. I love a good chicken wing and for years I've been going to the Native New Yorker and other neighborhood bars. Time and again their wings are not consistent and they have gotten smaller while the price goes up. Wings Express are always fresh, crispy and the sauce is outstanding. I have been here about a dozen times now and the wings have always been awesome. I wish they would open a location in the area with a sports bar. They would give Native a serious run for their money."}
{"text":"Was shorted $4 in food and owner refused to make the rest of the order after I called from home and came back to pick up after being told to do so.  Weekly customer since it was on Broadway before they burnt down spending $25 a week at least and know exactly what I get and should have gotten.  After 5 minutes of run around from the owner who claimed he wasn't but I been going for so long I know exactly who he is, I just walked out with nothing letting him keep the $4 since it was so important to argue over and not honor the food I ordered and paid for and thanked him for the years of food and that I will not be back."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh!! This place has THE BEST honey hot wings! Their fried mushrooms are delicious as well.  Very unassuming from the outside, but please go eat at this place, you will be happy you did."}
{"text":"Love the food but the service sucks.  Called in a order 45 min ago. It's been 20 min since I got here still no food.   At least the employee apologized for the delay!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love their wings! They are perfectly crispy. The flavor is delicious and they are amazingly priced!"}
{"text":"This is the kind of place that looks runs down but that's not a bad thing. Wings are small but tasty and reasonably priced ($6.40 for a pound,  $10 for 1.5 pounds,  $18.15 for 3 pounds, and you only get 1 flavor for those; for a bucket at $34.35 you get 6 orders, with 2 flavors). They come with nice, crisp carrots, but ranch is extra (. 40 for a small, $1.60 for large). They also have burgers, Order ahead for faster service."}
{"text":"Yess these wings have been my long time favorite! There is something about the way they are cooked and their distinct flavor that can't compare!

Great service is a hit or miss but whatever as long as my wings taste good, I don't care. The place is always clean and there is always people eating there. Prices are reasonable. 

Extra ranch is like 50 cents for a little one and they charge for refills now. 

They are nice to homeless people which is nice to see. I saw two walk in and grab water with ice as it was so hot outside. 

All in all I will always come here for wings when I am in the area."}
{"text":"Best wings in east Mesa I also love their fried mushrooms and gyro sandwich. We mix it up when we go. The honey BBQ wings are good too. Next time your looking to eat some wings try the place out."}
{"text":"Amazing place. Have been going here forever and love their honey hot. Stop in if you love some good hot wings."}
{"text":"Have been coming to wings express for 15+ years and LOVE their food. Best wings in town in my opinion.

The problem is that recently they have stopped fulfilling my requests to get all wings (hate drumsticks). I don't understand this as for most customers the drumstick is the more desirable item. 

Unless Wings Express changes their ways and starts making my wings how I want them again, I will NOT order from them any longer. And that really bums me out because I love their food.

Get it together Wings Express."}
{"text":"First time coming here and I ask for all flats and the lady in the front was less then professional and told me no I can't do that. More like they won't do it I would never come back to this business again"}
{"text":"Best place for Wings! I love picking up Wings from here for party, football games, or any occasion The medium and hot are my favorite but they have all flavors from honey hot, bbq, and regular. They are traditional type wings dont expect boneless or anything fancy. This a dive so if you plan on eating in, dont get your hopes up. Location is an old Long John Silvers and feels like a Filibertos inside. But remember looks can be deceiving, get your food to go and enjoy, other good sides are onion rings and potato skins."}
{"text":"I love there wings !! I highly  recommend  this place if you like hot wings ..honey hot would be my favorite. ..though"}
{"text":"Very difficult to say exactly what is my favorite. You have to stop in and try a-bit of everything!"}
{"text":"I am addicted to wings. I eat them
Once or twice a week and have eaten them  all over the valley. I have to say these are probably the best wings I've ever had. I love hot wings, but the honey hot here far surpasses the hot. They're crispy, but not overly so, and the sauce is crazy good. I've never eaten in the restaurant, because I always take them to go..but don't be fooled by the hole in the wall appearance. These are amazing wings!"}
{"text":"Okay if you are looking for just good wings at a decent price 5 stars.

But that's never all... the prices are fine for wings but the fries are stale and plain, taste pre-frozen. The ranch is over priced and who doesn't like ranch with their wings!
We got the honey hot. We would have loved to mix the few flavors they have but nope. They don't allow that, you have to do one flavor per order so if you would like multiple flavors it will cost more... also they have self serve drinks but charge for refills... HA OKAY! 

This place is a scam lol but the wings are very good!

overall we will be going back but it will be only for the wings and nothing else!"}
{"text":"Best Wings from East Coast to West Coast! I was in the Military and traveled a lot so I've eating at quite a few places and these wings are amazing !! The only place that comes close is Bojangles in Norfolk, Virginia. Another thing is the prices are really reasonable."}
{"text":"Awesome wings! 

My buddy and I always stock up here when we know it's going to be a party night. 

The honey hot is great and the ranch dressing that goes with it is perfect. The prices seem reasonable for what you get and I like the style of the wings -- they are small and have plenty of sauce (you pay by weight, not by the wing so no-fear that they are small). 

There are always lots of people eating there or picking up orders. Haven't tried anything but wings so can't comment there. Don't know why you'd get anything but wings from here though!"}
{"text":"The wife and I decided to give it a shot tonight instead of going to Native New Yorker (Native Bar and Grill) which is our normal wing place.  This place is located in an old Long John Silvers restaurant.  The sauces could not be split on all the orders which is a bummer.  We ordered Medium and Honey Hot to go.

The medium wings had a funny smell to them.  It wasn't horrible but it was strange.  I can't quite place what the smell is with them.  My wife and I both agreed that these weren't terrible wings and we didn't hate the place but Native is much better.  I don't believe we'll be returning and I think we're probably going to toss the remaining wings that we didn't eat.  Some of the wings were crispy and some were not so crispy.  I was definitely expecting them to be a lot crispier based on some of the other reviews.  I was also expecting the wings to be huge but they were just average in size.  

I won't say don't go here but I would suggest if you are looking for wings go try Native and you'll have a much more enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"Beat wings I have ever had! They are crisp to perfection! It is really hard to find wings that aren't soggy or the fat and skin is gross. 

Perfect flavors. Cooked with excellence. 
Try the hot for traditional wing sauce or the honey hot. So good!"}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE THEIR WINGS!!! this place is the best hands down!!! If you want wings done right?! Eat here!!! Our favorite is the honey hot wings!!! Yumm! We get wings almost every week from this spot!"}
{"text":"Wings are decent, but far from the best... B-dubs are certainly better, however for the price it's not bad, I'm not sure if I'd return for the simple fact that you can't choose more than once sauce unless you make a massive order."}
{"text":"Stopped by today with my sis for some much needed wings and cheese (mozzarella) sticks!

It's a stand alone building which was awesome, parking was spacious, and they have a drive through! We parked and went inside though, clean place, big windows to look outside when eating, and a TV that was playing the game while we waited for our food. The cashier took our orders, although it was kind of hard to hear what he was saying (maybe he just didn't have his cup of joe yet...) but overall, the food was great like everyone has said before me!

When I'm around Mesa again, I'll deffinitly stop here to get my wing fix again!"}
{"text":"This place is so hit or miss! While the employees here provide good customer service the food is just mediocre. I had honey hot wings that taste as if they were double cook with the second round dipped and so called fried. The other wings were were hot wings which had not a drop of heat to them. I have a LO who took a bite and they did not bother her.
I would have liked fries but was told they had none on hand. Now I found that interesting with smart and final, Sam's Club and Costco all opened. 
The cheeseburger looked delicious but I warn you looks are deceiving! This was the most flavorless piece of meat I've ever had. The tomato was as thick the patty just not ripe. 
Maybe the growing menu has made this Wings place loose site of its core values and flavor!"}
{"text":"Well. Let's just say I love these wings and come
Here often. I dislike that they charge for a refill. I hope they change that. Outstanding wings tho. Love em. Service is great"}
{"text":"I love the wings here but the service is always so Slow! I call my order in so that I don't have to wait 20 min for my food and they never have it made... On top of that back in my day I paid $4.25 for a dozen wings, I get prices have changed, but now I am paying $7.95 for approximately 1lb of wings?? Approx? Seriously? And $2.00 for ranch? Who doesn't like ranch with wings?! But for $2.00?! I feel
Robbed."}
{"text":"I've know about this place for some time but never thought to stop in. My co- worker and good friend stopped by one day after work and i've been hooked ever since... Even has the family hooked, wings are great, great sandwiches, great sides, just great all around. A must try!"}
{"text":"Just went there and placed an order. When I went to pay with my DEBIT MASTERCARD. I was asked, \"what's you bank?\" Kind of an odd question, but I told the lady 1st Convenience Bank. She then told me, \"Oh, I'm sorry we don't except that bank.\"

Since when was a business able deny the use of certain banking institutions.

Won't be going back to this place again. I loved there wings too. Guess I will become a frequent buyer at long Wong's on Stapley or Native Grill on Gilbert when I have a craving for wings."}
{"text":"Waited an hour to receive our meal. We were number 35 and they served out to number 40. They kept telling us that it should be out soon. Ended up refunding our money and went somewhere else."}
{"text":"This location gets no stars horrible customer service  they are rude as hell in there. Food was over cooked to where the wings were hard and shrink up so small  never going to this one again which is sad cause it's across the street"}
{"text":"These wings were delicious and crispy! We ordered the honey hot and they had great flavor. We got the order and a half for $10. The wing count came to 18. That's a great price for the amount of wings! We will most definitely come back here again and will recommend this place to our family and friends."}
{"text":"Do not judge this place by its shabby location and exterior.  The wings are seriously some of the best this location has to offer.  Perfectly crispy, without being dry, and deliciously flavored.  The fried mushrooms are really good too, and they give you a decent amount.  The prices are reasonable.  I'd totally recommend ordering take out if you're ever craving yummy wings."}
{"text":"The best wings in Mesa. The honey hot wings are addictive. Great onion rings. Clean place with a friendly staff. Always kind, great service, great food."}
{"text":"I eat at this place maybe 2-3 a week! I am die hard wing fan and these are the best i have had ever!!! They are crispy, flavorful and warm all the time! Best part is they charge by the pound not per wing! So for a  great wing and a great price try wings express!!"}
{"text":"My fav place for wings! No other palce can do Honey Hot like they do! They are nice and crispy and juicy! It may sound odd, but they have the best egg rolls, you are missing out if you have yet to try them!"}
{"text":"I've tried many other wing restaurants here in Arizona and in other states and I can say this is still by far the best chicken wing I've had"}
{"text":"A friend ordered a bucket of the medium wings for a get together. SO GOOD! They have the perfect amount of flavor without burning your face off. They are crispy, rather then soggy and nasty like some other joints. There is no excuse for soggy wings. The bucket fed 4 adults and 2 kids (along with pizza) and we had an entire container still left after everyone was done. The price is kind of steep -- around 38.00 for bucket & large ranch, but it was really worth every penny."}
{"text":"I have been coming to wings express since around 1997. Football night at my parents house always included the honey hot and the medium. 

To describe the wings; they are short boned crispy and so tender on the inside to eat them is comparable to the feeling you get of hitting home runs in a row. 

I might even do a glass shot of the honey hot its that good."}
{"text":"When a restaurant says \"best wings in the world\" I usually just smile. But these wing ARE really the best. The restaurant it's self isn't big or any type of fancy but who wants to be when you're Grubbing on some good chicken."}
{"text":"Wings are small but if you like a crispy wing this is your place.  I get the honey hot and they are excellent."}
{"text":"Very disappointed!!! Wings are my and my lil man's favorite food. I called up like I usually do and put my order in. We'll when I asked to put 6 plain wings on the side it was a BFD! The owner Sam even called me a liar.#BESTFOODHORRIBLESERVICE"}
{"text":"Honey hot is fantastic. Deffinetly recommend them. Medium is pretty mild. They are great too."}
