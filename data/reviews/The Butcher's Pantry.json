{"text":"Must get the burnt end sandwich! !!! Amazing cuts of meat not found anywhere else!  They have a great selection of gluten free options for those of you with seliac."}
{"text":"A wonderful hidden gem. You would never think to head down this street. I actually saw a Yelp suggestion and decided to give it a try. I'm glad I did. Now all I'm thinking about is what to try next."}
{"text":"Wow! The spicy beef tacos are amazing!  A little sloppy, I mention that only to forewarn you that you'll need a few napkins :) - not as a complaint, but so delicious.  What a nice selection of meats and wine too.  Picked up a bottle of reasonably priced wine and some of their smoked wings to try tonight."}
{"text":"Their sandwiches are the absolute best! Great for lunch! Plus the owner was so nice. He greets you personally as you come in. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Wow! Wow! The burgers here are beyond fantastic. I've never had such a juicy and delicious burger.  I would choose a burger from Butcher's Pantry over a rib eye steak."}
{"text":"Taken here by a coworker and was pleasantly surprised.  Portions were just right and top notch flavor.  The deli/restaurant setup is perfect. Just enough space for both.  The service was great as well.  Definitely a place to go every few weeks."}
{"text":"Have totally missed this place and it's been here for a year..... wow. Feel a bit silly. What a great little butcher set in a cute little strip in Solon. The place smells so good and I basically smell like a smoker now that I am at home. They have an excellent selection of meats and wine and all sorts of little food items- pasta sauce, rolls, spices... etc. I left with some lamb sausage and kielbasa and also some coffee maple bacon. Yum. Can't wait to cook this for dinner. Also,  you can eat in for lunch as they have a great dining section. They are reasonably priced and competitive actually. Has that artisan vibe and great music and all of it.  Will definitely go and take my kids for lunch as it looked and smelled so good. The people who own it  and work there are super helpful  and we're eager to answer all of my questions concerning pork belly- a sign of an expert in my opinion."}
{"text":"Awesome place!! I came here for lunch on a Monday and it was quiet. They do not have a big menu for lunch but the have a good variety. I got the spicy barbacoa tacos (3) and my dad got the pulled pork sandwich. We both had a side of potato salad - it was good but it could have used some salt and pepper. The tacos were delicious but are quite spicy, they toast the tortilla which was a great addition. The pulled pork sandwich was very good, it has a really nice taste and the bread doesn't fall apart while you eat it!   I am so glad that this place is in Solon, they have a quality butcher section as well as a wide wine selection and a few choices of beer. Hopefully, this place becomes even more well known than it already has!"}
{"text":"This place is a Hidden Gem. Is it an awesome lunch place that's masquerading as a butcher shop?  Or is it the other way around? The brisket was out of this world, and I even had a side of brussel sprout slaw."}
{"text":"The brisket was fantastic.  It was worth the 25 min drive from Cleveland.  They also have a great seasonal beer selection.  I'm looking forward to coming here again."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place. I really did. Ordered a pound of the brisket to go and was sorely disappointed and out 18 bucks. I'm on board with the ethos and the presentation, but man was the actual meat terrible. The brisket had the tenderness of beef jerky, was devoid of flavor and seemed to be missing the fat that helps with both of those things. Even the ends were bad-- how you get bad ends on brisket is beyond me. I will absolutely give it another shot (it's close, its practical, maybe I caught them on an off day), but the brisket will not be a part of my order."}
{"text":"Fantastic place for booze and meat. If you're looking for take out in around this part of town, look no further."}
{"text":"I got sandwich here for lunch. Portion was big. Beef  brisket was smoky and very juicy. Will definitely try it again"}
{"text":"Thanks to Lauren K for the recommendation for The Butcher's Pantry.  The place is not what you'd expect from a butcher shop.  Definitely a cool vibe going on here.  Great wine and beer selection, excellent sandwich menu with house smoked meats and fresh ingredients.  We're planning on having a prime rib for Christmas and their grass fed beef will fit the bill perfectly.  They sell 1/4 to full cattle butchered to your request.  Easy access off of SR 422 in Solon.  Very friendly owner and staff doing their version of locally sourced low radius food.  Go visit, I'm sure you'll love the place."}
{"text":"We had a good time here for lunch. Very cute decor-would never expect what's inside from the exterior. Beautiful & lots of space in there. Feels like it needs some filling in and to really decide what it's purpose is but you can tell they are working on that and trying things out to find what people want.  As far as food goes-the burger was GREAT, might prefer bacon instead of pulled pork though! The brisket was juicy and delicious-except my cut had a lot of fat on  it unfortunately but the other parts were great & the BBQ sauce was tasty! The sides made me sad-baked beans could have been cooked more and the green beans were just sitting in a large amount of juice and kinda rubbery. The Hawaiian BBQ chips they offer with the sandwiches were delish!  Bottom Line: I'll return to try other items for lunch to see what else is good but probably won't find myself purchasing any grocery items. If I were someone who cooked meat at home-the cuts looked great so come check them out for your butcher needs! Also people were in there buying wine & they had a large selection, so they might be a good place for that too! I'll update when I go back, I left hungry but I'm eager to try again!"}
{"text":"I bought some St Louis ribs for the grill and they were amazing!  The cut of meat matters as much as where you buy it.... Go to the Butchers Pantry!!!"}
{"text":"The Butcher's Pantry is one of the best places to grab lunch in Solon. Brisket, pulled pork, burger, potato salad - all delicious. BUT, my absolute favorite item on the menu is the Veggie Burger. It might feel wrong to order a veggie burger at a butcher shop, but these guy know their way around black beans and sweet potatoes. This Veggie Burger is the best veggie burger of all the veggie burgers. So please fight your urge to order the Barbacoa Tacos, as delicious as that might sound.   Keep up the good work, guys."}
{"text":"Butcher's Pantry has slowly become the spot for lunch! The owner is genuine and friendly and will help in the process of ordering a meal, especially if you're indecisive. The food is so fresh and the portion size is decent. I love looking at their wine selection and the low key feel of the place!"}
{"text":"Tried the smash burger and to say the least it was AMAZING! Sorry no photo this time we ate it too fast. Would highly recommend and bonus you can grab some fresh meat, wine and beer to take home on your way out.   Great concept and execution."}
{"text":"Being a foodie and wanting the freshest tastiest food it's hard to find a place that helps you create amazing meals at home. The cuts of meats you get here are similar that my mom use to get. You can order your select cuts on Monday and have your order cut perfectly that afternoon. Or go in and select the multitude of beef or pork. I would like to see veal and lamb in the future.   If you want a meal on the go for lunch or dinner, get there early because his select dishes sell out. The smoked Brisket is my favorite along with the turkey sandwich.   If you stop in you will not be upset. Oh wait take home a pound of bacon you will not be upset."}
{"text":"Best porkchops we've had in our entire lives...seriously!  Got 3 huge bone-in chops and we cooked them on the grill.  Can't wait to try some of their other meats. Sandwich menu varies each day depending on whats in stock or just smoked.  A number of choices and they all sound wonderful.  Nice varieties of wines that will expand over time. More sparkling wines, please!  Some interesting sides, roast carrots and gourmet mac n cheese topped with pulled meat. Welcome to Solon and I hope you do very well."}
{"text":"Half chicken is enough for a meal. The chicken had been brined flavorfully. Its completely moist and juicy.  Briskets are 3 slices of tender fatty beef.  The sweet potato is sweet but crunchy. What's causing the crunchiness? Is it celery? My brain didn't have time to analyze.  Pull pork was flavorful and not dry.  They excel at animal protein, no doubt about it. This  little gem has become our new favorite. It's quick and good eats.  No high chair for toddlers, so bring your stroller with tray.   There's a kids activity area up front to keep the little ones occupied while moms savor the caveman diet."}
{"text":"always happy to do business here. cleaner than most butcheries i've been to, proud regular of this spot."}
{"text":"The Butcher's Pantry RULES. There's no reason you all shouldn't be shopping there right now. This is the foodie-wino paradise of the suburbs.   Tucked in the plaza on Station Street, this place just gives you all the feels when you walk in. The vibe is really animated and hip, and you just want to look at everything. The place is so enticing, that you're going to feel like you could apply for Top Chef like, tomorrow. In addition to being a butcher's shop, they're also a small grocery stop for all your meat accoutrement needs.  These butchers know what they're doing. Not only can you buy meats to take home, but they have a sophisticated menu that's available all the time. You can grab a sandwich to go or sit and enjoy in their small caf√© area. They also have a cooler of drinks and an extensive list of sides. They were out of the mac and cheese when I was there, which makes me sad, but the sweet potato salad was just as delicious. The brisket sandwich was to die for. The meat literally melted in your mouth, and this is undoubtedly a new lunch/dinner spot for me.  They also have a really lovely selection of local beers and wines. They even do wine tastings, which i'm excited to come back for! Overall, a brisket sandwich, a side salad, and two high quality wines was $40. In my opinion, total steal. Five stars, without question! Time to set your bookmark, Yelpers!"}
{"text":"Best lunch in Solon (maybe Cleveland). The brisket and pulled pork are by far the best I've ever had.  As a butcher retailer these guys rock. They have great quality meats and are very willing to assist/advise in prep (I.e. smoking a pork shoulder or brisket).  Great place!"}
{"text":"I was looking for a delicious lunch and decided that a freshly made quality sandwich made at a butcher's pantry would be great. My first impression after walking in was that if the food was as good as the smell, I would be in for a treat. I struggled to decide which sandwich to try because all of the listed items sounded delicious. Eventually my hunger led me to decide on the Turkey Club with Maple smoked turkey, bacon and tomato jam on warm sourdough bread. Yes, it was very bit as good as it sounds! My one regret is that I may never get to try every item on the menu because I'm sure each would be just as delicious as the one I selected. For now I will hope that my travels will bring me back for another yummy lunch here."}
{"text":"Amazing little shop with delicious food and tons of wine to take home! Definitely a must try spot for anyone looking to satisfy a bbq craving."}
{"text":"We were in town for business and were looking for a great place for lunch.  We found the Butchers Pantry and couldn't have been more impressed.  This is first, a high quality butcher shop with a small store but also a hidden sandwich and taco joint.  Small tables, excellent service and smoked meats to die for.  We even took our instructors here on our last day because they had never heard of it.  This will be their new local go too lunch stop.  The sandwiches were delicious, the tacos stupendous!  Very small menu written on butcher paper on the wall to the left as you walk in.  Order at the register or call in and pick it up to go.  They had \"ready to go\" smoked chickens and other goodies in the meat case but we were traveling so that want going to work.   If your anywhere near Solon OH, give these folks a try.  You'll be thanking me!"}
{"text":"The sign at the entrance says meat and wine.  They aren't kidding!  There are a variety of sandwiches from which we choose brisket and pulled pork. The meat portions were generous and tasty.  Sandwiches come with kettle chips.  The only issue is the tables were not clean and when we requested it be washed,  they just wiped it and didn't wash it off.  The food is top notch though."}
{"text":"The Butcher's Pantry thinks it's a butcher shop - and it is a fantastic one - but more importantly, The Butcher's Pantry is beginning to realize that there is a definite need in Solon for great, locally owned restaurants and is quickly becoming one of them!  The owner, Taylor Steinhoff, and his staff provide exceptional service and go out of their way to help their patrons understand the various characteristics of the meat they buy. On multiple occasions he has taken the time to pull out various cuts of meat and hold them - as if he is trying to articulate the animal back together - to show how they relate to each other and give a better sense of what I am buying. They have answered questions about the difference between grain and grass fed beef. They have even let customers join them in the back to observe and learn more about their process of cutting the actual meat the customer would then purchase.  They clearly are passionate about the work they do and truly want their patrons to understand what they are buying.   They offer many different cuts of local, grass-fed beef and grain-fed beef as well as local pork. They also offer high quality ingredients needed to prepare the meat as well as many accoutrements to serve with the meal.   I could stop here and this would be a 5-star review, however, like I mentioned, what really sets them apart and keeps me checking-in week after week is the fact that they take all of the passion they have for the meat and combine it with their in-house chef to prepare some of the best barbeque I have ever had.  Every day they use their smoker to prepare a selection of various meats and vegetables such as brisket, pulled pork, pork belly, turkey, barbacoa, polish sausage, italian sausage, beets and many more - those are just the items I have tried! They actively post on their social media accounts to inform the world on what items they will prepare that day and create deliciously inspired sandwiches and BBQ trays until they run out! They also prepare various side dishes that are a perfect accompaniment to the main dish.  If you are a fan of really good sandwiches or really good meat I highly recommend that you give The Butcher's Pantry a try on your next lunch break. They truly provide one of the best meals you can get in Solon."}
{"text":"I visited this place at lunch time with my coworkers.  I am not much of a meat eater but I do recognize this place is great.  The ambiance is very modern chic.  The staff was quite knowledgeable about meat and different cuts.  I would definitely return for my butcher needs."}
{"text":"This little gem of a place has been in Solon for about 8 months now and I just discovered it this past week! I am not a big meat person at all so when some co workers and I were going to lunch, I ensured that they had a black bean burger!  It was not any black bean though because it was a back bean sweet potato burger and it was delicious! I have never had anything like that.  You could definitely taste the sweet potato and it was piled with chipotle mayo, homemade pickles and bib lettuce.  All sandwiches are served with kettle chips or you can upgrade to another side for an extra $3.00.  I stuck with the chips this time.  For $10, it was a solid sandwich and something I would go back and get.  For all you meat lovers, everyone else in my group got meat and said it was really great.  They smoke and curate  their own meats and this is evident by the small when you walk in.  The menu changes and is listed on the wall when you walk in.  You are also able to buy all different cuts of meat to take home.  They also  have a large wine selection if you are wanting to buy a bottle to share there or take home."}
{"text":"Wow, the food here is fantastic!  We had heard great things about this place and decided to give it a try today.  Wow!  Great, melt in your mouth, smoked meats.  The sammies were fantastic.  Give it a shot; you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This was a great find while driving through the area.  Amazing Butcher shop.  Delicious Veggie Burger & Turkey Club on our stop.  I had a light grapefruit soda, my guy grabbed a craft beer.  If you get the chance stop in you will be glad you did."}
{"text":"This has become a favorite lunch destination for my friends and me. The staff is always polite and food is always very good. We have even ordered meals in for fairly large groups. Their standard menu items are always good and their special sandwiches that vary from week to week delicious and often inventive."}
{"text":"One word comes to mind when thinking this place, wow. Just walked near this place, you can smell the bbq calling you into meat heaven. The chorizo tacos phenomenal. As i wright this, my mouth salivates with memory of  mouth happiness. They also have an excellent wine selection here, i did not want to leave this place. The brisket was spectacular too. Will be here again, for sure."}
{"text":"I decided to stop in to check out The Butchers Pantry based on a recent magazine article. I stayed for a bite to eat and had their tacos. Hughe portion and tasted fantastic! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Thanks for the Father's Day steaks.  We'll definitely be back for more.  The set up: butcher shop, wine store, lunch spot.  The Butcher's Pantry is the exact shop that the south east side didn't know they needed.  I know your routine.  You decide it's steak night, so you run to Heinen's or Giant Eagle or Sam's Club / Costco, pick the steaks up with the rest of your groceries.  You like the convenience of the one stop shop.  What I'm asking you to do is experience something different.  Getting your steaks at the big box is like having a roofer install your kitchen cabinets...I mean sure they can do it, but why not get someone that specializes in it?  Specifically grass fed, antibiotic free beef.  We ended up selecting 4 strip steaks.  The unfortunate predicament is that the selection is smaller at the Butcher's Pantry.  We originally asked for ribeye, but they were out for the day.  They did have T-Bones (monster T-Bones) and the strip steaks.  Seasoned with salt and pepper and garlic powder at home.  Grilled to medium, medium-rare.  Magnificent.  Tender.  Best I've had.  The Butcher's Pantry also offers sandwiches and tacos, along with potato chips and cold beer!! We got the turkey club, not knowing what to expect, and loved it.  It had thick, tender turkey, not the shaved I've come to expect.  It is served in the same paper wrap as the the steaks.  My only complaint is that they can improve the presentation.  The sandwich was perfectly greasy, but even more so from the protective wrap.  Beers on tap were ice cold and feature a relatively local selection from Mad Tree.  They also offer selections for processing a whole/half cow or pig for your home freezer."}
{"text":"This is a great place to buy meats and to get sandwiches. It reminds me of a Texas bar-b-que and a great selections of steaks and other meats. So glad this is less than 2 miles from my work."}
{"text":"I can't believe it's taken me so long to review this delish shop which is just down the road from my 9-5. Thank you Jeebus for answering my meaty lunch prayers.  Taylor treats each of his guests with such a welcoming and attentive nature, which is truly empowering considering how busy they can be sometimes during the lunch hour. Their smorgasbord of wine makes me really happy but almost tempts my Friday afternoon urges...lol. Just grab a bottle for when your work day is over! (And look forward to it for the next 5 hours ;)) They hosted a fantastic wine tasting and work out with Barre 5 once and it was very educational, and honestly you didn't feel too bad about the wine after the intense burning of calories that class put us through. Whew. Boot camp to a whole new level. It should be called \"Shake it til you Make it\" - my muscles were on fire.  Moving onnnnn... most recently I switched things up and tried the spicy barbacoa tacos (I usually stick to the Cuban) - oh my gooooodness you guys. If you wanna provide some for real natural adrenaline to the rest of your day, grab some of these marinated tender tacos! My friend who is Gluten Free tried their new shells which were made of spinach and plantain... they looked deeeeelish! Another homerun on the lunch break. Way to be, Butcher's Pantch! I'm really trying to stretch the bounds of my abbreving game. It could work! But on the real... these dudes work hard and it certainly shows. Our whole office is in a tizzy. Please support local and stuff your face with the tender meats your body needs. Unless you're vegetarian or vegan of course, and then try the veggie burger. Never fear, all food needs have a solution here! I'm a poet who's not afraid to show it... sorry, don't mind my corniness."}
{"text":"I've heard great things about this place, so decided to try it out. I'm really glad I did. I had the meat tray with turkey, pulled pork and green beans. The meat was incredible, super tender and the BBQ was great too. Cool atmosphere and they have a nice wine and beer selection if you're into that. I'll definitely be back and I'll definitely tell my friends!"}
