{"text":"Alright cheap quick lunch, my initial review a bit to focused on how cheap it is but it's nothing amazing but fills you up."}
{"text":"Decent food for the price. I recommend ordering off of Ritual as the line can get quite long.  I believe the place will satisfy most people who are craving Thai food but, it is more Chinese styled. I ordered the two-items plate/box a couple of times and they give you a decent amount of protein and veggies but will stuff a large amount of noodles (they call pad thai) and rice.  Overall, it is a good place for a food court and the price is the sweetener."}
{"text":"honestly the best thai&viet food for the best bang for your buck in the city core hands-down!!the beef brisket is to die for!!! the line up is long but its well worth the wait fast & great customer service!!! ive been to green curry so many times and have never encountered a dull dish always fresh \"2 thumbs up\""}
{"text":"Okay, I normally would not take the time to review a food court stop, but since Yelp was what lead me here (I was craving Thai food, saw the very good reviews for this place and made the short trek from work) I feel I must offer some insight for future patrons like me. I normally bring my lunch and if I don't I don't normally eat at food courts. Perhaps as far as food courts go this place is phenomenal. But compared to real life... um, no.  The positives are that the women working there were very friendly and I was pleasantly surprised that the dishes were actually quite spicy and had a very good flavour. The price was amazing - it came to $9 for 3 options plus noodles. And the amount of food piled into my dish was alarming - my weak little arm actually ached from carrying it back to my office.   Some of what I consider negatives overlap with what could be considered positives. Let me preface this by saying I am a huge pig who will eat whatever is in front of me until I want to barf. Yet I was only able to finish 1/4 of this meal before feeling repulsively stuffed. What I consider to be wrong with this is the simple economics of food. Spending $9 on takeout food should not provide me with four meals. I know what meat and vegetables cost. Add in the need to pay staff and make a profit and I am concerned at what the quality of this food must be if I can be served 12 pounds of chicken and noodles for $9.   Which leads me directly to the quality of the food. I have worked in chicken-centric restaurants and cooked many a poultry dish in my life. Yet I am still perplexed as to what parts of the chicken are stewing in my Styrofoam tray. The two white meat curries consist of rubbery, thin pieces of boiled-like chicken akin to what I would deem too low grade to feed my cat. The one dark meat dish is possibly not chicken. It's possibly a new species of animal discovered and kept secret by the chefs at Green Curry. An animal made up mostly of gristle, fat and rubbery bits. I have deemed it inedible and am throwing it in the garbage. Chicken aside, while the sauce on the noodles is quite delicious, the noodles resemble spaghetti that has been cut up for a child. It tastes good but it would be hard to argue for its quality.  Basically, if you are someone who does not care about your health or sodium intake, wants quantity over quality, and enjoys a great bargain over a culinary experience, then based on the flavour of the curry dishes and noodles (spicy noodles, red, green and golden chicken curry) and price I would recommend it. If, like me, you would rather maybe spend a bit more on a smaller portion but get quality ingredients you can feel okay about eating, eating here will only leave you with feelings of regret and terrible stabbing pains in your stomach. This is going to be an uncomfortable afternoon and I may have to undo my pants at my desk.    Also, there was no line when I went at 1:30pm - just one dude ahead of me."}
{"text":"My new favourite spot to get lunch. I like the 3 side combo and I usually go with the beef briskest. The taste is pretty good for food court and the portion is big for the price you pay. I would say the portion is 1.5 larger than what you usually get for the price. It's good enough for 2 meals for some people."}
{"text":"I stopped by at lunch today. Unlike other reviewers, I thought the food was just subpar. Typical food court Chinese food. I ordered their daily special - golden chicken curry. Their daily specials come with a mango salad, rice or noodles, the curry, spring roll and soda or soup. Despite being told the noodles and curry were spicy, they were quite mild. The noodles and curry were just subpar food court food. But their mango salad was to die for. The best part of the meal for sure. As other reviewed mentioned, you get a substantial amount of food which is enough for 2-3 people. The daily special was 7.99 plus tax so reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Where to begin... THIS IS NOT THAI FOOD... Yeah, that's the beginning. The \"food\" at Green Curry is imitation Vietnamese for the most part. I ate there regardless of that obvious issue because I was hungry and even though I had a hankering for Thai, Vietnamese sounded good... BIG mistake.   My BBQ Chicken vermicelli bowl was terrible. The spring roll was limp, the chicken had 2 nice big knots of cartilage (knee and hip), the noodles where overcooked white spaghetti and it was SWIMMING... no, DROWNING in sauce. Thin, over-salted, sweet sauce that overpowered every other flavour... I was left with at least 2 cups of juice in the bowl after eating some of it.   It was edible, but I'd never go back. I don't understand how this place is in business, let alone how it's received any high ratings... Yuck."}
{"text":"I recently came here again and they stopped the two-noodle option! Can no longer do half-half with the noodle/rice sides. Also, the ladies behind the counter were not so friendly this time around, and frowned quite a bit. Sad! I really liked this place."}
{"text":"This place always has a long line-up during lunchtime, but there is no wonder as to why! They have a huge selection of food at dece prices. I usually get the small portion for $5.03, which is pretty filling. You get to choose either rice or noodles, plus one side. For me, I like to get the brown rice and mushroom tofu."}
{"text":"I buy lunch about once a week. Ever since I've discovered Green Curry, I've only gotten my weekly lunches from there. It's good food at a steal compared to the surrounding chain stores in the food court. It also offers up some comforting, relatively healthy alternatives when I'm sick of choosing between a a mixture of greasy meats for $9 or a cold salad for $11.   The seafood noodle is my go-to. For $1 extra, I add extra veggies and now I have a warm, comforting, healthy lunch. I've also tried getting their two-item combo. Like other fast-food restaurants, you choose two meat/veggie accompaniments with a generous helping of rice or noodles. At Green Curry, you can substitute rice or noodles with mango salad (which you have to ask for). I love this option, as I usually get way too full with rice or noodles.   In the morning, they serve ham and macaroni, a classic Hong Kong meal but with a twist. I was so excited to find a place in a downtown Toronto food court that would have this (and at only $3!!). It also comes with HK milk tea by default, unless you ask for something else. There's nothing better when you're feeling a bit under the weather but really want something warm for breakfast.   I honestly think this is the place to go if you are looking for great food at an even greater price. The line ups are long during lunch (understandably) but they move quickly. I don't think anything else can really compare."}
{"text":"Taste: 2 Appearance: 2 Value: 2 Service: 3 Overall: 2.25 rounded down to 2  Hi and welcome to today's episode of javing it with Javier. Let's see what we are having today. I had the pad Thai with sesame chicken and mixed vegetables.  For takeout, the appearance looks pretty bad. Trying out the noodles they turn out to be bland and unfavourable. The sesame chicken taste was mediocre but they were soggy making it worse. No additional comments for the mixed vegetables.   In terms of value, the cost was $9 which I consider quite expensive for takeout Chinese food.   The service was average and probably the best part of this experience; Which I find incredibly ironic as I don't come to a food place for service.  Overall, there is a lot to be desired after a meal from here. I would not recommend this place to anybody. And that's it for today's episode of javing it with Javier. And remember food is life."}
{"text":"It had the longest line among all the food outlets in the food court across the street from the intercontinental hotel (in the basement).  Just as described by the other  yelper, this place was a surprise with tasty food and great noodle soups.   The price was also good and definitely worth a visit if you're nearby."}
{"text":"I just has the silver noodles, sesame chicken and spicy chicken combo.. Its some of the best food court food I have had..."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of food court food and even more so not a fan of asian food court food. But Green Curry has won me over!  Portions are HUGE. I can share a 3 item meal with someone and be stuffed and still have some leftovers. Prices are very very reasonable for the portion size and quality.  Rice is great, and love the beef brisket and spicy green curry chicken. Each item tastes different and not like mass produced food court crap. And not too much msg as I'm not dying of thirst afterwards.   One of my go to lunch places when I'm really hungry and craving a hearty meal :)"}
{"text":"Green Curry is located in the food court of Simcoe Place. It generally has a long line-up during lunch time. However, there are about 3-4 employees taking orders. They really have it figured out, so the line keeps moving. My favorite dish is the curry laksa. It comes with a bowl of thick rice noodles, a few pieces of shrimp, and a few other condiments. It also comes with about twice the necessary amount of soup. After finishing the noodles, I enjoy drinking the rest of the smooth coconut-based soup. I expected it to be spicy, but it's not. Overall, a really good value at less than $8."}
{"text":"Best in CBC food court, Good value for its price. Recommend: BBQ chicken with vermicelli Fast cheap, not very Thai, more of Chinese, but good for food court. Price: $7"}
{"text":"On a Sunday afternoon there's not that many options in the food court where this establishment is located. I told the lady behind the counter that I wanted 1 item option. She asked if I wanted rice or noodles and which item. Then she proceeded to try and upsell me to get another item."}
