{"text":"I have going to authentic pizza for 2 years.  Pizza is usually very good.  Last night, we received a horrible pizza.  The sauce was different, the pizza was super greasy making it a sloppy mess.  I called manager and he nothing had changed and they must be having a bad night.  He offered a 25 percent discount.  What a joke.  I told him to keep it.  I will be taking my business elsewhere.  It is sad how quickly a business can deteriorate."}
{"text":"We ordered fish dinners.  The fish was tasteless.  It looked like a lot but it was mostly breading.  They forgot to give us our fries.  I asked for tartar and ketchup, was told it was in there but it wasn't.  It was the worst fish we have ever had.  Should of went to the fire dept. The coleslaw was very warm.  Went here because it was voted the best in the Trib.  Who voted for this place?  The won on several categories.  I tried their pizza a long time ago.  It was horrible, but decided to try them again.  I will never go back not even for the deli!"}
{"text":"I ordered a pizza for delivery here.  Delivery service took about the average time.  When the pizza arrived, not a bad temperature.  However, the pizza itself was just plain bad.  The crust was a bit chewy and had absolutely no flavor whatsoever.  The cheese was good, but that's about it.  I also asked for a topping of ricotta cheese, which I expected a few a little dabs here and there like most places, but no.  They covered the whole half of the pizza with a thick layer of ricotta.  Oh, and the ricotta had absolutely no flavor.  I would never order from this place again.  Total waste of money.  There are plenty of other places in the area worth picking up or getting a pizza from."}
