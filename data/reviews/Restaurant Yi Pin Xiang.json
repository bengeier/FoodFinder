{"text":"For an inexpensive Chinese restaurant, this place was very yummy and satisfied my dumpling craving. The service was really good. The waitress was very polite. The food was delicious and the price was even better(around 15-20 dumplings for approximately 8.50$ depending on what fillings you chose). My only complaint is that the dumplings had very little filling. I think if they were more generous with the filling I would of given this place 5 stars. Don't get me wrong the dumplings were delicious, just lacking some filling. But other than that, no complaints. Also this restaurant is located in a nice area and they even have a terrasse to eat outside which is always fun for the summer."}
{"text":"Good dumplings! Friendly services! Nothing else to add. Good place to be with friends and family! You can bring your own wine there."}
{"text":"The food is great, but the customer service is unnaceptable. Dont ever take their delivery serive. It is extremely slow. Almost always over one hour. One time it arrived in 2 hours."}
{"text":"Yi Ping offers authentic Northern Chinese dumplings & noodles, as well as other lesser known regional dishes. We either go or take out about once/week. I have consistently enjoyed the Yi Ping shrimp/chicken/mushrooms dumplings (only fried) as well as different boiled and fried dumplings, especially the lamb/coriander. Don't overlook the outstanding hand pulled noodles; our favourite being the noodles with beef (could eat just that) Quite unique was the potato app, great textures & flavour, unusual but in a yummy way. The owner & his wife are super nice & friendly. When I went to pick up my order & asked about the vinegar brand they provide on their tables, he gave me a bottle!"}
{"text":"This place is a must-go for any true Chinese food lovers. With one bite, you can tell the difference between Yipin's dumplings and others. The dumplings are made fresh on spot when you order them. It takes less than 10 minutes to get them, hot and steamy, in front of you! The boiled (they don't steam them there) dumplings are full of juicy filling with flavours that explodes in your mouth as you sink your teeth in. Don't take them out! Eat it when they just came out of the pot! As for appetizers, i strongly suggest their potato salad, cucumber salad and home-made salad. You get a rather large portion for 2.99. Don't be closefisted-share with a friend ;) Their special fried dumplings are also worth a try. They clam to be the only one making them (kotiers) in Montreal. They are bigger and longer than your normal chubby dumplings and are open-ended. Watch out for extra crispiness and ravenousness!"}
{"text":"These are the very best dumplings I've tasted in Montreal.  They have the special fried ones (long - shaped a bit like spring rolls) and the regular ones that you can have boiled or fried (for $1.50 more). The dumplings come in beef, chicken, lamb, seafood, pork and vegetarian stuffings with mushrooms, chives, cabbage and other ingredients that can be combined. My favorites are the chicken and shrimp, lamb and coriander as well as the pork and chive ones. All are tastier when fried imho. The regular dumplings have just the right amount of liquid in them (no broth in the special fried ones).  They offer the regular dipping sauces (vinegar, chili oil, sriracha, soya sauce). Prices vary from $6.99 (pork and cabbage) to $11.49 (fish+shrimps) for 16 non fried dumplings. I could stop there because the dumplings are reason enough to come from far to this restaurant. However you should also know about their home-made Donbei noodle soups ($7.99 for a very large bowl). I had the beef one and the broth was rich and flavorful. The many pieces of beef in the soup had also been marinated as they were an explosion of flavors in my mouth. The noodles were just perfect and very satisfying. They also have rice dishes and a few appetizers. I loved the sweet&sour (and spicy) potato one I tried. The restaurant decor is simple. You can see the chefs cooking in the back through a large window. The service was very friendly although a bit slow.  I will return many many times I am certain. I just gave myself a craving for their dumplings while writing this."}
{"text":"As an American visiting/living in beautiful Montr√©al and trying to find a good Chinese food in St.-Laurent area, I was disappointed in the choices and taste.  Nothing to do with locale/service...but everything to do with the lack of flavor and choices in the menu.  Soup was pretty good (get the hot and sour) but rest of the cuisine was very greasy and until I put 3 cups of chili peppers, I could not taste anything.  I normally have very little chili on my Chinese food but this place needed more.  Then the food was too hot to eat.  Basically, don't read the local reviews if you are not from here.  Food is bland and not as healthy as advertised by some of the locals."}
{"text":"YO REVIEW UPDATE I LOVE DUMPLINGS   Solid DUMPLINGS in this area close to my office so I come often. The pork and Chinese cabbage dumplings and the lamb and green onion are both favorites. Soir & chilli soup isn't quite hot n sour but is still decent. Good prices and they often play a mouth watering Chinese food television show on their tv which really makes you want to visit China!!!"}
{"text":"Yummy yummy in my tummy. Specially with the super spicy sauce. Really nice food and great service."}
{"text":"Great fresh(!) dumplings at a very affordable price.  The restaurant is clean and the service is very attentive without being intrusive.  This is primarily a dumpling house but the wonton soup and the noodles were also very good."}
{"text":"never buy their coconut ice bar, which cost 5dollars but taste like a iced sugar water , lmfao ~"}
{"text":"AC broken, service too slow, won't offer me a cup of tea if I don't ask. And they pour me a tea with boiling water. They told me the normal temperature tea is only for big tables not for me. Waited 20mins in 30 degree room temperature, everyone was sweaty. The waitress doesn't know the AC was broken and she said she's gonna close the door so we will be fine! Their smart pos machine won't allow me to choose \"no tips\" so I had to pay cash. Haven't been so angry to a restaurant in a while. When I complained at the cashier they just kept saying \"ok ok\", no apology. When you take your customer for granted, you've got a big trouble."}
{"text":"The service was really bad, waited a lot before getting our food. The server never make sure we were okay, We had to ask him for water when he walked by (or else he totally ignored us). We didn't get our plates in the same time (we shared my plate because at this point we weren't even sure if he was going to come back). The guy looked like we were bothering him and we felt unwelcome"}
{"text":"Best dumplings in town!!  Went with 3 fellow operators and we demolished 6 plates of assorted fried and steamed. I don't even want to go back to the office, it was that amazing. 5 stars!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and his family are from Hong Kong so they usually know where to find good dumplings. This is their go-to place so I've been many times with them and it is never disappointing. I give 5 stars for the food because I have no idea if their customer is good or not ; I've never ordered myself!"}
{"text":"Best dumplings I ever had!!! The noodles and fried rice are deliciously different. Also, reasonably priced and cozy atmosphere."}
{"text":"Delicious dumplings! Fried or steamed are great. Their veggie salad is flavorful and spicy. All at a great price!"}
{"text":"Great dumplings! These and Qing Hua are some of the best in Montreal. Order in advance if you go there in a group."}
{"text":"I've been to A LOT of dumpling restaurants in Toronto, and when I Was getting my poutine we drove by and my mom saw dumplings!  So we stopped.....   Can I tell you, this place is AMAZING!  Everything is made fresh, so have some patience ok this isn't your manchu-wok, szechuan szechuan buffet to go.  You can see the ladies in the back preparing your dumplings and it was WORTH the wait.   Probably the best dumplings I've had outside of Asia... I wanted to get more but I stayed too far away.  Fantastic food!"}
