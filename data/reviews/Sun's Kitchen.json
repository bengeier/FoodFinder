{"text":"This food court spot is probably the best you'll find at pacific mall. The noodles are handmade and its amazing. For $5.99 there isn't anything else that compares.
Must try!"}
{"text":"Not so sure what the hype and rave reviews were all about. Let the man bang bang on the table for the hand pulled noodle. It's all for putting up a good show for the 'tourists' #bangbangnoodle

The Dan Dan noodle was oily .. Can't taste the peanut! Don't forget to add $2.50 for the chicken / beef / ribs coz the Dan Dan noodle has no mean... Just noodle, peanut sauce and chilly oil for $6.50 +tax :(

The beef pancake was.. meh..  unassuming to say the least. I've had better for the price.

The ingredients were low grade but you get what you pay for.

And don't forget to walk over the 'lucky' bridge while you are there."}
{"text":"Since discovered the restaurant last year, almost once, perhaps twice, a month coming to Pacific Mall just for the infamous noodles. Unfortunately, sometime could be pretty disappointed due to the inconsistency of the texture, as if I'm eating a bowl of saggy soft flour treads which ruin my fix for the day."}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure these are the best noodles in this continent and they're hand pulled. Get the Dan Dan and get it spicy (totally different flavour than medium). It's the most perfect thing. Softest noodles and insanely delicious broth. Worth a 2.5 hour trip from downtown."}
{"text":"Probably my favourite place to order from in Pacific Mall. 

I bring all my friends who don't know the area well here first, to try the yummy hand-pulled noodles! I can't stand next to the guy for too long when he's slapping the noodles hard onto the counter - it just makes me wince from how loud it is! 

But I appreciate his skill so much! 

My favourite is the Dan Dan noodles, which are so delicious with the chewy noodles, and spicy, peanutty broth. It's a bit on the oily side but since I don't have it all the time, it's totally worth slurping down all of it."}
{"text":"Apparently everybody says the Dan Dan mein is great but I'm allergic to nuts, so I order the traditional beef noodle soup instead. The beef is a bit tough and the soup has no flavour at all, but the noodle is handmade and tastes pretty good. I assume the reason for such good reviews is the Dan Dan broth."}
{"text":"This is one of my go to staples! Love the freshness of the noodles. The portions are very big and the food is always tasty.

I've had the dumplings and the bbq pork and they have both been excellent. Definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite places to go to for lunch. It's quick, fresh, delicious, and most important of all - cheap!  

For $6, you can order from a variety of different noodle in soup or stir fry. My girlfriend likes to get #17, spicy noodle with ground pork. It usually comes spicy but she always request it medium, but still finds it too spicy. Ordering it with no spice and just add some of their home made chili oil would be a better idea if you don't like it too spicy.

I usually like to get one of several options: wonton, dumpling, beef, or shredded pork with preserved vegetables in noodle soup; wonton and beef noodle soup are my favourites.  The beef is super tender and the best part is they actually trim off the tissue around it, that other Chinese places that serve brisket would lazily leave on. The wonton is really flavourful and comes with those small salted shrimps that adds flavour and texture.

Next time you visit Pacific Mall, this is a must try for lunch. Don't let the loud bangs of the dough smacking the counter intimidate you."}
{"text":"Sun's Kitchen used to be the only place I knew that served hand-cut noodles (which I love), but recently they're lacking consistency, so thank goodness I've discovered more noodle places to go to.

Located on the 2nd floor of Pacific Mall, it's quite a pain in the butt to find a seat. Secondly, people are lining up at Sun's Kitchen from all directions or pretending to just so they can successfully budge in line. 

It's easy to look past crappy food court service when the chef is putting on a noodle slapping show while you wait for your order. Granted, he looks super grumpy when working that dough, but it keeps customers a little more patient.

The hand cut noodles used to be my favourite, but unfortunately, the portion size has gone down and the nice chewy texture has gone with it. The soup base is also very bland - as if they just poured Lipton chicken stock into water. 

On the bright side, Sun's Kitchen will no longer be a reason for me to venture into Pacific Mall. Woot Woot!"}
{"text":"For th life of me, I don't know why I have never ordered at Sun's kitchen as I have been visiting Pacmall since it first opened.
I have been in search for a good Beef Brisket noodle soup (under $7 including tax) and Sun's did not dissappoint... Had an eye opening \"Wow\" on my first taste.
Can't go wrong with fresh noodles... Especially when it's pulled right in front of you. A good show and great texture.
There was a line up, but service was friendly and fast.
The stall is located on the 2nd floor of Pacific mall, just follow the loud banging sound when the guy whacks the dough to form the noodles."}
{"text":"this place is banging! ...literally. figuratively and food-wise, meh.

I've long been attracted to this place for all the noise that it makes but only recently gave it a shot. the noodles in the DAN DAN NOODLES aren't nearly as \"Q\" (aka springy) as you'd expect from noodles freshly pulled and make the soup rather starchy. the nuttiness of the soup is unique and there's a little spicy oil but it's not a soup you feel compelled to slurp up.

I was also excited for the WONTONS in spicy oil, as I've rarely come across non-soup wontons. the filling reminded me of siu mai/shaomai filling -- hearty pork with a shrimpy taste. but the skin also lacked springiness and the sauce it was served in was too sweet for our liking. 

this place is, however, good bang for your buck (har har) as a true Asian food court establishment should be, and each order comes with a cup of soy milk"}
{"text":"It's all about the hand-pulled noodles!  

I'm not sure about all the soups and sauces as I've only tried a few.  I had the spicy garlic with shredded chicken.  It was spicy alright, just the way I like it.  All dry noodles seem to come with a soup and soybean milk.  I also tried another sauce with julienned cucumbers.  I didn't love it, it was just okay.  For $6 and change, the meals are well priced.  

In the past, I've tried the braised beef noodle soup.  Not as flavourful as I would like it.  

Either way, the chewy texture of the noodles is what I'm looking for, and this place is a good choice if you're in P Mall.  

3.5 stars but I'm rounding up!"}
{"text":"Craving Chinese hand-pulled noodles for days, I went online to search the recipe for how to make it myself. The reason I was trying to make it myself is that there was no authentic hand-pulled noodles in Toronto as far as I knew. To my surprise, I found this video on Youtube showing how the owner of Sun's Kitchen made his noodles. He was pretty good on the video. So my husband and I travelled about 1 hour from downtown Toronto to Pacific Mall to give this place a try. 

When we got there, there was a young guy who was making the noodles. Looking at the menu and the pictures on the wall, I was a little dispointed. Most of the items they offer are Cantonese style, not what I imagined. Usually such noodle dishes are made in the northern Chinese style.

I ordered the beef brisket noodle soup and my husband ordered the BBQ pork noodle soup and we also ordered a plate of pan-fried dumplings. The noodles were OK. The guy who made them was kind of sloppy because the noodles turned out somwhat uneven. Some of the noodles were too thick and undercooked. The soup was very oily, which is not to my taste either.

The most dispointing thing was the dumplings. The skin of the dumplings was too thick and hard and the stuffing was too dry and bland. I have had much better dumplings in Toronto. As far as the noodles, they may be the best in Toronto but they simply cannot be compared to the authentic hand-pulled nooles (Lanzhou lamian) that I am used to having in Mainland China.

Anyways, we didn't enjoy the food at Sun's Kitchen. Maybe being from Mainland China, my standards are too high. I just cannot wait to go back to China to have real good hand-pulled noodles."}
{"text":"Sun's Kitchen is a food court stall in Pacific Mall. Having read some mixed reviews, we decided to give it a shot. I ordered the dan dan noodles - they were being hand-pulled at the counter and I'm a sucker for a man in an apron making noodles. My dining partner ordered pan-fried dumplings. 

The dumpling filling was a bit bland, but the exterior was infinitely crispy and tasty. We topped them up with chilli sauce and vinegar from the counter. 

The dan dan noodles were considerably lacklustre. This dish often contains minced pork and pickled veggies, which were notably absent in this instance. Also it's usually served spicy. I have a fairly low tolerance for spice, and I sailed through the bowl with nary a sip of soy milk (which comes free with each dish). 

Go for the dumplings, skip the dan dan. Oh, and don't expect the soy milk to taste like the Silk from the grocery store. It's pretty legit."}
{"text":"I'd give it 3.5 stars if I could. 

This is a great place to watch how hand-pulled or hand-cut noodles are made. Master Sun puts on quite a show when there are people gathered around the small store front to watch. You can really taste the difference in texture of hand-made noodles; I only wish that they have tastier / more flavourful broth like in a good Japanese ramen shop. Regardless, the noodles along are worth a try. 

Also liked their pan-fried dumplings, thin skin crispy on the outside and just enough chew on the inside. Chive Patties...these patties (or more like \"boxes\") hold so much chives, you really need to like chive smell and taste to like them."}
{"text":"I come PMall 5 times a year for haircuts and dentist appointments, but have never bothered to venture this far into the upstairs food court. Then I read about this place on Yelp and some other article and realized I gotta give it a try. I had no idea it was so well known. 

I ordered the Dan Dan Noodles and watched the fresh noodles be made in front of me. The guy make the noodles is pretty awesome - you can watch him stretch and noodles out in a matter of seconds and then dump them in the big pot in the back to cook. Of course, some snapchat videos were taken. Although I've been to other noodle places that claim to \"make their noodles fresh\", this tiny place is the only one I've seen that actually lives up to that statement. 

There were quite a few orders in front of me, but I only waited 5ish minutes. The portions are big and cheap (all around $6-7!). Some of the dishes don't come with me so you'll have to pay $1-2 more for meat."}
{"text":"Spicy - Roasty- Tasty 

and this is just me describing the broth of the Dan Dan soup spicy.

However the highlight has to be the noodles. Never have I ever said that about a noodle being delicious. Not the spices that make the soup- i am talking about the actual noodle.

However with these noodles made right in front of me. A worker literally banging them and scaring the pants out of everyone who just walks into a very tiny food court. 

One of the best tasting noodle I have had.

Must try!!! well worth the experience."}
{"text":"The Dan Dan noodles are delicious!! I want more!
They make it fresh right in front of you and the dish is so affordable!"}
{"text":"I would have given this lovely noodle restaurant a four star, except... just as I was about to pick up my order from the counter, I see a white, fly/mini-roach hybrid thing land on the counter next to my food tray - the cashier simply swatted it with her bare hands and pretended nothing happened. To be fair, she doesn't really prepare food, but simply arranges the tray, but this still caused my friend and I to do a double take and question whether something would fly out of our food at any moment.  Not fun.

That said, this is located on the second floor of p-mall, in the heritage village section.  You can always tell where it is by the sound of the noodle chef banging flour dough on the counter - interesting process to watch if you've never experienced before.  Noodles are handmade and you can definitely taste the difference (perfect chewiness)!  I highly recommend the Dan Dan noodle, with just the right amount of spicy kick, but pay the extra $1.5 to add meat (as the regular version has very little ground pork)."}
{"text":"If there's one thing I miss about Japan it's the food. Trying to get authentic Japanese fare here is next to impossible. I've come quite adept at making some Japanese staples like gyoza & tonkatsu but certain things like tantanmen is still beyond me. I can make an approximation but I can never get it right. That's part of the reason that whenever I go back, there are certain restaurants I hit just to be able to get my fix so to speak.

So imagine my surprise when somebody told me about the Dan Dan noodle soup they had here. I'm of course aware that Tantanmen is the Japanese version of the original Dan Dan noodles but as I've literally never found a place in Toronto that sells this. At best it's the Chinese version served without soup and sometimes even served cold. It's really not what I want.

But I heard of this and had to give it a try. One taste was all I needed and it was like I was back in Tokyo again. It's by no means the best but it's the best I can get and that includes what I make for myself.

The soup is good. It's spicy and just thick enough without being too thick. But the noodles are the star. They have just the right amount of chewiness to them and are pulled fresh all day long.

I really can't say enough good things about the noodles here. You just need to come and try them and I'm sure I'm going to be a regular here."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good!!!

We got the STIR FRY HAND CUT NOODLES and the texture was amazing!!! Nice and chewy!!  

Also tried the DUMPLINGS IN HOUSE SAUCE, the dumplings were ok, the flavour was ok but wasn't the best dumplings + sauce I've had 

All meals come with soup and soy milk! It's good value!!!"}
{"text":"Noodle was not cooked all the way through. I could still taste the raw dough. There was very little meat and vegetables. The server was nice but it was definitely not worth the price. Just go to the restaurant to the right, theirs looked much better!"}
{"text":"I wish I actually checked Yelp before ordering anything or better yet, waited to see them make their own noodles.  Instead I popped over to the stall beside it and ordered some stuff and came to this place just to order dumplings.  Lame.  I'd like to come here again and actually try their house noodles but for now, my review will be based on the dumplings and the service. 
I'll keep it short but basically, I had to wait a while.  In their defense, they were pretty busy.  In the heritage village there this was probably the busiest place so I guess they are off the hook.
The dumplings:  A bit too much wrapping and not enough meat.  That being said, it was very delicious, nothing too special, pretty much the standard pork recipe so I can't really complain.  My dad's dumplings are pretty much the same recipe except filled with tons of meat.  Nothing like having your parents cook for you.... I miss that.  Anyway, watching the guy make noodles is a show in itself.  They command the crowd whenever they are slapping that dough against that steel table.  THUD!!!! WHACK!!!  BAM!!!!"}
{"text":"I was out with my friend and we literally spent 2 hours inside Pacific Mall just looking around and walking. It was only a matter of time before hunger struck. It's hard not to get hungry especially when you take the escalator to the second floor and smell all the aromas hit you at once. I immediately craved Pho.

I walked around the \"food court\" about 3 times before I heard the hard slapping noises coming from Sun's Kitchen. I forgot I was in Canada. I travelled to a distant land and the smells took me there. I fell in love with the technique- up until now I had only seen it on tv, but there it was before my very eyes. He was making ramen noodles! 
I had to try it (It was this feeling inside me that I couldn't ignore even if I had already eaten and was full) So i ordered a small chicken noodle and it was amazing. So fresh!

Great size for being the small. I ate that soup with such delight. I will definitely come back for more.

You guys have to try it! So good =)

p.s. you get this white (milk-like) drink with your order. Not sure what it was but it tasted good."}
{"text":"Heard about this place through a coworker - that they make the best hand pulled noodles in town. Decided to try this place while waiting for one of the stores in the mall to fix my iPad. My fiance got the spicy noodles and the lady working the counter suggested I get hot and sour soup with noodles. 

My fiance really enjoyed his noodles and the broth. He said it was like ramen, but the noodles tasted much fresher than those you get at your usual ramen restaurants. It came with a tea egg and BBQ pork. He was really full before he finished his meal. I wasn't a huge fan of the hot and sour soup noodles. The texture of the soup didn't go well with the texture of the noodles. It was almost too slimy for my liking. The flavours were there. It tasted like a typical hot and sour soup. It probably would have been better without the noodles. 

Our meals came with soy milk. There was chunks in the bottom, which was a huge turn off."}
{"text":"It's amazing how fast that man turns a mound of dough into a handful of noodles.

I had the #3 Spare Rib Noodle soup. The meat was tough and the soup was bland. Tried to add the chili oil and the chiangkang vinegar but it didn't help, not enough depth in the broth.

Hubby had the #16 Dan Dan noodles and added beef for an additional $2. Tasted much better than mine but still nothing I would order again especially since the beef tasted old like they were leftovers just tossed in the soup.

These noodles have substance to them and I feel they would be much better in a saucy dish than soups imho."}
{"text":"Judging by the number of customers in line, I thought Sun's deserved a try.  They also held the promise of fresh pulled noodles, which were being made right before my eyes.  It's a bit like dinner theater, in a mall food court.  The rhythmic pulling and slapping of the dough being stretched out into tender noodles was almost hypnotic.   With your choice of toppings and a complimentary soy milk, the large portion makes a hearty lunch.  Easily customizable to the level of spiciness with the assorted sauces, Sun's Kitchen is a quick easy lunch.  My slightly fatty beef brought this down a star, but I would be willing to try another topping next time."}
{"text":"This place is one of the better food options in Pacific Mall food court upstairs.

We got their dumpling noodle soup. Price was around $7.

Only waited 5 mins for the food. Food was fresh, soup was tasty. Nice and hot. The pork dunpling was just okay. Over-all a good value for your money.

Place wasn't so busy on a Monday late afternoon.

Would come back for more soup, as they have a pretty decent selection of items.

Review 51 of 100"}
{"text":"This place makes a lot of noise, but isn't that good. Customer service is awful, I asked for lean bbq pork, but there's a big piece of fat in all 6 fairly thin slices they gave me. Meat to noodle ratio is pretty bad. I also waited over 20mins for my meal only to take it home and find out they left out the bok choy. They do a good job drawing spectators & crowds, but a lot of them were just waiting for their food."}
{"text":"Heard that there was a hand pulled noodle place  in the upstairs food court in pacific mall. I've been looking for this place for 4 years and visit pacific mall at least once a month.   Once I found Sun's Kitchen the food did not dissapoint! Amazing hand pulled noodles and a variety of delicious looking dishes, I order the beef soup. 

Will keep coming back."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place for YEARS...and I mean YEARS since I was a child. Not sure if this is the same place I remember when I was younger, but I simply remember there was always a man making noodles or dumplings. We ordered their noodles, pork katsu with rice, fried onion pancake and pan fried dumplings. They include a cup of soy milk for each of the dishes so we ended up with 3 cups. Which is way better then drinking water, duh. Food can be pretty heavy depending on what you order, but definitely worth the money and the amount of food you get. We were stuffed after. Also, took leftovers home too! 

Price is really fair and food is really good. Definitely my new place to go when I come to this mall now. The workers are all very nice and were accommodating when I asked for something."}
{"text":"John F said it best \"WHAM WHAM WHAM\" i went to lunch searching for this place and i had to stroll through a few aisles but then i heard the magical sound of fresh noodles hitting the flat surface.  as i got closer i noticed the crowd around watching.  i was hypnotized and instantly wanted to try it.  i got #4 which was BBQ Pork with noodle in soup.  The soup was nothing out of this world but just the thought of having those fresh noodles made it worth it.  the portion was more than enough for me, who was getting over strep throat so soup was what the doctor ordered.  nothing beat fresh noodles and if you haven't tried please check this place out just to taste and feel the difference of fresh noodles compared to dry, nothing like it."}
{"text":"had the zhajiangmian
noodles were okay; not QQ enough 
+1 for being hand-pulled
meat & sauce were subpar"}
{"text":"The dan dan noodles here are incredible. The noodles are hand pulled, and they always have someone smacking the noodles on the countertop in the front of the place. It's sort of an obnoxious gimmick, but I guess it does attract attention while making it obvious their noodles are freshly made. Their noodles are perfect. They have just the right amount of softness and thickness, and they do an excellent job at absorbing the flavor of the broth. The broth is delicious too. It is flavorful with the perfect amount of spice. The components of the broth do separate overtime, so you definitely need to stir it before getting a spoonful. If you don't do this, I imagine you could get some really unbalanced and possibly strange tasting spoonfuls of broth. Anyway, I haven't tried anything else at this place, and honestly, I don't plan to. I am content to order the dan dan noodles every time I come here because it is seriously that good (and I'm not really in the area much anyway). I'm already looking forward to my next visit here!"}
{"text":"Wham! Bam! Pow! This is the sound emitted from the constant slamming of the dough used to make your noodles. You definitely know that your noodles did not come out from the fridge, but made fresh on the spot. There is always a line-up in front of Sun's Kitchen during the lunch and dinner peak hours, while most of the other stores are just swatting flies empty.

The menu board is a great visual aid to know exactly what you're ordering.

Sun's Kitchen offer hand pulled or hand shaved noodles. Ordered the Won Ton hand-pulled noodles. The noodles are chewy and has a unique texture and smoothness. Though the broth is lacking in depth and flavour. The wrap on the wonton are too thick to really enjoy and the filling is lacking that savoury flavour.  

I also tried the beef brisket noodle soup, but I found the beef brisket very tough to chew through, some too hard. Flavour is really not there. 

The Dan Dan Noodle soup was quite delicious, coming in a spicy broth accompanied with crunchy peanuts. This broth was delectable. The only thing I disliked was the amount of oil on the surface of the broth.

Definitely give it a try if you love noodles as much as I do.

Note: They charge an extra $0.25 if you want an extra bowl or plate. It seems like every other store is doing the same."}
{"text":"Coming here with Jen C.
She's been here before and recommended we try this place since the reviews are pretty good.  Located on the second floor of P-Mall Sun's Kitchen dishes out some classics and if you love homemade noodles this is your place as you can watch their workers making it from scratch which is always a PLUS in my books...beware if you hear loud pounding noises...its because the chef is making your noodle lol!
I decided to try #17 their spicy noodles with BBQ Pork.  Though presentation was lovely, the broth from the soup was deliciously spicy...not too spicy.  Only drawback was the amount of BBQ pork.....only 4-5 slices..what happened to the rest of it? The overall dish was delicious from a taste-perspective. 
In addition we shared a side order of their pancake which was delicious and not drenched in oil. 

Price 4/5 (it's cheap)
Taste 4.5/5
Overall 3/5 (only because lack of ingredient in my bowl)"}
{"text":"I'll be honest. I've been to Pacific mall more than a few times and walked every single aisle, and I somehow never even noticed this place. It wasn't until I hopped on yelp in search of new restaurants that I stumbled upon a rare 4 star in Markham.

I should've noticed the loud banging, the dough whipping in the air, and bystanders constantly crowding the area. Maybe it's because the whole mall is always crowded and always loud anyway. Maybe it's because I'm just not that into you, Chinese cuisine. Either way, I had to try it because even though yelp has steered me in the wrong direction numerous times, they still have me by the balls.

It ended up being the highlight of my GTA Anthony Bourdain-wannabe food espacade.

The handmade noodles, perfect consistency, texture, and flavor. The dan dan noodle broth, a perfect blend of nutty and spicy. How can something so simple be so good? Sure they have dishes with meat and veggies and other ingredients. Who needs them? The handmade noodles are the star of the show here.

This place has become a must for every trip to pmall."}
{"text":"I ate here a couple of times throughout my teen years. Just wanted to walk down memory lane again. They still make their own noodles from scratch right in front of you. I remember the fried rice i had was excellent, full of flavour and \"wok hei\". I know the sign of times, their portions are smaller and the \"wok hei\" is not as strong as I remembered. But it was still very tasty, but it was a bit salty at some parts. The ja jiang mein was actually cold so we poured in the hot soup to mix it in. The texture of the noodles were very chewy n tasty! But again a bit salty for me. Overall it was not bad :)"}
{"text":"A little taste of Asia in Toronto. Hand made noodles with just the right balance of chewy and bready. My favs are the dan dan noodles (a lovely spicy peanut broth that is creamier and more filling than a simple stock broth). If I feel like noodles in a clear broth I go with the BBQ duck version, though you can choose from beef, chicken, pork etc."}
{"text":"Just came here twice in most recent memory. It still yummy and tasty!"}
{"text":"Sun's kitchen is one of the rare places in the GTA where you can actually find good handmade noodles for an affordable price. If you like noodles in soup and have been to places like Magic Noodle, this place is worth a try!

Price - 4/5: not much to say about it really, it isn't a steal but it isn't a rip off either. It is reasonable for what you are getting.

Food - 4.5/5: while other places are serving instant noodles that were made in a factory in China, this place makes the noodles right in front of you, so you know for sure that they are fresh! The texture of the noodles is perfect. I got the braised beef with it and it was nice and tender, a little surprising. However, i have had the fried chicken and pork cutlets with my noodles in the past and they are really salty. If you enjoy having kidneys, definitely avoid the fried cutlets.

Among the 10+ food court restaurants in Pmall, this is definitely one of the better and standout ones!"}
{"text":"Amazing noodle joint in the heart of the pacific mall food court. If you hear a loud thumping sound that lasts for a while, you know you've found the right place. 

Noodles are made from scratch per order essentially. There's a person at the front of the shop just pounding away at the dough - stretching and making noodles all the time. 

Ordered the beef and the veggie noodle soup. The beef was tender (somewhat fatty) and I like it the way it was served. 

I don't mind some nice tender fat when it calls for it. 

Noodles were deliciously fresh and the flavour of the broth was quite good. 

My only bone to pick is their dad hot sauce. It is really not hot. I watched the guy ahead of me unload 6 heaping tablespoons of hot sauce and I thought he was crazy. Turns out he's probably a regular looking for a kick. 

Lesson learned and I will be back again. 

This time - lots of hot sauce!!!"}
{"text":"Sun's Kitchen has been around for a long time. They've been mentioned in several newspaper articles (posted at the counter) and are famous for their hand-pulled noodles. All this from a little counter in a food court in a shopping mall. All well deserved.

I ordered the Thai Spicy Noodles and it was really spicy, but good. The noodles are all handmade as soon as an order is placed. Nice. Fresh. It wasn't the prettiest dish but it tasted really good. Did I mention it was spicy? I'll be back to try more..."}
{"text":"One thing I love about pac mall is the Chinese knock offs and the food. There is a lot of variety. This time we had noddle soup at sun's kitchen. The fresh noodles with spicy miso and bbq pork was great. The noodles were very distinguishable from dried noodles. From the texture to taste. The broth wasn't too rich. Also had the green onion pancake. That wasn't that good. Too greasy and you hardly taste the green onion. Fairly disappointing."}
{"text":"Hidden in an alley at the Pacific Mall, Sun is amazing. This is a hand pulled noodle shop. On a hot day, I was not going to get my usual beef noodle soup, but instead I opted for a beef stir fry. Wow.

The best part of the meal is everything comes with homemade soy bean milk... ahhhhhh!!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delightful food. Super fresh hand pulled noodles with fantastic broth and spices. A keeper."}
{"text":"The hand pulled noodles are alright, with a good chew to them. I got the beef brisket noodles, although it was more tendon than brisket. That was quite a disappointment. The beef itself (when I found the meat and not the tendon) had star anise flavor, but it was uneven, and the soup tasted more watered down than it needed to be.

I also wanted more veggies than the few that I saw swimming in other people's bowls. When I asked the lady how much it was to add more veggies, she said $2. In my mind, I was thinking $2?! It had better be a lot more greens. She even said there would be a ton. So I fork over two extra coins. Sadly, not a ton more. More like decent but not worth the extra cash. Then I found out that anything extra is $2, including meats like beef. LOL you guys now know!

I'm really on the fence about whether to go back and try their dan dan noodles, which some people rave about. At this point though, I'm still on the hunt for great beef brisket noodles."}
{"text":"Wham! Wham! Wham!  Beat the living you-know-what out of that piece of dough!

This place is as much fun to watch as it is to eat at.  The dough is laid out on a slab, stretched, whacked and whacked and whacked some more and finally looped multiple times till it becomes thinner and thinner and turns into one long noodle, at which point it is cut.

Noodle are tender and deliciouis and tast truly fresh.  Wide variety of preparations - I had the dan dan noodles, which swam in a kind of Thai-flavoured broth topped with peanuts.

Almost everything is less than $6.

A truly fun place for lunch."}
{"text":"The loud banging always draws crowds as you walk by and see that the chef is making fresh noodles. Noodles are delicious and you definitely need to make sure you save room in your stomach for this when you come to pacific mall!

After trying a few things on the menu - the true favourite is still the dan dan noodles. There is something about the spicy peanut sauce soup base that makes it so flavourful. Plus when you add their homemade chili oil - it makes it so good.

Because of Sun's dan dan noodles - my bf and I will always order the dan fan noodle whenever we see it on the menu but so far, no one has the same flavour as Sun's. Sun's    is the best we have had!!!"}

I go to the Pacific Mall specifically for a bowl of these fresh, hand-pulled noodles.

I always go for the Dan Dan Noodle Soup - creamy, nutty, spicy and totally slurp-worthy! Every order comes with a cup a sweetened soy milk, which pairs perfectly - a fresh way to cool things off!

This is in a food court, so be sure to stalk a seat while you wait for your order number to be called!

WORTH IT!"}
{"text":"Grabbed a bowl of freshly made hand pulled noodle with spareribs for $6.75. Comes with a cup of soya bean drink. The noodles were spot on with a nice chew to it. The ribs were okay and tasted decent. Portions were filling and fair for the price."}
{"text":"tried the dan dan soup today, with some added beef ($2 extra) to get some protein in.  nice prominent sesame-garlic flavours but i wasn't a fan of the extremely viscous broth.  also, it's like the noodles absorbed the broth and became mushy.  is this their intention?  maybe my bias towards ramen is showing.  the beef chunks were great though, very tender and flavourful.  we also enjoyed the beef pancake.

despite my disappointments, i have a shred of faith in this place and that what i ordered just wasn't a good display of their noodles"}
{"text":"3.5 stars. Been coming to this place for hand pulled noodle for the longest time. The portions are pretty generous whether it's a rice or noodle dish. fairly inexpensive and probably now one of my go to food stall if i'm craving thai style fried rice.

vegetarian hand pulled noodle: The noodle was fairly thin and pulled to the same thickness. The seasoning wasn't too strong so you can taste the broth. It's pretty awesome to see the noodle you ordered hand pulled right in front of you and it's probably one of the reasons why it attracts many people. You know for sure that the noodle you're eating isn't frozen noodle and that it's freshly made.

Thai style fried rice: this rice might not look like anything special and that's also what i thought at first... but DAMN. if you enjoy spicy food... this is DA BOMB! They added a sour and spicy sauce to make the fried rice with and let me tell you... do not get fooled just because you cannot see the colour of the spice because it looks like regular fried rice."}
{"text":"The noodles are always very fresh and tasty. The Dan Dan noodle is definitely a must try item if you are a fan of peanut. 
The quality of their green onion pancake is inconsistent, so I wouldn't recommend this. The first time I ordered the pancake, it was great, but the second time was way too oily and burnt. Very disappointed. 
The biggest problem is finding a seat in this always-packed foodcourt!"}
{"text":"Delicious noodles.  I'm not sure how there aren't more reviews for this place given how popular it is with tourists and everything. 

For those who don't know, Pac Mall's food court is on the second floor, and this place is hidden away on the south side away from the elevators.

Any way, the real appeal here are the noodles and dumplings made fresh in front of you. It's sort of like watching a pizza being made in front you except far louder.  There's lots of smacking the noodles against the counter as they get stretched.  I think.  If you're not a fan of seeing your stuff made, or loud noises, go for a stroll around the top level for five minutes and it should be ready by the time you're back.

Usually I'm not a big noodle eater, but there's plenty on the menu here.  And for those who aren't accustomed to \"Asian\" food, you(including me) can still find plenty to eat, especially if you've had Pho.

I picked up some spicy meat and noodles.  Very tasty. Spicy, but not too spicy.  The noodle's are thicker than the usual stuff you get with pho, or fried noodles, and taste different as well. Instead, they have the same sort of taste and texture that fresh pasta has, namely being softer and having more dough flavour than their dried counterparts.  I was quite happy washing the food down with the soy milk included in my combo.  Soy milk is not usually my favourite thing, but the dish was spicy so it went well.

I'm not sure if this review will sell you on the place, but it deserves a try if you are already at pac mall and looking for food.  Ok, that may be an even worse endorsement..."}
{"text":"I've had their noodles years ago, but this review is based on their beef roll/service.  Beef Roll was greasy, but good for a $5 snack!  Not that much meat, but then again, it's $5 + it came with a yummy soy milk.

What prompted me to write this review was the amount of time I waited.  Must have been 10-15mins while other noodle orders were being whipped out, one by one.  Girl behind the counter did get behind at one point and a coupla items sat on the counter without her calling out the #.  This would probably happen to anyone.

Tip #1:  Try to go when they're not busy, i.e. when there's not a crowd gathered around their stall.

Tip #2:  Noodles seem to come out quicker than other items.  So if you're really hungry, order that instead!"}
{"text":"A strong 3.5* for me!

Located on the 3rd floor of pacific mall inside the food court. It isn't too far from the bridge entrance, stick to the right and you'll find it. It is situated right in front of Wanda's Waffles. What caught my attention was the colourful food pictures that are posted every where on the walls. There are SO many options. When I was there during lunch time, there was a man there kneading/making noodles and I noticed that he would only make the noodles when customers order to maximize the freshness. 

I ordered the bitter melon with beef noodle soup ($~10 tax in). There was an extra $2 surcharge for the dan dan noodles that are made by the man and I am glad that I paid extra because the noodles were chewy - just the way I like it! There was a slight kick to the noodle soup and the entire thing was very flavourful. 

I'll definitely come back to try other stuff there."}
{"text":"Their \"pulled noodles\" is what set this place apart. If you are into soup, sorry, my review won't help you a bit as that's something I don't eat.
They will pull the noodles ONLY when there is an order, so you can always expect they are fresh. Of course, that also mean you might have to wait a bit during meal hours, but it's worth the wait.
I like the cold chicken noodle, always my favourite; and, if I feel for something hot (preparation, not spiciness) to eat I'll opt for the fried noodle version with either beef or chicken.
From what my friends have told me, the Dan Dan noodle is good because the sauce is at the perfect taste and heat."}
{"text":"Amazing noodles, perfect texture!!

The dan dan noodle is by far the best flavor I have had, none of the other ones I tried can match. 

The beef brisket is also very tender and the portions are huge. 

The sides are also very authentic, like the onion pancake, yummy!!"}
{"text":"When just walking by Sun's Kitchen looking for a quick lunch I was hypnotized by the noodle making process. The guy kept beating the noddle harder and louder BAng-BANg-BANG, so almost involuntarily I stopped and ordered Dan Dan noodles in spicy broth. 
And whoohoa, these are the best noodles in whole GTA. The chewiness and slurpiness at its best, also so fresh and delicious. The broth was nicely spiced and crushed peanuts added a good crunch to the dish. In no time I reached the bottom of the bowl and ascended to the seventh cloud. 
I only wish it wasn't a food court as I don't generally enjoy the cleanliness of the trays and tables in such establishments."}
{"text":"My favorite place so far at the Pacific Mall located at the 2nd Floor Food court in Markham, Ontario....Can't go home to New York without trying my favorite soup , never get tired of it..

There is always a line in this place...I always have to wait, everything is made on the spot, the noodles, hand pulled, hand cut noodle, in a spicy broth with your favorite Beef Brisket, Shrimp Dumplings, Pork barbecue with the freshest vegetables. 

It is always fun to watch the guy whip up this dough into noodles that goes in your soup.  The Dan Dan noodles was another good choice...and everything does not go beyond $6.99. Love Soups and will never get tired of it..."}
{"text":"I heard about this place through Yelp and decided to give it a shot. It was loud because the guy behind the counter was beating the snot out of the dough. There was a very user friendly menu with pictures, prices, and a number. I asked the lady to introduce me to something good and she recommended the spicy noodle soup thing and I gave it a whirl.  It was fantastic! Very flavourful, spices just right, and very cheap and filling. Loved it!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place because everyone was raving about the pulled noodles and being able to watch them pull the noodles while waiting for your order. Ordered the beef noodle soup and green onion pancakes. Both dishes were so good!!! I definitely would come back to try the other dishes!! Love how they give you a free cup of soybean drink with every order. Yummy!!!"}
{"text":"Fast? Delicious + Cheap?
Sounds like a place for me! 

Located inside pmall on the 2nd floor. 
They have been here for decades! As a child, I would come here to share a bowl of hand pulled noodles with my mama. Good old times.. :')

All their noodles are yummy. But every time I come I order their Dan Dan noodles. It doesn't come with meat, but if you want meat just pay extra to add it. Their dan dan noodles are to die for..omgg. It was the last meal I had to have before pulling out my wisdom teeth. It was that good! 

Who said food court food sucks? Not here it don't! 
Love this place, love their food & love their prices."}
{"text":"You have not experienced noodles until you have tried a bowl of Sun's bountiful, chewy hand-pulled noodles. The soup is spot on and the servings are generous. Tremendous value for what you get, and not to forget, the cup of soya milk you receive on side!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars

Sun's kitchen for sure is the busiest food stall at the food court in Pacific Mall's Heritage Village.

It is fun to see how the guy pulling the noodle right in front of you! Bang Bang Bang! Flip Flip Flip! (looks like great arm strengthening and with cardio components exercise routine) +0.5 star

I ordered Carleen L's favourite the Beef Pull Noodle soup ($5.99) with a soy drink. The soup base is ok, a little on the salty side but the soup based is not rich with beef flavour. The noodle is ok, I found noodle a little undercook because some of them has a floury taste. Extra half star is awarded to the generous amount of bok choy makes this a balance meal! (protein+carb+veggie)

Love the all photos menu, it does make selection a little easier!

Great friendly services! 

They accepts Cash only!"}
{"text":"You're paying a very good price for both a meal and a show.  The hand pulled noodles are made in house and right in front of your eyes which is pretty wicked.  Moreover, the food is so warm and delicious.
I get the beef with noodles. I love the uneven thickness of the noodles and the meat is tender while the broth is hot and salty.  The food is so good you almost don't need any additional sauces - ALMOST.  I just wish they had a bottle of oyster sauce lying around somewhere so I could give them five stars."}
{"text":"The food just tasted bad. It was not even worth the low price of $8 and you will find much much MUCH better options in the GTA.

I usually don't give low reviews for a place with decent service but the food here was a new level of subpar. I'm going through a handpulled noodle phase and there was so much wrong with my #2 Beef Noodles.

CONS
1) the soup doesn't even taste like beef brisket? I feel like it was just a really bland pork soup. Either way it was not the right colour or taste
2) the Beef was 50% fatty. I'm not sure if this was on purpose, but the photo on the menu definitely was not accurate.
3) the beef was SO chewy, my teeth were sore from trying to break it down in my mouth
4) the noodles were way to mushy for my liking. It didn't really hold its form. By the end of the meal it felt lie I was just eating jello.

PRO(S): 
 At least the choy and soy milk was decent. The service was relatively fast and friendly too."}
{"text":"This place is a unique experience, but one you don't find that often. This place is located on the second floor in Pacific Mall. Located in the food court. What makes this place different is the noodles you get here are made fresh right before your eyes. There is a man that stands at the front of this booth and creates these amazing string noodles you enjoy after. After you watch this you think how in the world is it possible, but right before you eyes you see it is possible. 

I have been here twice and both times I have ordered the chicken noodles and both times I have enjoyed it. This is now my go to place if I'm in the mall and feel like something to eat.."}
{"text":"The Pacific Mall food court is unlike almost any other that I've been to - you can find everything from shark fin soup to BBQ pork and duck to curry fish balls to lamb skewers at food court prices. Among the stalls is \"Sun's Kitchen,\" although perhaps more fitting is its Chinese name, which translates roughly to \"Noodle-pulling King\". Like its neighbours, instead of a menu, Sun's Kitchen has prices and more importantly pictures its dishes tiled across the back wall, allowing you to make a more informed meal selection. They serve everything from fried rice to green scallion pancakes, but their specialties are the noodles that are made - or rather, pulled - fresh. 

I ordered the cold noodles with spicy pork (#17). Within seconds, a man emerged from the back kitchen and began kneading a hunk of dough - broken off from an even larger ball that had been sitting to the side - on the flour-dusted counter to the left of the cashier. He pulled the dough into a thick rope; folded it back onto itself; raised it above his head, twisting as he went; and brought it back down on the counter with a thwack. He repeated this over and over until he was satisfied, and then spread the dough in an arc on the counter, cutting it into long segments. Each segment he pulled, floured, folded; pulled, floured, folded into perfectly uniform, round noodles that he tossed into a waiting vat of boiling water.

Sun's Kitchen does this for every single order of noodles, yet somehow each order is also usually ready within ten minutes, accompanied by a complimentary cup of cold, sweetened soymilk. My (fairly large) serving of cold noodles with spicy pork was delightfully savoury and the sauce not too light. The noodles themselves were - of course - just the right thickness and not too doughy.

The service at Sun's Kitchen was excellent, especially in comparison to what one might expect from a mall food court: although the employees worked incredibly efficiently, they also greeted each customer with a warm smile and were very accommodating to my request to take pictures. 

The one downside is that, located in Markham, Sun's Kitchen is a considerable drive for anyone living in central Toronto. And while the Pacific Mall food court is usually not crowded, the highways during rush hour are."}
{"text":"Favourite hand-pulled noodle place so far. Located in the main cafeteria area in pacific mall, it's the food stall with the man whipping and stretching the noodle dough (you can't miss them with how noisy it is haha!). I especially like their beef brisket noodle soup. Their noodles are doughy, chewy, a bit uneven (which I kinda like)! Otherwise they're quite sparse with how much meat and Bok Choy they add."}
{"text":"Awesome hand pulled noodles. 
I always get the noodles with the spicy minced pork.  The freshly made noodles make a huge difference, great texture to them.  The pork is delicious but the spiciness is inconsistent, I've had it several times and only once has it been spicy at all even though I'm asked if I want it spicy every visit.
It's great value for under 7 bucks, comes with a bowl of broth and a soy milk."}
{"text":"Pretty long wait for a bowl of noodles considering this is a food court place. Very simple bowl of noodles in a light broth with a few pieces of bbq pork. The noodles were a little soft, would have preferred it more if it was cooked a little less. Besides the appeal of handmade noodles and a demonstration of how the noodles are made while waiting for the order, there was nothing else that made it special. The price for the meal is good compared to the other places around.

Overall, would not go through the crazy Pacific Mall parking just to have the noodles again."}
{"text":"This place usually draws a crowd, due to the handmade noodles made in front of you. I was surprised at how good the noodles were, very al dente and chewy, and you can definitely tell that it is made fresh. The broth though is definitely with MSG, meat was soso and the bokchoy was average. What stood out though again, is the freshness and chewiness of the noodles, definitely not from a package which makes it an authentic experience. Pricing is good too. Would definitely come here again. It also comes with a soy milk, although a small cup."}
{"text":"Noodles make me weak... I just love noodles of all kinds. But Sun's Kitchen's holds a special place in my heart.  

Every time I come to pmall, half the time I will end up getting a dish here. Their hand pulled noodles are just so good! My favourite is their Dandan noodles, tomato and egg noodles or their spicy pork noodles (ja jiang noodles) never disappoints. I usually add shredded chicken to the Dandan noodles and ton of their hot sauce. You won't regret it!

Also their workers are super nice. One time we didn't have cash and they took us to their other store to pay with debit. Not sure if they do this often but they were super helpful. The food is ready really fast too."}
